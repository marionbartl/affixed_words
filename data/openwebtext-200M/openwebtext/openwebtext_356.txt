Mr Clegg said most of the details should be published Delaying publication of MPs ' expenses is a " hammer blow " to public confidence in the Commons , says Nick Clegg .
They were due to be released after Commons authorities lost a Freedom of Information case - but instead the Commons launched a High Court appeal .
It argues MPs ' addresses should not be published on security grounds but Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg said that did not stop other details being published .
Meanwhile MPs have voted to declare all relatives employed using public money .
Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 4 's
Today programme his understanding , when he was told about the appeal a week ago , was that it was on the specific issue of addresses .
Full declaration
He does not object to that but said it should not hold up the release of a detailed breakdown of MPs ' claims under their second homes allowance .
Mr Clegg said : " The reason why this feels like a needless , additional hammer blow to public confidence in the House of Commons and what MPs do , is , I think we all now accept , that there should be full declaration of all MPs ' expenses .
Most people who enter public life are doing it for the best of reasons , but where people are making mistakes and there are abuses they have got to be rooted out
Gordon Brown
" That will happen in the coming months once the arrangements are put in place in any event .
" So it 's not as though it 's doing anything other than delaying the inevitable . "
An Information Tribunal ruled last month that the Commons must release a detailed breakdown of 14 MPs ' claims under their Additional Costs Allowance ( ACA ) - under which each MP can claim up to £ 23,000 a year to cover costs associated with running a second home .
Sub-judice
But as the deadline neared , the Commons authorities announced they would make a last - ditch appeal to the High Court .
The date for a hearing has not yet been set .
On Wednesday Labour MP David Winnick asked Speaker Michael Martin in the Commons on what grounds the appeal was based , but was told he could not raise it , as it was " sub - judice " - a matter before the courts .
Lib Dem MP Mark Oaten , who was among the 14 on the list , said he had not been asked whether he wanted to appeal and was concerned it looked like " we are trying to hide something " .
Commons authorities are fighting the ruling at the High Court Requests for information about claims by the 14 MPs , who include Prime Minister Gordon Brown , Conservative leader David Cameron and former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell , were made in 2005 .
As a result of the tribunal ruling , it has already been revealed that MPs can claim up to £ 10,000 for a new kitchen , £ 2,000 for furniture and £ 750 for a TV or stereo under the ACA .
Rules that allowed MPs to claim up to £ 250 without providing a receipt are to be changed - they will only be able to claim up to £ 25 from 1 April - as part of a continuing review of MPs ' expenses set up by the Speaker .
Employing relatives
The review , which will report back in the summer , after Conservative MP Derek Conway was censured over payments to his son totalling £ 40,000 for work as a Parliamentary researcher - of which a standards committee said there was no record .
On Thursday , MPs agreed to accept recommendations from the Commons standards committee that they declare details of all relatives employed out of taxpayers ' money , without a vote .
From next week , they will put down the names and jobs of family members in the Register of Members ' Interests and explain the family relationship .
This will be compulsory from 1 August .
Earlier the prime minister was asked on GMTV why the expenses details were not being published .
He said he had told the Speaker more transparency was needed but the thing to do now was get a new system in place , by the summer so that in future all information was published .
" Most people who enter public life are doing it for the best of reasons , they want to help people , but where people are making mistakes and there are abuses they have got to be rooted out , " he said .

What are these ?
DIGG THIS
I 've been developing software professionally for close to two decades now .
But many years ago , in a prior life , I attended paralegal school and then worked several contract jobs in the legal profession as a paralegal in Houston , Texas .
During one of these stints I was summoned for jury duty .
It was my first ( and so far , last ) trip to the courthouse in the role of potential juror .
Of course , since I was a contractor getting paid hourly , I would not get paid for my time ( unless you call six dollars a day getting paid ) , and I was living paycheck to paycheck .
This was just after Pennzoil , with the help of Texas super - lawyer Joe Jamail , the " King of Torts " , had won its famous case against Texaco ( and so made Joe Jamail super - rich ) .
The trial had lasted for months .
So this summons caused me no small anxiety .
But I need n't have worried .
The big day came , and after finding some convenient but expensive parking nearby , I went into the courthouse and joined a large assembly of other potential jurors .
Soon I was marched off as part of a smaller group to a courtroom , and we sat down and listened while the judge explained , with obvious pride , that Texas was one of the few states left that still had divorce trials , and those of us lucky enough to be selected would be listening to a divorce case .
At that point what ran through my head was this :
" I 'm sorry for these two people , that they could not make their marriage work , and I 'm sure they have some legitimate disagreement about property division that needs to be worked out somehow , but what does that have to do with me ?
Why am I being dragged down here , and forced to miss paying work , in order to spend three days listening to what essentially amounts to a personal problem between these two strangers ? "
At least if this had been a murder case , I might have been able to rationalize making a contribution to public safety , but I could see no reason for me to be dragged into this , and by extension , just about any other civil case going on that day .
Then one of the lawyers starting asking questions of the jury pool .
The first one was , " Do you work in the legal profession or have you ever had any formal legal training ? "
As I raised my hand , I also breathed a sigh of relief .
Of course !
You do n't want someone who actually knows something about the law on the jury !
Duh !
I knew I had nothing to worry about beyond the missed morning of work , and in less than an hour , I was free to go .
I have never been summoned for jury duty since .
I like to think that the powers that be recognize that this is a waste of time on everyone 's part , but I 'm sure that the system just has n't been able to catch up with me since due to some moving around , and eventually I will get the dreaded summons .
I will then go down to the courthouse and waste another couple of hours plus the cost of gas and parking again .
But it is now even less likely that I would be picked for jury duty than that morning twenty years ago .
Here is a complete list of things about me that virtually preclude any lawyer with half a brain who is on the wrong side of a lawsuit from allowing me to be on his jury .
And in most civil cases , there is usually someone pretty obviously on the wrong side , but our legal system treats them all the same .
Some of these are more important than others , but I 've thrown everything on here , just for good measure .
I am educated ( college degree plus some graduate work ) .
I am middle class .
I am self - employed .
I am an employer .
I have been the target of two frivolous lawsuits ( one professional and one personal ) .
I have legal training .
I have legal work experience .
I am a libertarian .
I believe the legal system in this country is a farce , and am not afraid to say so .
Of course , all of these facts are precisely why I would make a good juror , not a bad one .
No , I 'm not volunteering , just pointing out that in our cockamamie upside down horrowshow of a legal system , it 's always opposite day , and one side ( if not both ) of a civil case will always want the least educated and most gullible jurors possible .
So that excludes me .
But that suits me fine , and I make no apologies for it .
The legal system in this country is a farce .
That 's what I said .
Just consider the nonsense of the Anna Nicole Smith case .
Remember the circus in Florida ?
Trust me , Judge Larry Seidlin 's courtroom is not an exception , like some far quarter of the universe where the known laws of physics do not apply .
I 've been in the courtroom where there were no celebrities and no cameras , and believe me , it 's just as much of a circus .
But it all makes sense once you realize that the purpose of the system is not to efficiently and fairly resolve disputes , but to make lots and lots of work for lawyers and judges ( lawyers in robes ) .
This is a subject way beyond what I am prepared to write today , and many others have written extensively on it .
But the next time you see a civil case courtroom proceeding on TV , ask yourself these questions :
Why do the lawyers talk so slow ?
Why do the lawyers ask so many questions , many of which seem irrelevant ?
Why do the lawyers often repeat the same question , with slightly different wording ?
Why are there so many motions and counter motions ?
Why are lawyers able to charge hundreds of dollars per hour , while jurors are forced to miss work and given a few dollars a day ?
Why do so many lawsuits just seem to breed new lawsuits ?
Do twelve people need to spend several days or weeks listening to this to arrive at a verdict ?
Is this a dispute that could somehow be resolved more quickly and cheaper ?
If I had a dispute to resolve , would I want to go through this ?
The Anna Nicole Smith case is a lawyer 's wet dream .
Every week there 's a new spin - off lawsuit .
It 's the gift to the legal industry that just keeps on giving .
( As an aside , last year the most read article on LRC was about fascism .
I am hoping that by mentioning Anna Nicole Smith , I will catapult my own article to the top of the list this year .
But just to hedge my bet , I 've also mentioned fascism . )
Well , I do n't have to worry about being sucked into one of these cases .
I realize now that for the really long ones , there must be an unspoken understanding between all parties that only people who can afford to miss work for weeks and months ( i.e. , whose employers are either a government agency , or a corporation large enough that it can stand being ripped off like that ) will be chosen .
But long or short , it 's unlikely I 'll ever be sitting in the jury box to see who should get what from the Anna Nicole Smith estate .
In the end , a lot of it is going to lawyers anyway .
Short of going to paralegal or law school yourself , or getting convicted of a felony ( an easy option in our society today ! ) , what can you do to avoid jury duty ?
Perhaps you can take a cue from a colleague of mine who was faced with this problem a few years ago .
Remember , for those of you who are just a little clever , there is almost always going to be an opportunity to let the involved lawyers know what a bad ( good ) juror you would be .
My friend was being considered for a lawsuit against a railroad .
The suit was being brought by the estate of the deceased , a gentleman who , presumably being in a hurry , decided to ignore the lowered gates and warning bells at a crossing , and to his detriment found out what happens when train meets car .
Assisting the estate was a lawyer my friend described as having " an Al Sharpton haircut . "
The lawyer asked if anyone in the juror pool did n't believe a life was worth one million dollars , to which my friend pointed out , his own life insurance was only for 750 thousand dollars , so he might have a problem with that statement .
Needless to say , he was not selected .
( But just to make sure , he asked the judge why the case was being tried in Houston , when the accident had occurred elsewhere , and the deceased did not live in Houston , nor was the defendant headquartered there .
Always best to pile it on . )
In a free society , it would not take a week and tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees ( not to mention taxpayers ' money ) to resolve simple disputes , nor months and millions to resolve more complex ones .
Or even , as in the dispute central to the Anna Nicole Smith case , years .
Uh , make that decades .
Good luck skirting jury duty .

The Best of James Foye
Nick Halsey knows it can sound strange to an outsider :
How is it possible for someone in Silicon Valley to have $ 10 million in the bank and still not feel rich ?
So Mr. Halsey , 46 , a veteran of a half - dozen technology start - up companies , walks a reporter through the financial realities of life near the top of the financial food chain .
He made it clear he was not describing his own life so much as basing his estimates on what he knows about his peers , imagining he was the all - too - common type here who , despite the high quality of the area ’s schools , sends his children to private schools and enjoys a penchant for free spending .
“ I ’m vastly amused by the flashy rich here , ” Mr. Halsey said .
“ They ’re mostly these techie guys with few social skills who do n’t know what to do with their money . ”
One former colleague , he said , spent $ 250,000 to buy a new a car , and then rarely drove it because taking it on the highway made him nervous .
And when he did dare to get behind the wheel , “ he ’d park his car a mile from the entrance ” because he was so worried about parking lot dings .
( CNN ) --
Many questions came to mind when the Oscar nominations were announced :
Who 's going to win best picture ?
Why was n't " Once " nominated more than once ?
" The Godfather " was the leading box - office film of its time -- and won the Oscar for best picture .
But there was one question that , surely , Hollywood did n't want to hear .
Does anyone care anymore ?
It 's not the kind of question anyone in Tinseltown would ask aloud .
However , the entertainment industry must surely be wondering if its biggest night has started , like the pictures in " Sunset Boulevard , " to become small .
" The Oscars Should Die , " headlined a Marc Peyser column on Newsweek.com , calling the show " freeze - dried . " " [ C] onsidering the anticipation and hype that precede the show every year , this is one pretty awful excuse for A - list entertainment , " he wrote .
" [ O ] nce again , there are lots of films that most people have n't seen and do n't care about , " wrote Slate 's " Hollywoodland " columnist Kim Masters after the nominations were announced .
" Should commercial success figure into Oscar nominations ?
Of course not .
But when it comes to generating big ratings for the telecast , this year 's slate spells trouble . "

This year 's nominees »
Indeed , Oscar 's TV ratings have been struggling -- though that 's a relative term for a traditionally much - watched show dubbed " the Super Bowl for women " for its ability to draw large numbers of female viewers .
Watch the stars gather for a lighthearted lunch »
Since 1974 , only seven Oscar broadcasts have attracted an audience lower than 40 million viewers .
Three of them have occurred in the last five years -- 33 million viewers watched in 2003 , about 39 million in 2006 and 39.9 million last year .

Compare those totals to the 1998 telecast , the year " Titanic " was crowned , which drew 55.2 million viewers .
Peter Sealey , an adjunct professor of marketing at Claremont Graduate University 's Drucker School and a former Columbia Pictures executive , acknowledges that the show has trouble when the nominees , however noteworthy , are n't big box - office successes .
" The show will have modest ratings this year , " he says .
" The nominees are not the kinds of films women go to see . "
( Of this year 's best picture nominees , at least two -- " There Will Be Blood " and " No Country for Old Men , " the two favorites for the prize -- are downbeat , violent films lacking big stars .
Only one , the sleeper hit " Juno , " has pulled in excess of $ 100 million at the box office . )
Independent filmmaker and two - time Oscar nominee John Sayles observes that recent Oscars have also lacked star power .
" Certainly , the TV show is happier with bigger celebrities rather than newcomers , " he says .
He observes that one year , host Billy Crystal , noting the presence of relative unknowns , asked , " Who are you people ? "
Still , says Sealey , Hollywood movies continue to have a global impact .
" Movies are a central cultural force for the United States .
...
The movies we make are the standard all over the world .
They 're a tremendous social force , " he says .
There 's a reason , he implies , the Oscars are broadcast all over the world .
" The Academy Awards , " he concludes , " still matter . "
They matter as much for their marketing potential as their ability to draw a large television audience .
After all , a movie that earns an Oscar nomination almost always gets a box office boost , assisted by those ads that blare how many nominations the film received .
It 's a shot of extra publicity for a film that may have died otherwise .
( Sidebar : Turning prestige films into box - office gold )
The Oscars were always as much about marketing as art , another way to keep movies in the forefront of the public imagination .
Louis B. Mayer and his industry pals created the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in early 1927 to improve the industry 's image -- then under fire because of labor disputes and boundary - pushing material -- and honor its best work , Mason Wiley and Damien Bona write in their indispensable book " Inside Oscar . "
Eighty years later , with the studios now in the hands of large multimedia corporations , the awards have n't changed much .
Though the Hollywood studios would be pleased if mainstream blockbusters were nominated , they 're just as happy with the low - budget " indie " films that earn awards -- since , for the most part , they all have their own " indie " branches , such as Fox Searchlight and Paramount Vantage , says Notre Dame film professor Jim Collins .
( One of these indie branches , Warner Independent Pictures , is a unit of Time Warner , as is its parent Warner Bros . -- and CNN . )
" They see it as diversification , " Collins says .
" It 's not like the Oscars have been taken over by a band of renegades .
Virtually every studio has a summer popcorn movie and a fall prestige film .
Each major studio developed an independent division to expand market share . "
In the last three years , only four of the 15 best picture nominees have been from the major studios , he notes .
Audience tastes have changed as well .
In the pre -" Star Wars " era , some of the biggest box office hits of all time were also best picture winners , including " The Godfather , " which -- with its large , ethnic cast , rich dialogue , deliberate pacing , period setting and three - hour running time -- would almost certainly be an indie film today .
( See box of top 10 hits , then and now . )
More recent bonanzas and best picture winners such as " Titanic " and " Lord of the Rings " are the exceptions that prove the rule : the former hearkened back to old - fashioned epic filmmaking , the latter equally appealed to fantasy - loving fanboys and art - house audiences .
" It used to be , come one , come all , " says Collins .
" But when you 're dealing with sophisticated ways of calibrating audiences , [ the studios ] ask , ' How do we fill out the [ demographic ] quadrant ? ' "
So , given the realities of the marketplace , what can the Oscars do to boost viewership ?
Every year Oscar show producer Gil Cates announces various initiatives to speed up the show and make it more entertaining , and every year the running time is extended by long - winded speeches or self - congratulatory tributes to the majesty of film .
Sayles suggests that the awards go to an " American Idol " - style vote - off , or try a suggestion from the screenwriter William Goldman to make the voting transparent .
With so many awards shows on TV , it 's hard to make the Oscars stand out , he says : " It used to be that there were the Oscars , and that was it .
There were no SAG Awards , or the People 's Choice Awards . "
Even the Independent Spirit Awards , once an industry sidelight at best , is televised and features major names , he points out .
( Moreover , there 's as much interest in celebrities and clothes as the awards : Collins says some of his students may watch the red- carpet specials " and then wander out . " )
Or should the Academy do anything ?
Sealey observes that it's not just the Oscars -- network viewership is down across the board , a decline that has been going on for almost two decades .
Besides , he says , if the Oscars is n't the monster it was in years past , it 's still -- next to the Super Bowl -- perhaps the most dependable audience event any network has .
In the end , the Academy can only hope that , mild - grossing prestige films or no , the Oscars retain their special aura .
Writer Bruce Vilanch , a regular Oscar show contributor , was asked by Entertainment Weekly if he'd still watch if the honors were derailed by the writers strike and ended up in some truncated form .
" Of course .
I 'd watch the Oscars without sound , " he said .
" It 's the Oscars . " E-mail to a friend
An anonymous reader writesby : AT&T spokesman Seth Bloom sends word that AT&T has not been ignoring the problem .
According to Bloom : " The majority of our customers did not have gateways affected by this vulnerability .
For those that did , as soon as we became aware of the issue , we expeditiously implemented a permanent solution to close the vulnerability .
In fact , we 've already updated the majority of affected 2 Wire gateways , and we 're nearing completion of the process .

Seems the NAFTAgate leak started with — surprise , surprise — the Chief of Staff to Canada ’s conservative PM Stephen Harper .
Only the first hint was n’t about stuff the Canadians had heard from the Obama camp .
It was about reassurances the Canadians got from the Clinton campaign .
According to a reporter who heard the original conversation , Brodie said “ someone from ( Hillary ) Clinton ’s campaign is telling the embassy to take it with a grain of salt .
. .
That someone called us and told us not to worry . ”
Only somehow this evolved into a story about the Obama campaign giving such reassurances .
The Globe and Mail has the latest details .
So was Hillary bashing Obama for what her own campaign had done ?
Did they both do it ?
Was it all a set up ?
I think the overarching story here is that friendly governments should not interfere in our elections .
Students in urban public school districts are less likely to graduate from high school than those enrolled in suburban districts in the same metropolitan area , according to research presented Tuesday .
The report by the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center found that about 75 % of the students in suburban districts received diplomas , but only 58 % of students in urban districts did .
In the Los Angeles metropolitan area , the gap was even wider , with 78 % of students in suburban districts and 57 % of those in city districts graduating .
Just 45 % of the students in the Los Angeles Unified School District completed all four years of high school successfully , compared with the national graduation average of 70 % .
The analysis of graduates in the 2003 - 04 school year examined U.S. Department of Education data from metropolitan areas surrounding the country ’s 50 most populous cities .
Of the principal school districts serving those cities , LAUSD ’s graduation rate was the ninth - lowest , the report found .
Nationally , 52 % of students in the main school districts of urban areas graduated .

The dropout rate of more than a million students each year “ is not just a crisis ; this is a catastrophe , ” said former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell , the founding chairman of America ’s Promise Alliance , which presented the research .
Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings said the government would soon require states to use a uniform method to report graduation data , although she did not provide specifics .
This would require a change in the No Child Left Behind Act , which allows states to devise their own methods of determining graduation rates and tracking improvements .
“ The problem is frequently masked by inconsistent and opaque data - reporting systems , ” Spellings said .
“ For example , in some districts , a school only counts a dropout if you register as a dropout .
. . .
In others , a dropout ’s promise to get a GED at an unspecified future date is good enough to merit graduate status .
With these loose definitions . . . it ’s no wonder why this epidemic is so silent . ”
Officials also pointed to the need for community involvement to help urban schools with the problem .
Leaders of businesses and faith - based groups were urged to make graduation a priority in discussions with children .

“ It is not just a problem for our schools or our teachers , ” Powell said .
“ It is a problem for all of us .
All these parts have to come together , connected to a superior school system , and we can solve this problem . ”
To accomplish that , the alliance announced plans for dropout prevention summits in every state over the next two years to bring community , school and business leaders together “ to develop workable solutions and action plans for improving our nation ’s alarming graduation rates . ”
For the “ Cities in Crisis ” report , the EPE Research Center , a nonprofit in Bethesda , Md. , used a method called the cumulative promotion index to calculate graduation rates .
The biggest difference between this index and previous measurements is that it looks at graduation in four steps -- three grade - to - grade promotions and receiving a diploma -- instead of as a single event .
The index counts only students who receive standard high school diplomas as graduates .
The promotion rates for each step of the process were multiplied by each other to form a graduation rate for the district .
Reported dropout statistics were not used .

Panelists said that open access to information and to problem areas was crucial in addressing the issue .
“ This problem is not only manageable ; it ’s solvable in a decade or less , ” said Robert Balfanz , a researcher at Johns Hopkins University .
“ We can locate the problem .
It ’s not every school ; it ’s not every student . ”
Tuesday ’s report said the main school districts of Detroit , Indianapolis , Cleveland and Baltimore had the lowest graduation rates in the country .
All were below 40 % ; Detroit ’s was 25 % .
Baltimore recorded a staggering gap in urban versus suburban performance : 82 % of students in suburban districts graduated , but only 35 % within the city did .

San Diego was the only California city , and one of just five nationwide , to report a minimal difference in urban and suburban graduation rates ; less than 1 percentage point separated the two figures .

Amazon Molly fish are all female ( Picture credit : Dunja K Lamatsch )
A fish species , which is all female , has survived for 70,000 years without reproducing sexually , experts believe .
Scientists from the University of Edinburgh think the Amazon Molly may be employing special genetic survival " tricks " to avoid becoming extinct .
The species , found in Texas and Mexico , interacts with males of other species to trigger its reproduction process .
The offspring are clones of their mother and do not inherit any of the male 's DNA .
Typically , when creatures reproduce asexually , harmful changes creep into their genes over many generations .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The species will eventually have problems reproducing and can often fall victim to extinction .
Scientists at Edinburgh University have been studying complex mathematical models on a highly powerful computing system to look at the case of the Amazon Molly .
Researchers calculated the time to extinction for the fish based on modelling genetic changes over many thousands of generations .
They are now able to say conclusively , for the first time , the fish ought to have become extinct within the past 70,000 years , based on the current simple models .
Scientists believe the fish , which are still thriving in rivers in south - east Texas and north - east Mexico , are using special genetic survival " tricks " to help them stay alive .
One theory is that the fish may occasionally be taking some of the DNA from the males that trigger reproduction , in order to refresh their gene pool .
Species tricks
Dr Laurence Loewe , of the university 's School of Biological Sciences , said : " What we have shown now is that this fish really has something special going on and that some special tricks exist to help this fish survive .
" Maybe there is still occasional sex with strangers that keeps the species alive .
Future research may give us some answers . "
He added that their findings could also help them understand more about how other creatures operate .
" I think one of the interesting things is that we are learning more about how other species might use these tricks as well , " he said .
" It might have a more general importance . "
The Edinburgh - led study was carried out in collaboration with Dr Dunja Lamatsch at the University of Wuerzburg , now at the Austrian Academy of Sciences .
The research is published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology .

What are these ?
Puppy gets his revenge on the marine
It ’s another round of the credit crisis .
Some markets are getting worse than January this time .
There is fear that something dramatic will happen and that fear is feeding itself .
— Jesper Fischer - Nielsen , interest rate strategist at Danske Bank , Copenhagen ; Reuters
Yesterday ’s action by the Federal Reserve proves that the banking system is insolvent and the US economy is on the verge of collapse .
It also shows that the Fed is willing to intervene directly in the stock market if it keeps equities propped up .
This is clearly a violation of its mandate and runs contrary to the basic tenets of a free market .
Investors who shorted the market yesterday , got clobbered by the not so invisible hand of the Fed chief .
In his prepared statement , Bernanke announced that the Fed would add $ 200 billion to the financial system to shore up banks that have been battered by mortgage - related losses .
The news was greeted with jubilation on Wall Street where traders sent stocks skyrocketing by 416 points , their biggest one - day gain in five years .
“ It ’s like they ’re putting jumper cables onto a battery to kick - start the credit market , ” said Nick Raich , a manager at National City Private Client Group in Cleveland .
“ They ’re doing their best to try to restore confidence . ”
“ Confidence ” ?
Is that what it ’s called when the system is bailed out by Sugar - daddy Bernanke ?
To understand the real meaning behind the Fed ’s action ; it ’s worth considering some of the stories which popped up in the business news just days earlier .
For example , last Friday , the International Herald Tribune reported :
“ Tight money markets , tumbling stocks and the dollar are expected to heighten worries for investors this week as pressure mounts on central banks facing what looks like the “ third wave ” of a global credit crisis … .
Money markets tightened to levels not seen since December , when year - end funding problems pushed lending costs higher across the board . ”
The Herald Tribune said that troubles in the credit markets had pushed the stock market down more than 3 percent in a week and that the same conditions which preceded the last two crises ( in August and December ) were back stronger than ever .
In other words , liquidity was vanishing from the system and the market was headed for a crash .
A report in Reuters reiterated the same ominous prediction of a “ third wave ” saying :
“ The two - year U.S. Treasury yields hit a 4 - year low below 1.5 percent as investors flocked to safe - haven government bonds …
The cost of corporate bond insurance hit record highs on Friday and parts of the debt market which had previously escaped the turmoil are also getting hit . ”
Risk premiums were soaring and investors were fleeing stocks and bonds for the safety of government Treasuries ; another sure sign that liquidity was disappearing .
Reuters :
“ The level of financial stress is … likely to continue to fuel speculation of more immediate central bank action either in the form of increased liquidity injections or an early rate cut , ” Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients .
Indeed .
When there ’s a funding - freeze by lenders , investors hit the exits as fast as their feet will carry them .
That ’s why the lights started blinking red at the Federal Reserve and Bernanke concocted a plan to add $ 200 billion to the listing banking system .
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman also referred to a “ third wave ” in his article “ The Face - Slap Theory ” .
According to Krugman , “ The Fed has been cutting the interest rate it controls — the so - called Fed funds rate — ( but ) the rates that matter most directly to the economy , including rates on mortgages and corporate bonds , have been rising .
And that ’s sure to worsen the economic downturn . ” …
( Now ) “ the banks and other market players who took on too much risk are all trying to get out of unsafe investments at the same time , causing significant collateral damage to market functioning . ”
What the Times ‘ columnist is describing is a run on the financial system and the onset of “ a full - fledged financial panic . ”
The point is , Bernanke ’s latest scheme is not a remedy for the trillion dollar unwinding of bad bets .
It is merely a quick - fix to avoid a bloody stock market crash brought on by prevailing conditions in the credit markets .
Bernanke coordinated the action with the other members of the global banking cartel — The Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank , the Federal Reserve , and the Swiss National Bank — and cobbled together the new Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) , which “ will lend up to $ 200 billion of Treasury securities to primary dealers secured for a term of 28 days ( rather than overnight , as in the existing program ) by a pledge of other securities , including federal agency debt , federal agency residential - mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) , and non-agency AAA / Aaa-rated private - label residential MBS .
The TSLF is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally . ”
( Fed statement )
The plan , of course , is wildly inflationary and will put additional downward pressure on the anemic dollar .
No matter .
All of the Fed ’s tools are implicitly inflationary anyway , but they ’ll all be put to use before the current crisis is over .
The Fed ’s statement continues : “ The Federal Open Market Committee has authorized increases in its existing temporary reciprocal currency arrangements ( swap lines ) with the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) .
These arrangements will now provide dollars in amounts of up to $ 30 billion and $ 6 billion to the ECB and the SNB , respectively , representing increases of $ 10 billion and $ 2 billion .
The FOMC extended the term of these swap lines through September 30 , 2008 . ”
So , why is the Fed issuing loans to foreign banks ?
Is n’t that a tacit admission of its guilt in the trillion dollar subprime swindle ?
Or is it simply a way of warding off litigation from angry foreign investors who know they were cheated with worthless toxic bonds ?
In any event , the Fed ’s largess proves that the G - 10 operates as de facto cartel determining monetary policy for much of the world .
( The G - 10 represents roughly 85 % of global GDP )
As for Bernanke ’s Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) it is intentionally designed to circumvent the Fed ’s mandate to only take top - grade collateral in exchange for loans .
No one believes that these triple A mortgage - backed securities are worth more than $.70 on the dollar .
In fact , according to a report in Bloomberg News yesterday : “ AAA debt fell as low as 61 cents on the dollar after record home foreclosures and a decline to AA may push the value of the debt to 26 cents , according to Credit Suisse Group .
“ The fact that they ’ve kept those ratings where they are is laughable , ” said Kyle Bass , chief executive officer of Hayman Capital Partners , a Dallas - based hedge fund that made $ 500 million last year betting lower - rated subprime - mortgage bonds would decline in value .
“ Downgrades of AAA and AA bonds are imminent , and they ’re going to be significant . ”
Bass estimates most of AAA subprime bonds in the ABX indexes will be cut by an average of six or seven levels within six weeks . ” ( Bloomberg News )
The Fed is accepting these garbage bonds at nearly full - value .
Another gift from Santa Bernanke .
Additionally , the Fed is offering 28 day repos which — if this auction works like the Fed ’s other facility , the TAF — the loans can be rolled over free of charge for another 28 days .
Yippee .
The Fed found a way to recapitalize the banks with permanent rotating loans and the public is none the wiser .
The capital - starved banksters at Citi and Merrill must feel like they just won the lottery .
Unfortunately , Bernanke ’s move effectively nationalizes the banks and makes them entirely dependent on the Fed ’s fickle generosity .
The New York Times ‘ Floyd Norris sums up Bernanke ’s efforts like this :
The Fed ’s moves today and last Friday are a direct effort to counter a loss of liquidity in mortgage - backed securities , including those backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Given the implied government guarantee of Freddie and Fannie , rising yields in their paper served as a warning sign that the crunch was worsening and investor confidence was waning .
On Oct. 30 , the day before the Fed cut the Fed funds rate from 4.75 percent to 4.5 percent , the yield on Fannie Mae securities was 5.75 percent .
Today the Fed Funds rate is 3 percent , and the Fannie Mae rate is 5.71 percent , virtually the same as in October …
A sign of the Fed ’s success , or lack of same , will be visible in that rate .
It needs to come down sharply , in line with Treasury bond rates .
Today , the rate was up for most of the day , but it did fall back at the end of the day .
Watch that rate for the rest of the week to see indications of whether the Fed ’s move is really working to restore confidence .
Norris is right ; it all depends on whether rates go down and whether that will rev-up the moribund housing market again .
Of course , that is predicated on the false assumption that consumers are too stupid to know that housing is in its biggest decline since the Great Depression .
This is just another slight miscalculation by the blinkered Fed .
Housing will not be resuscitated anytime in the near future , no matter what the conditions ; and you can bet on that .
The last time Bernanke cut interest rates by 75 basis points mortgage rates on the 30 - year fixed actually went up a full percentage point .
This had a negative affect on refinancing as well as new home purchases .
The cuts were a total bust in terms of home sales .
Still , equities traders love Bernanke ’s antics and , for the next 24 hours or so , he ’ll be praised for acting decisively .
But as more people reflect on this latest manuver , they ’ll see it for what it really is ; a sign of panic .
Even more worrisome is the fact that Bernanke is quickly using every arrow in his quiver .
Despite the mistaken belief that the Fed can print money whenever it chooses ; there are balance sheets constraints ; the Fed ’s largess is finite .
According to MarketWatch :
Counting the currency swaps with the foreign central banks , the Fed has now committed more than half of its combined securities and loan portfolio of $ 832 billion , Lou Crandall , chief economist for Wrightson ICAP noted .
The Fed wo n’t have run completely out of ammunition after these operations , but it is reaching deeper into its balance sheet than before .
Steve Waldman at interfluidity draws the same conclusion in his latest post :
“ After the FAF expansion , repo program , and TSLF , the Fed will have between $ 300B and $ 400B in remaining sterilization capacity , unless it issues bonds directly . ” ( Calculated Risk )
So , Bernanke is running short of ammo and the housing bust has just begun .
That ’s bad .
As the wave of foreclosures , credit card defaults and commercial real estate bankruptcies continue to mount ;
Bernanke ’s bag o’ tricks will be near empty having frittered most of his capital away on his Beluga - munching buddies at the investment banks .
But that ’s only half the story .
Bernanke and Co. are already working on a new list of hyper - inflationary remedies once the credit troubles pop up again .
According to the Wall Street Journal , the Fed has other economy - busting scams up its sleeve :
With worsening strains in credit market threatening to deepen and prolong an incipient recession , analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve may be forced to consider more innovative responses - – perhaps buying mortgage - backed securities directly .
As credit stresses intensify , the possibility of unconventional policy options by the Fed has gained considerable interest , said Michael Feroli of J.P. Morgan Chase .
He said two options are garnering particular attention on Wall Street : Direct Fed lending to financial institutions other than banks and direct Fed purchases of debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or mortgage - backed securities guaranteed by the two shareholder - owned , government - sponsored mortgage companies .
( “ Rate Cuts may not be Enough ” , David Wessel , Wall Street Journal )
Wonderful .
So now the Fed is planning to expand its mandate and bail out investment banks , hedge funds , brokerage houses and probably every other brandy - swilling Harvard grad who got caught - short in the subprime mousetrap .
Ain’t the “ free market ” great ?
But none of Bernanke ’s bailout schemes will succeed .
In fact , all he ’s doing is destroying the currency by trying to reflate the equity bubble .
And how much damage is he inflicting on the dollar ?
According to Bloomberg , “ the risk of losses on US Treasury notes exceeded German bunds for the first time ever amid investor concern the subprime mortgage crisis is sapping government reserves …
Support for troubled financial institutions in the U.S. will be perceived as a weakening of U.S. sovereign credit . ”
America is going broke and the rest of the world knows it .
Bernanke is just speeding the country along the ever - steepening downward trajectory .
Timothy Geithner , President of the New York Fed put it like this :
The self - reinforcing dynamic within financial markets has intensified the downside risks to growth for an economy that is already confronting a very substantial adjustment in housing and the possibility of a significant rise in household savings .
The intensity of the crisis is in part a function of the size of the preceding financial boom , but also of the speed of the deterioration in confidence about the prospects for growth and in some of the basic features of our financial markets .
The damage to confidence — confidence in ratings , in valuation tools , in the capacity of investors to evaluate risk — will prolong the process of adjustment in markets .
This process carries with it risks to the broader economy .
Without a hint of irony , Geithner talks about the importance of building confidence on a day when the Fed has deliberately distorted the market by injecting $ 200 billion in the banking system and sending the flagging stock market into a steroid - induced rapture .
Astonishing .
The stock market was headed for a crash this week , but Bernanke managed to swerve off the road and avoid a head - on collision .
But nothing has changed .
Foreclosures are still soaring , the credit markets are still frozen , and capital is being destroyed at a faster pace than any time in history .
The economic situation continues to deteriorate and even unrelated parts of the markets have now been infected with subprime contagion .
The massive deleveraging of the banks and hedge funds is beginning to intensify and will continue to accelerate until a bottom is found .
That ’s a long way off and the road ahead is full of potholes .
“ In the United States , a new tipping point will translate into a collapse of the real economy , final socio-economic stage of the serial bursting of the housing and financial bubbles and of the pursuance of the US dollar fall .
The collapse of US real economy means the virtual freeze of the American economic machinery : private and public bankruptcies in large numbers , companies and public services closing down massively . ”
( Statement from The Global Europe Anticipation Bulletin ( GEAB )
Is that too gloomy ?
Then take a look at these eye - popping charts which show the extent of the Fed ’s lending operations via the Temporary Auction Facility .
The loans have helped to make the insolvent banks look healthy , but at great cost to the country ’s economic welfare .
The Fed established the TAF in the first place ; to put a floor under mortgage - backed securities and other subprime junk so the banks would n’t have to try to sell them into an illiquid market at fire - sale prices .
But the plan has backfired and now the Fed feels compelled to contribute $ 200 billion to a losing cause .
It ’s a waste of time .
UBS puts the banks total losses from the subprime fiasco at $ 600 billion .
If that ’s true , ( and we expect it is ) then the Fed is out of luck because , at some point , Bernanke will have to throw in the towel and let some of the bigger banks fail .
And when that happens , the stock market will start lurching downward in 400 and 500 point increments .
But what else can be done ?
Solvency can only be feigned for so long .
Eventually , losses have to be accounted for and businesses have to fail .
It ’s that simple .
So far , the Fed ’s actions have had only a marginal affect .
The system is grinding to a standstill .
The country ’s two largest GSEs , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which are presently carrying $ 4.5 trillion of loans on their books , are teetering towards bankruptcy .
Both are gravely under - capitalized and ( as a recent article in Barron ’s shows )
Fannies equity is mostly smoke and mirrors .
No wonder investors are shunning their bonds .
Additionally , the cost of corporate bond insurance is now higher than anytime in history , which makes funding for business expansion or new projects nearly impossible .
The wheels have come of the cart .
The debt markets are upside - down , consumer confidence is drooping and , as the Financial Times states , “ A palpable sense of crisis pervades global trading floors . ”
It ’s all pretty grim .
The banks are facing a “ systemic margin call ” which is leaving them capital - depleted and unwilling to lend .
Thus , the credit markets are shutting down and there ’s a stampede for the exits by the big players .
Bernanke ’s chances of reversing the trend are nil .
The cash - strapped banks are calling in loans from the hedge funds which is causing massive deleveraging .
That , in turn , is triggering a disorderly unwind of trillions of dollars of credit default swaps and other leveraged bets .
Its a disaster .
Economist Nouriel Roubini predicted the whole sequence of events six months before the credit markets seized and the Great Unwind began ” .
Here ’s a sampling of his recent testimony before Congress :
Roubini ’s Testimony before Congress :
There is now a rising probability of a “ catastrophic ” financial and economic outcome ; a vicious circle where a deep recession makes the financial losses more severe and where , in turn , large and growing financial losses and a financial meltdown make the recession even more severe .
The Fed is seriously worried about this vicious circle and about the risks of a systemic financial meltdown …
Capital reduction , credit contraction , forced liquidation and fire sales of assets at below fundamental prices will ensue leading to a cascading and mounting cycle of losses and further credit contraction .
In illiquid market actual market prices are now even lower than the lower fundamental value that they now have given the credit problems in the economy .
Market prices include a large illiquidity discount on top of the discount due to the credit and fundamental problems of the underlying assets that are backing the distressed financial assets .
Capital losses will lead to margin calls and further reduction of risk taking by a variety of financial institutions that are now forced to mark to market their positions .
Such a forced fire sale of assets in illiquid markets will lead to further losses that will further contract credit and trigger further margin calls and disintermediation of credit .
To understand the risks that the financial system is facing today I present the “ nightmare ” or “ catastrophic ” scenario that the Fed and financial officials around the world are now worried about .
Such a scenario — however extreme — has a rising and significant probability of occurring .
Thus , it does not describe a very low probability event but rather an outcome that is quite possible .
Roubini has been right from the very beginning , and he is right again now .
Bernanke can place himself at the water ’s edge and lift his hands in defiance , but the tide will come in and wash him out to sea anyway .
The market is correcting and nothing is going to stop it .

HELSINKI , April 8 ( Reuters ) - Nokia NOK1V.HE and a German union agreed on Tuesday on a 200 million euro ( $ 315.4 million ) package for employees in Bochum , as the world 's top cellphone maker goes ahead with the controversial plant closure in June .
Some 2,300 employees will lose their jobs in the economically depressed region , which has lost its former historic mining and steelmaking industries .
The Finnish handset maker is moving production to Romania , were costs are cheaper .
Nokia ’s plans to shut Germany ’s last mobile telephone factory have created a storm of protests , with Germany ’s finance minister Peer Steinbrueck accusing Nokia of caravan capitalism .
Nokia said it would comment on the financial costs of the closure in its first - quarter report , due on April 17 , but analysts said it should not increase much from the 200 million euros .
“ The cost was pretty much as expected , ” said Hannu Rauhala , an analyst with Pohjola Bank .
Shares in Nokia were 1.8 percent lower at 21.42 euros at 1435 GMT , in line with a fall in the DJ Stoxx European technology shares index .
SX8P .
Germany , the world ’s biggest goods exporter since 2003 , has seen its technology sector hit hard in recent years .
In 2006 , 3,000 workers lost their jobs when BenQ Mobile declared bankruptcy , a year after it bought off Siemens ’ cellphone unit .
Some union leaders in Germany have called for a boycott of Nokia goods , and senior politicians have joined in the attack .
Nokia board member Veli Sundback said on Tuesday he hoped the 200 million euro package would settle the disagreement between the mobile phone maker and the North - Rhine Westphalia state ( NRW ) , where Bochum is located .
“ We hope that an agreement can be reached in the next few days , ” he said in Duesseldorf .
NRW is asking Nokia to pay back subsidies of around 60 million euros used to revamp the plant .
Nokia has said labour costs in Germany are nearly 10 times higher than in EU - newcomer Romania and has refused to back down .
Germany , Europe ’s largest economy , is Nokia ’s third - largest market , with annual sales of 2.64 billion euros .
Nokia employed 14,000 people in Germany at the end of 2007 .
“ The closure of the plant does not mean that Nokia is leaving Germany or that Germany is not an important market , ” said Nokia ’s Sundback .
Carmakers have also cut thousands of jobs in Germany to reduce labour costs , while appliance maker Electrolux closed a German plant in 2006 and cut around 1,750 staff .
Nokia said on Tuesday it had also reached an agreement with unions on planned divestments of two small parts of the Bochum business , which employ 300 staff in total .

Women in Tech : 20 Trailblazers Share Their Journeys
Successful women in the tech trenches share their insights and tackle subjects ranging from how to search out a strong mentor to how to be one -- from how to advance in a large company to how to start your own firm .
Get the Kindle or Paperback .
The European Commission introduced new rules Monday for mobile communications on aircrafts during flights .
The new regulations give the airlines a green light to let their passengers talk on their mobile phones midair -- with a few caveats , of course .
The Commission , however , did not create protections for quiet passengers who might find themselves stuck next to a working business person or a chatting teenager .
Regulations Needed First
" Pan -European telecom services , such as in - flight mobile telephony , need a regulatory ' one - stop shop ' to operate throughout Europe , and this is why the Commission has acted today .
One regulatory decision for all European airspace was required for this new service to come into being , " noted Viviane Reding , the EU 's telecom commissioner .
" Now we expect operators to be transparent and innovative in their price offerings .
In - flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service , especially for those business travelers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she added , noting that if consumers receive " shock " phone bills , the service will not take off .
The intention is to let airlines offer mobile services no matter which European Union country they happen to be flying over .
Technical Requirements
The Commission 's rules do n't allow mobile phone users to connect to the ground - based towers while in mid-flight .
Instead , passenger phones will be linked to an on - board cellular network connected to the ground via satellite , the Commission reported .
The system will block phones from connecting to ground - based towers .
These requirements , the Commission said , will ensure that transmission powers are kept low enough for mobile phones to be used without affecting the safety of aircraft equipment or the normal operation of terrestrial mobile networks .
In proposing rules for one of the first truly pan-European telecoms services , the Commission said it is responding to demand from air passengers , many of whom want to use their mobile phones during flights , as well as from the airline industry , which wants to respond to passenger interests .
The first flights to offer the services will likely take off sometime in 2008 .
Ofcom , a UK telecom regulator , announced last month that it will allow airlines to offer mobile communications on board aircraft in line with the common European approach , the Commission noted .
Respectful Yakking ?
The big question , of course , is how non-talking passengers will respond to disrespectful yakking .
Planes are already loud , so it 's not hard to imagine loud - voiced talkers .
Sleeping or even falling back to sleep after a loud ring tone goes off inches away may prove more difficult .
" In the U.S. marketplace , this is an issue that has been debated for a while , " Jeff Kagan , a telecommunications industry analyst , told the E - Commerce Times .
" The technology is now here , so we have some important questions to deal with , " he added .
The issue , Kagan noted , is somewhat similar to public smoking bans .
" The smoker wants to smoke without concern to the non-smoker , who finds the smell uncomfortable .
The non -smoker wants normal , clean air without concern for the smoker , who may need to smoke .
Both sides are opposite each other and cannot look at the question from both sides , " he explained .
" It 's the same with cell phones on airplanes .
...
What 's the answer ?
This is a tough call .
Flying at 35,000 feet trapped in an airplane can be a problem , " he said , noting that there has to be a reasonable solution to this problem , " which I think is a major issue . "

Microsoft wants to boost its internet presence
Microsoft saw its shares fall 6 % after it posted a fall in quarterly profits and earnings forecasts at the lower end of market expectations .
A day earlier the firm said profits fell 11 % to $ 4.39 bn ( £ 2.22 bn ) in the first three months of the year .
Uncertainty about what will happen to the firm's $ 44.6 bn - bid for Yahoo has added to market concerns .
Microsoft had given Yahoo until 26 April to respond but later implied it would wait a few days .
The deadline was due to expire on Saturday but by close of trade on Friday there had been no further statement from Microsoft .
Online market
Analysts now predict that the firm will either improve its offer , or try to replace Yahoo's board .
This second option would entail what is called a proxy battle - effectively embarking on a hostile bid .
Yahoo's board of directors has said that Microsoft 's offer undervalues the firm , and that it would not accept anything less than $ 45bn .
While some analysts argue that Microsoft will now abandon the deal , others say it is unlikely to favour that option .
" We still believe Microsoft is committed to completing the transaction and is unlikely to walk away , " said Citigoup analyst Brent Thill .
A day earlier Chris Liddell , Microsoft 's chief financial officer , said : " With or without a Yahoo combination , Microsoft is focused on the online advertising market . "
While Yahoo has opposed the Microsoft bid , it has looked into other options to improve its fortunes , including a possible tie - up with Time Warner 's AOL .
But analysts say such an association would be a less strong partnership than one with Microsoft .
Shares in Microsoft ended at $ 29.9 , after closing 6.1 % lower , while Yahoo shed 1.8 % to end at $ 27 .
The Pear of Anguish ( Torture )
The Pear of Anguish was used during the Middle Ages as a way to torture women who conducted a miscarriage , liars , blasphemers and homosexuals .
A pear - shaped instrument was inserted into one of the victim 's orifices : the vagina for women , the anus for homosexuals and the mouth for liars and blasphemers .
The instrument consisted of four leaves that slowly separated from each other as the torturer turned the screw at the top .
It was the torturer 's decision to simply tear the skin or expand the " pear " to its maximum and mutilate the victim .
The Pear of Anguish was usually very adorned to differentiate between the anal , vaginal and oral pears .
They also varied in size accordingly .
This torture very rarely provoked death , but was often followed by other torture methods .

If you like unskippable , random tech - materia summoning animations , you are going to LOVE Crisis Core .
If just thinking about Sephiroth 's 8 - hour long planet - destroying Super Nova magic makes you wet , and if your interface experience with the psp begins , and ends , with the X button , this is the game for you .

" Prison inmates are in desperate need of friends on the outside ! "
In Our Words :
" Prison chicks so desperate they might even have sex with a loser like you ! "
How It Works :
Before our resident conservatives get all indignant about how the prison system is like a big country club , we 'll have you know that women in prison , for the most part , do n't have internet access .
So in order to use this site , these lovely gals apparently anticipated a prison stay ahead of time , and had the wherewithal to research the best options for meeting men once there .
Dude , she totally wants it !

To post a profile , they have to mail a handwritten bio , including date of birth , the state where they are currently incarcerated and expected release date .
They also have to send what one can only hope is a recent picture .
What they do n't send are the details about what got them locked up .
To find that out , you 'll have to click the " add to cart " button next to your lady love 's profile .
For a nominal fee , you get her mailing address so you can send her a letter .
It 's like 1985 up in this piece !
Why It 's a Bad Idea :
Let 's get the obvious out of the way here .
There are some high - end dating sites that actually check for criminal backgrounds before allowing people to sign up .
At Women Behind Bars , the criminal background is the only prerequisite .
This means most dudes will find themselves way in over their innocent little heads , no matter how tough they make themselves out to be on their MySpace page .

Yesterday , VMware updated Fusion to version 1.1.2 .
Although this is a minor increase in the version number , the update brings some important fixes , updates , and improvements that may affect a lot of you /us .
Perhaps the most important piece of additional functionality is version 1.1.2 of Fusion allows users to back up their virtual machines using Time Machine .
While backing up is always a good idea , it can become a tricky issue if you have several virtual machines , as they tend to be large files and Time Machine will want to back them up after each time the are run .
VMWare suggests that if the large amount of space required is an issue , you can manually exclude some VMs in Time Machine .
With 1.1.2 , we also see improved compatibility with Apple 's MacBok Air .
The update fixes a virtual CD / DVD drive crash and adds the ability to use the USB SuperDrive to burn CDs and DVDs .
We also see the rather timely addition of support for Windows XP SP3 Boot Camp partitions , as well as Simplified Chinese localization .
Rounding out the list of updates are fixes for a wireless bridged networking bug , a sound selection bug , better support for the Apple Aluminum Keyboard , the ability to change key command mappings , a USB device related issue , and a keyboard input bug that was introduced in version 1.1.1 .
Now go forth and update .

Earmarks are “ congressional provisions directing approved funds to be spent on specific projects . ”
In other words , legislators can direct federal money to pet projects ( usually in their cities or states ) .
The Secular Coalition for America reviewed 24 Congressional appropriations committee reports from the fiscal year 2008 .
They found over 140 earmarks that are “ constitutionally suspect . ”
Those earmarks — set aside for religious activities — total nearly $ 30,000,000 .
Among the projects financed by your money ?
Training programs for evangelical ministers , homeless shelters that try to convert clients to Christianity , and colleges whose students must believe in Biblical inerrancy .
Here are some of the SCA ’s findings :
Both parties support religious earmarks
Our study found that political party was a poor indicator in determining whether a member of Congress would provide an earmark to a religious organization ; 52 percent were sponsored by Republicans and 42 percent were Democrat sponsored .
Six percent of the earmarks were bipartisan …
Sens. Arlen Specter , Kit Bond lead in religious earmarks
… Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) provided 8 earmarks to religiously motivated and operated abstinence - only programs with funding totaling $ 365,000 .
Senator Specter produced an additional 12 earmarks , mostly to religious colleges , for about $ 1,300,000 .
In fact , Senator Specter requested the greatest number of religious earmarks , by far , of any member of Congress .
In sheer dollars , Senator Kit Bond ( R - MO ) was the leader with a total of $ 2,250,000 in religious earmark requests .
Some ministries granted multiple earmarks Several organizations received multiple earmarks from different Congressional sponsors ; for example , World Impact Ministries , a Christian group that “ ministers cross-culturally to people unreached by the gospel of Jesus Christ through evangelism , follow - up , discipleship and indigenous church - planting , ” received five earmarks for a total amount of $ 1,875,000 from Senators Kit Bond ( R - MO ) and Sam Brownback ( R - KS ) and from Representatives William Lacy Clay ( D - MO ) , Xavier Becerra ( D - CA ) and Jerry Moran ( R- KS ) .
Teen Challenge , a program designed for at - risk youth that involves conversion to Christianity , received four earmarks for a total of $ 600,000 from Representatives Christopher Carney ( D - PA ) , Steve Buyer ( R- IN ) , Jim Ramstad ( R - MN ) and Howard Coble ( R- NC ) .
The SCA even provides a list of the Top Ten Most Egregious Earmarks :
$ 750,000 to renovate World Impact Ministries St. Louis Headquarters ( Bond , R- MO ) .
$ 200,000 to the International Fellowship of Chaplains to pay for their attendance at the Road to Hope Training Program ( Gillmor* , R - OH ) .
$ 200,000 to the Lower East Side Conservancy , a group that works to restore and preserve living synagogues ( Maloney , D - NY ) .
$ 200,000 to the Goodwill Rescue Mission , a homeless shelter that seeks to convert its clients to Christianity ( Lautenberg , D - NJ ) .
$ 850,000 for construction at Morning Star Ranch , a Christian - only camp that trains youth to become lay evangelists ( Brownback , R- KS ) .
$ 300,000 to Wildwood Ranch , another Christian - only camp ( Conyers , D - MI ) .
$ 350,000 to Northwest Nazarene University , an evangelical college with a strict code of conduct that does not admit nontheists and possibly gays / lesbians ( Craig and Crapo , R - ID ) .
$ 450,000 to Grace College , an evangelical Christian college that requires belief in an inerrant Bible for admission ( Souder , R- IN ) .
$ 150,000 to Quinn Chapel in Chicago for renovation ( Davis , D - IL ) .
$ 150,000 to New Hope Academy , a reform and rehabilitation program that requires conversion to Christianity ( Carney , D - PA ) .
* Rep. Gillmor died Sept. 5 , 2007 .
He was succeeded by Robert Latta .
A letter was sent to all 107 Congress members who sponsored one of these earmarks .
Constitutionally prohibited earmarks include those directing taxpayer dollars towards religious organizations that provide earmark - supported services only to people who share their religious beliefs or that limit employment opportunities funded by the earmark to fellow believers .
Also , the federal funds , or equipment and facilities purchased with federal funds , must not be used for inherently religious activities such as worship , religious instruction or proselytization .
Government funding of any of these activities advances the religious mission of the organization ; this is a violation of the Establishment Clause and therefore unconstitutional .
The letter was also sent to the American Humanist Association and the Freedom From Religion Foundation .
Both groups engage in litigation .
The research was undertaken by Tom Antonsen , a student at Oberlin College , who interned with the SCA .

Bringing his claims to Capitol Hill for the first time , former AT&T network technician Mark Klein appeared yesterday at a press conference to reiterate his astonishing claim : AT&T operated a 24 x 48 - foot room in one of its network operations centers in San Francisco , where Klein discovered his employer was cooperating with the National Security Agency in the monitoring of all Internet traffic over a major backbone line .
" I have first - hand knowledge of the clandestine collaboration between one giant telecommunications company , AT&T , and the National Security Agency to facilitate the most comprehensive illegal domestic spying program in history , " Klein remarked in his press conference yesterday .
Klein 's allegations have been part of an ongoing class - action suit against AT&T since January 2006 , funded by the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
While he was not able to witness everyday goings - on in the " Secure Room , " as an engineer , Klein was privy to how the room was wired .
In a June 8 sworn deposition entered into evidence in this case , he described what he saw .

In January 2003 , Klein was invited to tour the Folsom Street Facility of what was then known as SBC Communications .
There he saw for the first time Room 641A , categorized as the " SG3 Secure Room . "
That fall , when he was hired to work at the facility , he noted that an NSA agent was interviewing field support specialists for clearance to be able to work in the Secure Room .
" To my knowledge , only employees cleared by the NSA were permitted to enter the SG3 Secure Room , " Klein stated in his June deposition ( PDF available here ) .
" To gain entry to the SG3 Secure Room required both a physical key for the cylinder lock and a combination code number to be entered into an electronic keypad on the door .
To my knowledge , only [ two Field Support Specialists ] had both the key and the combination code . "
But Klein , who often worked at Folsom alone , had keys to every other door except SG3 .
As part of his job there , Klein installed new circuits to a fiberoptic " splitter cabinet , " whose sole purpose , diagrams entered into evidence show , was to duplicate WorldNet service Internet traffic into SG3 .
The existence of this splitter suggests that the NSA had access to all the traffic on that circuit .
Klein was scheduled to appear on Capitol Hill again today , to appear as a witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
There , he expected a friendly audience before Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , who opposes efforts by the Bush administration and Congressional Republicans to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act to grant immunity to telecom companies like AT&T , from prosecution for surveillance acts .
Such an immunity grant would conceivably result in the dismissal of cases including Klein's .
While BetaNews had planned to cover Klein 's remarks on Capitol Hill today , in a strange turn of events , the audio feed for the Senate Judiciary conference room was malfunctioning .
A notice to that effect was posted to Web sites that had planned to carry the feed live .
Transcripts or recordings of today 's proceedings may yet be made available .
In the meantime , a federal judge in California moved yesterday to block AT&T , Verizon , and Sprint from destroying documents that may be subpoenaed into evidence in this case .
IBM chip is fastest on Earth Water - cooled Power6 is designed for use on big , high - end machines
IBM Corp. began shipping high - end computers Tuesday built around the fastest chip on Earth , a microprocessor that can carry out up to 5 billion instructions per second , surpassing the speediest competing processors built by rivals like Intel or Sun Microsystems .
The new IBM processor , called the Power6 , was designed to run big - ticket , water - cooled machines that drive corporations or tackle scientific problems , but slower versions of this same family of chips are already being used in inexpensive , consumer devices like the Nintendo Wii , Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation .
Cranking up the speed is only one way to improve overall system performance , say chip experts from Intel and Sun , which have evolved different ways to coax more work from chips - and therefore stay competitive in the never - ending race to sell computers that do more and cost less .
But if a stopwatch were the only ranking system , the 5 - billion - instructions - per second Power6 processor from IBM would beat such rivals as the 3.73 gigahertz Pentium Extreme and the 2.4 gigahertz UltraSparc T2 from Sun .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" It 's hard to make the average person understand just how fast this is , " said IBM Chief Technology Officer Bernard Meyerson , offering an example meant to explain his company 's baby that still leaves the listener awed with the speediness of the two " laggards . "
" Hold your index finger out in front of your face , " Meyerson said in a telephone interview from IBM headquarters in New York .
In less time than it would take a beam of light to travel from your knuckle to your fingertip , the new IBM chip would complete one task and start looking for the next , he said .
Light would presumably have to travel more than a finger 's length to get each task done on the slower processors from Intel and Sun - and at billions - of - cycles per second , slow is a bit of a misnomer .
Then why do n't Intel and Sun just crank up the speed ?
Well , just as is the case with cars , the faster chips run , the hotter they get , and IBM has created water - cooling systems akin to the radiators in cars to keep its processors from overheating .
Not doing so , Meyerson quipped , " results in setting fire to the user , which is bad . "
Intel spokesman George Alfs said his company , which sells millions upon millions of processors for all sorts of stuff like laptops , where lugging around a water jug would be a chore , said there 's no technical reason why Intel chips can't run faster .
In fact , Alfs said , sophisticated game enthusiasts buy water - cooling kits that they fit into desktop PCs , then use software tricks inside the Windows operating system to crank up their own speeds into the 5 gigahertz range .
" But that can void your warranty , " Alfs said .
Sun spokesman Mark Richardson took umbrage at the focus on speed .
" It 's an easier marketing message to deliver to say that faster gigahertz means a faster processor , " he said .
His colleague , chip expert Fadi Azhari , explained how the Mountain View firm uses a different technical trick , called multithreading , to make a computer faster but not hotter .
Imagine a long line of airport passengers waiting for the ticket agent to check them in , Azhari said .
The IBM speed trick would have that ticket agent working faster and faster - with maybe a blower overhead to cool the agent down .
But multithreading would be like putting two or more ticket agents on duty , which is another less - heat - intensive approach to processing , he said .
LispScript
LispScript is a Common Lisp program that translates Lisp programs into Javascript .
It 's extremely simple at the moment , but has support for basic arithmetic functions , defun , IF , macros , and LET .
It currently works with CLISP .
Using LispScript
From the lispscript directory , load CLISP , and type :
> ( load " package.lisp " )
This will load the lispscript package .
To compile the example program , type :
> ( in - package lispscript ) > ( jscompile " test.lisp " " out.js " )
This will produce a file called " out.js " which is referenced in the included index.html file .
Load index.html in your favorite browser and you 'll see a number of alerts with the results of called functions .
Clicking on the Test link will show you closures working .
Why ?
While I think Javascript is a great scripting language , its scoping and the way it provides closures annoys me , and I really miss macros and LET .
So I started doing this to see if I could fix those problems .
But really , this is a fun project I work on when I 'm bored and have some free minutes to spare , two conditions which seldom occur simultaneously these days .
Obviously , a lot more work needs to be done for this to actually be useful for writing web sites .

『声に出して読みたい日本語』『間違いだらけのクルマ選び』などのベストセラーを出してきた草思社が経営破たんに追い込まれた。長引く出版不況のなかで、多くの出版社は体力を消耗、出版点数を増やし続ける「自転車操業」状態に陥っている。草思社の経営破たんは、出版業界が陥っている「危機」を象徴する出来事だったようなのだ。
「 昔はあった数十万部売れる書籍がなくなってきている」
草思社のHPでは民事再生法の適用申請について触れられていない 草思社のHPでは民事再生法の適用申請について触れられていない
草思社は2008年1月9日、東京地方裁判所に民事再生法の適用を申請した。負債総額は約22億5000万円。業績不振や有利子負債が経営を圧迫したためで、同社は不動産を売却し、07年12月中旬には本社を移転。同12月末にはWebマガジン「
Web草思」の運営をやめていた。同社によれば、すでに書籍の出庫を停止しているが、08年1月10日までに10社近い企業が支援に名乗りを上げており、営業を08年3月に再開することを目指しているという。
同社は1968年に設立。『間違いだらけのクルマ選び』を76年から30年間にわたって発行していたほか、『声に出して読みたい日本語』（01年）『清貧の思想』（92年）といったベストセラーを多く出しており、07年12月には北朝鮮に拉致された横田めぐみさんの母・早紀江さんの発言をまとめた『めぐみへ
横田早紀江、母の言葉』を出版したばかり。そういったこともあり、出版業界にあたえる「衝撃」は計り知れない。
草思社編集部はJ-CASTニュースに対し、162万部のミリオンセラーを記録した『声に出して読みたい』以降、「50万部を超える書籍が出版できなかった」と話す。
「 ミリオンセラーと『売れない書籍』の " 格差 " があり、昔はあったはずの中間層の数十万部売れる書籍がなくなってきている。ここ数年、それが出せなかったことが、（経営破たんに）直接的な影響を与えたと考えている。また、新書や文庫本といった『安くてコンパクト』な本が今求められているのに、単行本だけを出していたことも時代の逆を行ったかたちになる」
一方で、同社編集部の担当者は 「 環境のせいにするわけではないが、出版業界が厳しくなってきているのは肌で感じた」とも漏らしている。
SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNN ) --
Thousands of protesters demonstrated against China 's human rights record and its crackdown in Tibet after the Olympic flame arrived in San Francisco Tuesday .
Pro-Tibetan demonstrators shout outside the Chinese consulate in San Francisco Tuesday .

Chanting and waving flags , the protesters ended their march at the Chinese consulate , where they sat in a dense group , holding flags and banners , as police watched from nearby .
" Stop killing , " one sign read , while another said , " No human rights , no Olympics . "
The protests came after passionate demonstrations in London and Paris in which protesters tried to snuff the torch 's flame and dozens were arrested .
Meanwhile , the Olympic flame was being kept in an undisclosed location in advance of Wednesday 's planed 6 - mile relay in San Francisco .
Watch how the city is preparing »
The run is the only U.S. appearance for the flame , wrapping up the first week of a 23 - city global tour .
Beijing organizers have said the monthlong international relay will not be stopped despite the protests , but some International Olympic Committee members have suggested an early end should be considered .
The IOC 's executive board will discuss the torch relay " in general " Thursday or Friday , but there is no proposal on the agenda to end the global tour early , IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said .

Protesters clog Olympic torch relay route CNN / Money : Protests could hurt sponsors
The official Beijing Olympics Web site , controlled by the Chinese organizers , gives little indication of any torch relay disruption .
It characterizes the demonstrators as " a small number " of Tibetan separatists .
Beijing blames the Dalai Lama and his followers for violence that erupted in March amid protests for Tibetan independence .
China has drawn international criticism for its crackdown on the demonstrations , which began peacefully on the 49th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising .
China 's Foreign Ministry Tuesday reacted forcefully to the torch relay protests .
" We express our strong condemnation to the deliberate disruption of the Olympic torch relay by Tibetan separatist forces regardless of the Olympic spirit and the law of Britain and France , " China spokeswoman Jiang Yu said .
" Their despicable activities tarnish the lofty Olympic spirit and challenge all the people loving the Olympic Games around the world . "
The flame will return to China in May to begin a relay through the host nation , ending in Beijing with the August 8 opening of the Olympic Games .
One of the San Francisco torchbearers has dropped out of Wednesday 's relay because of fears of protests , a torch relay spokesman said .
David Perry , spokesman for the San Francisco Olympic Torch Relay , said he did not want to release the name of the person .
" I understand anyone that might feel that they do n't want to expose themselves to something more than protest , " Perry said .
On Monday , three protesters scaled San Francisco 's Golden Gate Bridge and raised a large banner .
Those who climbed the cables from which the bridge 's deck is suspended were members of Students for a Free Tibet , said group spokesman Tenzin Dasang , 22 .
They unfurled a banner that read : " One World .
One Dream .
Free Tibet . "
The three climbers , along with four people on the ground , were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance charges , said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein .
The climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing .
The Golden Gate Bridge protest came on the same day that thousands of protesters forced an abrupt halt to the flame 's passage through Paris after 10 miles of the 17 - mile planned route .
Some stops were skipped and the flame was transferred from the torch back to the lamp to be carried on a bus several times to avoid protesters .
Protesters pierced the thick security bubble surrounding the torchbearers , at times getting their hands on the torch itself .
The Paris demonstrations were similar to those Sunday in London , where at least 36 people were arrested , according to London Metropolitan Police .
Protesters cited China 's actions in Tibet , its policies on the Darfur region of Sudan and the lack of civil rights and freedoms for the Chinese people .
But other demonstrators , bearing Chinese flags , turned out in support of the Chinese government , and many others were spectators there just to see the torch .
An Olympic committee member suggested Monday that the public relations nightmare that has followed the Olympic flame on its way to the Summer Games in Beijing may make 2008 the last time such an ambitious global torch relay is attempted .
Follow the torch relay itinerary »
International Olympic Committee member Richard Kevan Gosper , who is also chairman of the IOC 's press committee , told reporters he was always opposed to a global tour for the flame .
" I'm a firm believer that we had the right template in the first place , that the torch simply should go from Olympia , Greece , to the host country , " Gosper said .

First - born children are more intelligent than their siblings , research has found .
The oldest child is more likely to have a higher IQ , and the youngest likely to have the lowest , say researchers .
Scientists at Vrije University , Amsterdam , studied 650 children whose IQs were tested three times until they were 18 .
Dorret Boomsma , whose work will be published in the journal Intelligence , said : " The effect is seen in boys and girls .
" The highest IQ scores were in children without any older siblings , followed by children with one older sibling .
" Children with two or more older siblings obtained the lowest score . "
Why this occurs is unclear but it is thought that the level of attention parents lavish on first - borns boosts their intellectual development .
But while the oldest may be the brightest , another study shows the youngest is the most favoured .
Research on 2,000 families by the University of California found first - borns are achievers , who are dominant , religious , conscientious and neurotic .
Middle - borns are rebellious , less religious , impulsive and open to new experiences .
Last - borns are agreeable , sociable and creative - and are often the most favoured child .
Here are two pictures that made me laugh today .
For some reason , I suddenly felt like playing around with Scala for a couple of days , and having gotten over my perceived difficulty of the language vs Groovy , and after actually trying to write something in it – I really like it 🙂
At first glance , advanced functional programming in Scala can look a little freaky to someone who ’s only been writing Java for the last few years .
But if you start slowly , it all slides into place .
I started to get into it by reading this is a really good series of articles introducing the language
What follows are two examples of Scala .
The first , LoveGame is a demonstration of programming a simple algorithm in Scala along with a little comarpison with Java .
The second is a little toying around i did with Scala to create a front end for JScience with the “ Pimp my library ” pattern .
The Loooove Game
I ’m teaching a course to our new hires in Melbourne at the moment and one of their assignments was to write a program called “ Love Game ” which implemented a simple algorithm to calculate the compatibility between two people based on the letters in their names .
I ’m sure you all remember doing this as a kid ?
Well , in the weekend , I could n’t help but start thinking about how the algorithm could be expressed so much better .
So I thought this was the motivation to give Scala another shot .
The algorithm in java looks like this :
// Creates 2 character arrays that will be compared char bothNamesArray [ ] = " roger federer maria sharapova " .toCharArray ( ) ; char compWordArray [ ] = " loves " .toCharArray ( ) ; // Creates an Integer array for storing count results Integer tally Array [ ] = new Integer[ compWord.length ( ) ] ; int tally ArrayPointer = 0 ; int matchCounter = 0 ; /* * Counts the number of times each character in compWordArray also * appears in bothNamesArray */ while ( tallyArrayPointer < compWord.length ( ) ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < bothNames.length ( ) ; i++) { char nameLetter = bothNamesArray[i ] ; char compLetter = compWordArray[ tallyArrayPointer ] ; if ( nameLetter == compLetter ) { matchCounter ++ ; } tallyArray[ tallyArrayPointer ] = matchCounter ; } matchCounter = 0 ; tallyArrayPointer ++ ; } int tally Counter ; int totalAdder ; /* * Calculates the compatibility percentage by adding consecutive * numbers in tally Array together .
*/ while ( tallyArray [ 2 ] != - 1 ) { tally Counter = 0 ; while (( tallyCounter < tallyArray.length - 1 ) && ( tallyArray[tallyCounter + 1 ] != - 1 ) ) { totalAdder = tallyArray[ tallyCounter ] + tallyArray[tallyCounter + 1 ] ; tallyArray[ tallyCounter ] = totalAdder ; tallyCounter ++ ; } tallyArray[ tallyCounter ] = - 1 ; } int finalPercentage = ( tallyArray [ 0 ] + tallyArray [ 1 ] ) * 2 ; // Displays the compatibility percentage System.out.println ( "
Calculated compatibility = " + finalPercentage + " % " ) ;[ / sourcecode ] < pre>NB :
Yes we could re-write the Java implementation using recursion also , but it does n’t fit as nicely as it does into the Scala solution , and the Java code would still require most of it ’s verbosity .</ pre>
It works in two steps ; < ol > < li>Counts the frequency of occurrence of the letters in the word love , in the full names < / li > < li >
Takes this list of frequencies and reduces it down to one number by adding up pairs of values in the list , creating a new list , then repeating until there ’s one value left .
That value is then multiplied by two , and that ’s your result .
</li > </ ol >
This is what the Scala code to do the same thing looks like : I can't stop sitting here and steering at how awesomely terse the following Scala code really is .... val names = " roger federer maria sharapova " val initialList = " loves " .
toList map ( x => names .
toList count( x == _ ) ) def loveReduce ( numbers : List [ Int ] ) : Int = numbers match { case head :: Nil => head * 2 case _ => loveReduce ( numbers zip ( numbers tail ) map {case ( a , b ) => a +b} ) } //
Displays the compatibility percentage println ( " Compatibility = " + loveReduce( initialList ) + " % " )
As you can see , the algorithm can be written in far fewer lines of code , and is far simpler to understand , expecially the second stage .
This means it ’s much easier to see that it is correct .
Ironically , the Java code above actually fails in the case where the “ verb ” ( loves ) , is replaced with a smaller work like “ is ” .
There may also be other cases where it fails .
However the Scala code works perfectly !
Step One
" loves " .map ( x => names.count( y => x == y ) )
NB : toList ( ) has been removed for clarity .
The first step is to find our list of frequencies .
List.map ()
What the map fuction does , is apply a given function F( x ) to a list of elements , returning a new list , such that each element is now the result of F( x ) .
For example :
Consider the array
[ 1,2,3,4 ]
Applying map ( F( x ) ) results in :
[ F( 1 ) , F( 2 ) , F( 3 ) , F( 4 ) ] .
If we imagine the function we pass is F( x ) = x+1 , then the returned array would look like :
[ 2,3,4,5 ]
In our code , we have defined our function F( x ) to be the number of times our x appears in the String names .
We do that by using the count ( ) function .
List.count ( )
The count function counts the number of elements in a list which satisfy a given condition .
We pass that ‘ condition ’ in as a function .
In our case , we are breaking up the word loves into individual letters , so we want to count how many times that letter occurs in the names string .
By using the count function , we iterate through the names string , letter by letter , counting the times a given letter in the name – y – equals the letter we access from our outer loop – x .
We then perform the same operation , but with the next letter in the word loves .
In our code above , you can see we are passing the function x == y ( x == _ is short hand ) .
Again , where x is a letter in the word loves and y is a letter in the names .
Note that this one line is an O ( n ^ 2 ) complexity .
Step Two
def loveReduce ( numbers : List [ Int ] ) : Int = numbers match { case head :: Nil => head * 2 case _ => loveReduce(numbers.zip(numbers.tail ) .map{case ( a , b ) => a +b} ) }
Ignore the method signature at this point , let ’s explain the algorithm .
The second part in the algorithm deals with the list of frequencies .
For the example “ Roger Federer loves Maria Sharapova ” , the frequency count for the letters in the loves is : List ( 0 , 2 , 1 , 4 , 1 ) We then to add up each pair of numbers to create a new array e.g. List ( 2 , 3 , 5 , 5 ) and repeat until are left with a single element which we multiply by 2 .
To express this very tersely , in Scala , recursion is involved .
We could re-write the Java implementation using recursion also , but it does n’t fit as nicely as it does into the Scala solution , and the Java code would still require most of it ’s verbosity .
The list gets reduced as so :
List ( 0 , 2 , 1 , 4 , 1 )
List ( 2 , 3 , 5 , 5 )
List ( 5 , 8 , 10 )
List ( 13 , 18 )
List ( 31 )
Apart from the pattern matching ( we ’ll get to that soon ) , most of this method is similar to how you would do it in Java .
The really interesting Scala part of this example is this line :
numbers.zip(numbers.tail ) .map{case ( a , b ) => a+b}
What this is doing is constructing a list of tuples ( pretty much two element arrays ) by combining two lists , and then applying another map function , the function being adding together the two elements in the tuple.numbers.
tail returns the list without it head ( with out it ’s first element ) .
So we are effectively calling : [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] . zip( [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] )
The result of this call is a list which looks like ;
List ( ( 1,2 ) , ( 2,3 ) , ( 3,4 ) )
It is one element shorter than the original list because the zip ( ) is defined such that when zipping together lists of different length , remaining elements in the longer list are ignored .
We then apply the map ( ) function to this array of tuples , with the function F ( case ( a , b ) => a +b ) .
The case statement uses Scala pattern matching to retreive a matchin tuple element .
The result from this is now the tuples all added together , and the list one element shorter :
List ( 3 , 5 , 7 )
Then we simply recursively call the loveReduce method again on the newlist .
numbers match { case head :: Nil => head * 2 case _ => loveReduce (... ) }
This is similar in nature to Java ’s switch statement , but far , far more powerful .
It uses a powerful concept called pattern matching and is not simply restricted to either ints or enums .
In our example , we are performing a math on our numbers list where our first case is the end of recursion .
This being where the parameter passed in as number , matches a list ( as Scala knows it ’s a list ) where the list has only a head element and nothing else ( one element in the list ) .
The statement which would match a list which had two or more elements would be “ head :: tail “ .
The reason we do n’t need to return from a case is that in Scala , unlike Java , cases do not overflow into each other , so to end or recursion , we simply return the head element , multiplied by two , as per our LoveGame algorithm .
The second case uses the universal operator “ _ ” which is used in several places in Scala , but used consistently .
This is similar to the “ default ” case in Java .
In this case , we want to perform our zip and map , and make our recursive call again .
And to breiflly explain the method signature of loveReduce
def loveReduce ( numbers : List [ Int ] ) :
Int
In Scala , everything is an object , even functions .
Above we define the loveReduce function .
It takes one parameter called numbers of type List [ Int ] .
As you can see Scala supports type parameters , just like Java ’s Generics .
Usually , in Scala , returns types of a method can be inferred by it ’s type inference system .
However , there are cases where the return type of the method has to be specified and this is one .
But do n’t worry – the compiler will tell you when you need to !
Here we simply define the return type of the method is Int .
On a side note – in Scala , everything is an object – even simple ints .
So unlike in Java where auto - boxing was introduced in 1.5 , Scala treats all simple numbers as Objects .
Engineering
That is the compact version of the code .
Originally I wrote it in a more engineered way , in order to learn more Scala , and also so that I could learn more about implicit conversions .
/** * LoveGame algorithm .
Uses a recursive function to reduce the frequency * list to the final result .
*/ class LoveGame ( verb : String ) extends MyConversions { /**
Reduces a list of numbers down to a single number by continually * adding up consecutive pairs until there is only one element left , * and multiplies it by one . */ def loveReduce ( numbers : List [ Int ] ) : Int = numbers match { case head :: Nil => head * 2 case _ => loveReduce(numbers.zip(numbers.tail ) .map{case ( a , b ) => a +b} ) } /**
Runs the LoveGame on the words in the String names based on * the class parameter verb . */ def compute ( names : String ) : Int = { val initialList = verb.toLowerCase.countOccurances(names.toLowerCase ) loveReduce( initialList ) } } /** * A collection of implicit conversions used in this component .
*/ trait MyConversions { implicit def string2MyRichString ( str: String ) = new MyRichString ( str ) } /** * Pimps out the String class with extra methods .
*/ class MyRichString ( str: String ) { /**
Counts the frequency each letter in occures _haystack_ , returning a list .
*/ def countOccurances ( haystack : String ) = str.toList.map ( x => haystack.toList.count(x == _ ) ) } /** * Bootstrap for the LoveGame program .
Should be replaced by a xUnit test .
*/ object LoveGameProgram extends Application { val names = Array ( " Roger " , " Federer " , " Maria " , " Sharapova " ) .mkString ( " " ) // loves - 62 % val loveGame = new LoveGame ( " loves " ) println ( names ) println ( " Compatibility = " + loveGame.compute(names.mkString ( " " ) ) + " % " ) }
Update :
Inspired by my friends
C# code below , here ’s the love game in Scala again , but using the while loop approach in 4 lines ( i.e. minus pattern matching , recursion and functions ) :
var loves = " loves " .
toList map ( x => " roger federer maria sharapova " .
toList count( x == _ ) ) while ( loves.length > 1 ) loves = loves zip ( loves tail ) map {case ( a , b ) => a +b} println ( " 3 line compatibility = " + loves .head * 2 + " % " )
Pimp My Library
In honor of this JScience and Groovy example , here ’s something in Scala going for the same sort of thing – extrapolate out , use your imagination .
For those of you who do n’t know what JScience is : “ JScience is a comprehensive Java library for the scientific community .
Its vision is to create synergy between all sciences ( mathematics , physics , sociology , biology , astronomy , economics , geography , history , etc. ) by integrating them into a single architecture . ”
It is also going to be the in Java soon as the Reference Implementation ( RI ) for JSR - 275 : javax.measure .* ( Latest Draft Specification ) .
It allows you to do stuff like this in Java :
Measure length = Measure.valueOf( 50 , SI.
CENTI ( SI.METER ) ) .plus( Measure.valueOf( 25.0 , SI. METER ) ) ; Measure lengthInCentimeters = length.to( SI.CENTI( SI.METER ) ) ; System.out.println ( " length in centimeters is " + lengthInCentimeters.getEstimatedValue ( ) ) ;
But that ’s pretty verbose , would n’t you rather just write :
var len = 50. centimeters + 25.meters println ( " length in centimeters is " + len )
Well , below is the start of writing a wrapper for the JScience Library using Scala ’s implicit conversions .
println ( 2.miles.to.meters ) class MyInt ( quantity : Int ) { def miles ( ) = new Mile( quantity ) def mile ( ) = new Mile( quantity ) } abstract class Measure { def to ( ) = new Converter ( this ) def toMeters ( ) } class Mile ( quantity : Int ) extends Measure { def conversionFactorToMeters : Double = 1.609344 * 1000 ; override def toMeters ( ) = quantity * conversionFactorToMeters } class Feet ( quantity : Int ) extends Measure { def conversionFactorToMeters = 1/0.3048 override def toMeters = quantity * conversionFactorToMeters } class Converter ( quantity : Measure ) { def meters ( ) = quantity.toMeters ( ) } implicit def numberToMile ( number : Int ) = new MyInt ( number )
How powerful is that ?
Implicit conversions allow the “ Pimp my library ” pattern which can be really powerful .
I certainly know it would have been really useful in my last project !
P.S. If anyone knows anything about Scala code high lighting in hosted WordPress drop me a line !
Sourcode tag does n’t support it .
NEW YORK / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Gold ended higher on Monday as oil hit a record high and physical demand rebounded , but investors remained cautious ahead of this week ’s meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve on interest rates .

Bullion rose as high as $ 895.80 an ounce and was at $ 891.65/892.65 by New York ’s last quote 2:15 p.m. EDT , against $ 886.90/888.30 in New York late on Friday .
U.S. gold futures for June delivery on COMEX division of New York Mercantile Exchange settled up $ 5.80 at $ 895.50 an ounce .
Gold was supported by strong oil prices , but analysts said bullion ’s upward movement was not as impressive as last month when soaring oil and a record low dollar propelled gold to a lifetime high of $ 1,030.80 on March 17 .
“ Sentiment towards gold is not nearly as bullish as it was , not least because the outlook for the dollar is considerably less bearish , ” said Tom Kendall , metals strategist at Mitsubishi Corporation .
“ If we get more positive U.S. data this week that surprises on the upside , or if the tone of the statement following the Fed meeting gives people confidence that it has come to the end of its interest rate easing cycle , then it would not be surprising to see gold pushed lower . ”
The metal has fallen 13 percent since then and has been struggling to regain $ 900 .
It hit a three - week low of $ 877.60 on Friday before a surging oil market lifted gold ’s appeal as a hedge against inflation .
Oil hit a record near $ 120 a barrel , boosted by a string of bullish factors including disruption of Nigeria ’s output and a UK refinery strike , highlighting anxieties over supplies .
U.S. crude futures settled up 23 cents at $ 118.75 a barrel .
“ I do expect gold to drift around $ 900 for a little while , until we really see another strong shift in sentiment .
Even the spike in oil is failing to really fire up the gold market , ” said Daniel Hynes , metals strategist at Merrill Lynch .
“ After such a good run , a lot of people took the opportunity to liquidate , but the general trend would be for rising prices in the medium - to long - term , ” he said .
FED MEETING AWAITED
In the currency market , the dollar marginally fell against the euro ahead of the Federal Reserve ’s meeting on Wednesday .
The Fed has slashed borrowing costs in response to the credit crisis that erupted last year , but some speculate that climbing fuel and food prices could prevent any more big cuts .
A rate cut tends to weaken the dollar and lift gold demand , as the metal is seen as an alternative investment and often moves in the opposite direction of the U.S. currency .
“ Gold ’s still trying to find a base here .
It ’s taking direction from the dollar , ” said one New Jersey - based trader .
The trader said that robust physical buying from Asia had boosted gold prices , especially during the Asian trading hours .
Gold should remain supported provided that Asian physical demand remained strong , he said .
In other metals , platinum rose to $ 1,964/1,974 an ounce from $ 1,944/1,964 late on Friday and silver gained to $ 16.95/17.05 an ounce from its precious finish of $ 16.83/16.89 .
But spot palladium fell $ 2 to $ 433.50/439.50 an ounce .
By injecting embryonic stem ( ES ) cells from a wood mouse into the early embryo of a house mouse , an international team of scientists has produced normal healthy animals made up of a mixture of cells from each of the two distantly related species .
This is the first time that stem cells from one mammalian species have been shown to contribute extensively to development when introduced into the embryo of another , very different species .
Although both are rodents , the wood mouse ( Apodemus sylvaticus ) and the house mouse ( Mus musculus ) have evolved separately for up to 20 million years .
Their genes differ by as much as 18 percent , about 12 times the difference between human and chimpanzee .
In an advanced online posting on Oct. 3 , 2007 , in the journal Human Molecular Genetics , scientists from the University of Chicago , Sun Yat - sen University , China , and the University of Liverpool , U.K. , describe how they produced a viable " chimera " - - a single organism with traits from two different species .
Before now , scientists have used ES cells to make chimeras within the same species or with closely related species .
" There are surprisingly high degrees of conservation in developmental programs between at least some distantly related mammalian species , " said study co-author Bruce Lahn , a Howard Hughes investigator and professor of human genetics at Chicago .
" When early embryonic cells from two divergent species are mixed together , they can communicate with each other properly and develop into one seamless , functional organism . "
" These results demonstrate the feasibility of differentiating ES cells into a wide range of cell types in vivo by introducing them into an evolutionary divergent host , " the authors wrote .
" This interspecies approach may be the only way to study ES cells of some species , such as human ES cells , in an in vivo context . "
The scientists extracted wood mouse ES cells and introduced a gene that produced a fluorescent protein , which enabled them to visually track the descendents of the stem cells in the chimeric organisms .
They then injected about 15 wood mouse ES cells into each of the 1,250 house mouse blastocysts and transferred the viable embryos into 44 surrogate house mouse mothers .
From these , 220 pups were born , 16 of them ( 7.3 percent ) showed chimerism based on their appearance .
In those 16 chimeras , up to 40 percent of the cells in some organs were wood mouse cells .
These cells were integrated into all of the tissues at various levels .

The chimeras appeared healthy and had no apparent defects .
They did demonstrate some behavioral differences .
They were less " jumpy " than a typical wood mouse but more so than a typical , much tamer , house mouse .
Although genetically different ( the wood mouse has 48 chromosomes , the house mouse , 40 ) , both of these species have similar developmental schedules .
The gestation period for a wood mouse is 23 days ; the gestation time for a house mouse is 19 days .
They also have approximately the same body size .
The chimeras varied in terms of how much and where the injected ES cells generated tissue .
" It 's completely random where the cells will develop and grow tissue , " Lahn said , adding that more studies are planned .
" We 're going to continue with these animals for a while to see if we can understand the developmental cues and learn how to manipulate the system , " Lahn said .
" For example , could injected wood mouse embryonic stem cells contribute more extensively to the liver in a house mouse that carries a genetic defect that prevents it from growing its own liver ?
Or , could we alter the stem cells in ways that could prevent them from contributing brain tissue ? "
The researchers also plan to merge mouse and rat , which have vastly different body sizes , as well as 20 percent genetic difference .

The Stabilization and Association Agreement ( SAA ) , a precursor to full EU membership talks , was signed on Tuesday , April 29 , by the EU foreign ministers and Serbia 's Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic in the presence of the Serbian President , Boris Tadic .
Djelic ( left ) , Tadic , Solana and Rupel were happy that the job was done
Europe hopes that the deal will boost Serbia 's pro-European parties ahead of an upcoming parliamentary vote .
But first , the ex-Yugoslav country will have to show it is fully cooperating with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague .
EU states will not ratify the pact , nor will Serbia get any trade or other benefits until this condition is met .
The SAA sent " a strong signal to Serbia to join us , to come to the EU , " said Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel , who chaired the council meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg where the decision was made .
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic , a pro-European member of the government , called the SAA agreement historic and said the decision signaled " an important political statement " which will open the doors to Serbia 's EU membership .
" We believe we are irreversibly on the road to EU membership , " he told reporters .
Serbia must hand over war criminals
Opinions about the EU are divided in Serbia
The SAA helps aspiring EU candidates to meet the strict standards necessary for eventual membership in the bloc .
Serbia will be asked to carry out various political , judicial and economic reforms .
In return , the EU will offer a series of benefits , including financial assistance , free trade deals and the relaxation of visa rules .
Tuesday 's diplomatic breakthrough came after the Netherlands and Belgium said they would no longer oppose the Serbian SAA .
Both countries had blocked the agreement because they felt Belgrade was not fully cooperating with the Hague Tribunal .
The Netherlands and Belgium agreed to sign the SAA on the condition that Serbia handed over all remaining war - crime suspects .
The most notorious criminal is Ratko Mladic , the Bosnian - Serb general indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity .
He is accused of orchestrating the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Bosniaks .
Mladic is believed to be hiding in Serbia .
" The Netherlands and Belgium have been very flexible and put forward several proposals , because we want to give the Serb people a signal that we care about them and that their future is in Europe , " Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen had said ahead of the Luxembourg meeting .
Elections unlikely to produce clear mandate
Serbians rioted after Kosovo independence
EU officials hope that the prompt signing of the SAA might give other pro-European parties an edge over ultra-nationalist rivals in the May 11 parliamentary elections .
Less than three months ago Serbians re-elected pro-European president Boris Tadic .
Yet Tadic 's Democratic
Party has been unable to hold together a coalition in parliament , leading to snap elections .
While the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party ( SRS ) was leading Tadic 's Democratic Party slightly in the polls , neither party was expected to win a clear majority .
It 's thought that current Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica will be the king maker in the upcoming elections .
Kostunica formed an uneasy coalition with Tadic 's party , which collapsed in March .
Kostunica 's increasingly nationalistic Democratic Party of Serbia was enraged by what it sees as Tadic 's acceptance of Kosovo 's recent declaration of independence .
Kosovo , a predominantly ethnic - Albanian province , split from Belgrade on Feb. 17 .
Kostunica is nominally in favor of Serbia joining the EU , but only on the condition that the 27 - member block recognizes Kosovo as part of Serbia .
Serbian parties could nix agreement
Kostunica has opposed the agreement
The SAA would become binding for Belgrade only once it is ratified by the new parliament .
Kostunica has condemned the agreement , saying that it recognizes Kosovo 's independence and calling it " an act against the state and against the constitution . "
Tadic disagreed , calling the SAA an " economic agreement which can not in any way endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia . "
EU ministers also indicated they will offer an SAA to Bosnia - Herzegovina , which has been less controversial than the Serbia agreement .
Interview with Renkoo
This is a pilot of a new feature we 're exploring at Twisted Matrix Labs : interviews with businesses that use and / or develop twisted applications .
The motivation for this is to provide practical , real - world examples of the kinds of things you can do with Twisted as well as exposing the more human side of the equation .
About Renkoo
Prior to the interview , I had a few quick conversations with Adam Rifkin about ​ Renkoo and their service offering .
Afterwards , I was invited to try out Renkoo , and I must say that I was delighted with it .
I find that nearly all of the gatherings I have with my friends start as ill - defined events that slowly ( and often painfully ) evolve into events with exact space - time coordinates .
Renkoo looks like the kind of app that could soothe or eliminate that pain .
The Players
This interview was conducted over the phone with Adam Rifkin and Kevin Murphy of Renkoo in Silicon Valley , and me ( Duncan McGreggor ) at the base of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado .
At the end of the interview are pasted some links of interest .
Enjoy !
Q : Let 's start at the beginning : how did you guys first get into python ?
Adam : Oh , wow ... let 's see .
Java was n't cutting it .
We were looking for another language that we could use on the backend .
And honestly , python was really easy to learn .
Kevin : I had n't done a lot of python before I started working on ​mod-pubsub .
My biggest exposure prior to that had been working with ​mailman .
I 'd done a little bit of extending and tweaking over time and it proved to be very easy to work with .
Once I started working on mod-pubsub , I just jumped in heard first , learning python and Twisted .
Q : mod-pubsub being one of the technical cornerstones of the Renkoo event planning service ...
Adam :
As a company , we have n't been around that long , but we 've been using ​ Twisted way before there was a company .
And yes , mod-pubsub is our open source project that helps power Renkoo .
mod-pubsub 's first incarnation was actually as a CGI .
When we converted to be a stand - alone server , we went with python instead of Java and actually learned the language as we wrote the software .
Kevin :
As far as twisted goes , I found the learning curve to be really , really steep .
But once you get acclimated , the power you have is undeniable .
What 's more , you can write these crazy , concurrent applications and then go back six months later and actually see the execution flow easily and know what everything in the code is actually doing .
And none of those locking headaches you get when writing threaded programs .
Q : So was your first exposure to Twisted with mod-pubsub ?
Kevin :
That was my first exposure - but I 'm newer to Renkoo and mod-pubsub .
Adam :
We 'd actually been looking at Twisted very early on .
You know , the reason that we actually got the idea to work with Twisted in the first place was through exposure to the code that ​ Abe Fettig had in place with his ​ Hep server .
Finding
Abe 's project was a natural discovery , seeing how we wanted to do something similar with messaging and multiple end points .
That was at least two and a half years ago , maybe three years by now .
Q : I actually downloaded mod-pubsub from SourceForge today and took a look .
Adam : Ah , yes .
That one 's old ; it 's pre-Twisted .
We migrated form ​asyncore to Twisted last year .
We plan on releasing the new one this year .
Q : What kinds of issues prompted you to switch from asyncore ?
Adam :
Well , as you can imagine , we found that as connections went up , performance went down .
Asyncore is not designed to be used in highly concurrent applications .
Kevin :
To add a little more about the limitations we had with asyncore , it was my understanding that not only did it not scale well , but it seemed to have a lot of problems especially if many of its open network connections were idle .
Adam : Yeah , basically , once we got past tens of connections , it really started to drag .
Kevin :
And it was really great to take advantage of all the work that 's been put into the Twisted reactor .
Q : How did you go about migrating to Twisted ?
Was this a complete rewrite ?
Or a series of incremental changes ?
Adam :
After initial , exploratory work , we decided that we did n't have the time to build both a business offering while simultaneously rebuilding the software underneath it .
So we contracted with a company called ​ OmniTI , based in Maryland .
Q : How was the original code that you guys wrote treated during the rewrite ?
Did any of it make it into the Twisted version ?
Adam :
The code that 's in SourceForge was treated as a " living spec " ; OmniTI did the rebuild based on what mod-pubsub was designed to do : publish and subscribe .
However , even though the rewrite did n't happen until last year , we 'd been looking at Twisted from the very start of our project .
Kevin :
In fact , there was a re-implementation of mod-pubsub before the work that ​ George Schlossnagle from OmniTI did , where we bolted on Twisted and made use of the reactor in all the places where asyncore used to be .
Even in that state , we were already seeing a pretty big performance improvement .
Q : So , in practical terms , how does Renkoo make use of the Twisted framework ?
What work do you make it do ?
Adam : Basically , mod-pubsub is in charge of real - time delivery to the web browser .
​twisted .web is what drives this .
Q : So this is the actual " Renkoo service " that drives what people are seeing ?
Riding on the back of twisted .
web ?
Adam :
You 've got it .
The other place where we are using Twisted is in messaging , with twisted .
words .
Kevin : Yeah , we 're sending out various types of notifications such as AIM and Yahoo !
Messenger .
Additionally , we use ​twisted .
mail for SMTP .
We using this in conjunction with libxslt for generating different types of messages from templates that are appropriate for the context .
Q : Did you run into any issues with twisted .
words with regard to the moving target of the AIM protocol ?
Kevin : Yeah ... words seems , right now , to be one of the least polished parts of twisted .
I ended up taking some of the Yahoo !
Messenger code from ​curphoo .
Working around the dual - login aspect of AOL really complicated things and I had to come up with solutions for working around disconnects with the cookie server such that the chat server connection was n't affected .
It would be nice if the AIM support was stronger in twisted .
words , providing something that people could more easily build off of .
Q : I do know that lately ​ Ralph Meijer has been putting a great deal of work into twisted .
words for ​ Jabber / ​XMPP support ...
Kevin : Cool !
That 's great to hear .
Q : On a related note , what sorts of things would you like to see get more attention in Twisted ?
Kevin :
Well , I 've been following the development of epoll ( see ​Improving Network I / O Performance , ​ Twisted 2.5 Release notes ) , and we 're really interested in seeing that get released .
In our benchmarks , though we have seen that the poll collector scales much better than the select reactor , it does start to get bogged down once it gets above 1000 connections or so .
It 's my understanding that epoll should be better for that kind of workload , especially if a lot of the connections are idle .
Q : Is there anything you can think of that the Twisted community might have done that would have made your job easier ?
Kevin :
Well , when I started , I really could have used better documentation .
But my experiences with the community were fantastic as I was learning : people were very helpful on IRC and on the mail lists .
And now , the documentation is actually quite excellent .
Q : I 've got a couple quick questions for you about Renkoo itself .
Adam :
Go for it .
Q : How does ​ Renkoo see itself in the market compared to such offerings as ​evite ?
Adam :
Well , evite 's been around for a while and the people that are using it are going to keep using it .
For some people , though , evite is not actually that useful .
Many people do n't know upfront where they want to meet - or even when .
Renkoo is perfect for them , as it gives them a friendly application that helps them decide the " when " and " where " of any get together .
Q : If you do n't mind my asking , what avenues is Renkoo exploring for producing revenue ?
Adam :
Not at all .
We 're looking at ways of non-invasively offering suggestions for things such as where to meet , if it has n't been decided .
Not traditional advertising , but more along the lines of working with a user 's or a group 's past preferences .
Have they enjoyed their meetings at these places before ?
Then here as some other places that are similar .
Kevin :
We 're also exploring partnerships with third - party reservation services .
This would enable users to easily make reservations as part of an organic experience within the Renkoo application .
Q : Well guys , thanks so much for your time and sharing with us how you make use Twisted -- I do look forward to playing with Renkoo .
Adam :
It 's been our pleasure .
Thanks !
Kevin :
Take care .

The Clinton Tax Returns : What Will They Reveal ?
ABC review shows the Clintons have made over $ 50 M since leaving the White House .
April 3 , 2008  -- Hillary Clinton has been pulling out all the stops to win the Democratic nomination for president -- but one : she still has not released her family 's tax returns .
The campaign says they will release the documents sometime before April 15 .
Without them , many questions remain about how the Clintons made tens of millions of dollars -- and whether they used arcane tax loopholes available to the super - rich , an expert says .
A Clinton campaign spokesman says the couple has paid all U.S. taxes at ordinary income tax rates .
An independent review by ABC News has found that since leaving the White House seven years ago , the senator and her former president husband have made well over $ 50 million , much of it from paid speeches made by Bill Clinton .
A review of Sen. Clinton 's annual ethics filings found that her husband has earned $ 47 million in fees from more than 280 speeches he has made around the world .
Clinton 's biggest patrons include New York - based investment firm Goldman Sachs , which paid him $ 650,000 for four speeches in recent years , and two foreign firms .
Gold Services International , a Colombian - based event organizer , brought Clinton to Latin America in 2005 for four days of speeches , earning Clinton $ 800,000 .
Another company , Toronto - based Power Within , paid Clinton $ 650,000 for a series of motivational speeches in Canada in 2005 .
Aides to the former president have said that his paid speeches are an efficient way for him to make money and devote more of his time to charitable work .
The annual disclosures do not require Sen .
Clinton to fully report her husband 's income , which obscures the picture of how much the former president has made in his business dealings with longtime friends and fundraisers .
Read Sen. Clinton 's latest disclosure form .
For example , an examination of the records reveals her husband is a partner in an investment fund , Yucaipa Global Partnership , registered in the Cayman Islands , and was paid " guaranteed payments to partner . "
Sen .
Clinton 's forms do not list the exact amount of her husband 's payments , only that they totaled more than $ 1,000 over four years .
" No average person has interest and funds in the Cayman Islands .
This is all the above - average , non - tax - paying , super rich , " said Jack Blum , an attorney and leading expert on offshore tax havens .
Jay Carson , a spokesperson for Sen.
Clinton 's presidential campaign , said the Yucaipa global fund was organized in the Cayman Islands to attract foreign investors .
" Each investor or partner in the fund pays the taxes they owe in their home country .
For U.S. citizens like Bill Clinton , that means he pays U.S. taxes on his income from this fund , which he does , " said Carson .
The exact amount he has made from his involvement in the fund remains undisclosed .
According to the Wall Street Journal , the former president stands to receive a payout of around $ 20 million for his role as an adviser to billionairel Ron Burkle 's investment funds .
Sen . Clinton 's presidential campaign disputes that figure .
" Contrary to published reports , neither the level of his compensation for his advisory role , nor the value of his partnership share in the Yucaipa Global Fund upon his exit , has been determined , " Carson said .
Bill Clinton has also faced scrutiny for his business dealings with friend and fundraiser Vinod Gupta , who has reportedly paid him undisclosed consulting fees and provided him use of his corporate jet .
Shareholders in Gupta 's data collection company filed a lawsuit in 2007 accusing Gupta of using the company 's resources to ingratiate himself with Clinton and other personal friends .
A court later dismissed the lawsuit .
Gupta has said it was a legitimate business expense to hire Clinton .
Contacted by phone Wednesday , a lawyer for Gupta declined to disclose the amount his client had paid Clinton .

It is the one moment every man wants to get right -- and which London floor - fitter Lefkos Hajji could hardly have got more wrong .

The luckless 28 year - old ’s dreams of giving his sweetheart , Leanne , 26 , the ultimate proposal have literally vanished into thin air .
Hajji , of Hackney , east London , had concealed a $ 12,000 engagement ring inside a helium balloon .
The idea was that she would pop the balloon as he popped the question .
But as he left the shop , a gust of wind pulled the balloon from his hand and he watched the ring -- and quite possibly the affections of his girlfriend -- sailing away over the rooftops .
“ I could n’t believe it , ” he told The Sun newspaper .
“ I just watched as it went further and further into the air .
“ I felt like such a plonker .
It cost a fortune and I knew my girlfriend would kill me . ”
Hajji spent two hours in his car trying to chase and find the balloon , without success .
“ I thought I would give Leanne a pin so I could literally pop the question , ” he said .
“ But I had to tell her the story -- she went absolutely mad .
Now she is refusing to speak to me until I get her a new ring . ”
He is hoping the ring will still turn up .
“ It would be amazing if someone found it , ” he added .

Reuters cameraman killed in Gaza
Posted
Apr 16 - An Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed Reuters cameraman Fadel Shana and two Palestinian civilians .
Even though Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton raised $ 21 million in March , her campaign continues to struggle with a cash squeeze as her unpaid bills mount and she spends more money than she is taking in , according to new campaign finance filings .
Mrs. Clinton , of New York , currently has $ 10.3 million in outstanding primary debts but only $ 9.5 million available to cover them , leaving an $ 800,000 shortfall at the end of March .
In February , the Clinton campaign had unpaid bills of $ 8.7 million and $ 11.7 million in cash .
By comparison , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , who raised $ 42 million in March , had $ 43 million in cash for the coming primaries and a campaign debt of less than $ 660,000 at the end of March .
Mr. Obama is spending 75 cents for every dollar he is taking in ; Mrs. Clinton is spending $ 1.10 .
In a conference call with reporters on Monday , the Clinton campaign sought to quell any concerns about finances .
Howard Wolfson , a campaign spokesman , said , “ This campaign has resources , ” and added , “ We will be honoring our debts in the coming months . ”
Pepsi Super Bowl Commercial , Behind the Scenes Look at ' Bob's House ' Videos
PepsiCo took an innovative approach to one of their 60 second Super Bowl commercials that will air as part of the pre-game show .
The ad concept will appeal to members of the deaf community and will have everyone else reaching for their television remote to adjust the sound .
The sixty seconds of silence may stretch on for what seems like an eternity of many but PepsiCo is betting that hearing impaired viewers will be thrilled .
The ad plays off a very popular story among the deaf community where two deaf men are in a car , heading to a friend 's house to watch the Super Bowl .
They do n't know which house in the neighborhood is Bob 's house so they honk the horn .
One house after another turns on their yard light and some peek out to see what the commotion is about .
The house that remains dark is Bob's .
We 've included this video and one that gives a behind the scenes look at how the commercial was made .
The 3 actors are actually deaf PepsiCo employees who have put in their own private time to help with the filming .
This is the actual commercial - check it out after the jump .
Now check out the behind the scenes creation of the commercial .
Whether it takes photos or videos , and whether it fits in the palm of your hand or has interchangeable lenses , …
The Dalai Lama 's high - profile visit is stirring pro- and anti-China sentiment in the US as the White House prepares to host the exiled Tibetan leader next week .
The meeting is likely to be sensitive for US - China relations , as China continues to reject Western criticism of its handling of widespread unrest in Tibet amid increasing international calls to boycott the opening ceremony of 2008 Beijing Olympics .
The Dalai Lama has repeatedly denied any involvement and condemned violence in Tibet .
Last week , the Nobel Peace Prize laureate arrived in Seattle to attend a conference on compassion at the University of Washington .
While thousands gathered to hear him speak Monday of peace and dialogue , hundreds of people , mostly Chinese - Americans protested outside the venue against the Dalai Lama , reports the Associated Press .
Demonstrators held signs alleging media bias and protesting the violence from rioting by Tibetan monks .
Some echoed Beijing 's stand that the Dalai Lama is behind the recent uprising against five decades of Chinese rule .
Signs called the Dalai Lama a liar and a " CIA - funded militant . "
Many people waved large Chinese flags .
" I think that people are misinformed .
They have media discrimination , " demonstrator Jiange Li said .
" Tibet was freed – 50 years ago . "
The Seattle Post - Intelligencer reports that protesters sang the Chinese national anthem and waved American and Chinese flags .
A small plane circled above the university , pulling banner that read DALAI UR SMILES CHARM , UR ACTIONS HARM .
One organizer said ethnic Chinese had paid for the flight .
President Bush 's special envoy on Tibet , Paula Dobriansky , is due to meet the Dalai Lama next week .
It will be the highest - level meeting with the US administration since the unrest began .
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports that a Chinese envoy in Washington criticized the US for the planned meeting , as it amounted to interfering in China 's " internal affairs . "
A State Department spokesman called for dialogue between Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama .
The Dalai Lama said Sunday that some backdoor discussions were being held between the two sides , but said he was not directly involved , says The New York Times .
His comments came a day after Chinese President Hu Jintao said that dialogue was possible only if the Dalai Lama stops " scheming and instigating violence " and trying to " sabotage " the Olympics .
Since March , anti-Chinese protests rioting and protests across a large swath of ethnic Tibetan areas in western China have tested security forces there .
Paramilitary troops have been at the forefront of the crackdown .
Chinese police recently said that pro-independence Tibetans were planning suicide attacks ahead of the Olympics .
This claim is hotly disputed by exiled Tibetan activists .
The unrest has focused world attention on Beijing 's rule in Tibet and sparked angry protests during recent legs of the Olympic torch relay .
United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon last week joined other world leaders , including British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , in declining to attend the opening ceremony in Beijing on Aug. 8 , a clear snub to Beijing .
Over the weekend , Chinese state media reported that nine Tibetan Buddhist monks were arrested last month for bombing a government building in western China .
State television broadcast footage of a damaged building and said the suspects had confessed but made no mention of casualties , reports Agence France - Presse .
The report is the latest in a series by Chinese media that portrays the unrest as a violent separatist campaign orchestrated by the Dalai Lama and his exiled supporters , and , as The Christian Science Monitor reported , " The vast majority of Chinese citizens , relying on state - run media for news and official views , appear to find no fault with their government 's handling of recent Tibetan unrest , presented as an outbreak of murderous mob violence instigated by separatist plotters abroad . "
Last week , Chinese authorities said they had thwarted a plot by a Muslim minority group to carry out suicide attacks and kidnappings during the Olympics .
The Associated Press reports that a security official revealed that 35 people had been arrested over the alleged plot in Xinjiang , a vast western province where Muslim Uighurs have long bristled under Chinese rule .
But analysts have questioned the veracity of this and other reported terrorist threats involving Uighurs in the run-up to the Olympics .
Nicholas Bequelin , a Xinjiang expert with Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong , said Beijing has undercut its credibility by consistently labeling criminal acts , anti-government violence and peaceful dissent as terrorism .
" The experience around the world since the launch of the global war on terrorism , has taught the international community how easily threats of terrorism can be manipulated by authoritarian governments for their own purposes , " Bequelin said .
The Washington Post says that China has deliberately minimized its deployment of the People 's Liberation Army in putting down unrest in Tibet , preferring to draw on the People 's Armed Police , a growing paramilitary force of around 700,000 .
Analysts say this may reflect Beijing 's belief that the current crisis is less serious than the last major outbreak of antigovernment unrest in 1989 .
The global spotlight ahead of the Olympics may also have played a part in keeping the army in reserve .
The shift in approach by President Hu and his Communist Party lieutenants reflected political sensitivities that still surround memories of 1989 , when public esteem for the Army suffered after it moved against its own people .
The party Propaganda Bureau has worked tirelessly since then to restore the military 's image and portray it as devoted to China 's 1.3 billion inhabitants .
Japan 's Yomiuri Shimbun reports that relatives living in the Dalai Lama 's childhood home are under virtual house arrest as security forces control their access .
The spiritual leader spent several years living in Pingan County before moving to Lhasa , the capital of Tibet .
On the front gate of the house , a government notice warned against " destructive antigovernmental behavior " and forbade the reproduction of the Dalai Lama 's image .
On Feb. 21 , before the uprising took place in Lhasa , there was a clash between monks and police officers in Tongren County in Huangnan , Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture , which is about 150 kilometers [ 100 miles ] south of Pingan County .
When we visited the site of the incident , a young monk expressed anxiety .
" Military officers are coming round and searching our rooms every day .
If they find even a fragment of a Dalai Lama photograph , they will take us away immediately , " he said .
The incident followed a series of " aggressive " provocations by five boats believed to belong to Iran 's elite Revolutionary Guard .
US officials told CNN the boats were " attack craft " which had approached US vessels in international waters on Saturday .
Oil prices rose about 30 cents to more than $ 98 ( £ 50 ) a barrel following the incident , with traders citing increased risk of possible disruptions to oil shipments .
Iran downplayed the incident ; its foreign ministry confirmed the episode but described it as " ordinary " .
An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman , Mohammed Ali Hosseini , suggested the incident was a case of misidentification .
" That is something normal that takes place every now and then for each party , and it is settled after identification of the two parties , " he told the state news agency , IRNA .
The incident was " similar to past ones " that were resolved " once the two sides recognised each other " .
But one US official said the Iranian boats turned away " literally at the very moment that US forces were preparing to open fire " .
" It is the most serious provocation of this sort that we 've seen yet , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" Five small boats were acting in a very aggressive way , charging the ships , dropping boxes in the water in front of the ships and causing our ships to take evasive manoeuvres .
" There were no injuries but there very well could have been . "
The incident occurred at about 5 am local time on Sunday as a US navy cruiser , destroyer and frigate made their way into the Persian Gulf .
The shipping channel separates the Arabian peninsula with Iran and is viewed as a crucial oil supply route .
Officials said the captain of one US vessel was giving the order to shoot when the Iranian ships began turning away .
A radio transmission from one of the Iranian ships said , " I am coming at you .
You will explode in a couple of minutes , " a US official was reported as saying .
After the threatening radio communication , US sailors manned their ships ' guns , it was claimed .
In Tehran , an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman had no immediate comment when asked about the incident .
A White House spokesman , Tony Fratto , said : " We urge the Iranians to refrain from such provocative actions that could lead to a dangerous incident in the future . "
Washington has long been engaged in a standoff with Tehran over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Relations between the two countries soured dramatically when an Iranian civilian airliner was mistakenly shot down by US missiles in 1988 .
All 290 passengers and crew were killed .
This weekend 's incident occurred just days before the US president , George Bush , was due to visit the Middle East .
Only last week , Bush said that one of the aims of his trip on Wednesday was to counter Iran 's ambitions in the region .
In March last year , Iran seized 15 British sailors and marines operating in the Gulf from HMS Cornwall and accused them of trespassing in Iranian territory .
The British personnel were held for almost two weeks before being freed in what the Iran president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , referred to as a " gift " to the British people .
The FBI has failed to pay phone bills on time , causing telecommunication firms to temporarily cut off wiretaps used for terrorism investigations , an audit found .
In a review of the FBI 's handling of special funds used for secret operations , the Justice Department 's inspector general found an archaic payment system that goes through disorganized third - party offices .
A summary of the audit released Thursday noted that a telecommunication specialist pled guilty in June 2006 to stealing more than 25,000 dollars in confidential funds .
The audit found that the employee had taken advantage of the FBI 's mismanagement of bills to steal money from refund checks , as the agency even has trouble cashing refunds from overpaid bills .
The audit concluded that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was particularly bad about paying phone bills by their due date .
" As part of our audit , we analyzed 990 telecommunication surveillance payments made by 5 field divisions and found that over half of these payments were not made on time , " the report said .
" We also found that late payments have resulted in telecommunications carriers actually disconnecting phone lines established to deliver surveillance results to the FBI , resulting in lost evidence including an instance where delivery of intercept information required by a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) order was halted due to untimely payment . "
FBI Assistant Director John Miller played down the impact of the phone interruptions and insisted that the agency would modernize its payment system .
" While in a few instances , late payment of telephone bills resulted in interruptions of monitoring , these interruptions were temporary , and in our assessment , none of those cases were significantly affected , " Miller said .

Today , Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee ( and Thursday on the House side ) to give the intelligence community 's annual global threat analysis .
These hearings are always significant , but the stakes are especially high now because of the recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iran .
Criticism of the NIE 's politicized , policy - oriented " key judgments " has spanned the political spectrum and caused considerable turmoil in Congress .
Few seriously doubt that the NIE gravely damaged the Bush administration 's diplomatic strategy .
With the intelligence community 's credibility and impartiality on the line , Mr. McConnell has an excellent opportunity to correct the NIE 's manifold flaws , and repair some of the damage done to international efforts to stop Iran from obtaining deliverable nuclear weapons .
There are ( at least ) three things he should do :
- Explain how the NIE was distorted , and rewrite it objectively to reflect the status of Iran 's nuclear programs .
The NIE 's first key judgment is " we judge with high confidence that in fall , 2003 , Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program . "
Most of the world , predictably , never got beyond that opinion .
Only inveterate footnote hunters noticed the extraordinary accompanying footnote which redefined Iran 's " nuclear weapons program " to mean only its " nuclear weapon design and weaponization work , " and undeclared uranium conversion and enrichment activities .
Card sharks -- not intelligence professionals -- could be proud of this sleight of hand , which grossly mischaracterizes what Iran actually needs for a weapons program .
The NIE later makes clear that Iran 's nuclear efforts and capabilities are continuing and growing , that many activities are " dual use " ( i.e. , for either civil or military purposes ) , and that Iran 's real intentions are unknown .
Substantively , therefore , the NIE is not far different from the 2005 NIE , but its first sentence gives a radically different impression .
Spotlight On Mars - Image Wanted : Space - Age Dust Removal
If Mars had an on - line Web site for ads , one of them might say something like this : " Wanted : Gentle space - age dust removal system to clean solar cells without leaving grit behind .
Please direct inquiries to NASA . "
NASA 's Spirit rover has accumulated a lot of dust during four years of exploring Mars , especially following last year 's dust storms .
Only about one - third of incoming sunlight is able to penetrate dust on the rover 's solar panels to be converted to electricity .
As a result , Spirit is experiencing the lowest energy levels to date and accumulating a backlog of data waiting to be transmitted to Earth .
The only available cleaning agent would be a timely gust of Martian wind !

The banker view
No doubt nearly all bankers want the broad foundations of the existing banking system to be maintained .
That system is their bread and butter and it has served them well .
All resources that are no longer unappropriated are owned by some person or persons , where ownership means having exclusive control .
Who owns the central bank of the United States , which is the Federal Reserve or the Fed ?
Its stockholders are member banks .
The most powerful of the 12 Federal Reserve banks is the New York Fed .
Its ownership is concentrated among a few large banks such as Citibank and JP Morgan Chase .
The Fed�s incorporation or very existence is a form of capital to it , and that 's due to its being a creature of Congress .
However , Congress makes no appropriations for it and lacks effective day - to - day control .
The Fed�s actions are largely independent of Congressional direction .
The Fed is like a large publically - held corporation in which the effective control is actually in the hands of a very few people , like a CEO who sits before a passive board of directors .
The people who run the Fed or heavily influence those who run it are the owners .
They include the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Fed , which the large New York banks influence .
They include the Secretary of the Treasury .
They include Timothy F. Geithner , who is the President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
It was he who is said to have devised and brought about the financing of JP Morgan Chase with regard to the bailout of the failing investment bank Bear Stearns and Company .
They include the major banks and dealers who have lined up to exchange hundreds of billions of dollars of questionable collateral for the loan of U.S. Treasury securities that the Fed once held .
The leading bankers who own and operate the central bank not only want the system maintained , they want to increase its hold on the rest of the financial system � the remaining capital markets and their institutions .
They want the Federal Reserve System ( the Fed ) to gain new powers .
The subprime crisis is the catalyst for this augmentation in Fed power .
JP Morgan Chase is a key player at the apex of the banking system .
Two of its analysts have made it crystal clear that greater Fed regulation lies ahead .
What they say is so important that I quote the Reuters article at length : " This looks like a recession caused by financial markets , which clearly policy makers are not going to take kindly to ...
There will be a lot of follow - up , " Loeys said .
" This was a run on the securitized world .
The bank regulation and the structure of the supervisory system was created for a banking world of taking deposits and making loans .
That world has moved towards capital markets , which were regulated from the point of view of consumer protection , but not from a systemic stability point of view , " he said .
" Banks did not have the tools to try to protect the capital market from its own excesses . "
As a result , central banks will be forced to take on more power as they are the entities extending support to the markets , Loeys said .
" Central banks ' extension of liquidity to broker - dealers and ( the ) securitized world is permanent , and will be followed by regulatory control , " the analysts wrote .
Notice the heavily bank - oriented ( and slanted ) world - view in these statements .
To paraphrase them , the financial markets caused the recession , not the Fed , and not the banking system .
The capital markets , although regulated for consumer protection , are not regulated enough .
They are subject to excesses .
They threaten the banking system�s stability , so they need to be controlled .
The banks cannot do this , so the Fed must .
The Fed is the good guy .
It �s supporting the system now , and control of brokers and other financial intermediaries doing securitization must follow .
Control follows support .
The banks , including the central bank , have clean hands .
They were passive players in this disaster .
The capital markets were the bad guys .
The good guys will now have greater power over the bad guys .
The good guys will save the system .
The non -banker view Well , maybe the banking system will be saved so that it may continue to profit bankers for another cycle or two .
After all , there is a lot of ruin in a country , and the bankers can do a lot more damage to us .
But if several hundred years of bank - induced panics in this nation alone ( not to mention those around the world ) , at a time when our capital markets were in knee pants , do not show us where the problem is , we are either bankers or we are taking something .
Our current banking system has , from the viewpoint of the general public , three main ills .
The first of these is that it produces economic instability , that is , a boom - bust cycle or expansion and recession ( or depression ) .
The second , which is related to the first , is that it produces a continuing loss in purchasing power of the dollar .
Third is that the banking system provides support to ill - conceived and destructive spending policies of the State .
These three ills retard a normal course of economic expansion and impoverish many persons in our country in a most unjust way .
Four separate elements are responsible for these failings of the banking system .
One is that banks promise that demand deposits will be paid out on demand , but they cannot possibly meet this requirement for all depositors because they lend out the deposits .
Furthermore , their lending results in a multiplied total of further deposits and further loans .
Second is that the money used in these deposits is fiat money , that is , money declared to be money that has no sound backing or perceived intrinsic worth .
Third is that the money in the banking system has been made legal tender by State law .
This means that it must be accepted as a payment medium .
Fourth is that deposits are insured by a State agency , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
We could reform the banking system and eliminate its major ills if we rid ourselves of these four elements .
We could make demand deposits really be ready and available on demand .
We could shift from fiat money to monies that users found acceptable because of their worth or backing .
We could rescind the legal tender laws , and we could terminate the FDIC .
Many other regulations could also be thoroughly and completely eliminated while retaining , clarifying , and strengthening laws against various criminal and tortious behaviors .
The current apparatus known as the Federal Reserve System could be ended , for example .
We have had one or more of these elements of the existing banking system in place almost from the start of the republic .
They are the foundations of the banking system .
Our banking system serves the interests of the bankers and politicians very well .
That is why we see this system in place today with the form it has despite the ills it produces , for these ills only damage the interests of the general public and the general public does not control the banking system .
That is why the bankers will patch up the system if they can .
That is why the Fed may end up with even greater power .
Regulation and appearances
It is an interesting fact that the banking system is heavily regulated .
This regulation provides the appearance that the banks are under public control .
We observe that these regulations are changed from time to time as various banking crises occur .
They are changing again now because of the subprime crisis and they will change more in the months ahead .
Appearances will again be maintained .
The appearance will be given that the politicians or regulators are bringing the bankers to heel .
We will hear about reform ; we have heard that refrain before .
And reform there will be , but it will not correct the system .
It will be reform of certain aspects of the system while leaving that system in place ; and those reforms will be designed to prolong and enlarge the privileged position of the bankers .
Remedies will be applied whose aim is to resuscitate the banks so that they can continue to profit while inflicting untold harm .
The fact is that the system cannot be reformed by any piecemeal regulation or deregulation , because the regulators are part of the system and help keep it alive .
The system relies upon the four elements noted above , and until those are eliminated , the existing system will remain in place .
Maintaining the bank cartel Bank regulation is actually in the interests of the banks , not the public .
The banks are running an operation in which they print fiat money and lend it out .
Their goal is to run that system as long as possible so as to make as much profit as possible for themselves .
The goal of regulation is the survival of this arrangement and the sustenance of the banks � ability to print fiat money and lend it out at interest indefinitely .
If crises occur , the bankers may undergo regulations of various sorts .
These act to control the individual banks so that they do not bring down the system .
If , for example , the banks were to print money without restraint , the system would quickly grind to a halt as hyperinflation proceeded .
Collectively , the banks must have a means to prevent excessive note issue in order to continue their note issuance .
Regulation and central banking achieve that purpose .
There is an optimal rate of inflation so as to hold up bank profits while ensuring the survival of various interests including the government itself .
The State participates in the cartelization and prolongation of the fiat money bank system .
In return , bankers contribute heavily to politicians at all levels of government .
The kinds of regulations that occur , such as deposit insurance , are designed to prop up the system .
The bank cartel has its problems , as all cartels do .
The Basel Accords take country cartels to an international level in order to prevent the banking system of any one country from gaining a competitive edge .
Bank regulation typically controls the risk levels of the assets that banks hold .
If asset risk is not controlled from without , the individual banks have a tendency to ramp up their risk - taking , especially when their deposits are insured .
This endangers the entire system .
Lax regulation in the last few years accompanied higher leverage of banks , risky off - balance sheet entities , loans to hedge funds , investment in risky subprime loans , etc .
Unless the cartel is enforced through regulation of the individual banks , banks have a tendency to make an excessive amount of bad loans .
The end result is systemwide destruction .
In terms of insolvency of the banking system , this has already occurred .
Each day a new bank makes headlines by an announcement that it is raising billions of dollars of new capital .
The Fed�s current rescue operation is buying time so that banks can obtain more capital and liquidate bad loans or ship them off to the Fed in return for Treasury bills .
But its measures are designed not only to save the banking cartel but to bring investment bankers and broker - dealers under its control .
Congress looks ready to cooperate in that endeavor by strengthening not only the Fed but also the SEC .
Conclusion
The best solution to the financial problems brought about by the Fed�s past bubblenomics is analogous to a " big bath " : write the old system off and start up a new one with sound fundamentals .
That means eliminating legal tender laws , doing away with monopoly government fiat money , and making institutions that claim to be depositories for money actually hold that money .
Instead , the U.S. is following its tried and false strategy of bandaging up the banking system at great cost to non-bankers .
If the system survives , there is likely to be a prolonged period of economic underperformance but the Fed will be rewarded for its past bad behavior .
Amazingly enough , the Fed , whose behavior brought about this crisis , looks to be the big winner .
Maybe they did not plan this result , but they certainly knew that they were in the driver�s seat .
Central banking must be destroyed before it totally destroys us .

Microsoft today lifted the lid on 14,000 pages of sketchy versions of tech documentation for core software code .
On show for the first time in public are underlying protocols for Office 2007 , Office SharePoint Server 2007 and Exchange Server 2007 .
This is Microsoft 's latest effort to satisfy anti-trust concerns of the European Union , which is possibly a tougher adversary for the company than Google .
In February , the firm made a surprise announcement in which it agreed to publish and provide free access to application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for its major software products .
At the time Microsoft said it also planned to free up protocols around its client and server software .
Now it has unleashed preliminary tech docs that reveal some of the inner- workings of its code via its Microsoft Developer Network ( MSDN ) website .
This is the first stage of the process .
Microsoft is to release details in three phases .
Between now and June it will garner feedback from the developer community .
Then , at the end of June , Microsoft will publish the final versions of technical documentation – along with definitive patent licensing terms .
The definitions will be crucial to third parties who want to play with Microsoft code .
We shall find out soon enough if Redmond will let them play ball .
Tom Robertson , Microsoft ’s interoperability and standards general manager , says today 's moves are " another step toward putting our interoperability principles into action with the public availability of these protocol specifications " .
It may also help the company head off some anti-trust concerns .
In January European regulators began two formal investigations against Microsoft for alleged market abuse .
One is a response to the complaint filed by the European Committee for Interoperable Systems alleging Redmond had refused to disclose interoperability information on a range of Microsoft products .
The EC is scrutinising several server products and Office Open XML ( OOXML ) on the grounds that the specification does n't work with those of competitors .
Just last week OOXML bagged enough votes to be passed as an international standard , much to the chagrin of open source fanciers around the globe .
The second investigation was sparked by a complaint from the Norwegian web browser company Opera , which alleged that the tying of Internet Explorer to its Windows operating system was anti-competitive . ®

Personal technology enthusiasts yearning for the Mac Experience without the Apple Tax — that huge markup that Mac users pay for off - the - shelf PC hardware with OS X — your days of gnashing teeth may be over .
Psystar , a plucky little company from Miami , Florida is , for the moment , selling OpenMac , a Mac clone with Leopard pre-installed for $ 554 .
You also get :
2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU
250 GB Hard Drive ( 7200 RPM )
2 GB DDR2 667 RAM
Intel GMA 950 integrated graphics
DVD +/-R Optical Drive
4 USB ports
For another $ 110 , you can get an NVIDIA GeForce 8600GT , and for another $ 50 , you can get FireWire too .
Even without that , this price seems a little high compared to other OEM PCs sold by mom and pop .
I guess we could call the overhead the Apple Legal Defense Fund Tax , because the EULA ( PDF ) for Leopard makes the legality of this computer seem dubious .
You agree not to install , use or run the Apple Software on any non-Apple - labeled computer , or to enable others to do so .
Setting aside legalities , the OpenMac supposedly works with Mac - compatible hardware and an EFI emulator .
Psystar claims the " OpenMac is a configuration of PC hardware capable of running unmodified OS X Leopard kernels , " but the company also says this .
Can I run updates on my OpenMac ?
The answer is yes and no .
No because there are some updates that are decidedly non-safe .
Yes because most updates are not non-safe .
It 's best to check on InsanelyMac for this information but when in doubt do n't update it .
You may have to reinstall your OS X if it is a non -safe update .
Well , that 's reassuring .
So much for a Software Update hack , but it does n't really matter .
A cheap , upgradeable alternative to a $ 1999 Mac Pro will never be more than a fantasy among personal technology enthusiasts engaging in endless circular arguments on the Internet .
Anyone who wants to build their own Mac and patch OS X to run on it is pretty much free to do so — notwithstanding software updates that trash your Hackintosh .
Apple does n't care about you .
You can even talk , circumspectly , about your efforts .
But try to take one penny of the dollar a year Steve Jobs makes , and you 'll be thinking different without the metaphorical equivalent of the KY .
Assume the position , Pystar .
Oh , Pirate Bay .
You know just what to do to get people 's attention , you rabble rousers .
In February , The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ; essentially , the international RIAA ) went to court and got Danish ISP Tele2 to block access to the famous BitTorrent tracker .
It now appears that the courts are going to side with The Pirate Bay on this one , and if so , guess what ?
The Pirate Bay is going to sue the music industry for damages .
Gotta love it .

If they 're able to win , they plan to use the money for good , not evil .
We will demand an amount of cash that we feel will be reasonable ( Not counting like Ifpi themselves , we actually understand economy a bit more ) .
With the money ( when / if we get it ) we will start a Danish grant if possible .
The grant will give out money to Danish aspiring artists for making music and releasing it for free .
And all will be sponsored by Ifpi since they tried to fuck those people over .
Poetic justice .

" Those who are inspired by a model other than Nature , a mistress above all masters , are laboring in vain . "
- Leonardo Da Vinci
The field of biomimicry ( also called " biomimetics " and " bionics " ) is a new one that has gathered an increasing amount of attention in recent years , with advocates promoting these types of designs as being efficient ways to harness natural resources and to use them in a sustainable way .
In this post I 'll look at the history of the science ( apparently you can get a degree in it now ) and at a range of examples where it is being applied .
The project is due to go live next year , with 2 prototype units being deployed - the wave power system will be off King Island and the tidal power one off Flinders Island .
Each unit can produce up to 250 kilowatts .
The $ 10.3 million system is half funded by the Australian Government and the electricity generated will be used by Hydro Tasmania .
BioPower CEO
Tim Finnigan says the locations were chosen because Tasmania " offers a world - class wave climate on the west coast and a fantastic tidal environment on the eastern side " .
In my post on ocean energy a few months ago I briefly mentioned a scheme by a small Australian company called BioPower to trial some tidal power and wave power technologies in Bass Strait that used " biomimicry " based design principles .
BioPower
BioPower Systems ' wave power device ( Biowave ) mimics the swaying motion of the sea plants found in the ocean floor .
The system consists of three floating blades which are constantly oscillated by the motion of the sea , generating electricity as they do so .
The flexibility of the blades enables them to deal with heavy seas without breaking , unlike more rigid designs .
BioPower 's tidal power system ( Biostream ) is based on the highly efficient propulsion of " Thunniform " swimming species , such as sharks , tuna , and mackerel .
The device mimics the shape and motion characteristics of these species , as a fixed device in a moving stream of water .

Biomimicry - " Innovation Inspired By Nature "
Biomimicry ( from bios , meaning life , and mimesis , meaning to imitate ) is a relatively new science that studies the designs nature has evolved through millions of years of trial and error and then imitates these to solve problems in a sustainable way .
The term was introduced by science writer ( and Club of Rome member ) Janine Benyus in her 1997 book " Biomimicry : Innovation Inspired by Nature " ( Buckminster Fuller was also a strong advocate of mimicking nature to achieve sustainable systems ) .
The most frequently cited example of biomimicry is Velcro , which was inspired by the way burrs stick to fur - the scratchy side of Velcro acts like a burr , the soft side acts like fur .
Biomimicry is not simply a slavish imitation of nature - instead nature is used as " Model , Measure , and Mentor " .
* Nature as Model means that we can get ideas from organisms to solve our problems .
* Nature as Measure means we can observe nature to see what is possible .
One commonly used example is spider silk , which is stronger than steel and tougher than kevlar , even though the spider " factory " is tiny and uses no boiling sulphuric acid or high - pressure extruders - and whose only material inputs are crickets and flies .
* Nature as Mentor means we should change our relationship with nature , recognizing that we are part of it and that we should treat it as a partner rather than merely a mine to extract resources from .
Biomimicry can be achieved on a number of different levels - the " form or function " level , the process level and the system level .
* Biomimetic forms and functions are the most common - as per the Velcro example above .
* Biomimetic processes are cases where the actual manufacturing of a product is done as nature would do it ( which is frequently very dificult to achieve ) .
* Biomimetic systems are closed - loop lifecycles , where outputs and by - products of one process become inputs for other processes ( in " Cradle to Cradle " terminology it's where " waste equals food " ) .
* A fourth level ( not in Benyus ' book ) that has been suggested by Jeremy Faludi is the design level .
This includes genetic algorithms and iterative design .
Biomimicry on the design level can produce things that are biomimetic on the form / function , process , and system levels , but it can also produce things that nature has never evolved ( such as an oddly shaped satellite antenna ) .
The main obstacle to biomimicry in practice has been that nature builds things in a radically different way to human industry , which use " heat , beat , and treat " methods that physically manipulate materials to achieve the desired form , and often involves industrial chemistry which uses high temperatures and pressures that require large energy inputs .
Instead , nature builds from DNA upwards , assembling a few molecules at a time into larger structures using organic chemistry .
As our understanding of nanotechnology and biotechnology has evolved , it is now becoming possible to try and " grow " products rather than " build " them .
The combination of environmental pollution and resource scarcity may help to encourage businesses to try and use chemical processes that follow nature 's example - in water and at ambient temperature and pressure .
For more background , there was a good story at National Geographic recently .
Biomimicry has also been featured in a number of " TED Talks " - particularly :
* Janine Benyus shares her top 12 designs , from self - assembly to self - smoothing paint .
* Robert Full ( whose work with geckos is explored in the National Geographic story ) shares his obsession with animal feet .
* Sheila Patek looks at some extreme engineering from nature - the superefficient structures that allow shrimp to move at high speed .
* David Gallo looks at some animal abilities that we might someday want ( assuming you could use a little bioluminescence )
More recently Janine Benyus has established a pair of organisations ( the Biomimicry Institue and the Biomimicry Guild ) which aim to promote and commercialise the science .
The biomimicry community has developed the following design principles :
• Waste = Food
• Self - assemble , from the ground up
• Evolve solutions , do n't plan them
• Relentlessly adjust to the here & now
• Cooperate and compete , not just one or the other
• Diversify to fill every niche
• Gather energy and materials efficiently
• Optimize the system rather than maximizing components
• The whole is greater than the sum of its parts -- design for swarm
• Use minimal energy and materials
• " Do n't foul your nest "
• Organize fractally
• Chemical reactions should be in water at normal temperature and pressure
Wind Power : Turbine Blade Tubercles
A Canadian company called Whale Power is designing wind turbines ( and industrial fan blades ) that imitate the form of humpback whale flippers - in particular the " tubercles " that line the leading edge of the fins .
The tubercles dramatically improve the aerodynamic efficiency as they move through the water - with tests showing a 32 per cent lower drag and an 8 per cent improvement in lift compared to the smooth flippers found on other whales .
The angle of attack of a flipper with tubercles could be up to 40 per cent steeper than a smooth flipper before stalling ( ie. encountering a dramatic loss in lift and increase in drag ) - and they stall gradually rather than abruptly .
The company claims that turbines manufactured with this designs should be capable of capturing energy from weaker winds than usual , where conventional turbines tend to stall .
This is expected to improve the business case for individual wind farms and to broaden the range of locations suitable for large - scale wind generation .
Solar Power : Learning From Sea Sponges
Scientists are studying the way sea sponges get simple inorganic materials like silicon ( extracted from the silicic acid in seawater ) to assemble themselves into complex nano - and microstructures , in the hope that one day energy - intensive , capital - intensive semiconductor fabrication facilities used to create solar cells might be replaced by vats of reacting compounds .
One approach being trialled uses zinc - oxide instead of silicon to produce primitive solar cells .
Energy Efficient Buildings : Termite Mounds And Treescrapers
One frequently used example of biomimicry is the Eastgate Centre in Harare , Zimbabwe .
This green building has no conventional air - conditioning or heating , yet stays at a comfortable temperature by imitating the structure of the self - cooling mounds created by termites ( some observers do n't like the people who inhabit buildings being compared to termites , but I still think this is a useful design innovation ) .
William McDonough 's firm is also looking at high rise buildings inspired by nature - in their case by trees - giving rise to the term " treescraper " .
Another biomimicry based development is in the Canary Islands , with a desalination plant using design techniques inspired by Namibian Fog Basking Beetles and the nostrils of camels to capture water .
The architects hope this will show the islands how they can " move towards self - sufficiency in water and energy , without relying on fossil fuels " .
Energy Efficient Fans And Impellers
One shape which appears regularly in the biomimicry world is that of the spiral .
A company which is concentrating on the use of spirals in advanced designs is PAX Scientific ( yet another recipient of investment funds from Vinod Khosla ) , which is designing energy efficient fans , impellers and pumps based on observation of the way fluids flow .
The company was started by a naturalist from the Australian Department of Fisheries and Wildlife named Jay Harman ( one of a number of local practitioners of biomimicry ) .
Harman noticed that the spiral pattern occurs repeatedly in nature when water or air is in motion - in eddies in streams , in waves , in smoke plumes as well as in the shape of Nautilus shells - and was inspired to come up with energy efficient devices based on what he calls the " streamlining principle " .
For example , Pax 's impellers are claimed to be able to circulate 4 million gallons of water through industrial storage tanks while drawing no more electricity than a couple of 100 - watt lightbulbs and their fans ( being developed by a company named PAX Fan which includes Paul Hawken , of " Natural Capitalism " fame ) are expected to use half the energy required by conventional designs .
Another spiral based design I 've noticed recently was this Austrian " Gravitational vortex hydro - power plant " .
These designs remind be of an Austrian scientist ( if that is the right description for him ) named Viktor Schauberger , who is almost deified in some fringe subcultures and was colloquially known as " The Water Wizard " .
There is a lot of strange history behind this guy ( extending back to Keppler and Pythagoras ) which I 've never investigated properly , but he does seem to have been quite influential , one way or the other .
Anti-microbial Surfaces
I mentioned Paul Hawken above - he is also involved in another Australian biomimicry company called BioSignal , which is trying to commercialise seaweed based anti-bacterial treatments .
The company produces synthetic compounds which imitate a seaweed whose " furanones " disable bacteria 's ability to colonise surfaces , with the aim of keeping surfaces clear of bacteria buildup in industrial and hospital environments .
Some other examples of biomimicry under development include :
* " Viral batteries " , which imitate the way red abalone grow their shells to build tiny rechargeable batteries using virus ' .
* Sewage treatment systems that use live plants and microbes which are selected and arranged to imitate a natural ecosystem .
* Fuel efficient cars with very low drag coefficients inspired by the shape of the box fish .
* Self healing aircraft made of composite materials that " bleed " resin " when stressed or damaged , effectively creating a " scab " that fixes the damage " .
* Nanotube based adhesives that mimic gecko feet .
* Shark inspired textures for Speedo swimsuits that mimic the denticles , reducing drag in the water .
* Self cleaning coatings for cars and building surfaces based on the Lotus leaf .
* Photonic crystals for use in optical computing based on the shells of beetles .
* Adaptable polymers that switch between flexible and rigid states , inspired by sea cucumbers .
* DARPA is building cyborg insects for use in surveillance applications .
* Solar lily pads proposed for Glasgow 's Clyde river ( admittedly these seem to be more of artistic value than a cost effective way of generating power ) .
Hopefully you 've found some of these ideas interesting .
I 'll close with 2 final links - one to a series of articles on " Constructal Theory " - the " inverse of biomimicry " , and another to an Edge interview with Kevin Kelly on " The Technium And The Seventh Kingdom Of Life " which mentions his " all species inventory " , amongst other things .

Détente has arrived in the fight between independence - minded states and a federal bureaucracy keen to claim a unanimous victory in its drive to create a de facto national identity database .
New Hampshire Governor John Lynch followed the lead of Montana and secured a reprieve from federal ID - rule punishment , without agreeing to comply with Real ID .

The key ?
The renegade states send a nice letter that is not a request for an extension of a looming deadline but touts the security of their driver 's licenses , which the Department of Homeland Security accepts as an official extension request .
That lets DHS save face , even as it backs down from repeated threats to punish the citizens of rogue states .
On Thursday , New Hampshire became the second of the four holdout states to get an unasked - for extension , following the path blazed by Montana 's feisty Democratic governor Brian Schweitzer last Friday .
Schweitzer told Threat Level he sent DHS " a horse , and if they want to call it a zebra , that 's up to them . "
The legislators in the Live Free or Die state , like those in Montana , banned the state from complying with the Real ID mandates , citing state 's rights , the inequity of unfunded federal mandates , and privacy issues .
Under the rules , almost all license holders will have to return to the DMV with notarized " breeder documents " like birth and marriage certificates , and states will have to interlink their databases of digital photos and personal information .
Citizens of states that opt out can't use their licenses for federal purposes , such as entering airport screening lines or going to a Social Security office .
DHS says the new licenses will prevent terrorism and identity theft , and Secretary Michael Chertoff says it 's one of his top priorities in his last nine months in office .
In a terse February letter , New Hampshire Governor John Lynch , a Democrat , asked that DHS not stop accepting New Hampshire licenses come the May 11 deadline , as DHS had threatened to do to the citizens of any state that did n't agree to eventually comply with Real ID .
If that had happened , New Hampshire residents who did n't have passports would have been frisked at airports and banned from federal buildings .
However , Earl Sweeney , assistant commissioner of New Hampshire 's Department of Safety wrote a new letter
(.pdf ) Thursday .
It highlighted the state 's efforts to include more anti-counterfeiting features in its identification cards and to verify people 's documents and eligibility for a license .
But Sweeney also noted that New Hampshire is " currently prohibited by law from implementing Real ID . "
DHS Undersecretary Stewart Baker promptly responded by interpreting the letter as a request for an extension ( .pdf ) , thereby averting a May 11 showdown .
Now only Maine and South Carolina remain without extensions , but it 's very likely both states will submit similar letters by the April 1
deadline .
That will turn the Real ID map all green , clearing the way for a DHS victory proclamation .
That lets the Bush administration claim credit for implementing
Real ID , even though no states will begin offering Real ID - compliant licenses until at least 2010 , well into someone else 's term at the
White House .
And the states get to claim victory over the federal bullies .
And it leaves time for Congress to step in , if it wishes , to actually hold hearings on identification policy and figure out if a de facto national ID , complete with a national biometric database , is really the right solution to preventing someone from blowing up a mall full of shoppers .

Something to Really Bake Your Noodle
By Brian Proffitt
Managing Editor
First off , I need to extend my apologies for the lack of an Editor 's Note last week .
I could offer up a myriad of reasons why , but it really came down to not enough time and not enough to say .
It happens .
Not so this week ; plenty of time , and plenty of things to say .
Let 's just hope it 's interesting .
While we were all watching the fall out of Red Hat 's announcement and Novell 's CEO 's comments about focusing on the enterprise desktop , meanwhile Canonical undermined their comments with a very solid release of Ubuntu 8.04 LTS ( Hardy Heron ) .
I pulled down the Kubuntu flavor of Heron yesterday , and thus far I like what I have seen .
There will be other reviews , of course , more detailed than I will provide here , and I invite readers to check them out .
For my meager part , everything seems to function well .
I have n't noticed any great leaps in speed or interface changes , though I think the font rendering is much better than I have seen in a while .
One bugaboo : my Gnumeric no longer has a minimize button ( and the panel menu 's Minimize command is disabled ) .
Kind of weird , but manageable , since I use Gnumeric pretty much the entire day to storyboard the LT feed .
One of the things that gets me about upgrading to a new version is the lack of dramatic changes .
As I have written before , everything these days is done in increments .
There are no big leaps anymore , particularly in the interface arena .
Nor , I have come to believe , should there be .
One example : my wife was exposed to Office 2007 at her work the other day and hated it ; she could not find anything she needed , having gotten very used to Office 2003 .
She said she never had that much trouble when she started to use OpenOffice.org at home .
Still , the geek part of me ( everything from my ankles up ) sometimes longs for the heady days when new interfaces came out as a matter of course .
I remember being stunned moving from Windows 286 to Windows 3.0 .
Windows 95 and 98 , I must admit , provided fun times too -- at least from the interface aspect .
Mac OS X was like ambrosia .
GNOME 2.0 and KDE 3.0 gave me similar chills .
Today , though , interface designers are more conservative in their changes , because while drastic changes may please the geekatroids among us , they make casual users very nervous .
Lately , though , I have begun to get that little thrill down my spine when I play with KDE 4 .
It 's an interface that 's pretty and ( bonus ) so fundamentally different than what we have now , it brings a lot of excitement to the table .
The typical fallacy about KDE 4 when people look at it is " oh look , a pretty desktop " and form their opinions based on that .
I admit , I had the same thought .
The Oxygen - themed icons and the widgets are indeed very pleasing eye - candy .
But under the hood , there 's a huge set of differences that could fundamentally change the way Linux developers code .
To make sure I understand these changes , I called up Aaron Seigo , the lead developer of Plasma and asked for a basic rundown of what he and his team are doing .
To emphasize the impact of what the Plasma ( and the KDE team in general ) are trying to accomplish , Seigo started with a bit of history lesson .
In the beginning of the graphical user interface ( GUI ) universe , there was PARC , and it was good .
Wait , too metaphorical , let me try again : in the 1960s and 1970s , when GUI research began , the limitations of the computing environment ( floppy - booted operating systems , highly rudimentary networking , no multi- tasking to speak of ) the file - based interface concept made a lot of sense .
It was a good metaphor and fit quite well with the environment of the time .
Now , decades later , we have personal computers with massive drives , USB devices , peripherals .
So much data is floating around that you simply cannot view or use all your files all at once .
The hardware has grown , but it 's left the GUI behind .
Seigo first got a hint of how things could be different when he was watching graphic designers working at their machines .
They would tend to lump everything together into project - oriented folders , where every file for a given project was placed into a single folder .
The designers would then open the folder , dump all of the contents out to the desktop , and start working .
Once finished , they would move everything back into the folder , close it , and start on the next folder .
This work process started him thinking : what would it look like if you could manage everything -- files and tools -- for a given project as objects ?
Instead of just managing files , you could manage objects instead ?
These objects can be interconnected so that whenever you accessed a file , a web page , or an application , all of the related files and tools would open up , too ?
A personal way of thinking about this for me would be my morning routine .
Instead of separately opening all of the files and apps I use to put LT together , what if I could just visit the LT admin page and have everything -- Gnumeric , gedit , Pidgin , my Gmail page -- just pop open , identities automatically managed ?
That would certainly be handy .
Anyone who uses multi-site book marks in Firefox can get an inkling of what I am talking about .
I can open up my browser now and click a link to open the 16 pages I start looking for news for LT .
Now extend that to the entire desktop and you can get a sense of what Plasma is about .
It 's an object - based way of looking at the information inside these PCs sitting in front of us .
Basically how this works is through the use of scripting languages ( any one you want ) that build apps that run on the interface , not the operating system underneath .
These are n't big monolithic applications either .
The scripting means that you can exchange tools or whole sets of tools within the Plasma interface .
If you like a certain media player 's controls inside of your Konqueror application , it will now be easy to just pull the controls in with just a few lines of code .
Writing to the interface and not the OS leads to another advantage of KDE 4 : apps written to it now no longer care what OS you are using .
I watched the KDE 4 launch event video on YouTube this morning and saw a Mac developer and a Windows developer run the same apps on top of KDE 4 / Mac and KDE 4 / Windows .
The apps ( Marble , Kstar , Konqueror ) ran just like their Linux counterparts -- and not a single line of code was changed in any of these applications to port them .
They were running on Plasma , and were quite happy to do so .
I have touched on this capability before , and have hinted that such functionality could lead to a universal shell that ran on the major operating systems and would allow seamless transitions for users from one OS to another .
Being the Linux advocate , I also hinted that this could be the " gateway " for Windows users to Linux .
A lot of readers came back with " why would anyone average user use Plasma on Windows in the first place ?
And what would be the incentive for Redmond to install it ? "
Fair enough .
But even without such a future outcome , the platform independence would still be huge advantage : non-PC platforms ( tablets , media centers , PDAs , phones ) would now be far more accessible for application developers .
You could write your app for Plasma and see it run anywhere Plasma fits .
Without porting .
Instantly .
In fact , in this year 's Summer of Code at Google , there 's a Plasma project to stabilize Plasma further on the mobile platform .
Closer to home , there 's always been the age old problem of app developers wringing their hands about which distribution to code for .
" Red Hat ?
SUSE ? Ubuntu ?
Mandriva ?
So many choices , " they think , " guess we should just skip it . "
And often they do just that ( completely missing whole point of the Linux Standard Base ) .
When KDE 4 is in place and Plasma is more stable ( likely by KDE 4.1 ) , then such problems would be moot .
Do n't know what distro to code to ?
Then code to Plasma , and it wo n't matter .
The possibilities , it seems , are far - reaching and quite mind - stretching .
It 's a free software project that promises to do the one thing that no other software has been able to do to date : bring us any information anywhere and anytime .
And , hey , it 's pretty too .
The last recipe I posted for French Onion soup was from Cook ’s Illustrated and the soup came out great .
So when I saw that they had an updated recipe , I had to give it a try .
The big change between the recipes was that the updated version calls for caramelizing the onions in the oven rather than on the stove top .
This change lets you get a lot more flavor out of the onions and means you do n’t have to stir the onions every minute .
They call this , “ The Best French Onion Soup , ” and after trying it , I ca n’t argue !
The Best French Onion Soup From : Cook ’s Illustrated Serves 6 Notes :
For the best flavor , make the soup a day or 2 in advance .
Alternatively , the onions can be prepared through step 1 , cooled in the pot , and refrigerated for up to 3 days before proceeding with the recipe .
Ingredients : Soup 3 tablespoons unsalted butter , cut into 3 pieces
6 large yellow onions ( about 4 pounds ) , halved and cut pole to pole into 1/4 - inch - thick slices ( Make sure you get Yellow )
Table salt
2 cups water , plus extra for deglazing
1/2 cup dry sherry
4 cups low - sodium chicken broth ( They recommend Swanson Certified Organic Free Range Chicken Broth )
2 cups beef broth ( They recommend Pacific Beef Broth )
6 sprigs fresh thyme , tied with kitchen twine
1 bay leaf
Ground black pepper Cheese Croutons 1 small baguette , cut into 1/2 - inch slices
8 ounces shredded GruyÃ¨re cheese ( about 2 1/2 cups ) Directions :
For the soup :
Adjust the oven rack to the lower - middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees .
Generously spray the inside of a heavy - bottomed large ( at least 7 - quart ) Dutch oven with a nonstick cooking spray .
Place the butter in the pot and add the onions and 1 teaspoon salt .
Cook , covered , for 1 hour ( the onions will be moist and slightly reduced in volume ) .
Remove the pot from the oven and stir the onions , scraping the bottom and sides of the pot .
Return the pot to the oven with the lid slightly ajar and continue to cook until the onions are very soft and golden brown , 1 1/ 2 to 1 3/ 4 hours longer , stirring the onions and scraping bottom and sides of pot after 1 hour .
Carefully remove pot from oven and place over medium - high heat .
Using oven mitts to handle pot , cook onions , stirring frequently and scraping bottom and sides of pot , until the liquid evaporates and the onions brown , 15 to 20 minutes , reducing the heat to medium if the onions are browning too quickly .
Continue to cook , stirring frequently , until the pot bottom is coated with a dark crust , roughly 6 to 8 minutes , adjusting the heat as necessary .
( Scrape any fond that collects on spoon back into onions . )
Stir in 1/4 cup water , scraping the pot bottom to loosen crust , and cook until water evaporates and pot bottom has formed another dark crust , 6 to 8 minutes .
Repeat process of deglazing 2 or 3 more times , until onions are very dark brown .
Stir in the sherry and cook , stirring frequently , until the sherry evaporates , about 5 minutes .
Stir in the broths , 2 cups of water , thyme , bay leaf , and 1 / 2 teaspoon salt , scraping up any final bits of browned crust on bottom and sides of pot .
Increase heat to high and bring to simmer .
Reduce the heat to low , cover , and simmer for 30 minutes .
Remove and discard herbs , then season with salt and pepper .
For the croutons :
While the soup simmers , arrange the baguette slices in single layer on baking sheet and bake in a 400 - degree oven until the bread is dry , crisp , and golden at edges , about 10 minutes .
Set aside .
To serve : Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler .
Set individual broiler - safe crocks on baking sheet and fill each with about 1 3/4 cups soup .
Top each bowl with 1 or 2 baguette slices ( do not overlap slices ) and sprinkle evenly with GruyÃ¨re .
Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly around edges , 3 to 5 minutes .
Let cool 5 minutes before serving .

Pelosi : Dems ' absolutely ' will continue pursuing contempt after Bush leaves office Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday March 6 , 2008
|
Print This Email This House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats would not abandon their pursuit of contempt of Congress charges against two Bush administration figures after the president leaves office .
Last month the House approved contempt citations for White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and former counsel Harriet Miers .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey refused to refer the citations to a grand jury , so Pelosi said House Democrats plans to move forward with a direct appeal to the courts .
Pelosi was asked if Democrats would keep up the fight assuming a court battle would not be resolved by the time the next president is sworn in in January .
" Absolutely , " Pelsoi said during a conference call with bloggers Thursday .
" This is about the Congress of the United States .
We can't say that it was important when you had a Republican president and not important when you had a Democratic president .
...
We might as well shred the constitution . "
The Speaker did say she " hoped " to reach an agreement with the White House before the end of Bush 's last term .
Pelosi also discussed pending legislation to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which remains stalled in the House .
She criticized the secrecy surrounding the program and the administration 's push for immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated the warrantless surveillance of Americans .
The full picture of President Bush 's pre- and post - 9/11 surveillance expansion may not emerge before he leaves office , she said .
" It may take another administration to go in there and see what they did , " Pelosi said , warning that the push for immunity , which would halt about 40 ongoing court cases , could hide illegal actions by administration officials or the companies .
" If their instructions were beyond the constitution , I think that 's what their concern was about , " she said .
Although Pelsoi opposes telecom immunity , speculation is mounting that the House bill ultimately will include an immunity provision similar to the Senate 's FISA measure .
Bush has threatened to veto any bill that does not include immunity .
During the call , Pelsoi seemed to indicate that an " exclusivity " provision , which would ensure that FISA is the sole means to collect foreign intelligence on Americans , is " the issue . "
The Speaker said Bush ignored FISA law enacting his warrantless wiretapping program , and she said any FISA update must prevent him from doing so again .
Otherwise , Pelosi said , Bush could continue to say , " ' Crown me king , I do n't have to obey the law to collect intelligence and invade the privacy of the American people . ' "
Pelosi stressed that the House 's failure to renew a stopgap FISA fix has not imperiled US intelligence collection , and she accused House Republicans and their conservative allies of turning the FISA fight into a political bludgeon with negative television ads running in Democratic districts .
" Their fear mongering is their way of life , " she said , " and now they 're politicizing the FISA law .
...
It shows how frivolous they are . "
A Japanese teenager has committed suicide by mixing common household cleaners , releasing fumes that made dozens of people sick , officials said .
About 100 people in Konan City , in western Japan , fled their homes after smelling the toxic hydrogen sulphide the 14 - year - old girl had made .
There has been a spate of similar suicides since details of the technique were posted on the internet .
Japan has one of the developed world 's highest suicide rates .
At least 30,000 people have killed themselves every year since 1998 , according to national statistics .
Toxic chemical
The unidentified girl in Konan City left a note on the bathroom door of her family 's flat saying " poison gas being produced " , Japanese media said .
About 90 neighbours went to hospital feeling ill , including the girl 's mother , who was out of the flat during the suicide but later returned .
Most people complained of sore throats but none was severely ill , officials said .
Police said the teenager mixed detergent with a liquid cleanser to make hydrogen sulphide .
The gas is colourless but smells like rotten eggs and is highly toxic , leading to suffocation or brain damage .
In small doses , it leaves people with sore throats , nausea and irritated eyes .
Japanese authorities have set a goal of cutting the country 's high suicide rate , through counselling programmes and blocking websites that offer suicide tips .
Everyone knows the U.S. Army is overstretched by the simultaneous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The dirty little secret is that nobody knows how much longer it can keep it up before its fighting capability declines .
A year ?
Probably , with lowered recruiting standards and big bonuses .
Three years ?
No one in Washington will answer that question .
But recent indicators are making some tough generals queasy .
First , the good news .
The Marine Corps and the Air Force are doing fine .
They continue to attract capable young people , and they ’re managing to retain their top officer talent .
And all of the services , including the Army , met or exceeded their recruitment goals for February , no small feat given the near certainty that those who enlist now will soon be sent to Iraq .
But a closer look shows just how far the Army has had to lower its standards to keep itself in soldiers .
The following “ metrics ” -- data the military collects to assess its strength -- were compiled from open sources by the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .
In 2006 , the percentage of Army recruits who were high school graduates ( 82 % ) was the lowest since 1981 , and their scores on the military ’s aptitude test were the worst since 1985 .
The number of “ moral waivers ” issued to those with criminal records more than tripled since 1996 , to 8,500 in 2006 .
Worse , the number of recruits with felony convictions was up 30 % in 2006 compared with 2005 .
And the Army apparently stooped to social promotion : 94 % of recruits graduated from basic training in 2006 , compared with 82 % in 2005 .

Keeping the all - volunteer Army at full strength in wartime has n’t been cheap , either .
The cost per troop soared to $ 120,000 in 2006 from $ 75,000 in 2001 .
And to keep reenlistments up , the Army had to pay retention bonuses of $ 735 million in 2006 , up more than eightfold from the $ 85 million paid in 2003 .
Even so , officer shortages are a problem , and at the rank of https://https:\ www.tinyurl.com/369jse " > www.tinyurl.com/369jse , the backbone of the command structure , the Army is at 60 % strength in Iraq .
Moreover , for the last year it has n’t had the 3,200 troops needed to fill a brigade designated as militarily “ required ” for Afghanistan .
Senior officers who remember when the Army did break during the Vietnam War say they ’re amazed by how brilliantly the volunteer force is performing , despite stop - loss orders and brutal schedules of up to 15 months ’ deployment and just one year home before another tour .
The Army believes that soldiers should deploy no more than one year in three , to keep stress on family life manageable .
The fear is that if the stress becomes too much -- as measured by soldiers going AWOL , refusing orders or declining en masse to reenlist -- it will be too late to rescue morale .
This is relevant now because the presidential candidates are making campaign - trail promises they may not be able to keep .
Republican John McCain , judging the risk to U.S. national security of Iraq unraveling to be far greater than that of the Army unraveling , has said he would keep troops in Iraq for 100 years if necessary .
But will there be enough volunteers in the sixth year of the Iraq war ?
If not , would he contemplate the political anathema of a draft ?
Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton think breaking the Army is riskier than withdrawing from Iraq , and Obama also promises to increase the number of troops in Afghanistan -- a position advocated by this page .
But if the situation in Afghanistan deteriorates -- and there are signs that it could -- where would we get the manpower to “ surge ” there ?
On the campaign trail , it ’s bad politics to admit that there are limits to U.S. power .
But failure to warn voters that the looming military manpower shortage may limit our foreign policy options could well come back to haunt the next commander in chief .
WASHINGTON — Grim talk of terrorism is again making headlines .
First came the announcement that the United States will try the masterminds of the 9/11 plot , through military commissions — contemporary kangaroo courts .
Now comes Senate approval of a vast surveillance bill that gives sanction to the warrantless snooping on Americans that President Bush carried out secretly until the program was exposed in the press .
And by the way , the House ’s refusal to go along with giving immunity to telecommunications companies who were complicit in the spying puts the nation ’s security at risk , the White House warns .
These set pieces of political discourse in the Bush era inevitably lead to the conclusion that we remain imperiled by terrorism .
On this point , there is an undeniable and ugly truth behind the raw rhetoric .
But there is also truth in cold , hard numbers — and in them , the White House tells an altogether different tale .
Homeland security funding — for states to try to prevent or prepare for such a disaster , for firefighters who would have to respond , for radios that would actually allow emergency personnel to communicate with one another during a catastrophe , for rail and mass transit security , for inspections and security at ports — all are stepchildren in the latest White House budget .
Grants to states and local governments for homeland security and first responders were cut by half from current funding levels , according to an analysis by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
Meanwhile , financing for a special urban security program that is intended to replace pork - barrel jockeying among states , with funds better targeted to those cities — New York , Los Angeles and Washington — known to be at greatest risk of attack , is held just about flat .
A project meant to help detect a nuclear or radiological device in densely populated cities — was cut by 25 percent , according to Sen .
Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y .
Another to train emergency workers to handle an attack involving weapons of mass destruction also was pared .
“ The threat to our cities and towns from terrorist attacks and natural disasters has not diminished , and the federal government ’s contribution to protecting states and localities should not diminish either , ” says Sen.
Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , who chairs the homeland security panel .
Seven years into the “ war on terror , ” with conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq still fought in its name , there should be legitimate anger about why , as Lieberman correctly notes , the terrorist threat has “ not diminished . ”
But if this is so — and the administration most definitely agrees — then what plausible reason is there for cutting prevention and preparedness funding , and eliminating some programs altogether ?
Since New York City and the Pentagon were struck on 9/11 , homeland security funding has become a crude political game .
The administration started from the premise that no new money was needed to meet the demand for extraordinary services that only government — state , local or federal — can provide .
To admit otherwise would jeopardize the continuation of the Bush tax cuts , and cut the heart of the conservative argument that almost no government function is a valid one .
Congress soon produced a farce , divvying up pots of anti-terrorism money like so many highway projects to the point where a few years ago , Wyoming was getting more funds per capita than was New York .
Some , but not all , of these shenanigans ceased when the White House and lawmakers agreed that urban areas facing the greatest risk should get more , and a separate program was set up for them .
Now a new shell game :
The White House repeatedly cuts or eliminates homeland security grants , knowing Congress usually restores the money .
“ I ’m sure you ’ll find no shortage of politicians on the Hill or in state and local governments who will advocate more spending , ” says Russ Knocke , spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security .
“ Ultimately there is a limited amount available . ”
But there is a limit to patience , too .
And a limit to the number of years we have to prepare before what we are told is the inevitable next attack .
Homeland security budget fights should n’t have the tone of low comedy .
But they do , and somewhere , maybe a terrorist is chuckling .

Sookee had to spend the night at the vets in Dundee A cat who was rescued from a blazing house was resuscitated by firefighters using a child 's oxygen mask .
Officers pulled the unconscious black cat named Sookee from the fire in Baluniefield Road , Dundee , after it had been overcome by smoke .
They fitted the oxygen mask over the elderly animal 's face and it quickly regained consciousness .
Another two cats and a dog were safely removed from the burning house on Sunday afternoon .
The fire started when an electrical fault caused a blender to burst into flames .
Joan Docherty , who owns Sookee and the other animals , said : " We were n't in .
The cats could n't get out because the cat flap is in the kitchen and they could n't get past .
" The wee boys across the road were saying that the cats were clawing at the windows trying to get out and the dog was throwing herself at the door .
" He [ Sookee ] has a heart murmur .
He was unconscious , so they took him outside and they revived him with the children 's oxygen mask .
" He 's doing alright .
We 've got to pick him up from the vets .
They 're going to give him a bath as well but he seemed to be okay . "
Neil McKay , from Tayside Fire and Rescue , told the BBC Scotland news website that when they arrived at the home , smoke was coming out all of the windows .
Eventually the cat turned round and was sick , and got rid of a lot of soot and stuff it had breathed in during the incident

Tayside Fire and Rescue
" As the crews pulled up they could see a cat trying to climb the blinds in the front room window and trying to get out of the window , " he said .
" But after a couple of attempts the cat was overcome and passed out .
" Crews applied the oxygen mask to the cat 's head and started stroking it .
It did n't work for a considerable time .
" Then they charged a second oxygen bottle and kept trying .
Eventually the cat turned round and was sick , and got rid of a lot of soot and stuff it had breathed in during the incident . "
Sookee , 16 , spent the night at the vet , where he was given more oxygen and steroid injections .
Eve Ireland , from Parkside Veterinary Group , said : " Today he 's a much brighter and happier cat - eating , drinking , and the plan is to give him a bath , because he 's full of soot . "

Record 60,000 frosh admitted to UC campuses university of california
The University of California offered admission to the most freshmen ever , sending out more than 60,000 acceptance letters for fall 2008 even as it faces budget cuts from reduced state funding , officials announced Monday .
Even though not every hopeful got his or her choice of school , overall 3 out of every 4 applicants were offered admission to one of the system 's nine undergraduate campuses .
Compared with fall 2007 , UC accepted 4.7 percent more students and will fulfill the university 's promise of offering admission to all eligible high school seniors .
Each year , UC releases numbers based on admission information collected as of March 31 for California resident students .
The data does not include admissions offered after that date .
For example , the data does not include 8,450 applicants who were rejected by their campuses of choice but were subsequently offered admission to UC Merced and UC Riverside , two schools with room to spare .
UC received a record number of applications - 79,661 - because of a peak in the number of Baby Boomers ' children graduating from high school and because a greater number of students are becoming UC eligible , officials said .
Even as the system accepted more students than ever , many individual campuses became more selective - posting higher overall grade point averages and test scores .
All students have until May 1 to decide whether or not to accept UC 's admissions offer .
The system would be in big trouble if everyone said yes , especially with budget cuts looming .
Last year 52.7 percent of those admitted said they planned to enroll .
" Campuses have gone to great lengths to select an applicant pool that will result in the desired number of students they have space for , " said Susan Wilbur , director of undergraduate admissions .
" The budget situation is very serious for us , and we are very concerned about the possibility of overenrollment . "
According to numbers released by the UC Office of the President , UC 's flagship campus in Berkeley offered admission to 8,615 high school seniors for the 2008 - 09 school year including a set of quadruplets , someone who wrote a symphony during high school , a champion in youth division sailing and an international Irish dance competition winner .
Its admissions rate fell to 22.5 percent , making it the second most selective UC campus , after UCLA , which had a 22.1 percent admissions rate .
The average total SAT I score for Cal 's admitted class is 2014 out of 2400 , up from 2009 the year before .
Cal 's average GPA grew to 4.18 - up from 4.17 the year before .
For the second year in a row , some applicants to UC Berkeley , UC Irvine , UCLA and UC San Diego will receive offers to participate in UC Merced 's " Shared Experience " program .
Students can begin their education at the Merced campus but have the option of transferring to another UC campus in their junior year .
Systemwide , 39 percent of applicants would be first - generation college students and 36.8 percent come from a low - income family , defined as one earning less than $ 43,000 a year .
Roughly 8 percent were from rural California , 39 percent from urban areas and nearly 53 percent from the suburbs .

Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) and the Joint Quantum Institute ( NIST / University of Maryland ) have developed a new method for creating pairs of entangled photons , particles of light whose properties are interlinked in a very unusual way dictated by the rules of quantum physics .
The researchers used the photons to test fundamental concepts in quantum theory .
In the experiment , the researchers send a pulse of light into both ends of a twisted loop of optical fiber .
Pairs of photons of the same color traveling in either direction will , every so often , interact in a process known as " four - wave mixing , " converting into two new , entangled photons , one that is redder and the other that is bluer than the originals .
Although the fiber 's twist means that pairs emerging from one end are vertically polarized ( having electric fields that vibrate up and down ) while pairs from the other end are horizontally polarized ( vibrating side to side ) , the setup makes it impossible to determine which path the newly created photon pairs took .
Since the paths are indistinguishable , the weird rules of quantum physics say that the photon pairs actually will be in both states -- horizontal and vertical polarization -- at the same time .
Until someone measures one , at which time both photons must chose one specific , and identical , state .
This " spooky action at a distance " is what caused Einstein to consider quantum mechanics to be incomplete , prompting debate for the past 73 years over the concepts of " locality " and " realism . "
Decades of experiments have demonstrated that measurements on pairs of entangled particles do n't agree with the predictions made by " local realism , " the concept that processes occurring at one place have no immediate effect on processes at another place ( locality ) and that the particles have definite , preexisting properties ( called " hidden variables " ) even without being measured ( realism ) .
Experiments so far have ruled out locality and realism as a combination .
But could a theory assuming only one of them be correct " Nonlocal hidden variables ( NLHV ) theories would allow for the possibility of hidden variables but would concede nonlocality , the idea that a measurement on a particle at one location may have an immediate effect on a particle at a separate location .
Measuring the polarizations of the pairs of entangled particles in their setup , the researchers showed that the results did not agree with the predictions of certain NLHV theories but did agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics .
In this way , they were able to rule out certain NLHV theories .
Their results agree with other groups that have performed similar experiments .

I think Russia has it right .
Yes that 's what I said .
Energy should be a government monopoly , using that instead of income taxes to run things .
The large projects that will be required to convert our world economy to energy sources other than fossil fuels will require huge investments .
Rather than take this money out of private capital flows , causing a downturn in the world economy as other private enterprises compete for that capital , governments can finance billion dollar projects with deficit spending , effectively turning these projects into a long term stimulus package that does n't just cause price inflation .
The money those projects spend building , goes into the economy , and the power generation byproduct stimulates further economic growth in the future .
Like the Hoover Dam did with the CCC .
If large nuclear / wind / tidal / geothermal sources are produced this way , then the profit going to government increases directly with economic production , as all production requires energy .
Excess energy production could be used for materials recycling , and desalination plants , which will likely be needed as the population of the Earth continues to grow .
People running for office are arguing about who is going to pay for the next social services project , when the solution is staring them right in the face .
Politicians are not bred to think this way , but someone needs to .
We have to start thinking 20 , 50 , 100 years down the road , and no one is taking that job seriously .
Huge security alert over BT broadband
Hundreds of thousands of BT broadband customers are at risk of massive breaches of their computer security because of a flaw in the Home Hub wireless network systems installed by the telecoms giant .
Eve a ' teenage script kiddie ' could breach system
BT has 4.4 m broadband customers and it is believed most of those supplied with wi-fi boxes are vulnerable to hacking .
Only the latest versions of the BT system are safe from attack .
And though BT has been aware of the problem for months , it has not written to customers to warn them of the risk and the simple fix .
Computer experts last week demonstrated to Financial Mail how easy it was for a hacker to use a free computer program to join a household network without being told the password .
It took five minutes for the program to probe the wi-fi hub and gain access .
From there , more skilled computer criminals could access and seize vital personal data from individual computers .
BT said : ' We are aware of this problem , though we do n't believe that any customers have been affected .
It 's important to realise that , though it has been possible to demonstrate a scenario where the hub may be vulnerable , we do n't believe it is something that should affect the majority of BT customers . '
Experts from IT security consultancy NCC Group , one of only three UK firms to have a top level accreditation to work with the GCHQ communications centre , said that computer experts had been discussing the weakness for months .
Paul Vlissidis , NCC 's technical director and principal consultant Lloyd Brough , said even a ' teenage script kiddie ' - the internet equivalent of a phone box vandal - could penetrate Home Hubs .
Doing so without permission from the owner of a network would be strictly illegal and people have already been jailed for breaking into wi-fi networks .
Vlissidis , who legitimately hacks into computer systems as a ' penetration tester ' , said : ' In the jargon of the hackers , this is a simple exploit .
' Once in , a skilled hacker has the opportunity to take total control over systems , including planting software to steal passwords to bank accounts or capturing credit card details . '
Brough added : ' I am sure there are people driving round the suburbs with laptops trying to do this today . '
The problem with BT 's system is a fault with the password supplied to ' secure ' the wi-fi network .
Hackers have only to try a few permutations , rather than the desirable billions , to gain access .
BT said that even if hackers gained access to wi-fi , it was a ' theoretical ' attack .
The company strenuously denied bank details could ever be at risk as a result of such an attack .
' There are far more important risks on the internet , ' a spokesman said .
Vlissidis and Brough said this attack could be done on a laptop computer or even a smart phone well away from the targeted system .
' This is not theoretical , it is entirely practicable , ' said Vlissidis .

Mark Penn will continue as a pollster and adviser for Mrs Clinton
The chief strategist for Hillary Clinton 's campaign to become the Democratic Party 's candidate for the US presidency has resigned .
Mark Penn stepped down after a row over a potential conflict of interest involving his public relations firm .
Mr Penn 's company had been employed by the Colombian government to help it pursue a free - trade agreement with the US - a deal Senator Clinton opposes .
She is competing against Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination .
They have been fighting a close battle in the continuing state primary election campaign .
The latest count of pledged delegates to the party 's national convention in August , according to Associated Press , puts Mr Obama at 1,634 and Mrs Clinton at 1,500 .
A total of 2,024 delegates is needed to win the Democratic nomination .
Union opposition
In a statement , Mrs Clinton 's campaign manager , Maggie Williams , said Mr Penn had stepped down after it was disclosed he had met Colombian officials seeking his help to push the Colombia Free Trade Agreement through Congress .
The meeting was an error in judgment that will not be repeated and I am sorry for it
Mark Penn
" After the events of the last few days , Mark Penn has asked to give up his role as chief strategist of the Clinton campaign , " she said .
She said he would " continue to provide polling and advice to the campaign " .
Mrs Clinton 's communications director , Howard Wolfson , and pollster Geoff Garin will take over co-ordinating her " strategic message team " , Mrs Williams added .
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Mr Penn had met the Colombian ambassador to the US on 31 March in his capacity as chief executive of the public relations firm , Burson - Marsteller , to promote US approval of the trade accord .
Mr Penn later issued a statement apologising for attending the meeting , calling it an " error of judgement that will not be repeated " .
His words were not , however , well received by the Colombian government , which said it considered the " declaration a lack of respect towards Colombians , which is unacceptable " and reportedly fired the PR company .
The deal is opposed by unions , whose support is essential for Mrs Clinton The US government completed the Colombia Free Trade Agreement in 2006 and is seeking approval in Congress .
The pact would eliminate tariffs on flowers , corn , machinery , meat and other products and also set rules for investment .
A BBC correspondent in Washington says the free trade deal is opposed by US trade union leaders , whose support is essential for Mrs Clinton .
Mr Penn is not the first senior Clinton adviser to have resigned in recent months .
Geraldine Ferraro stepped down from an honorary role on Mrs Clinton 's finance committee three weeks ago after she said Mr Obama would not be where he was in the race for the White House if he were not black .
Patti Solis
Doyle quit as her chief of staff in February .

What are these ?
America , the world 's beacon of democracy - that shiny righteous city on the hill - has always claimed moral superiority to the war criminals of the past .
America got this title because of two claims : we do n't torture people and we give everyone the right of Habeas Corpus .
Well , toss # 1 out the window .
We do torture people .
Of course , the CIA claims they only water boarded people when the country was in total chaos and everyone was absolutely terrified of another 9/11 .
Skeptics might say that 's exactly when the CIA should have shown the MOST restraint - when the American citizenry was in a state of shock and needed to be calmed rather than prodded - but then that would hardly follow the government 's systematic pattern of exploitation and fear - mongering .
So because we torture people , all confessions ( of any kind ) are immediately called into question , even the confession of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the former senior aide to Osama bin Laden , who has said he was the principal planner of the plot and who is one of the Gitmo Six .
No video tapes of his interrogation were ever shown to the public , so we have no idea if he was forced into giving false information through torture .
The CIA were desperate to find someone - anyone - on which to pin the blame for 9/11 .
Perhaps in their desperate quest , they overzealously interrogated terrified men , who in turn regurgitated false confessions in hopes of calming their crazed captors .
And # 2 ( the right of Habeas Corpus ) flew out the window , too .
The government can lock you up , and they do n't need to tell you why , or even present evidence to a court .
Just ask the six men awaiting their " trial " in Guantanamo .
These guys are n't going to get a fair trial , and some people might say that 's a good thing .
After all , why should we give terrorists a fair trial ?
Well , the question has a two - fold answer .
First , they could be innocent .
Yes , it 's true : sometimes our government has the wrong people arrested .
Second , we gave NAZIS fair trials at Nuremberg .
We even found a lot of defendants not guilty !
In the Nuremberg opening proceedings alone , three men were found not guilty .
The men got a second chance at freedom because they were able to speak in their defense and present evidence in court : two bedrocks of American democracy .
In other words , men accused of Nazi war crimes had more rights than the Gitmo Six .
Still , even without the right of Habeas Corpus , even without the right of a fair trial , maybe ... maybe ... these guys can catch a lucky break .
Not according to Colonel Morris Davis , a former prosecutor for the military commissions overseeing all the prosecutions at Gitmo .
The Nation magazine reveals that when Davis spoke with Pentagon General Counsel William Haynes , who now oversees the prosecutions and the defense for the tribunal process , about the possibility of acquittals , Haynes nearly had a heart attack .
" ( At the ) Nuremberg trials there were some acquittals , and if there are some acquittals in our situation here , at least that will lend some legitimacy to the process , " Davis told Haynes .
That 's when , according to Davis , Haynes 's eyes grew to the size of saucers .
" We can't have acquittals , " Haynes said , " How can we explain holding these people for so long ? " and he added , " We have to have convictions . "
Even Nazis caught a better break than the Gitmo Six .
These guys are going to get railroaded , and potentially executed , on - site .
And yet some individuals still claim the Gitmo Six will receive a fair trial , despite the practices of secret evidence and torture .
Pentagon legal adviser Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann claims the defendants will have the right to remain silent so as to not incriminate themselves .
But Vincent Warren , executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights told Democracy Now that Hartmann 's claims are weak .
" He said that these detainees were going to have was a right to remain silent at trial .
What that means is , they did n't have the right to remain silent when the government was torturing them and interrogating them and abusing them , ( but ) they can sit idly by during this commissions process and listen to the stream of evidence that was brought in against them through torture , and they have a right not to say anything about it , and it is an illusory right .
Military officials have said that even if these men are found not guilty , the government has no intention of letting them go .
So the absolute best they can do is to remain in jail for the rest of your life illegally .
And , of course , the worst you can do is to be executed .
These are sham show trials , and there is nothing about this that comports with due process . "
One can practically hear the Gitmo Six pining :
If only we were Nazis .
The trials at Nuremberg were a proud moment for America .
We got to show the world that we gave even our enemies a chance to defend themselves .
We let the worst of the worst - individuals accused of genocide - present evidence in their defense .
For a brief moment in history , America truly was a merciful giant , one capable of compassion and immeasurable kindness and decency .
However , if the Gitmo Six are subjected to these secret , illegal trials , and then are murdered in a United States military prison , we have become what we have so long claimed to loathe : immoral tyrants .

Trackbacks Taiwan Presidential Election : Results and Process .
1 . Election Results .
The Nationalist Party ( Kuomintang , KMT ) presidential candidate Ma Ying - Jeou won a landslide victory today , defeating the Democratic Progressive Party candidate Frank Hsieh by 17 % ( 58.5 % to 41.5 % ) .
Ma won about 7.6 million votes , compared to 5.4 million for Hsieh .
The results exceed even the election - eve expectations of the KMT , which was hoping that its internal polls showing a victory margin of about 11 - 13 % would hold up .
Compared to the 2004 election ( in which the DPP 's margin of victory was only 0.22 % ) , the KMT improved its performance in every Taiwan county by 7 - 10 % , and won 20 of the 25 counties .
( The only county where the KMT did not improve dramatically was Kinmen County , which consists of some small islands very near to China ; a large percentage of the population of Kinmen County is military and their families , and the military has historically favored the KMT .
The KMT got about 95 % in Kinmen in both 2008 and 2008 . )
The only counties with the DPP won were a cluster in southwest Taiwan , the party 's heartland .
The KMT and DPP positions on domestic policy were not greatly different , but the DPP nevertheless suffered from voter unrest about lower economic growth rates in recent years , in comparison to the rapid economic growth of not long ago .
The parties have significant differences on international relations , particularly on how to deal with China , but both Ma and Hsieh are moderates within their parties .
For further analysis of the policy implications of the election results , tune in next to a webcast of a TV program in which I interviewed a pair of Taiwanese political scientists .
( Details later . )
The DPP also performed very poorly in the January elections for the legislature ( Legislative Yuan ) , in part because a group of 11 DPP incumbents were defeated in primaries by hard - liners who could not carry swing districts .
Nevertheless , because Hsieh is a moderate , there is a significant possibility that DPP 's remaining moderates may be driven from leadership roles .
President - elect Ma will take office on May 20 .
A pair of initiatives were also on the ballot , regarding Taiwan 's membership in the UN .
A DPP referendum asked if Taiwan should apply to join the UN under the name of " Taiwan . "
A KMT counter - initiative asked if Taiwan should apply to " rejoin " the UN under the name of " Republic of China " or " any other convenient name . "
Both initiatives received an overwhelming majority of votes cast , but neither passed , because the law states that no initiative will be valid unless 50 % of eligible voters ( not actual voters ) vote on the initiative .
2. Election Process .
The voting and vote - counting were a model of integrity , transparency , and efficiency .
I observed voting at three north - central Taipei precincts : at St. John Bosco Catholic Church , and at a pair of precincts voting at National Taipei University .
Throughout Taiwan , voting was by paper ballot , with marked ballots placed into sealed ballot boxes .
Photography during the voting process is forbidden , but is allowed while the ballot are being counted .
When the ballot box is opened , and vote - counting begins , each ballot is held up one - by - one , and the vote is announced .
The vote - counting is open to the public , and is observed by party representatives , as well as other interested citizens .
Each vote is recorded on a tally sheet which is also visible .
Each small box on the tally sheet holds a total of five votes , which are recorded one at time with hashmarks .
The completed five - strokes of the hashmark form a Mandarin character which means " correct " or " upright . "
After the last ballot is tallied , the empty ballot box is displayed for all to see .
The results are transmitted to a district election office , and then the district results are sent to the Central Election Commission , where results are displayed as fast as they are recorded .
The Central Election Commission 's work ( which was conducted in an auditorium at the National Police Academy ) is open for everyone to watch , with the data processors located at the front of the room .
Between the time when we left our precinct after the votes were counted , and when we arrived at the Central Election Commission , about half an hour had elapsed .
By then , the CEC was already displaying over half of the votes cast nationwide .
In a typical American general election , which may have dozens of races and issue votes , it would be very difficult to achieve such speedy results with hand - counting .
Even so , the transparency of the Taiwan process inspires confidence and helps assure legitimacy .
As in any election , there are plenty of people who are disappointed with the result , and no one should minimize the difficulty of the challenge that President Ma will face in ensuring that when he leaves office in 2012 or 2016 , Taiwan 's freedom and sovereignty have not been eroded by its aggressive neighbor .
But for now , all the people of Taiwan should be proud of their beautiful island of freedom , and their successful exercise of the inherent right of the sovereign people to chose their government .

A HELPING PAW FOR PET OWNERS A HELPING PAW FOR PET OWNERS
Pet owners in financial trouble should check with local shelters or rescue groups for information about temporary assistance ( some can provide food for the short term or provide lists of lower - cost vet care , for example ) .
Also , the HSUS has a broad range of information on its website , including how to market yourself to a rental property manager if you 're a pet owner , how to save money on pet care , and links to pet - friendly apartments .
Go to hsus.org and type " foreclosure pets " into the search function .
Enlarge By David Paul Morris , Getty Images Lola , a shorthair , is one of the many cats and dogs either abandoned or surrendered to animal shelters in Sacramento in the wake of mounting home foreclosures .
They 're arriving by the thousands every month , homeless , hapless victims of foreclosure .
Family pets , their lives upended by the ravaged finances of their owners , are landing in animal shelters in large numbers in some parts of the country .
FAMILY IMPACT : Foreclosures ' financial strains take toll on kids PET TALES :
The truth about cats and dogs ( or at least some interesting news ! )
The precise numbers are unknown , because there is no nationwide standard for recording foreclosure pets and because many owners who surrender animals at shelters tell personnel only that they are " moving " and give no specifics .
But shelters that are experiencing an increase in pet intakes are almost without exception in areas where the foreclosure rate is high .
Now there 's growing concern that another , perhaps bigger wave of pet surrenders is in the offing , the result of the worsening economy and growing joblessness that will affect additional homeowners as well as renters .
" The fate of people 's pets tracks with their own financial fate , " says the ASPCA 's Steve Zawistowski .
He adds that although some shelters have been largely unaffected , " there are pockets " where so many homeowners are losing their homes that the number of pets relinquished to shelters , turned loose or abandoned is increasing dramatically .
The pockets probably will spread with a deteriorating economy , he says .
The situation is sufficiently worrisome that the Humane Society of the United States ( HSUS ) just created a $ 15,000 seed - money fund ( and is seeking public contributions to it ) to help shelters and rescue groups accommodate in the short term their local surge in homeless pets .
And many shelters in hard - hit areas are devising programs to respond .
Among them : • The Sacramento SPCA , which took in 100 more dogs and cats for " moving " reasons ( 176 ) in the past four months of 2007 as in the same period in 2006 , has developed an early - assistance program to help people find ways to keep their pets or make temporary - care arrangements before they reach the out - of - options stage , says director Rick Johnson .
" We 'll visit with the animals and we can meet with prospective landlords " when it appears , for example , that additional discussion might help a family keep the pet in new quarters .
And , he says , the staff is willing to take whatever time it takes to discuss with owners the possibilities for keeping their animals .

The Pennsylvania SPCA is waiving for foreclosure victims the fees associated with its " good - home guarantee " program , which promises the shelter will keep the pet as long as it takes to find a new home .
" With everything else they 're going through , ( people who foreclose ) should not have to worry that their animal will be euthanized , " CEO Howard Nelson says .
At least 10 families have taken advantage of the program in less than three months .
The Pennsylvania program is addressing one of animal welfare experts ' greatest concerns : that pet owners , worried that their animals will be euthanized at the shelter , are setting them loose or leaving them in empty houses and garages with some food and water .
Often the abandoned animals are n't found for days or weeks and are dead or dying , they say .
And ultimately the survivors wind up in a shelter anyway .
As for the ones set free :
Most house pets do n't do well on their own and are often injured in fights with predators or other animals , hit by vehicles or infected with diseases , experts say .
Though acknowledging that many pets left at shelters are eventually euthanized if they are n't adopted , " if the animal is put in a shelter , at least she will have a chance and wo n't endure all that suffering , " Zawistowski says .
The SPCA of Erie County , N.Y. , is experiencing only a bump — about two a month — in foreclosure pets , says executive director Barbara Carr .
But each is heartbreaking .
She tells of a man who arrived at the shelter this month saying he had to give up his cat and two small dogs .
When an employee walked outside to help him get the animals into the shelter , " she discovered that he had arrived in a U - Haul loaded with boxes and furniture .
He had lost his home and had no place to go .
The very last thing he did was surrender his animals . "
All three now have new homes .
HSUS and ASPCA have sent out advisories imploring people to plan for their animals in case their finances nosedive .
Also , " we 're trying to get the word out for people to take note of what 's happening in the economy , understand that animals are expensive , and if you do n't have much cushion , now may not be a good time to get a pet , " says Stephanie Shain of HSUS .
Zawistowski hopes the question of foreclosure pets will prompt a national discussion .
Hurricane Katrina resulted in a recognition that after natural disasters pets must be managed , " and we have , as a nation , set up systems to do so , " he says .
It 's important to see that when people are displaced by economic disaster , " we also need to manage the pets and should establish systems for that . "

The Tired Gaza Two - Step
Gaza erupted in celebration last week to the news that a Palestinian had murdered Jewish religious students in Jerusalem .
And almost daily terrorists send rockets from Gaza into nearby Israeli cities , hoping to kill civilians and provoke Israeli counter - responses -- and perhaps start another Middle East war .
This is not the way some imagined Gaza two and half years after the Israelis withdrew both civilians and soldiers from the territory in September 2005 .
At the time , the Palestinian Authority controlled Gaza , but in early 2007 , Hamas took over in a violent civil war , claiming legitimacy after once winning a popular election .
Gaza has plenty of natural advantages .
It enjoys a picturesque coastline on the Mediterranean with sandy beaches and a rich classical history .
There is a contiguous border with Egypt , the Arab world 's largest country and spiritual home of pan-Arabic solidarity .
The Palestinians are a favorite cause of the oil - rich Middle East , and would seem to be in store for at least a few billions that accrue from $ 100 a barrel oil .
In short , an autonomous Gaza might have been a test case in which the Palestinians could have crafted their own Singapore , Hong Kong or Dubai .
Instead , despite Palestinian rule of Gaza , Hamas has continued its civil war with the Palestinian Authority , and looters have ruined infrastructure that was left by the United Nations and the Israelis .
Mobs crashed the border crossing with Egypt .
Hamas - led terrorists have launched over 2,500 mortar rounds into Israel , as well as over 2,000 Qassam rockets .
We all now know the familiar Gaza two - step .
The Israeli Defense Forces respond to Hamas rockets with targeted air strikes against terrorist leaders or small - rocket factories .
Hamas makes certain both these targets are intermingled with civilians in the hopes of televised collateral damage .
Hamas counts on the usual sympathetic European and Middle Eastern media coverage and commentary .
Terrorists deliberately trying to murder Israeli civilians are seen as the moral equivalents of Israeli soldiers trying to target combatants who use civilians as shields .
To the extent that the IDF kills more of the terrorists than Hamas kills Israeli civilians , sympathy goes to the " refugees " of Gaza .
This tragic charade continues because Hamas wants it to continue .
Its purpose is to make life so unsure and frightening for nearby affluent Israelis that they will grant continual concessions , hopefully leading to such wide - scale demoralization that the Jewish state itself will collapse and disappear .
In that regard , the last thing Hamas wants is calm and prosperity in Gaza , which would turn the population 's attention toward living rather than killing and dying .
Hamas in Gaza also feels that the war is not static -- and that it is already winning on all fronts .
As Europeans , Middle Easterners and the United Nations lecture Israel about " inordinate " or " disproportionate " responses , the terrorists ' smuggled missiles increase in range , payload and frequency of attack .
Hamas has gained powerful patrons in Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah .
Both provide terrorist training and weapons as long as Gaza serves as a useful proxy in their own existential struggles against Israel .
On the world front , we 've reached a new threshold in which evoking the destruction of Israel and the killing of Jews has become commonplace and almost acceptable .
Hezbollah 's leader , Hassan Nasrallah , publicly brags about hoarding the body parts of captured Israelis .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad openly talks of Israelis in Hitlerian terms as " filthy bacteria " that should be wiped off the map .
Palestinians in Gaza can enshrine mass murderers and praise terrorist killers without much worry that the world will be appalled at their grotesque spectacles -- much less cease its sympathy and subsidies .
And what a world it is that enables Gaza !
The Russians have fought a dirty war against Muslim separatists in Chechnya .
The Chinese have been hunting down Muslim separatist Uighurs who claim Xinjiang Province as their own .
India wages bloody periodic wars against Muslim terrorists who claim Kashmir .
Imagine tomorrow that all of the above nations told the Gazans that their dispute is no more or less important to the world than similar land quarrels in Cyprus or Azerbaijan ; that they are no more or less deserving of international money and sympathy than are the Chechnyans or Uighurs or the Muslims of Kashmir ; or that the Israelis have as much right as the Chinese , Indians or Russians to retaliate and put down neighboring Islamist attacks .
Then the crisis would shortly recede from the world 's attention .
And Hamas in Gaza would either begin negotiating and building Palestinians ' own civil society -- or face the sort of typical Chinese , Russian or Indian retaliation that Israel is quite able to unleash .

先週末の土曜日に同僚の結婚式がありました。
二次会の方に参加したのですが、いい会だった。
会社で、なにかプレゼントをしようということになり、お祝い用にシステムを作ってプレゼントしました。
内容は、写メで披露宴や二次会の最中の写真や、自分撮りした写真を送って、本文にメッセージ書いて送ると、二人に贈ったURLを開くと、フォトムービーとして見ることが出来るというものだ。
特別な技術は使用していないが、進め方が通常案件の進め方にも通じるものがあると思うので、エントリを書いてみた。
まず、企画 どんな企画にするかを2週間ぐらい前から練り始めました。
過去に写メや動画を携帯から送り、PC上のFlashでつなげて見れるというのはやったことがあったので、それをカスタマイズするという方向に決定。これはすんなり決まった。
プロトタイプ作成 メール受信関連をphpを使って作成 、Subjectや本文はDB上に保存をし、画像はconvertをかけて、[id].jpgという名前で実ファイルとして保存することにした。
ここまでが、前々日までに行っていたこと。
紙系の用意 実際に披露宴や二次会に参加した人に、写メを送ってもらうための、説明を書いた紙を用意するのと、二人にURLを伝える方法も工夫することになり、こちらは、営業の人がそれらしいのを買ってきてもらったりしていました。
開発部隊とは別なので、ちょっと進め方などは把握していませんでしたが。。。
ランチミーティング 前日のお昼に、プロジェクトにかかわるメンバーで、ランチMTGを行い、プロトタイプのブラッシュアップや残作業のタスク確認などをした。
まずは、作業の洗い出し。
・二人が見るフォトムービー画面のデザイン
・二人にURLを伝えるための方法
・来場した人に使い方を教える紙資料（カード）のデザイン
・来場した人にサンプルを見てもらうための携帯サイト
などなど 。
まずは、フォトムービー画面のデザイン。
プロトタイプですでにある程度まで作りこまれていたのだが、デザインナーやディレクションから、画面イメージを紙に書いて共有。
デザイナーが外枠を作成することになり、それを開発が受け取って仕上げることになった。
次に、二人 にURLを伝える方法。
一応Basic認証をかける予定なので、ID/PWも伝えなければならないが、ただ伝えるだけでは芸がないので、結婚証明書の用紙に、勝手に承認ということで、全社員の直筆サインと共に、URLなどを書いて贈るということになった。これはすでに決まっていて、営業さんが買ってきてくれていました。
結構重厚な感じ 。
来場した人に、使い方を伝えるための紙資料ですが、これは、A5サイズを二つ折りにすることになった。
みんなが好き勝手にイメージを言う中で、デザイナーさんが裏紙に手書きでデザインイメージを書き、それを見てさらに話すという感じ。
文言は、たたき台を営業や管理部の人が作ってくれたのを、さらにディレクションが錬ることになった。
紙のカードだけでは伝わりにくいということで、携帯サイトを作り、そこにサンプルのフォトムービーを見れるようにしようということになり、それのデザインと文言の錬るのもカードと同様に。
大まかな流れと作業分担が決まったところで、ランチMTGが終わり、午後は通常の仕事をしつつ作業開始。
実作業 他部署の作業はちょっと見えないところもあったので、開発側ですが、メール受信システムはほぼ出来ているが少し修正。
受信するメアドについて まずは、システムエラーでうまく写真が受信できなかった場合に、再送をお願いするわけにはいかないので、そこに対応するために以下のような構成にした。
1. m@example.com をリダイレクタとして作成
-> m-reg@example.com
-> xxxx@example.com ( 開発者のメアド )
2. m-reg@example.com でシステム起動
これで、m-regがエラーになったとしても、転送自体は問題なく動いているので、開発者に届いたメールから復旧できるようにした。
次に届いたメールについて 送られてきたメールが、間違いや、不適切な内容。または、写真の縦横が回転してしまっている場合があります。
なので、これに対応するための仕組みを考えてみた。
不適切な内容はDB側で削除日時を登録することで論理削除にすることにした。
物理削除でもよかったのだが、操作ミス時に復旧の時間を早くするために論理削除にしました。
回転のずれについては、写メ受信時に、800x600にリサイズするところで、90度、180度、270度に回転した画像も同時に作成しておいて、シンボリックリンクで使用するファイルを決定することにした。
ファイル名は [ id ] .
jpgなので、1_0.jpg、1_1.jpg、1_2.jpg、1_3.jpgという風に実体の画像を作成し、それを、1.jpgという名前にシンボリックリンクを張った。
phpの場合、realpath関数を使うことで、シンボリックリンク元ファイル名を取得できるので、それをもとに次に回転する角度を判別するという手法をとりました。
帰ってきてから、目視でチェックしてデータ修正でもよかったのだが、二人にはURLを披露宴で伝えるので、帰宅して見られる前に調整しておきたいので、リアルタイムで作業ができる仕組みを構築した。
方法としては、メール受信時に開発者の携帯メアドに、本文と、削除・回転ができる管理画面のURLをついたメールを送り、届いたものを片っ端から目視チェックして対応した。
来場者に配るカードについて こちらは、デザイナーさんが頑張ってました。
アイコンや画像の配置。フォントの選択などやはりセンスって大事だなぁと思った。
写真撮り まずは、自分たちの写真を投稿すべく、金曜日の夕方から写真撮り大会になった。
仕組みがあると、そこで面白いこと遊べることをするのは、ある種才能だと思いました。
営業部が面白いチーム写真を撮ったのを皮切りに、どの部署も面白いポーズとかで写真をとっていた。
開発から贈ったのはこんなソース while ( Love is true ) { echo " Happy ! " ; }
当日 社長や役員さんが、披露宴から参加していたので、家で起きたぐらいから、自分の携帯にチェック用のメールが届いてきました。
それを見ることで、ほぼリアルタイムで披露宴の内容が見れたのは思わぬ役得だったかもしれない。
私は、二次会から参加。
すでに来ていた人にカードを渡しつつ、自分の携帯でサンプルのフォトムービーを見せて投稿のお願いをし、あとは、入口で来た人に説明とお願いをしたりした。
会の最中にもパチパチ携帯で撮って送ったが、自分の携帯のカメラ性能が思ったよりも良くないことに気づいた・・・シャッタースピードがピントを合わせるためか、遅すぎる。
今日 今日、新婦から見た感想をききました 。
とても喜んでくれたみたいでよかった〜
最後に 絵がないとうまく伝わらないかもしれませんが、とても完成度が高く、このままサービスにしたいぐらいのものが出来ました。
なにより喜んでもらえてよかった。
それと、この作業をしているの自体がとても楽しかった。
部署を超えた一体感と、作業が進んでいる感じと、同じ方向を向いて、よりよくしていこうという意識の共有など。
普段の仕事とはまったく違った空気感で作業ができたのはなんなのか。終わった後に飲みながら話をしたけど、何が原因かはよくわからなかったです。
でも、そのスパイスを見つけて、普段の仕事にも織り込めていけたらいいなぁと思いました。
The Lida Demesh , carrying a consignment of cars from Japan , was heading for the Russian port of Vladivostok when it was stopped by patrol near Cape Musudan .
No reason was given for the search , but Russian sources said the ship may have gone too close to a missile test site .
A similar incident in 2005 took 15 days to resolve through diplomatic channels .
The ship had sought shelter from a storm in North Korean territorial waters .
Strong winds
On Saturday , an official at Vladivostok 's maritime rescue centre , Vladimir Yeroshkin , said the Lida Demesh had been detained and boarded by the North Korean coastguard about 3 - 5 nautical miles ( 5.5 km ) from Cape Musudan .
This is a small two - hold ship - it is quite possible that weather conditions forced it to move closer to the coast
Vladimir Yeroshkin
Vladivostok Maritime Rescue Centre
" An armed group boarded the ship and ordered the captain to change course and go to a North Korean port [ Chongjin ] , " he told the Russian NTV network .
Mr Yeroshkin said the centre had been told the ship 's 25 crew - members were fine and that there had been no threat to their lives .
North Korean officials in Russia said they were not aware of the reasons for the detention , but Mr Yeroshkin said strong winds might have accidentally forced the vessel into North Korean territorial waters .
" The forecast for our region is a N - NW wind , 15 - 18 metres per second , " he said .
" This is a small two - hold ship .
It is quite possible that weather conditions forced it to move closer to the coast . "
Most countries claim an area extending 12 nautical miles ( 22.2 km ) from their coast as territorial waters .
You can tell a lot about a person by what they say when you tell them you ’re a stripper .
They always ask .
â€ œWhat do you do for money , traveling around in that van.â€ 
Or even if they do n’t know about the van dwelling , it ’s â€œso , what do you do .â€ 
I used to tell people that I took my clothes off for money , or danced naked with the fairies , or whatever came to mind .
Lately I just say , â€ œI ’m a stripper , â€  and try to play it off all smooth , like saying you ’re an investment banker or a paralegal .
The best people will respond in the manner it ’s spoken , and say , â€œoh , cool.â€ 
Or , â€ œyou can do that wherever you go ?
Great.â€ 
They ’re pretty rare .
Some people will look a little shocked for a second and then tell me that it ’s okay .
Like , â€œoh !
Well .
That ’s… okay .
I guess .â€ Really ?
Are you sure ?
Cause you know I could never live without the random approval of some stranger .
Older men are usually conditional with their approval .
As in , â€ œwell , I guess that ’s okay .
As long as you ’re being smart and saving money and not doing drugs.â€ 
I like how they think it ’s any of their business , and sometimes I ’ll ask them if they do their money , and if they find it hard , as an investment banker , to resist drugs ?
Other people want to reassure themselves with their approval .
â€ œI guess that ’s okay , if you ’re just doing it to put yourself through school / save money / feed your kids ? â€ 
Or , the ever so common sympathetic middle aged woman : â€ œI had friends who did that !
You can just make some money and then stop.â€ 
I used to feel guilty about smashing their stripper fantasies , but now I take a certain kind of delight in it .
â€ œOh , no , there ’s no chance of me stopping .
I ’m a stripper for life .â€ â€ œNo , I ’m not going to school .
Why , are you ?â€ 
The worst , but most hilarious , is when they totally miss the irony .
Then there are cute , sweet people .
Once a friend of a friend ’s husband was under the bus with me , looking at rusted out brake lines , when it occurred to him to ask how I made money .
â€ œI ’m a stripper , â€  I told him , just as I rolled into a puddle of brake fluid .
â€ œOh , like in the oil fields ?â€ 
â€ œNo , like in the strip clubs.â€ 
â€ œOh!â€
This caused him to jump and bump his head on the rear axle .
â€ œYou do n’t do it all the way , do you ?â€ 
â€ œAll the way what ?â€ I asked , wondering if he was asking if I went â€œall the wayâ€ in the VIP room or something .
â€ œAll the way naked !!! â€ he said , horrified .
Once , in the same town , I met a woman who was the director of an art center .
The next day she introduced me to some of her possible investors as a girl who travels around in a van and â€œlives by her wits , â€ with a big wink and a nod at my tits .
Often people take my stripper - ness as an opportunity to unpack their favorite stereotypes or pop psych theories .
Cause , you know , strippers are all victims , starlets , and bad poets .
Oh , and how could I forget ?
There ’s the whore with a heart of gold , too .
Especially in Alaska , where whore ’s actually funded much of the gold mining and provided most of the social assistance for years before government established itself and ran them off .
Just the other day someone sent an email telling me that he does n’t go to strip clubs because he can’t stand the vibe , the constant crushing of all these poor girls movie star aspirations .
Wow , how did he know ?
That ’s totally why we all decided to be strippers !
Once , my ex and I were selling her jewelry at a fair , and the woman in the next booth was having some fibromyalgia / MS problems with pain and moving her hands .
She lived in a short bus , so we packed her stuff up for her and my girlfriend drove her bus to her parking spot .
Before we left , she asked how we could afford gas , and I told her I was a stripper .
â€ œ
Oh , â€ she pronounced , â€ œyou poor thing .
You ’re going to have such self esteem problems.â€ 
â€ œReally?â€
â€ œOh , yes , it happens to all strippers.â€ 
Wow , thanks for informing me .
The worst are the guys who try to prove how cool they are by bragging about what shitty customers they are .
You know , they ’re so cool they get free blow jobs whenever they go near a strip club .
Or they ’ve had six girlfriends who were strippers so they could teach me a lot about the business .
Like , you should act really really slutty .
I do n’t even know what to say to these people , so I just walk away .
Or , as soon as they find out I ’m a stripper they wanna buddy up with me and put their wives or girlfriends down .
Like , strippers are so cool , and their wife wo n’t shave her pussy .
Yeah , I would n’t shave my pussy for your fucked up free enjoyment either .
What the hell ?
Or they explain to me how innocent and dowdy their girlfriend is , and then turn to her and explain that strip clubs are dens of sin , meat racks of naked women , full of the crushed dreams of aspiring starlets and bad poets .
Better than that , but just as frustrating , are the ones who try to correct me :
â€ œI ’m a stripper.â€ 
â€ œNo , no .
You ’re an Exotic Dancer!â€ 
â€ œI ’m not a fucking ballerina , â€  I tell them , which I learned from this really awesome stripper in Indianapolis once , while having a conversation about this very thing .
She said that people always tell her that she ’s lying , and I ’ve had that happen a couple times too :
â€ œI ’m a stripper.â€ 
â€ œHaha , you ’re not really .â€ 
â€ œYeah .
I am.â€ 
â€ œNoooo , â€  they look you up and down and you can see them thinking you are n’t blond , you ai n’t got fake tits , â€ œyou do n’t look like a stripper.â€ 
â€ œUm , thanks .
But I am.â€ 
â€ œOmigod that ’s so funny , but no your not.â€ 
Oh , yeah !
I totally forgot !
I ’m not a stripper , I ’m an exotic dancer .
Left - leaning Brave New Films on Friday launched a viral video campaign that seeks to diminish Fox News ' influence on the rest of the political news media ( good luck ! )
The four minute video airs footage of Fox News reports that compare senator Barack Obama to Chairman Mao , and radio commentary comparing him to Hitler .
It also shows how some of the controversial commentary makes its way into other popular news outlets .
In an e-mail blast , the group 's founder Robert Greenwald asks supporters to sign a petition that he says he plans on sending to news rooms chiefs .
He wants the rest of the media to stop following Fox 's lead .
This video is the latest in a series that Brave New Films has made over the past few months .
The series is called Fox Attacks !
My question : Can we get through an election without any over - the - top references to Hitler ?
It seems that Godwin's Law applies just as much to presidential elections these days as they do to online discussions .

John McCain is all over the news today because during a speech at CMU in Pittsburgh he proposed a federal gas tax holiday that would run from Memorial Day to Labor Day .
“ I propose that the federal government suspend all taxes on gasoline now paid by the American people — from Memorial Day to Labor Day of this year .
The effect will be an immediate economic stimulus — taking a few dollars off the price of a tank of gas every time a family , a farmer , or trucker stops to fill up .
Over the same period , our government should suspend the purchase of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , which has also contributed to the rising price of oil .
This measure , combined with the summer - long “ gas - tax holiday , ” will bring a timely reduction in the price of gasoline .
And because the cost of gas affects the price of food , packaging , and just about everything else , these immediate steps will help to spread relief across the American economy , ” McCain said .
For the moment let ’s ignore the obvious problem that McCain wo n’t be president summer , so it does n’t matter what he proposes , and focus on the fact that McCain ’s tax holiday would n’t really deal with the problem .
Since 2006 , Congressional Democrats have been trying to eliminate the federal gas tax , but they have been blocked at every turn by McCain ’s fellow Republicans .
Advertisements
The GOP is against the Democratic proposal because it would be paid for by eliminating the yearly billions spent on subsidies to the oil companies .
( In his defense , Sen. McCain is against the federal subsidies to the oil companies ) .
McCain ’s proposal would encourage Americans to drive more and increase consumption .
This is exactly what we should n’t be doing .
Oil prices will not fall until we decrease demand .
However , McCain is also against spending any federal money to promote the development of alternative energy sources , so what McCain is proposing is the equivalent of a drunken summer bender that we will have to pay for later through even higher prices at the pump .
If McCain was n’t such a pandering fraud , he would call for not a holiday , but the elimination of the federal gas tax .
If he had any guts he would call for an end to subsidies for big oil , and that the savings be used to develop alternative energy .
McCain can’t afford to anger corporate America , so he is going to offer the citizens of this country a temporary sedative to dull the pain at the pump .
This is straight out of the George W. Bush playbook , and another example of John McCain ’s lack of vision and political courage .
McCain ’s Remarks :

Une équipe de chercheurs franco - germano - suisse utilisant le laser Téramobile a réussi pour la première fois à créer des micro- décharges dans un nuage d’orage grâce à un laser , explique un communiqué du CNRS .
L’équipe Téramobile rassemble notamment des chercheurs du Laboratoire d’optique appliquée ( CNRS / École nationale supérieure des techniques avancées / École Polytechnique / Université Paris 11 ) et du Laboratoire de Spectrométrie Ionique et Moléculaire ( CNRS / Université Lyon 1 ) .
Les résultats de ces travaux publiés le 14 avril sur le site de la revue Optics Express ont été obtenus après des expériences réalisées au cours de l’été 2004 au Laboratoire Langmuir du New Mexico Tech ( États - Unis ) , station permanente d’étude de la foudre choisie pour la fréquence des orages qui l’atteignent .
Située dans les Montages Rocheuses à 3200 mètres d’altitude , elle est équipée d’un réseau d’antennes pour détecter et localiser en trois dimensions l’activité électrique des nuages .
Les chercheurs se sont appuyés sur les performances exceptionnelles du laser Téramobile le laser mobile le plus puissant au monde transporté aux États - Unis pour la première fois à cette occasion .
Ce laser produit des flashes d’une puissance de 4 térawatts , c’està - dire 4000 milliards de Watts , l’équivalent de 1000 centrales électriques , pendant un très bref instant .
Le flash dure 100 femtosecondes , soit un dix - millième de milliardième de seconde .
Pendant le flash le laser ionise l’air qui devient conducteur de l’électricité sur plus de 100 mètres .
Le filament conducteur généré par le laser , pointé vers les nuages d’orage , se comporte comme une pointe métallique dirigée vers une électrode chargée .
Il initie des petites décharges diffuses comme celles qui sont observées souvent par temps d’orage à l’extrémité des piolets des alpinistes ou des mâts des bateaux .
Pour dépasser ce stade de la “ décharge couronne ” et déclencher des éclairs , il est nécessaire d’allonger la durée de l’ionisation actuellement limitée à une microseconde , un millionième de seconde .
Les chercheurs veulent mettre d’ici à deux ans un laser dix fois plus puissant qui permettrait cette fois de déclencher la foudre .

Producer , Cry Rape , 1Xtra
False allegations of rape may make for gripping headlines in the newspapers , but they can also ruin the lives of those men who 've been accused despite being innocent .
At the age of 19 , Ben Guerin had his life ripped apart by one allegation .
Three years after he'd had a sexual encounter with a girl from school he was arrested for assault , rape and paedophilia .
The girl claimed they had met at a party when she was just 15 and that the walk home afterwards had resulted in a violent assault .
Some people still like to disbelieve me - they definitely regard me as the guilty person
Ben Guerin
But witnesses who had been with the couple came forward on Ben 's behalf and inaccuracies were found in the girl 's story .
The charges were dropped and instead the girl was eventually sentenced to a year for perverting the course of justice .
According to Home Office research , between 3 % and 9 % of all reports of rape are found to be false .
Yet the lives of those men accused are often devastated .
Some even commit suicide , so terrible is the stigma of being charged with sexual assault - even if subsequently cleared .
It 's an issue that particularly affects young people , with those aged 16 and 25 making up both the largest group of victims and the accused .
Jason , who is now 18 , was also the victim of a false allegation .
After wasting over a year of police time , as well as causing distress both to Jason and his family , the girl retracted her statement in court .
Later it came to light that she had made three false allegations previously .
Student calls
Margaret Gardener , the director of the False Allegations Support Organisation ( Faso ) receives over a thousand calls each year from men looking for help and advice .
RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT
The majority of perpetrators are known to the victim 97 % of callers to Rape Crisis lines knew their assailant prior to the assault During 2001 it is estimated there were 190,000 incidents of serious sexual assault and 47,000 female victims of rape / attempted rape Home Office figures show that police recorded 12,630 female rapes in 2006 - 7 Data from Children and Women Abuse Studies Unit and Home Office
" We are beginning to get a lot of university students phoning us , " she says .
" One of the scenarios is going to the pub and then suddenly finding the morning after you 've had a boozy night out and you 've been with somebody , that you get a phone - call from the police because an allegation of rape has been made . "
The impact of an allegation can extend far beyond the legal ramifications .
Gardener works with men and their families to help them deal with the ostracism they often face within their communities , even long after the event .
In Jason 's case , his neighbour asked to be moved to another flat due to concern about the accused man 's proximity to his daughters .
For Ben , his apprenticeship as a plumber was terminated and he faced widespread suspicion from people he knew .
She backdated the party one year , so it became rape and paedophilia
Hear 1Xtra's Cry Rape
" My door became blacklisted , " says Ben .
" People would rather avoid me than speak to me , they literally took her word .
My dad did n't take it too well either .
He had doubts in what I was saying so that created problems with my home life .
" It was n't like I was convicted for it .
I think some people still like to disbelieve me .
They definitely regard me as the guilty person . "
Ben also believes the police assumed he was guilty from the start .
But Dave Gee from the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) maintains that officers seek to remain even - handed when dealing with rape .
Complainants ' anonymity
" In most cases it 's one word against the other , " he says .
" It 's very difficult not only to convict and prosecute , but in most cases difficult to even establish whether an offence has happened at all .
" There can not be an assumption that all alleged offenders are guilty .
We have more to do with victims but that should not translate into demonising male accused people . "
But an unfounded charge remains on someone 's Criminal Record Bureau ( CRB ) file permanently , which can affect future job prospects .

Complainants are granted total anonymity on first reporting a rape .
According to the 1976 Sexual Offences
Act , it is a criminal offence for the media to reveal a victim 's identity or any other information that might lead to them being identified .
If they are charged with an offence such as perverting the course of justice or perjury in relation to their complaint they can then be named .
But there is no protection for those falsely accused of committing an assault .
Whilst Ben 's name found its way into the local newspapers , Jason , as a 16 - year - old , narrowly escaped the media glare .
Conviction rate
There are those who believe that when it comes to rape allegations , men do not deserve any protection .
Hamiltons had false allegations made against them
" The whole thing was flung onto me .
If I was going to lie surely I would have gone with some crazy story .
I just told the police what had happened .
Had I known what I was going to go through I would have had to think twice about reporting it . "
With only 6 % of sexual assaults resulting in conviction and according to some research , as many as 91 % of rapes unreported , Vernon Coaker from the Home Office is adamant the focus needs to remain on victims rather than those who 've been accused .
" There have been some high - profile cases highlighted by the media where one or two false allegations have been made , " he says .
" But we should n't be deflected from the fact that the real issue in respect to sexual violence is underreporting and to ensure the conviction rate is improved .
That is the thrust of government policy . "
Cry Rape is available to listen now on 1Xtra 's website and is broadcast on BBC Radio 1Xtra between 1400 and 1600 GMT on Wednesday 27 February 2008 .
When the conviction rates for rapists have reached at least 50 % I 'll start worrying about these possible innocents .
Considering how difficult it is to have a man convicted even when there is evidence , false accusations of rape seems like a very uncertain method of getting even .
Erik Lundbom , Ramsgate , Kent
I was falsely accused in 1993 .
It was a horrific experience and one which has tainted my life ever since .
I even contemplated suicide at the time ( I had just started University ) .
My accuser conducted a whispering campaign against me , telling everyone except the proper authorities .
As it never became a criminal matter , I had no legal position at all .
It was a horrific experience and one which I am only just coming to terms with 15 years later .
It not only affects the man who¿s been accused , but is an insult to every woman who has really experienced this horrific crime ¿ particularly those to afraid to come forward .
I have never received either an explanation or an apology .
Incredibly , my accuser is now an Ordained Anglican Priest .
Anon , St Helens
This article has left me disappointed in and embarrassed for the BBC .
Why in a week in which three horrific men were finally jailed for murdering and raping women , does the BBC decide to run an article and air a radio discussion on the minuscule number of men wrongly accused of rape ?
To me this appears not only deeply inappropriate , but tinged with unhealthy misogyny .
The media should be focusing upon the attitudes that allowed men like Levi Bellfield to abuse and rape .
Bellfield assumed he could get away with it .
Articles such as this , printed at this time suggest that the shocking numbers of women subjected to violence , rape and intimidation on a daily basis , are less important than the tiny number of men wrongly accused .
Elsa Richardson , Glasgow
I was interviewd by the police concerning a rape allegation levied against me .
I was assured by the police that this matter would be cleared up within a day or so but it was nearly two months before I received a call to say no further action would be taken .
My life was hell wondering how friends and family would react yet knowing I was innocent and trying to find a way to stop the nonsense .
I now suffer in silence feeling as though I 'm forever tainted .
It has affected my relationships and caused no end of frustration that I am powerless to do anything about the matter .
I had several female witnesses who knew it was a false allegation who stood by me yet my DNA and arrest remain on file forever .
I have a life sentence against my name now .
Job applications and anything I do will show up and two years on I still have many years of hell ahead of me .
My DNA remains on file with fingerprints and photograph .
The humiliation of the proceedure is awful .
Mike , UK
I think it is disgusting that girls falsely accuse men of rape .
The increase of false accusations of rape make the women who have been raped not want to come forward .
Therefore , there are many actual rapists that are still out there , free to attack again .
Victoria Oxley , Essex
I¿d rather live in a society where money and effort spent in trying to blindly convict all allegations were re-directed into preventing rapes from happening in the first place .
We live in a reformist society where ( thank goodness ) the death penalty is banned , so lets take steps to change ourselves rather than constantly pursue vengeance .
M Turner , Leicester
I have had an experience bordering on rape but I blame myself more for putting myself in the position where it can happen .
I have never told anyone other than one close friend who I know will never meet the guy involved - as a lot of people I know know him and I 'm scared of people 's reactions .
Reading " Louise 's " story just makes me more sure that I 've done right in not saying anything .
What can I do ?
I 'm certainly not helping the guy avoid doing this to anyone else .
It does n't help me not blame myself .
The guy in question avoids me now and its very awkward if we meet socially so he knows something happened that was n't supposed to .
Its such a hard situation to be in and to know what to do - that is why so many cases go unreported .
Leanne , North Lincolnshire
Rape is such a horrible thing to happen to anyone male or female .
I do believe that the conviction rate puts people off reporting rapes to the police .
As it says in the article it 's often one person 's word against another which is very hard to prove unless forensic evidence is found .
But if it 's proven 100 % that a false allegation has been made , that person should receive a long prison sentance and be named .
A false allegation can ruin a person 's life as a rape can .
I undersatnd that people can go out get drunk and regret what they did but to cry rape is a serious offence and should be treated that way .
Ger , Dublin , Ireland
I believe that a major part of the problem for both sexes is people getting regularly so drunk that they put themselves at risk of getting into situations that they can neither control nor remember clearly .
This is not to suggest that all rape victims or falsely - accused men were drunk , but apart from the fact that people think more carefully about their actions when sober , surely a person 's story would be more convincing both to the police and in court if they were sober at the time in question rather than very drunk .
HS , Chester , UK
It 's presumably very hard to legislate for a number of reasons .
Firstly , and simply , it 's often the case of one person 's word against another .
Secondly , what constitutes one person 's idea of rape may conflict with someone else 's .
The line is sometimes not entirely clear between seduction and coercion ; or between boisterous sex and violence .
Thirdly , there is the issue of consent - whether it is given and then retracted , or given when the person in question is not in control of their actions .
Or , of course , when it is given , but then regretted later - which can lead to guilt , shame , and false accusations .
It is such a minefield , and reveals so many embedded assumptions about the sexual contract between men and women , that it 's hardly surprising that each case seems to raise such complex issues and attract so much in the way of opinion and judgement in the media .
Lucy , Suffolk
Why not make both identities protected up to the point of conviction .
The law states you are innocent until proven guilty , but the stigma attached to this type of crime is such that the " general public " tend to believe the reverse .
If the police thought the accused was a danger to the public , surely they would be remanded in custody .
If they are not a danger to the public , what benefit is there to anyone in allowing the accused 's identity to be published ?
Ed , Livingston UK
Every single person - male or female - needs to take responsibility for his or her own actions .
Any man who chooses to have sex with a woman who is clearly drunk / high should be prepared to accept he may be charged with rape because he has assaulted someone just as much as if he 'd punched her in the face .
But a woman who chooses to go out drinking barely dressed is effectively telling men " I 'm sexually available " and if she gets blind drunk and then wakes up next to some bloke with no memory of the night before she has no right to destroy his reputation because of her own bad behaviour - she too is guilty of " assault " .
I realise as a woman this will infuriate the extremist feminists who hate men , but sex is not rape just because a woman says it is .
If both men and women were made to take responsibility for their own actions , then all the public money and police time wasted on these tit - for - tat word - against - the - other allegations could be spent on catching the likes of Wright and Bellfield , serial raping mass murderers .
Cat Stewart , Derby , UK
One of the main problems is the fact that the accused get 's their name revealed .
If someone is guilty of something then their name should be announced ( as part of any punishment ) .
However , the principle in this country is supposed to be " innocent until proven guilty " .
Names should not be revealed prior to any conviction -
It 's simply not fair .
Anthony , Reading , Berks
It happened to me with my ex-girlfriend , I left her and she swore she 'd make my life hell .
I woke up one morning with two coppers stood above my bed , was taken into custody and treated like scum by the police .
After some very forceful questioning , a DNA test and a lot of other humiliating things the girl retracted her accusation citing she could n't go through with it .
The police did n't even ask if I wanted her charged and just let me go without a sorry or whatever .
Still to this day some ex-friends believe her and I do n't trust any woman properly .
Accused , Manchester
I think the onus is really on the media to be more responsible .
It should not legally be allowed to publish the identity of the accused until that person is found guilty .
If the news organisations were more responsible and less desperate for sensationalist stories then the relevent authorities could focus their attention on the victims of the alleged attack .
The BBC has been guilty of this in its coverage of the Ipswich murders , publishing every little detail about the first man taken in for questioning , who we all now know is innocent of this crime .
They claimed it was " in the public interest " but there is a difference between what is in the public interest and what the public is ( voyeuristically ) interested in .
This , and the cases above , sadly are the latter .

A light aircraft that crash - landed in a pensioner 's back garden was carrying a prisoner on day release , it emerged today .
The convict was a passenger in the Cessna 172 when the aircraft crashed in trees in the back garden of Eileen and Alfred Watling 's garden in Folkestone , Kent .
The elderly couple watched in amazement as the prisoner and the pilot emerged from the wreckage and dropped to the ground , shortly after taking off from Rochester Airport in Kent .
The convict , who has not been named , was serving his sentence for importing drugs at Blantyre House Prison , Goudhurst , near Tunbridge Wells , Kent .

Stunned : Pensioner Eileen Watling and her new garden ornament in Folkestone , Kent
He had been let out of the category C prison on day release .
The 12 - hour formal leave of absence is granted to allow inmates to maintain ties with their families .
The pilot , also unnamed , was forced to ground the plane at approximately 3.15 pm but both he and his passenger escaped with only minor injuries .
It is not yet known what caused the crash but the Air Accidents Investigation Branch were last night investigating the possible causes .
Both men were taken to William Harvey Hospital after the incident and treated for minor injuries .
The convicted man was then taken to Maidstone Prison in Kent .
The incident comes less than a month after Blantyres deputy governor Kim Coulstock was suspended for alleged irregularities concerning prisoner movements .
Internal investigations are continuing .
Mrs Watling , 71 , who lives at the house with her 83 - year - old husband , said : " It was so sudden , we 'd just started watching a film when there was an almighty crash .
We thought the house had collapsed .
" I looked out of the window and saw the conifers had come down and there were no electricity lines .
Then I saw the plane .
" When the pilot came out he was covered in blood , then the passenger came down out of the trees .
I managed to get them into the conservatory and got a towel to stop the bleeding from the pilot 's head .

What a sight :
The wrecked plane , as seen from a neighbour 's garden
" He said ' I 'm so sorry to do this to you ' and I said , ' not to worry your health is more important ' .
" We realise how lucky we 've been .
The plane was 10ft from our neighbour 's house .
If it had hit them first , it could have exploded .
Somebody was looking out for us . "
A spokesman for Kent Police said : " We do n't know what caused the crash but they managed to get the aircraft down without injuring themselves or anyone else .
" Fortunately it is a very rural area and I understand the garden in question was quite large .
" The pilot was from Maidstone and his passenger from Cranbrook . "
Emergency services went to the scene at the property off Stone Street , in Farthing Common , near Folkestone , Kent .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - When Hassan Amin al - Bana gingerly steps on the gas pedal of his bright yellow taxi , a strange smell wafts from the exhaust : deep - fried fast food .
A Palestinian taxi driver fills his taxi with cooking oil in Gaza Strip April 30 , 2008 .
Faced with chronic fuel shortages due to an Israeli blockade and a strike by Palestinian distributors protesting supply caps , taxi drivers in the Gaza Strip are filling their tanks with cooking oil , often scrounging leftover fat from street vendors .

Faced with chronic fuel shortages due to an Israeli blockade and a strike by Palestinian distributors protesting supply caps , taxi drivers in the Gaza Strip are filling their tanks with cooking oil , often scrounging leftover fat from street vendors .
“ It ’s not like driving with diesel -- it takes time to get it going in the morning , ” said Bana , 40 , at Gaza City ’s main taxi stand .
“ I know it ’s bad for my car , but I have to pay for food for my kids so what can I do ? ”
The pumps at Gaza ’s petrol stations have been deserted for several weeks but brightly - colored cartons of soya bean cooking oil , some smuggled from Egypt , are piled high at the taxi rank in the impoverished territory ’s main city .
The drivers say they mix the oil with turpentine before filling up .
Used oil is better than the fresh stuff so they often beg or buy leftovers from street vendors who sell falafel -- a fried chick - pea snack popular in the Middle East .
Vendors are doing a brisk trade .
“ I set up the stall last week when I saw taxi drivers had started putting cooking oil in their cars , ” said Yehya Karam , 21 , as he stacked cartons of oil alongside waiting taxis .
“ I sell about 70 cartons a day -- I ’d say most of the taxi drivers still on the streets are powering their cars this way . ”

PRICEY
Israel has sharply cut the amount of fuel it pumps into the Gaza Strip as part of tightened restrictions on the enclave after Hamas Islamists routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and wrested control last June .
Limited supplies have all but dried up since the Palestinian fuel association went on strike this month to protest the limits , preventing one million liters of diesel and petrol in tanks on the Gaza side of the border from being delivered .
Israeli restrictions on cooking oil are less stringent than for fuel , although aid groups say supply is starting to run low now it is being used to power cars .
Prices are also rising .
International organizations condemn the Israel - led blockade but the Jewish state says it aims to curb Palestinian militants who fire rockets at Israel and target its border crossings .
Some drivers buy diesel smuggled through tunnels from Egypt on the black market .
But a liter costs up to 20 Israeli shekels ( $ 5.76 ) , about three times the price in Israel and beyond the reach of most Gazans , more than half of whom live in poverty .
Others have hooked their cars up to canisters of cooking gas , but that too is in short supply .
Many travel by donkey or bicycle .
The fuel shortage has also hit the enclave ’s creaking sanitation system , and stinking sewage gushed onto the Gaza City streets on Wednesday when a main pump stopped working because diesel for back up generators ran out during a power cut .
Ahmed al - Beltaji , who runs a falafel stall at the taxi rank , started selling his leftover oil to drivers about 10 days ago .
“ It makes the cars smell like a kitchen -- you feel like falafel is following you , ” said Beltaji , crinkling his nose .
“ Next week they ’ll be putting water in there . ”
Another company has settled charges today with the Federal Trade Commission over violations of the CAN - SPAM Act , netting the FTC another $ 2.9 million in civil penalties .
Online advertiser ValueClick and its subsidiaries were charged with using deceptive e-mails , banner ads , and pop-ups to drive traffic , as well as a failure to secure customers ' financial information .
The settlement is the largest in CAN - SPAM 's five - year history , says the FTC , and bars the companies from any further violations .
ValueClick and subsidiary Hi-Speed Media 's e-mails and online banners promised free gifts like iPods , gift cards , PS3s , laptops , and plasma TVs , among other things .
But when unsuspecting users clicked through , they were greeted with a number of third - party offers that they were required to sign up for before receiving their " free " gifts .
It was ValueClick 's failure to disclose that users must first sign up for other offers ( ones that cost them money ) before collecting the prize that was a violation of the 2003 CAN - SPAM Act and the FTC Act .
But the violations go much further than just misleading to customers about free prizes .
ValueClick , High - Speed Media , and another subsidiary , E - Babylon , also claimed to secure customers ' financial information by encrypting all transactions and other stored info .
This , of course , was a complete lie — the FTC said that they either failed to encrypt information at all , or chose to use non-standard and insecure forms of encryption .
" The agency also charged that several of the companies ’ e-commerce Web sites were vulnerable to SQL injection , a commonly known form of hacker attack , contrary to claims that the companies implemented reasonable security measure , " said the FTC .
In addition to the cash settlement , the companies can no longer misrepresent their use of encryption or any other security measures , no matter what those measures may be .
The FTC has also required companies to maintain a " comprehensive security program " ( complete with third - party assessments ) until 2028 , and for the companies to conspicuously disclose that users must first spend money in order to qualify for free gifts , with a full list of obligations .
The FTC says that this is the 18th case in which it has challenged companies ' data security practices , and only the third case that targeted the use of deceptive promises since CAN - SPAM was first introduced in 2003 .

The much - debated open document standard Office Open XML ( OOXML ) has been approved by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , according to a document obtained by Intellectual Property Watch .
The result of the voting showed 24 supporting votes by participating national standards bodies allowed to vote , known as “ p- members , ” versus eight opposing votes .
This translates to a 75 percent approval rating among bodies which cast a vote , greater than the two - thirds approval required for approval by ISO .
However , nine national standards bodies who abstained from voting were not included in this calculation .
The ISO document is available here [ pdf ] .
The Microsoft document standard , which is a 6,000 page set of specifications , has been hotly contested , culminating in two parallel meetings in Geneva this February ( IPW , Access to Knowledge , 27 February 2008 ) : one , the Ballot Resolution Meeting meant to resolve technical issues with the specification before approval as a standard and the other , called OpenForum Europe , in which free software and rival Open Document Format supporters called for the rejection of OOXML .
Though the public announcement has not been made , Ecma , an industry standards - making body that had approved OOXML previously , has released a press statement welcoming the approval , with secretary general Istvan Sebestyen calling it “ an important milestone . ”
Microsoft ’s statement hailed the appearance of “ extremely broad support ” for the standard at the end of the ISO voting process .
Opponents of the OOXML standard disagree about the support , and accused Microsoft of irregularities during the voting process ( IPW , Access to Knowledge , 29 February 2008 ) .
Knowledge Ecology International released an early statement saying it was “ disappointed ” about the likely approval and that “ Microsoft ’s control over document formats has destroyed competition on the desktop . ”
Several other sources have raised questions about apparent last - minute vote changes , with several countries changing their votes from disapproval or abstention to approval in the eleventh hour , they said .
Most notable of these is Norway , whose reportedly last - minute “ yes ” vote has raised questions about legitimacy , according to a Norwegian IT blog .
The ISO is a 157 - member network of national standards bodies based in Geneva .

The U.S. government believes that America is going to pot — literally .
Earlier this month , the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse announced plans to spend $ 4 million to establish the nation ’s first - ever “ Center on Cannabis Addiction , ” which will be based in La Jolla , Calif .
The goal of the center , according to NIDA ’s press release , is to “ develop novel approaches to the prevention , diagnosis and treatment of marijuana addiction . ”
Not familiar with the notion of “ marijuana addiction ” ?
You ’re not alone .
In fact , aside from the handful of researchers who have discovered that there are gobs of federal grant money to be had hunting for the government ’s latest pot boogeyman , there ’s little consensus that such a syndrome is clinically relevant — if it even exists at all .
But do n’t try telling that to the mainstream press — which recently published headlines worldwide alleging , “ Marijuana withdrawal rivals that of nicotine . ”
The alleged “ study ” behind the headlines involved all of 12 participants , each of whom were longtime users of pot and tobacco , and assessed the self - reported moods of folks after they were randomly chosen to abstain from both substances .
Big surprise : they were n’t happy .
And do n’t try telling Big Pharma — which hopes to cash in on the much - hyped “ pot and addiction ” craze by touting psychoactive prescription drugs like Lithium to help hardcore smokers kick the marijuana habit .
And certainly do n’t try telling the drug “ treatment ” industry , whose spokespeople are quick to warn that marijuana “ treatment ” admissions have risen dramatically in recent years , but neglect to explain that this increase is due entirely to the advent of drug courts sentencing minor pot offenders to rehab in lieu of jail .
According to state and national statistics , up to 70 percent of all individuals in drug treatment for marijuana are placed there by the criminal justice system .
Of those in treatment , some 36 percent had not even used marijuana in the 30 days prior to their admission .
These are the “ addicts ” ?
Indeed , the concept of pot addiction is big business — even if the evidence in support of the pseudosyndrome is flimsy at best .
And what does the science say ?
Well , according to the nonpartisan National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine — which published a multiyear , million - dollar federal study assessing marijuana and health in 1999 — “ millions of Americans have tried marijuana , but most are not regular users [ and ] few marijuana users become dependent on it . ”
The investigator added , “ [ A ] though [ some ] marijuana users develop dependence , they appear to be less likely to do so than users of other drugs ( including alcohol and nicotine ) , and marijuana dependence appears to be less severe than dependence on other drugs . ”
Just how less likely ?
According to the Institute of Medicine ’s 267 - page report , fewer than 10 percent of those who try cannabis ever meet the clinical criteria for a diagnosis of “ drug dependence ” ( based on DSM - III - R criteria ) .
By contrast , the IOM reported that 32 percent of tobacco users , 23 percent of heroin users , 17 percent of cocaine users and 15 percent of alcohol users meet the criteria for “ drug dependence . ”
In short , it ’s the legal drugs that have Americans hooked — not pot .
But what about the claims that ceasing marijuana smoking can trigger withdrawal symptoms similar to those associated with quitting tobacco ?
Once again , it ’s a matter of degree .
According to the Institute of Medicine , pot ’s withdrawal symptoms , when identified , are “ mild and subtle ” compared with the profound physical syndromes associated with ceasing chronic alcohol use — which can be fatal — or those abstinence symptoms associated with daily tobacco use , which are typically severe enough to persuade individuals to reinitiate their drug - taking behavior .
The IOM report further explained , “ [ U ] nder normal cannabis use , the long half - life and slow elimination from the body of THC prevent [ s ] substantial abstinence symptoms ” from occurring .
As a result , cannabis ’ withdrawal symptoms are typically limited to feelings of mild anxiety , irritability , agitation and insomnia .
Most importantly , unlike the withdrawal symptoms associated with the cessation of most other intoxicants , pot ’s mild after - effects do not appear to be either severe or long - lasting enough to perpetuate marijuana use in individuals who have decided to quit .
This is why most marijuana smokers report voluntarily ceasing their cannabis use by age 30 with little physical or psychological difficulty .
By comparison , many cigarette smokers who pick up the habit early in life continue to smoke for the rest of their lives , despite making numerous efforts to quit .
So let ’s review .
Marijuana is widely accepted by the National Academy of Sciences , the Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs , the British Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and others to lack the severe physical and psychological dependence liability associated with most other intoxicants , including alcohol and tobacco .
Further , pot lacks the profound abstinence symptoms associated with most legal intoxicants , including caffeine .
That ’s not to say that some marijuana smokers do n’t find quitting difficult .
Naturally , a handful of folks do , though this subpopulation is hardly large enough to warrant pot ’s legal classification ( along with heroin ) as an illicit substance with a “ high potential for abuse . ”
Nor does this fact justify the continued arrest of more than 800,000 Americans annually for pot violations any more than such concerns would warrant the criminalization of booze or nicotine .
Now if I can only get NIDA to fork me over that $ 4 million check .

Chris Bowers sketches out a plausible and appealing scenario in which Barack Obama wraps up the nomination on May 6 .
Among other things that would be good about such a scenario , it 's worth noting that at this point the main obstacle to a satisfactory resolution of the Florida / Michigan situation is that Clinton continues to be in the race .
If she drops out and endorses Obama on May 7 or shortly thereafter , it 'll be easy for Michigan and Florida to be " forgiven " in late May and allowed to fully participate in a rubber stamp convention in exchange for promising to never do it again .
This is what , I think , everyone believed would happen when the harsh sanctions were first announced .
Only the fact that Hillary Clinton is trying to use the seating of the improperly selected delegates to actually overturn the results of the legitimate nominating process is creating a crisis situation that threatens Democratic prospects in the fall .

Said to smell like God 's feet , France 's favourite soft cheese is at the heart of a battle pitting small farmers against the corporations
In his tiny workshop with a view of his cows , Francois Durand stood lovingly ladling raw milk curd into cheese moulds .
After several weeks of salting , ripening and maturing , these would turn into the pungent , oozing Camembert that is France 's favourite soft cheese - as much part of the national stereotype as the Basque beret , the baguette and a glass of red wine .
" When you use raw , unpasteurised milk , the taste is nice and fruity , " Durand mused as he inspected the smelly contents of his ripening rooms .
" You can taste what the cows have been eating at different times of year . "
Durand is the last dairy farmer in the tiny Normandy village of Camembert still making traditional , raw milk Camembert cheese .
But the farm 's visitor book hints at the bitter cheese wars that have poisoned the air of the surrounding hills and dales .
" Be brave ! " urges one scribbled French entry .
" Keep up the fight !
Thanks for defending real cheese . "
For months , small cheese producers and Camembert connoisseurs have been engaged in a battle of David and Goliath , dubbed the " camembert wars " , which have captured the French imagination and seen Normans take to the streets to defend their cheese 's pungent tang .
" Camembert is a subject that unites all the French , " the former president Francois Mitterrand once said .
But when small , traditional producers are pitted against France 's industrial dairy giants the divide seems vast .
Camembert , whose sharp aroma was once likened to " God 's feet " , was made fashionable by Napoleon III and popularised as part of rations to soldiers in the first world war .
It is France 's best - selling cheese after Emmental , so it is not surprising that French industrial diary giants moved in to mass - produce it , buying up small producers and delivering vast amounts of cheaper , machine - produced camembert to supermarket shelves .
There are only five remaining small , traditional producers of the prized " Camembert de Normandie " .
Last year , the two industrial giants that produced 80 % of the exclusive Normandy Camembert that carries France 's famous Apellation d'Origine Contrôlée ( AOC ) stamp of approval , tried to change the rules .
Until then , all prized AOC - approved Normandy camembert had been made with raw milk .
The big groups decided instead to make most of their Camembert with pasteurised milk , saying they wanted to protect consumers ' health because , when manufacturing large volumes , they could not ensure raw milk was free of dangerous bacteria .
Pasteurising their milk - a process which was cheaper and better suited to mass - production - meant the dairy giants could no longer carry the prized AOC label .
But they began a fight to win back the precious AOC stamp , arguing that pasteurised cheese should be included in it .
Last month , Camembert aficionados breathed a sigh of relief when , after a long public battle , cheese authorities said they would protect small producers by reserving the AOC only for Normandy Camembert made in the traditional way with raw milk .
But small cheese - makers say the war is not over and the fight could be turning dirty .
In recent weeks , the biggest industrial producer , Lactalis , snitched on a smaller , traditional competitor , telling authorities that dangerous bacteria was found in a batch of AOC raw milk Camembert produced by Reaux .
Coincidentally , Reaux happened to be one of Lactalis 's biggest critics .
The smaller company said there was no evidence of contamination .
" This was an operation to destabilise us , it 's a new episode in the camembert war , that 's for sure , " said Reaux 's director Bertrand Gillot .
" The camembert war is a symbol of the wider cheese crisis in France , " warned Véronique Richez - Lerouge , founder of France 's Regional Cheese Association , which lobbies to protect traditional raw - milk varieties .
Nicolas Sarkozy has vowed to apply for Unesco world heritage status for French cuisine .
Yet , while French leaders have long promoted the ideal of French countryside produce , small , regional cheeses are under threat from intense - production and its food industry giants .
France produces 1,000 cheese varieties , and its huge consumption is second only to the champion cheese - eaters of Europe , the Greeks .
But the problem for French purists is the type of cheese that the French are wolfing down .
Raw milk cheese makes up only 15 % of the market .
Dozens of traditional cheese varieties have disappeared over the past 30 years as small producers die out or are bought up by industrial giants .
The new types of cheese created in France now include squeezable , spreadable , and artificially flavoured varieties which strike horror into experts who worry that French teenagers can no longer recognise a proper goat 's cheese as their palettes have been numbed .
Around 95 % of French cheese is now bought in supermarkets , where even cheesemonger counters are disappearing as people prefer their fromage packaged and ready sliced from a fridge unit .
" If it continues like this , in 10 years ' time traditional raw milk cheese will be over , " Richez - Lerouge said .
" France defends its terroir , its great chefs , but that 's just window - dressing , in fact France is the nation of Carrefour [ the world 's second - biggest supermarket giant ] and a vast density of McDonalds .
Consumers in France are n't aware of the disaster that 's happening . "
She said even Britain where , like the US and Spain , raw milk cheese is currently in fashion , traditional makers were held in more esteem .
At a table on Durand 's Normandy farm , Gérard Roger , a camembert historian and president of the newly - created Defence Committee for Authentic Camembert , reluctantly agreed to taste - test a mass - produced , big - selling supermarket camembert .
" Wow , it stinks , " he says sniffing the pale , uniform cheese .
" It 's dull , it tastes of nothing . "
Roger 's group , which has organised street demonstrations , see themselves as " guardians of the temple " .
Now they have won a victory in the AOC battle for raw milk camembert , they are lobbying to protect authentic production methods , encouraging more small farmers to make cheese using milk from local Normandy cows .
Francis Rouchaud the group 's secretary and a former marketing expert , said the big industrial producers wanted to put out a maximum number of Camembert products : " It 's Coca - Cola thinking " .
Lactalis , the world 's second largest dairy processor , countered : " We are not trying to kill off the small people , that does n't interest us at all .
We 're a global dairy company in 20 countries .
We 've got better things to do . "
A spokesman said that although the risk from raw milk was very small , for the company 's big brands it preferred not to take it .
He said there was nothing malicious in alerting the authorities to a bacteria - risk in competitor 's cheese .
Charlie Turnbull , an exclusive cheesemonger from Dorset and judge at the world cheese awards , was visiting Durand 's farm to pay homage to the " cathedral " of camembert .
" The French put art before enterprise , " he said .
" Whereas the British put enterprise before art . "
But small French producers are still on guard against mass - produced cheese .
Inspecting his matured Camemberts , Durand said : " We must keep fighting to defend raw milk cheese , but we can't do it alone , French consumers must help us . "

Henry Sawaged has been telling skeptics — especially his brother — that he is running a cathedral of booze , a wine and spirit colossus unmatched anywhere .
Finally , last month , he got framed proof .
It is a certificate from Guinness World Records declaring Daveco Liquors in Thornton the largest liquor store in the world .
Guinness ’s pronouncement spurred an impromptu celebration at Daveco — which Sawaged opened in November 2006 .
It was also a vindication of sorts for Sawaged , who always dreamed of being the biggest liquor vendor on the planet .
“ I kept saying this is the world ’s largest liquor store , and people kept saying ‘ You can never prove that , ’ ” said Sawaged .
“ But now people know I am a man of my word . ”
The 102,000 - square - foot Daveco is the size of most supermarkets in the metro area .
It includes a customer - service area , 66 beer cooler doors , a walk - in beer cooler , a humidity - and - temperature - controlled 7,500 - bottle wine cellar , a wine testing room and a cigar humidor .
There is also a sprawling kitchen and a 5,000 - square - foot basement .
In all , Daveco features $ 3 million in inventory including 9,000 types of wine , 2,400 brands of liquor and 800 different beers at the store , located at 16434 Washington St. , east of Interstate 25 , north of E -470 .
Thirty employees help customers who have come from Wyoming , Nebraska , Montana and Utah — all attracted by Daveco ’s legendary status , now confirmed .
“ A lot of people just want to be in the world ’s biggest liquor store , ” said store manager Ted Sutton .
The verification process demanded by Guinness was not easy , however .
Daveco officials had to gather statements from architects , surveyors , producers of media commercials and have them signed , sealed and notarized .
Sawaged ’s staffers then had to measure the store and follow precise , specific guidelines and be accurate to a “ .1th of a foot , ” according to Guinness .
Only retail space could be measured and included in the final packet of evidence sent to Guinness .
“ It was a lot like a lawyer ’s exhibit for court , ” said Rosalind Frascona , Daveco executive administrator .
Sawaged — whose parents , four brothers and three sisters emigrated from Jordan in 1979 — said he started Daveco to honor his father , David , who for years ran a 900 - square - foot liquor store in Thornton .
A friendly competition with his brother Issam also led to Daveco .
Issam runs the 50,000 - square - foot Davidson Liquors in Highlands Ranch and challenged his brother , Henry , to top him .
While Sawaged says smaller , nearby liquor stores are doing fine under Daveco ’s shadow , not everyone agrees .
Won Kil said Daveco has taken a chunk out of his business .
“ It has hurt us a little bit , ” said Kil , who with his wife runs a liquor store not far from Daveco .
But the local economy also has n’t helped .
“ We get a lot of construction workers , and when houses are n’t being built , we do n’t see them , ” Kil said .
Still , Daveco is just the tonic for a party , said Brighton ’s Sharon Farner .
She and friend Beth Semp pushed a grocery cart full of beer and wine after a visit to Daveco recently .
“ It ’s cheaper here , and they always have a good selection , ” Farner said .
“ I always find what I want . ”

Everywhere you look , a bottle of good cheer
At 102,000 square feet , Daveco is about the size of most area supermarkets .
7,500 Number of bottles in the wine cellar
9,000 Types of wine
2,400 Brands of liquor
800 Different beers

Pollster and independent political analyst
Has Barack Obama won the Democratic presidential nomination ?
Mr Obama is popular with moderate and independent voters
But the short answer to the question has to be no .
Senator Obama has now more states than his rival , Senator Hillary Clinton , including the last six ( plus the Virgin Islands and the national capital , Washington DC ) and he now leads among delegates pledged to vote for him at the Democratic National Convention .
In addition to his momentum of victories , he has made significant inroads into constituencies that were the core of his opponent 's support .
Thus , in Virginia and Maryland , exit polls revealed that he tied with Senator Clinton among white voters , and actually defeated her among women , lower - income voters , rural voters , those over 65 years of age , Catholics , and Hispanics .
Swing groups
Those numbers are very important because they show the meaning of momentum , which is so vital to understanding the primary process , and because they take away one of the main arguments that has been used against Mr Obama : that he is the African - American candidate who has more limited appeal than Mrs Clinton with mainstream voters .
Mr Obama 's victories are becoming numerous and sizeable .
In addition to expanding his political base among African Americans and young voters , he also has consistently demonstrated a greater appeal than Mrs Clinton among independents and moderates , swing groups that will give shape to the general election in November .
There is also an almost cult - like quality to Obama 's following
This in itself is a powerful argument for Obama 's nomination , because the Democratic nominee will likely face Republican Senator John McCain , who is very popular among centrist voters .
Above all , Obama generates an intense and growing level of emotion among young voters .
They are voting in record numbers in the primaries and can make the difference between victory and defeat for him in November .
' Clinton fatigue '
On the other side , Senator Clinton 's campaign has been going through a rough patch .
She is having difficulty raising money , she has accepted the resignations of both her campaign manager ( a Hispanic woman and long - time aide whose departure has not gone down well among Hispanics ) and deputy campaign manager .
Her staff are already pointing fingers of blame at each other - never a good sign when so much positive energy is needed .
Perhaps more than anything else , there is a growing feeling of " Clinton Fatigue " among insiders and ordinary voters .
Mrs Clinton still has core support among older women and Hispanics
After all , a voter in November 2008 has to be at least 42 years old to have voted in a general election in which a Bush or a Clinton did not emerge as the victor .
And finally , there are almost 800 " super - delegates " - elected officials or Democratic party leaders - who also get a vote at the convention .
A key question : why are n't these establishment types already backing Senator Clinton ?
Why are they waiting until the last minute ?
To me , that speaks volumes .
' Formidable '
On the other hand , this deal is not closed .
At this time of writing , the two candidates are nearly tied among pledged delegates , and even if Obama wins all of the remaining states with 55 % of the vote , he still falls short of the 2,025 total delegates he needs to secure the nomination .
Meanwhile , Clinton would continue to rack up almost the same number of delegates based on proportional voting .
Clinton is formidable .
She is after all a Clinton - she and her husband are popular , dogged , able campaigners .
She has been a successful senator and has core support among older women and Hispanics , both of whom can propel her to victory in Texas and Ohio and get her campaign rolling again .
There is also an almost cult - like quality to Obama 's following .
He generates a lot of heat and excitement - but can he sustain it ?
Will the press continue to love him tomorrow ?
And if negative ( or at least not glowing ) stories begin to appear in rapid succession , will his supporters still be so enthusiastic ?
So the nomination battle is far from over .
But - at least for now - Obama has truly taken his campaign much further than his opponents ever believed possible .
John Zogby is the President and CEO of Zogby International , an independent polling company in the US .
Mr. Leebaw added that the company had contributed more than $ 5 million to the American Red Cross in the last three years .
Image A first - aid kit sold on Target.com .
Johnson & Johnson is challenging such sales .
John T. Crisan , general counsel for Johnson & Johnson ’s consumer products division , said in an interview last night that the company had met with the American Red Cross to try to resolve the dispute .
Mr. Crisan said it was not clear how far the American Red Cross wanted to go in licensing the symbol for commercial purposes , noting that the red cross was a trademark of Johnson & Johnson before the American Red Cross was officially chartered .
Mr. Crisan said that some of the items being sold under licensing agreements by the American Red Cross seemed to compete directly with products sold by J.& J.
Mr. Everson said that the items the American Red Cross was licensing for retail sale include emergency preparedness kits and grooming kits .
The nonprofit organizations get part of the revenue from sales of those products , amounting to what he estimated was less than $ 10 million a year .
“ It ’s consistent with our mission , ” he said .
“ People will buy disaster kits , sometimes on an impulse basis .
That American Red Cross image on there gives them the confidence that there are the right things in the kit .
We think they ’re all done with that preparedness theme . ”
The lawsuit filed yesterday says that Johnson & Johnson has used the red cross symbol since 1887 on a wide range of products , including wound care products and first - aid kits , which include gloves , wipes , bandages and cream .
The company entered into an agreement with the American Red Cross in 1895 .
The agreement acknowledged Johnson & Johnson ’s exclusive right to the red cross as a “ trademark for chemical , surgical and pharmaceutical goods of every description , ” according to the lawsuit

Internet Dating 2.0 : Why Version 1.0 is Unsatisfying and Aversive
Online daters have become disillusioned with standard profile - based sites that are now the internet dating norm .
Trolling through endless profiles and reading near - identical bios often seems more like work than pleasure .
Research published in the Journal Of Interactive Marketing suggests this is because online dating interfaces tend to treat people like commodities – daters search profiles for matches using check - box categories , just as if they were shopping for a TV .
Consequently the big online dating sites have seen a reduction in their growth .
A new experiment , though , suggests that online dating could be improved with virtual dates in which people can experience each other in something closer to a real encounter .
Welcome to Internet Dating 2.0 .
The problem with online dating
The research , conducted by Jeana H. Frost and colleagues , first wanted to establish exactly how people use currently well - established online dating systems ( Frost , Chance , Norton & Ariely , 2008 ) .
Finding a connection with another person is all about the interaction : it is an experiential process .
In a survey of 132 internet daters , the researchers found that users of a profile - based online dating site spent seven times as long screening other people ’s profiles and sending emails than they did actually interacting face - to - face on real dates .
As a result participants reported finding online dating unsatisfying and aversive .
Frost and colleagues argue that part of the problem with online dating is the search mentality .
In reality what makes people click together is hard to boil down to a few attributes in a search box .
Finding a connection with another person is all about the interaction : it is an experiential process .
Online daters end up wasting so much time because the interface encourages endless ticking of boxes , searching profiles and sending emails , rather than actually experiencing another person .
Virtual dating
Instead of search - based online dating Frost and colleagues tested a new approach : the virtual date .
This encouraged participants to engage in a more interactive experience than simply viewing profiles :
Participants could instant message each other .
Images were displayed for the participants to talk about .
Simple avatars were displayed onscreen which participants controlled .
To evaluate the virtual date in comparison with the more usual profile - based online dating , Frost and colleagues had 24 participants ( half male , half female ) each randomly assigned to two other opposite - sex participants .
People preferred others who they had first met in the virtual environment to those whose profile they had read .
Each went on a virtual date with one of them and just viewed the profile of the other .
A day or two later all 24 participants met each other in the flesh at a speed - dating event .
After the dating each participant rated those they had met on liking , similarity , excitement and comfort .
The results showed that people preferred others who they had first met in the virtual environment to those whose profile they had read .
Further results also suggested that this was romantic - liking rather than just platonic - liking .
The future ?
Despite the small sample size in this study , the research does bode well for some of the new generation of dating technologies , dubbed ‘ Internet Dating 2.0 ’ , many of which do include virtual environments .
Of course virtual dates are still bleeding edge and it will inevitably take time for both the industry and online daters to adjust .
But when they do perhaps then singles will be spared the tedious task of skimming endless profiles in favour of heading off on potentially more successful virtual dates .

Plato Was An Asshole
Dear Neo-Platonist Society of America ,
Anyone that works in the mimetic arts eventually runs up against a criticism first raised in Plato 's Republic .
In books 2 , 3 , and 10 , Plato 's Socrates -- who serves as a mouthpiece for Plato 's ideas throughout the work and is not really Socrates -- makes the argument that there is no need for artists or storytellers in a perfect society .
He claims that because they are focused on mimesis instead of the eternal realm and are three steps removed from the gods , plus because they 're corruptors of children , they should be banished from the ideal society .
This is obviously total bullshit .
The first logical flaw is probably the most obvious .
Plato says that stories like the one he tells you you should be banned from the greatest possible world .
Let me repeat that .
Plato says that stories like the one he tells you you should be banned from the greatest possible world .
I 'm glad to hear that this book will never be published in Heaven , and that we are now able to expel him from the great Platoland writing community .
Second flaw : Plato was not right about everything .
Despite what your philosophy teacher might have said , or how large he wrote up that famous quote on the blackboard on the first day of class , Plato had some not - so - good ideas .
This is essentially the point Derrida is trying to get at in " " Plato 's Pharmacy , " but I 'm going to try to break it down for you in non-obscurantist style .
Here is some of the bullshit found in Republic .
But first , an ad hominem attack about some things Plato really liked : totalitarianism , eugenics , and sex with very young boys .
These are not good things .
Now , onto his actual theories : the Guardians , the leaders of this great land , " must not be laughter - loving .
For ordinarily when anyone abandons himself to violent laughter , his condition provokes a violent reaction . "
Musicians ?
They 're gone too .
" Our songs and airs , then , will not need instruments of large compass capable of modulation into all the modes , and we shall not maintain craftsmen to make them , in particular the flute , which has the largest compass of all .
That leaves the lyre and the cithara for use in the town ; and in the country the herdsmen may have some sort of pipe . "
You see , Plato does n't think that we should make flutes due to some obtuse moral principle .
Sounds like a fun society !
If I were having dinner with this guy , I would already be a little pissed off .
He has already talked way too much and been a little presumptuous in his ability to construct Platoland .
But in book 10 , we get treated to these passages :
He starts out with " We are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates .
Imitation is only a kind of play or sport , and the tragic poets , whether they write in iambic or in Heroic verse , are imitators in the highest degree . "
No knowledge worth mentioning ?
How much research has gone into the creation of novels , paintings , music , or theater ?
This statement is absurd on its face , but Plato 's fanclub responds with a cheer .
" Shall I propose , then , that [ poets and poetry ] be allowed to return from exile , but upon this condition only -- that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre ? "
That 's right .
He just gave all artists the boot .
Wait , art is not permitted in the greatest society ?
And this is coming from a philosopher ?
Either Plato was an asshole or he just wanted to get poets angry so they would write more .
Plato 's student Aristotle took him up on this offer .
Sir Philip Sidney also wrote one , and so did Percy Shelley .
Then after them , everyone else started .
You could say that in a way , each great poem ever written is a defense of poetry .
Each great painting made is a defense of visual art , each great story is a defense of stories , and each great film is a defense of great films .
So basically , the only good thing about Republic is that no one else really bought the idea .
Do you know what this means ?
It means that in the war between artists and philosophers , artists are winning .
With that said , in my ideal society , people would make art almost all the time , and people whose name started with a Plat - would not be allowed for my own arbitrary reasons .
Sincerely ,
Goodman Carter , Esq .
We saw the Beamz Laser Music System in pictures last week , but little we knew then how totally demented , how amazingly asstupid and musically retarded this " synthesizer music system " could be in real life .
Watch the video after the jump and marvel at the bozonic " one man rock band , " the loungetard " quiet reverie , " or the male - bonding " jam session . "
Update : the company has contacted me with some clarifications on this article and a test drive offer

" Everybody sounds great ! " they say .
Seriously , I had to check twice to see if this was a Conan O'Brien skit or not .
Unfortunately , we knew it 's just the worst infomercial and product in the history of the internet , available for $ 600 on April 15 .
And you have to love the Sharper Image comment when someone asks " are you using pre-sets ?
It seems that this is just signaling when to play a pre-set ? " in YouTube :
The answer depends on the definition of ' pre-sets ' .
Yes , the product has voices and samples assigned to each beam , but the music itself is generated algorithmically by the beamz software .
The user 's playing technique determines when and how much of the sounds / melody stream is triggered thus creating a potentially different arrangement with each use .

Please , do n't buy this product .

Update
So harsh that the public relations company that represents the product contacted me about it .
Needless to say , they were n't happy about it :
Jesus : Ouch !
- you really nailed us on the beamz video .
Okay , you do n't like the video - I get that .
But that 's not being fair to the product itself .
Of course , we do think the beamz offers plenty of opportunity for creativity and I am hoping you 'll see that when you get the product .
It is not meant to be a traditional musical instrument because that takes so much training for people to master .
The beamz was conceived and created by an accomplished Hollywood musician and songwriter whose goal was to allow the average music lover to experience the passion of making music .
Without a doubt , everyone who sees the beamz in person and uses it , absolutely loves it .
The beamz was a huge hit this weekend at its first major public event - Celebrity Fight Night .
You can find photos of the beamz at the event here .
Jesus , it 's easy to knock us for a video you do n't like - but I 'd rather you see and use the beamz , then give us a fair review based on the merits of the product - not based on whether you like the video .
So , as the PR agency representing the beamz , I am offering you the opportunity to borrow a set of beamz for a product review .
Are you willing to do that and give us a fair shot ?

Needless to say , I 'm testing this , even if I risk my soul and mental sanity in the process .
Hopefully , it will arrive soon and leave even earlier , but I will give it , like everything else , a fair shot .
VANCOUVER –
The head of the RCMP 's national drug branch is debunking claims by the United States ' drug czar , who claims organized crime rings in Canada are dumping dangerous , methamphetamine - laced " extreme ecstasy " into his country 's illegal drug market .
Supt .
Paul Nadeau said he does n't know why John Walters , of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , would make such statements in a widely distributed news release without checking facts with Canadian officials .
" I shook my head when I read the release that they put out , " said Nadeau , adding he 's never heard of extreme ecstasy .
" That term is unknown to us , certainly in Canada , and I can tell you that I 've spoken to law enforcement people in the U.S. and they 've never heard of it either so it would appear that it's a term that somebody came up with in a boardroom in Washington , D.C. "
The release has generated huge media buzz in the U.S. , with some news outlets using names such as " turbo - charged ecstasy , " which is supposedly flowing across the border from Canada .
In the release , issued earlier this month , Walters warns public health and safety leaders that more than 55 per cent of ecstasy samples seized in the U.S. last year contained meth , a stimulant that affects the central nervous system .
" This extreme ecstasy is a disturbing development in what has been one of the most significant international achievements against the illicit drug trade , " Walters said .
" Cutting their product with less expensive methamphetamine boosts profits for Canadian ecstasy producers , likely increases the addictive potential of their product and effectively gives a dangerous `facelift ' to a designer drug that had fallen out of fashion with young American drug users . "
Nadeau said there 's nothing new about ecstasy – the so - called love drug that gained popularity during the 1990s rave scene – being laced with methamphetamine or other stimulants and that it 's been happening for the last decade .
" According to our stats the presence of methamphetamines in ecstasy is dropping , " he said , adding tests by the RCMP indicate that currently , about 35 per cent of ecstasy pills contain meth , down from 75 per cent several years ago .
" Why now do they feel the need to announce this to the world ? " Nadeau said of the Office of National Drug Control Policy .
Walters ' office did not return calls from The Canadian Press .
But John Carnavale , an economist who worked for four previous U.S. drug czars between 1989 and 2000 , said Walters is ``cherry - picking data " to blame Canada .
He said that 's likely because of Canada 's harm - reduction approach to dealing with drug addiction , compared with the " user accountability " model American drug czars have preached .
" It was news to me that Canada was allegedly emerging as the source of supply ( for ecstasy ) .
Mexicans have really dominated the market , given the data up to now , " Carnavale said .
Walters ' news release could actually create demand for a form of extreme ecstasy , Carnavale said from Gaithersburg , Maryland .
" If I was a meth dealer in Canada I would certainly rebrand mine to `extreme ecstasy . ' "

Nadeau said that while the RCMP is concerned about drugs being smuggled into the United States , he disputes information in the release that is falsely attributed to the force .
" The Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) estimates that the current combined production capacity of Canadian ecstasy laboratories exceeds two million tablets a week , " it says .
" We have no idea where they came up with that , " Nadeau said .
" In the final analysis this stuff is driven by demand , " he said .
" If the U.S. population has an insatiable appetite for this stuff somebody 's going to be producing it for them so that 's the part of the equation they never seem to talk about . "
While Walters said in the release that ecstasy use had recently ``plummeted " in recent years , Nadeau said that contradicts the statistics .
" If anything , in the last 10 years , synthetic drugs , whether they be ecstasy or meth , the demand for them has gone through the roof . "
Scott Rintoul , spokesman for the RCMP's Drugs and Organized Crime Awareness Service in Vancouver , said there 's no doubt Canada is a major synthetic drug supplier for the U.S. and other countries , with 65 per cent of the production happening in British Columbia , followed closely by Ontario .
He said that for years , producers made ecstasy from a powder imported from Europe , but that it has more recently been replaced with a cheaper liquid precursor from Asia .

American liberalism and the Iraq War : The New York Times gives its blessing to Bush “ surge ”
By Patrick Martin
22 November 2007
A front - page report in Tuesday ’s New York Times gave the newspaper ’s stamp of approval to the Bush administration ’s policy in Iraq .
The report , spread across four columns under the headline , “ Baghdad ’s Weary Start to Exhale as Security Improves , ” described improving conditions of life and security in the war - torn Dora neighborhood in southern Baghdad , portraying it as the outcome of the massive US military buildup in the Iraqi capital .
The Times report consists of a single anecdotal account — the story of one Shiite family who fled sectarian violence in Dora and has now returned — buttressed by figures supplied by the US military and the Iraqi regime , showing a decline in violent attacks from the highs recorded in the early part of this year .
“ The security improvements in most neighborhoods are real , ” the article asserts .
“ Iraqis sound uncertain about the future , but defiantly optimistic .
Many Baghdad residents seem to be willing themselves to normalcy , ignoring risks and suppressing fears to reclaim their lives . ”
The family interviewed “ said they felt emboldened by the decline in violence citywide and the visible presence of Iraqi soldiers at a checkpoint a few blocks away , ” the article continues , although , significantly , no quotes are offered to substantiate this supposed sentiment .
After laying it on thick in this fashion , the Times is compelled to admit that the Shiite family profiled is more the exception than the rule .
It describes the condition of a second Shiite family , the Nidhals , who fled violence in the west Baghdad neighborhood of Ghazaliya and have not returned because a Sunni family now occupies their home .
“ In Baghdad there are far more families like the Nidhals , ” the newspaper concedes , citing official figures : “ About 20,000 Iraqis have gone back to their Baghdad homes , a fraction of the more than 4 million who fled nationwide , and the 1.4 million people in Baghdad who are still internally displaced , according to a recent Iraqi Red Crescent Society survey . ”
Why then the rose - colored portrayal of conditions in the Iraqi capital , prominently displayed in the most important American newspaper ?
Clearly what is involved here is a political adaptation by the Times , the most influential voice of official liberalism , to the Bush administration ’s policies in Iraq .
The political consequences were immediate , as the Times report became the basis of countless further comments , cascading through the American media , about “ things looking up in Iraq . ”
The right - wing press , of course , gloated that the success of the military surge in Iraq was evident “ even to the New York Times , ” supposedly the most implacable critic of the war .
The foreign policy columnist for the Times , Thomas Friedman , a leading cheerleader for the initial US invasion who has more recently been silent on the subject , wrote the following day : “ Right now what is indisputable is that we are seeing the first crack in years in a wall of pessimism that has been the Iraq story .
It is only a crack , but it creates new possibilities . ”
The upbeat mood in the corporate - controlled media reached the point that ABC News anchorman Charles Gibson , in a sycophantic interview with George and Laura Bush at Camp David , broadcast Tuesday night , asked Bush whether he now felt inclined to “ say I told you so ” about the progress in Iraq .
The first thing that must be said about this outbreak of self - congratulation in official political and media circles is that it represents a form of gross self - delusion ( perhaps best displayed by Bush himself , when he declared in the same interview that Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was “ truly somebody who believes in democracy ” and that , despite declaring a state of emergency and rounding up thousands of political opponents , Musharraf had not “ crossed the line ” that would make his conduct unacceptable to the White House . )
Moreover , while Iraqi attacks on US targets appear to have fallen compared to earlier this year , US attacks on Iraqi targets have not .
The Los Angeles Times reported November 17 , citing figures supplied by Air Force Major General David Edgington , director of air operations in Iraq , that aerial bombings by US forces had more than quadrupled , from 229 in all of 2006 to close to one thousand so far this year , about three a day .
US bombing attacks account for more than ten percent of Iraqi violent deaths since the March 2003 invasion and occupation , according to a number of published studies , and estimates of the number killed in such attacks range up to over 100,000 .
US air strikes frequently result in atrocities in which entire families are slaughtered because their homes were targeted as alleged terrorist hideouts .
The drop in the number of reported acts of violence in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq is relative and may well be transitory .
The level of violence is still far above what it was during the first three years of the US occupation , prior to the bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra in February 2006 which touched off 18 months of savage sectarian bloodletting , particularly by Shiite militias targeting Sunnis .
Part of the decline is no doubt due to the fact that significant sections of Baghdad are already “ ethnically cleansed ” as a consequence of the previous sectarian conflict .
Time Magazine reporter Charles Crain , who published an article on November 19 along similar lines to the Times piece ( “ Baghdad Residents Return — Warily ” ) noted , “ The use of Sunni men to defend Sunni enclaves hints at a more grim explanation for the drop in violence : many neighborhoods have completed their brutal sectarian segregation , leaving fewer easy targets for intimidation and murder . ”
Much of the reduction is the result , not of supposed US military success , but of political decisions by several of the key forces in Iraqi politics , including Sunni tribal sheiks who have formed an alliance with the US occupation regime in return for cash , weapons and military training , and the Shiite leader Moqtada al - Sadr , who announced a six - month ceasefire by his Mahdi Army militia in August .
In what may be a covert quid pro quo , US military forces have since then carried out comparatively few raids into the Mahdi Army strongholds in eastern Baghdad .
Both the Sunni sheiks and al - Sadr are politically opposed to the government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and claim to oppose the US occupation .
They are evidently calculating that they should avoid direct confrontation with the US military while they build up their forces for the next round of civil war , perhaps after January 2009 .
There are certainly illusions — as widespread in Iraq as in the United States — that if a Democrat succeeds Bush in the White House there will be a significant change in US policy , including a substantial withdrawal of military forces .
Such hopes are grotesquely misplaced .
The politics of the Democratic Party and the politics of the New York Times , which are more or less identical , take as their starting point the interests of the American ruling class in the Middle East — access to oil resources and control of a critical geo-strategic region .
To the extent that the Democrats and the Times criticize Bush , it is not because he has waged an illegal war of aggression that has killed more than one million Iraqis , but that he has conducted the war incompetently and largely unsuccessfully , and thus weakened the world position of American imperialism .
That is what gives such a half - hearted and two - faced character to their supposed “ antiwar ” stance .
The Democrats are constantly on their guard against the possibility that the Bush administration may “ turn the corner ” and win at least a temporary military respite in Iraq , which would immediately transform them from critics into cheerleaders .
The Democratic - controlled Congress has refused to cut off funding and use its power of the purse to end the war in Iraq .
None of the major Democratic presidential candidates will commit to a withdrawal date from Iraq as far off as January 2013 , when they would be inaugurated for a second term in office .
The reports led prosecutors and investigators to what some describe as a kind of crossroads .
While they do not routinely investigate allegations concerning public officials who pay for sex , the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation regard public corruption as a high priority and routinely investigate allegations of even low - level wrongdoing .
“ If the government gets a Suspicious Activity Report about a high - ranking public official , they would be negligent not to pursue it , if only to determine whether there was bribery or extortion involved , ” said Robert D. Luskin , a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor .
Mr. Luskin said that as the case proceeds , the more difficult questions could well involve how the information about Mr. Spitzer became public and whether the government “ will prosecute Spitzer if it does n’t prosecute others in the same situation . ”
The Treasury reports led federal investigators to the Emperor ’s Club and Mr. Spitzer ’s involvement with prostitutes , and later to the 47 - page affidavit filed with the complaint that referred to him as Client 9 .
The officials said that once they learned that such a prominent figure was involved in soliciting prostitutes , and had seemed to be arranging sex in violation of the statute that prohibits travel across state lines to engage in sex , they wanted to follow the evidence .
Moreover , several asserted that had they dropped the matter or given Mr. Spitzer ’s conduct only cursory examination , they almost certainly would have been accused of a cover - up for failing to aggressively investigate possible misconduct by a public official .
In defending their handling of the case , officials said that in the end , investigators chose to monitor his conduct but made no effort to set up a sting , or an arranged situation in which Mr. Spitzer might implicate himself .
They did not surreptitiously record his activities inside the hotel or seek to obtain DNA evidence .
It was not necessary , as Mr. Spitzer proved to be easy prey , according to the affidavit , which was signed by an F.B.I. agent .
It indicated that on Feb. 13 federal agents staked out his hotel in Washington , and it contained recorded conversations that amply demonstrated that he willingly had a sexual encounter with a prostitute .
Afterward she was recorded on a wiretap telling an Emperor ’s Club employee : “ I do n’t think he ’s difficult .
I mean it ’s kind of like , whatever . ”
Once upon a time , there were parrots living in America .
Not the escaped kind we know today that steal away from airports and apartments to find improbable refuge in Brooklyn or Chicago , but wild parrots that evolved here in their own slow , mysterious way .
They were large , colorful , noisy birds , found from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf of Mexico .
John James Audubon noted the decline in the Carolina parakeet back in the mid-19th century , but the birds hung on in the wild until the turn of the 20th century .
The last known Carolina parakeet died in the Cincinnati Zoo 90 years ago , on Feb. 21 , 1918 .
His name was Incas .
He had outlived Martha , the very last passenger pigeon -- which also died in the Cincinnati Zoo -- by four years .
Once you get a celebrity cage and a human name , it is usually over for your species .
What is the right way to honor the memory of Incas and his species on the anniversary of their extinction ?
And what lessons are there to apply from his death ?
One lesson is the importance of zoos .
It is big news , understandably , when a tiger escapes , but as a rule , it is the animals that need protection from us , not the other way around .
Incas was n’t the only caged Carolina parakeet , and there were even pairs that hatched out young , but as Christopher Cokinos points out in his excellent history of extinct birds , no effort was made to coordinate among the zoos to create a diverse breeding flock .
Or to rescue the eggs that Incas and his mate repeatedly tossed out of their nest .
That thinking has changed .
I remember looking at Micronesian kingfishers some years ago in the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago .
These birds are extinct in the wild , but in the 1980s , before they winked out altogether , scientists gathered up 29 remaining birds and have been successfully breeding them with an eye to returning them to an island close to where they once lived ( without the snakes , introduced accidentally by humans , that killed them off ) .
Another lesson is that birds need protection from our sentimental urge to see them as simple creatures that can be “ saved ” without a radical change in our thinking about the world .
Saving birds means nothing if we do n’t re-create an environment for them to live in .
Birds are not dangerous , like tigers -- unless , of course , bird flu becomes a threat -- but they are wild , and they live inside an infinitely complex web of complementary dependencies .
The Carolina parakeet became extinct for the usual reasons -- hunting by humans , loss of habitat .
But also , it seems , for a few unusual reasons , like the spread of honeybees -- brought here by European settlers and referred to by Indians as “ the white man ’s flies ” -- that took over the hollow logs the birds nested in .
Though the Carolina parakeet managed to hang on in land developed for farming , this very adaptability may , in a crowning irony , have proved its undoing since it is speculated that proximity to human habitation exposed the birds to poultry disease , which they could not withstand .
In this sense , they fell victim to the law of unintended consequences as well as our own rapacity .
Not that rapacity is to be underestimated .
Frank Chapman , the man who created the Christmas bird count , the annual volunteer effort to tally bird populations , inaugurated in 1900 in New York City , tells a chilling story about Carolina parakeets .
Chapman was a pioneering ornithologist at the American Museum of Natural History , and he devised the bird count as a way of sublimating the hunting urge and replacing it with the conservation urge , the counting urge -- in short , the bird - watching urge .
But Chapman was also a hunter , and he tells a story in his memoir about a shooting trip he made in Florida in 1897 , when there were hardly any Carolina parakeets left .
Chapman learned about a small flock and , unable to resist gathering rare specimens , shot them .
Looking at the bodies laid out before him , he vowed to shoot no more of the birds .
But later that day , he stumbled on another small cluster and killed them too .
“ Good resolutions , ” he wrote , “ like many other things , are much easier to plan than to practice . ”
This dual heritage -- the killing urge and the conserving urge -- lies at the heart of our relationship to nature , and it is only by acknowledging it that we will do right by the wild world around us .
This is why hunters often make the most pragmatic , and effective , conservationists .
And why it is fitting that Audubon lent his name to bird conservation , though he too was a great hunter .
He spent his life killing birds , impaling them on wires in animated poses , and then painting them as if they were alive .
On the very first page of his memoir , Audubon describes the death of a parrot as if it were a murder .
It is an extraordinarily strange but meaningful story .
According to Audubon , his mother , a highborn Louisiana lady living in St. Domingue , kept a number of parrots as well as several pet monkeys .
One morning , one of the parrots asked for breakfast , and a monkey , offended for some reason , stood up and killed the bird .
Little Audubon was so traumatized by this primal scene that he recalled it , he writes , thousands of times , noting that it was responsible for his lifelong love of birds .
One of the things that makes the story disturbing is that Audubon was creating a sort of racial parable with his tale -- his mother , he later tells the reader , was killed by blacks in the slave revolt that turned St. Domingue into Haiti ; his story , therefore , feels like a weird racial parable in which his mother is somehow the delicate bird and the black slaves are the killer primates .
But Audubon was lying -- his mother was n’t killed in St. Domingue ; she died in childbirth and was a chambermaid .
Audubon was fabricating a story to hide his illegitimacy .
Which is something I believe many of us do in relationship to nature -- hide our origins .
Darwin , after all , has made monkeys of us all .
Racism is merely the crudest attempt to force a single group to bear the burden of our shared animal natures .
Looking at birds , at any wildlife , brings us into contact not only with these creatures but with ourselves -- as we are , and as we wish to be .
We are both the talking bird and the killer primate -- as Audubon clearly knew at some level , intent as he was on both killing birds and bringing them back to life .
And we need to fit our understanding of the natural world into our understanding of ourselves .
I sometimes wonder how it is that the passenger pigeon is more often remembered than the Carolina parakeet .
To be sure , it was the more dramatic loss because its flocks took days to pass , and it is speculated that the birds , numbering in the billions , accounted for one - quarter of the bird life in the United States .
But I also think it ’s worth noting the dates of the two birds ’ disappearance .
Martha the passenger pigeon died in September 1914 , just one month into the World War I , which the United States had not yet entered .
Four years later -- after millions of wartime deaths and a complete upheaval in the world order -- Incas the Carolina parakeet died .
The fall of a sparrow , or any bird at all , must hardly have weighed much against the balance of human carnage , about to be doubled by the Spanish flu pandemic .
Today , amid war and terrorist threats and daily worries about the economy , there are certainly enough global distractions to keep us from recalling the Carolina parakeet or noticing the creatures in need of our protection .
But according to Watchlist , put together by the American Bird Conservancy and the Audubon Society , one in four bird species in this country is imperiled .
These birds do not all live in the same place or suffer for the same reasons -- for the Hawaiian duck , it is the introduction of cats and dogs and mongoose , as well as the destruction of wetlands .
For the Bicknell ’s thrush , nesting in specific elevated regions of the Adirondacks or Catskills , it may be acid rain that has reduced its habitat .
A lot of what we know about the numbers of these birds comes from what the Audubon Society calls “ citizen scientists ” -- concerned watchers who participate in annual tallies of the sort pioneered by regretful parakeet killer Frank Chapman .
Just identifying the problem , opening our eyes to the natural world , marks a beginning .
There is no single , simple solution , and we are not going to suddenly choose the preservation of nature over economic growth .
Bird - watchers know that balance is the key -- the watcher and the watched , the hunter and the conservationist , the talking parrot and the killer primate .
All of us need to shoulder the responsibility of becoming “ citizen scientists , ” or at least “ citizen naturalists . ”
We might as well begin by remembering Incas , last of his species , a wild animal with a human name who died in a zoo 90 years ago .
Jonathan Rosen , a novelist and essayist , is the editorial director of Nextbook .
His book about bird - watching , “ The Life of the Skies : Birding at the End of Nature , ” is being published this month .

The goal of last Thursday 's election was to fulfill two Maoist demands : write a new Constitution and end the country 's 240 - year monarchy .
But concerns are growing that Nepal 's moderate political parties – which coaxed the Maoists into mainstream politics and forgave past atrocities in the interests of peace – might be sidelined and a more radical agenda prevail .
What matters now , analysts say , is how the Maoists themselves interpret the will of Nepalis .
" If they take this as an endorsement of their policy of mass annihilation of class enemies , it will be a catastrophe , " says Yubaraj Ghimire , editor of Newsfront weekly .
" If they take this as people 's recognition of them as the key agent of change , it will be easy for Maoists to work and good for the country as well . "
By late Monday , the Maoists had won in 112 of 202 constituencies where counting of the direct vote had concluded .
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala 's Nepali Congress , which has dominated politics for six decades , had won just 32 seats , while the Communist Party of Nepal ( CPN - UML ) had won 28 seats .
Another 335 seats are allocated proportionally according to each party 's percentage of votes , and the remaining 26 members of the 601 - member assembly will be nominated by the government .
Vote counting for the proportional seats is under way .
International and national election monitors hailed the polls as a success .
But reports of intimidation surfaced , with Maoists warning rural , poorly educated voters that they would be watching the polling booths and would know who voted for whom .
Mr. Ghimire also argues that voters were terrified by the Maoist threat of going back to war in case of defeat .
But another factor in the Maoists ' strong showing may have been the perception that they hewed to a consistent agenda – forming a republic – while the leading Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal shifted toward the Maoist agenda as it became more politically expedient .
" The CPN - UML went to the election with an identity crisis , " says political analyst Krishna Hatchetu .
" The CPN - UML gradually became less left since they joined multiparty politics after mass protests in 1990 .
In this election , the pro-left voters had the choice to vote between the CPN - UML and the radical Maoists .
The people chose the Maoists . "
The crushing defeat of his party prompted CPN - UML General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal to resign Sunday from the post he had held for 15 years .
The former CPN - UML chieftain was also humiliated by his defeat in Katmandu by a little - known Maoist candidate .
A majority of top leaders from the Nepali Congress , including four relatives of the prime minister and powerful ministers in the current cabinet , also were defeated , mostly by Maoist candidates .
The casualties included the party 's acting president , Sushil Koirala , who announced his resignation .
The two parties made a policy switch from " constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy " to " federal democratic republic " last year after sensing overwhelming support for a republic during the peaceful uprising in April 2006 that forced King Gyanendra to relinquish executive authorities he grabbed in a military coup in 2005 .
Despite their stunning victory , the days ahead might not be easy for the Maoists , analysts say , especially as they will now have to deliver on tall promises , including swift economic transformation .
" The people have given legitimacy to the Maoists , " says C.K. Lal , a noted political columnist .
" But they have yet to get acceptance .
And remember , there is only a prefix that separates legitimacy and illegitimacy . "
So far , the Maoists have indicated that they understand the people 's message .
Speaking during a rally after his victory from a constituency in Katmandu this weekend , Prachanda , the leader of the Maoists , promised that his party would continue to work with other political parties , strengthen relations with the international community , and shoulder the responsibility entrusted by the people to build lasting peace .
The party 's chief ideologue , Baburam Bhattarai , who is the most likely prime ministerial candidate from the party , said on Sunday that the new government " that will be formed under our leadership " will have participation from all parties represented in the constituent assembly .
Mr. Bhattarai's wife , Hisila Yami , was declared the winner in her constituency .
But analysts say the Nepali Congress and CPN - UML , with an eye on the next election , might opt to sit in opposition and let the Maoists try to deliver without any support from them , something that could hinder legislative efforts .
Among immediate challenges the Maoists will face after forming a government is ensuring a smooth supply of fuel without making the unpopular decision of raising fuel prices .
For the past year , the state - owned Nepal Oil Corp . has borne heavy losses as a result of the disparity between local prices of fuel and international prices .
And Indian Oil Corp. , the monopoly supplier of fuel to Nepal , has regularly cut supplies in a bid to force payment .
Also , the Maoists will have to help solve the country 's current power shortages , which leave Nepalese without electricity for eight hours each day .
The interim constitution says the elected assembly will have to come up with a constitution within two years , after which a general election must be held for a government that will sit for five years .
Put simply , this is one of the most amazing stop- motion Transformers clips we ’ve come across .
It shows Optimus Prime battling Bumblebee .

The Constitution of the United States is absolutely clear when it comes to matters of torture .
Amendment 8 specifically states that , ” Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted . ”
Acts of torture are by definition and common understanding — certainly at the time of the drafting of the nation ’s essential document and arguably even in this less - enlightened era — cruel and unusual punishments
Vice President Dick Cheney , when he assumed the second most powerful office in the land after the disputed election of 2000 , swore an oath to “ support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic ” and to “ bear true faith and allegiance to the same . ”
Any reasonable reader of that oath would conclude that Cheney bound himself to abide by the Constitution — and thus to avoid any involvement with the promotion of acts of torture upon detainees of the United States government .
Yet we now know from revelations made by former senior intelligence officials to ABC News and the Associated Press that Cheney and other members of the administration — who apparently took care to insulate President Bush from a series of meetings where CIA interrogation methods were discussed — authorized the use of waterboarding and other generally recognized torture techniques .
There is no question that Cheney violated his oath of office , which bound him to support and defend a Constitution that he disregarded .
The question is : How will responsible Americans respond ?
The power to hold Cheney to account rests with Congress .
The power to get Congress to act rests with the American people .
Former Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson , a respected lawyer who has been working with a number of other Constitutional experts and activists , has responded — not just to Cheney ’s trashing of the Constitution but to the long list of Bush administration wrongs .
Anderson is circulating a letter that reads :
As patriotic Americans , we believe in knowing the truth about our government .
Regardless of political affiliation , we believe in our constitutional democracy .
We believe in the rule of law “ “ that no person , regardless of position , is above the law .
We believe in respecting basic human rights “ “ and have been proud to distinguish our nation from those countries where people are kidnapped , disappeared , and tortured .
We believe that in a democracy likes ours , citizens are entitled to know whether government officials are living up to their oaths to defend and preserve the Constitution , and whether they are abusing the human rights of people here or elsewhere in the world .
This is not a partisan matter .
It is a matter of responsible citizenship .
Recently , several conscientious members of the House Judiciary Committee , including the Chair , Congressman John Conyers , have indicated support for public hearings to investigate and disclose the facts concerning claims of illegal conduct and other abuses of power by members of the Executive Branch .
If misconduct has occurred , the American people are entitled to know .
If misconduct has not occurred , hearings will determine and disclose that as well .
By showing that the American people “ “ without political partisanship “ “ support the disclosure of the truth through public hearings , we can make a difference , together standing up for the truth , the rule of law , and our Constitution .
“ ¢
We are entitled to know whether members of the Executive Branch misrepresented the facts and withheld crucial information , thereby deceiving our nation and the international community before the invasion of Iraq .
“ ¢ As American citizens who value the system of checks and balances among the three branches of government , we are entitled to know whether that system has been seriously undermined .
We are entitled to know whether the courts and Congress have fulfilled their important constitutional roles in investigating and disclosing the misuse of Executive power .
“ ¢ Our nation has engaged in the unprecedented , illegal , and immoral kidnapping , disappearance , and torture of human beings around the world ( some of whom have been proven to be innocent of any wrongdoing ) , with no due process , in complete secrecy , and with no accountability .
Even US citizens have been held in prisons indefinitely , with no legal counsel , no trial , and no charges filed against them .
As Americans , we are entitled to know what has occurred in connection with these human rights abuses .
In our democratic system of government , there must be full accountability .
Speaking out together , as concerned , patriotic Americans , we can send a clear message to Congress :
In the United States , the rule of law must prevail , our Constitution cannot be disregarded , and the fundamental morality to which our nation has always laid claim will be restored .
Anderson asks that Americans who support the principles outlined in this letter — as I do — go to his Restore the Rule of Law website and sign on .
Signing this letter , says Anderson , who has opened an important dialogue about the Constitution and White House accountability with Conyers and other key players on the Judiciary Committee , “ indicates to Congressman Conyers , other members of the House Judiciary Committee , and Congress as a whole that you support efforts to investigate and disclose any illegal acts and abuses of power by the President and others in his administration .
Declare to the world , and to our posterity , that , as a US citizen :
“ ¢ You proudly support our long - held constitutional principles .
“ ¢ You are speaking out to reaffirm our democracy .
“ ¢ You demand accountability for those in our government who have disregarded our Constitution , violated statutory law , or engaged in immoral human - rights abuses . ”
Anderson ’s is an authentic patriotic response to the latest revelations about Dick Cheney ’s disregard for the Constitution .
Go to the Restore the Rule of Law website and sign on and do what Cheney did not : support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic .

UD - led team sets solar cell record , joins DuPont on $ 100 million project
UD researchers Christiana Honsberg and Allen Barnett
5:14 p.m. , July 23 , 2007 -- Using a novel technology that adds multiple innovations to a very high - performance crystalline silicon solar cell platform , a consortium led by the University of Delaware has achieved a record - breaking combined solar cell efficiency of 42.8 percent from sunlight at standard terrestrial conditions .
That number is a significant advance from the current record of 40.7 percent announced in December and demonstrates an important milestone on the path to the 50 percent efficiency goal set by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .
In November 2005 , the UD - led consortium received approximately $ 13 million in funding for the initial phases of the DARPA Very High Efficiency Solar Cell ( VHESC ) program to develop affordable portable solar cell battery chargers .
Combined with the demonstrated efficiency performance of the very high efficiency solar cells ' spectral splitting optics , which is more than 93 percent , these recent results put the pieces in place for a solar cell module with a net efficiency 30 percent greater than any previous module efficiency and twice the efficiency of state - of - the - art silicon solar cell modules .
As a result of the consortium 's technical performance , DARPA is initiating the next phase of the program by funding the newly formed DuPont - University of Delaware VHESC Consortium to transition the lab - scale work to an engineering and manufacturing prototype model .
This three - year effort could be worth as much as $ 100 million , including industry cost - share .
The ground - breaking research was led by Allen Barnett , principal investigator and UD professor of electrical and computer engineering , and Christiana Honsberg , co-principal investigator and associate professor of electrical and computer engineering .
The two direct the University 's High Performance Solar Power Program and will continue working to achieve 50 percent efficiency , a benchmark that when reached would mean a doubling of the efficiency of terrestrial solar cells based around a silicon platform within a 50 - month span .
“ The University of Delaware is very proud of the achievements of Allen Barnett and Christiana Honsberg , both their research and their work in leading the consortium , ” UD President Patrick T. Harker said .
“ We are grateful to DARPA for its confidence in the University and very much look forward to working with DuPont and our other partners in industry , government and academia on this project , which will have wide application and will be of particular benefit to our men and women in the service . ”
“ UD has become an important center for renewable energy research , and we applaud the efforts of the University - led consortium , ” UD Provost Dan Rich said .
“ This project is of vital importance , particularly given the pressing need for alternative sources of energy . ”
" The University is committed to the advancement of leading - edge research that solves important problems and results in the invention of new technologies aimed at enhancing society , " Carolyn Thoroughgood , vice provost for research and graduate studies at UD , said .
" This project highlights the quality of research at UD and also demonstrates the value of collaboration . "
“ The achievement of this benchmark is a major step forward in the ongoing development of low - cost solar photovoltaic technology , ” Rhone Resch , president of the Solar Energy Industries Association , said .
“ Furthermore , we applaud DARPA for making a strategic investment in American 's energy security .
We anticipate that this project will result in a wide range of commercial solar applications that will benefit the U.S. military and American consumers alike . ”
" Many of us have been working with programs to take us to a real photovoltaic energy future .
This project is already working in that future .
DARPA has leapfrogged the ' conventional , ' demonstrating that creativity and focus can significantly accelerate revolutionary research - bench concepts toward reality , demonstrating this does not have to take decades , ” Lawrence L. Kazmerski , director of the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Center for Photovoltaics at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo . , said .
“ This is a first step - but a significant one in making sure our energy future is what we know it should look like . "
The consortium 's goal is to create solar cells that operate at 50 percent in production , Barnett said .
With the fresh funding and cooperative efforts of the DuPont - UD consortium , he said it is expected new high efficiency solar cells could be in production by 2010 .
The highly efficient VHESC solar cell uses a novel lateral optical concentrating system that splits solar light into three different energy bins of high , medium and low , and directs them onto cells of various light sensitive materials to cover the solar spectrum .
The system delivers variable concentrations to the different solar cell elements .
The concentrator is stationary with a wide acceptance angle optical system that captures large amounts of light and eliminates the need for complicated tracking devices .
The VHESC would have immediate application in the high - technology military , which increasingly relies upon a variety of electronics for individual soldiers and the equipment that supports them .
As well , it is hoped the solar cells will have a large number of commercial applications .
Today , the American soldier carries a pack that weighs nearly 100 pounds of which about 20 pounds are the three - day supply of batteries needed to power their gear .
The DARPA program aims to dramatically reduce the battery logistics pipeline and provide the soldier with more power at reduced weight , thus improving mobility , survivability and the availability of advanced electronic technologies on the battlefield .
With the dramatically higher efficiency of the VHESC technology , solar rechargers could be integrated into common battlefield devices such as night vision goggles , radios and GPS navigation systems .
Barnett and Honsberg said that reaching the 42.8 percent mark is a significant advance in solar cell efficiency , particularly given the unique small and portable architecture being used by the consortium and the short time - 21 months - in which it was developed .
Modern solar cell systems rely on the concentration of the sun 's rays , a concept similar to youngsters using magnifying glasses to set scraps of paper on fire .
Honsberg said the previous best of 40.7 percent efficiency was achieved with a high concentration device that requires sophisticated tracking optics and features a concentrating lens the size of a table and more than 30 centimeters , or about 1 foot , thick .
The UD consortium 's devices are potentially far thinner at less than 1 centimeter .
“ This is a major step toward our goal of 50 percent efficiency , ” Barnett said .
“ The percentage is a record under any circumstance , but it 's particularly noteworthy because it's at low concentration , approximately 20 times magnification .
The low profile and lack of moving parts translates into portability , which means these devices easily could go on a laptop computer or a rooftop . ”
Honsberg said the advance of 2 percentage points is noteworthy in a field where gains of 0.2 percent are the norm and gains of 1 percent are seen as significant breakthroughs .
“ This achievement is the direct result of the new architecture we developed under the DARPA program , ” Barnett and Honsberg said .
“ By integrating the optical design with the solar cell design , we have entered previously unoccupied design space leading to a new paradigm about how to make solar cells , how to use them , and what they can do . ”
During the first 21 months of the VHESC program , a diverse team of academia , government lab and industrial partners , led by UD , was focused on developing the technology basis for a new extremely high efficiency solar cell .
The rapid success of that effort has enabled the present transition to a focus on prototype product development .
The team 's novel approach provides for affordability and also flexibility in the choice of materials and the integration of new technologies as they are developed .
Barnett credits the early success of the program to the team approach taken to solving the problem .
Partners in the initial phase included BP Solar , Blue Square Energy , Energy Focus , Emcore and SAIC .
Key research contributors included the University of Delaware , National Renewable Energy Laboratory , Georgia Institute of Technology , Purdue University , University of Rochester , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , University of California Santa Barbara , Optical Research Associates and the Australian National University .
“ What we 've done , ” he said , “ is create a virtual lab by having all of these companies , universities and national laboratories in the consortium .
This has given us access to a broad range of capabilities in terms of expertise and equipment . ”
That approach is exemplified by the fact that the record - breaking system features three types of solar cells - one made by industry ( Emcore ) , one by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and one by UD .
“ This is a solar cell that works , ” Barnett said , adding , “ This technology has the potential to change the way electricity is generated throughout the world . ”
Barnett believes the 50 percent efficiency mark is just the beginning .
“ Our best inventions are in front of us , ” he said .
“ The consortium has been a super team , and has worked to develop new devices and architectures based on a breakthrough design paradigm . ”
Honsberg said the efficiency potential for solar cells is significantly higher still , which leaves “ large room for improvement . ”
She said she enjoys the engineering challenge , particularly in a field in which “ we create things that make a difference . ”
The newly formed DuPont - University of Delaware VHESC consortium will be made up of industrial partners , national laboratories and universities .
“ The new consortium will build upon the considerable technical successes of the first phases of the VHESC program and provide the strong industry - led and product - focused leadership required to ultimately bring the VHESC product to commercialization , ” Barnett said .
“ We look forward to working with DuPont and others to continue our progress in developing this novel solar power research . ”
UD offers one of the nation 's broadest research programs in photovoltaics .
It is home to the High Performance Solar Power Program in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Institute of Energy Conversion , a multidisciplinary laboratory devoted to the research and development of thin film photovoltaic solar cells .
Honsberg is developing one of the nation 's most complete courses of study for solar power systems , which is partially sponsored by the National Science Foundation 's Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training ( IGERT ) program .
Barnett earned a doctorate in electrical engineering from Carnegie - Mellon University , is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ( IEEE ) , was awarded the IEEE 's William R. Cherry Award for outstanding contributions to the advancement of photovoltaic science and technology and won UD's Karl W. Ber Solar Energy Medal of Merit in 2001 for “ pioneering high - performance , thin - crystalline silicon solar cells , founding and leading a world - class enterprise for the commercialization of solar electric products , and outstanding continuing service to the solar electric power community . ”
Honsberg earned a bachelor 's degree in electrical engineering in 1986 , a master 's degree in 1989 and a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering in 1992 , all from UD .
She was an associate professor in the Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering at the University of New South Wales from 1993 - 2000 and an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Georgia Tech before joining the UD faculty in 2004 .

Woman Takes Two - Year Toilet Break A Kansas woman needs medical attention after living in a bathroom for two years .
March 12 , 2008  -- WICHITA , Kan . ( AP ) --
Authorities are considering charges in the bizarre case of a woman who sat on her boyfriend 's toilet for two years -- so long that her body was stuck to the seat by the time the boyfriend finally called police .
Ness County Sheriff Bryan
Whipple said it appeared the 35 - year - old Ness City woman 's skin had grown around the seat .
She initially refused emergency medical services but was finally convinced by responders and her boyfriend that she needed to be checked out at a hospital .
" We pried the toilet seat off with a pry bar and the seat went with her to the hospital , " Whipple said .
" The hospital removed it . "
Whipple said investigators planned to present their report Wednesday to the county attorney , who will determine whether any charges should be filed against the woman 's 36 - year - old boyfriend .
" She was not glued .
She was not tied .
She was just physically stuck by her body , " Whipple said .
" It is hard to imagine .
... I still have a hard time imagining it myself . "
He told investigators he brought his girlfriend food and water , and asked her every day to come out of the bathroom .
" And her reply would be , ` Maybe tomorrow , " ' Whipple said .
" According to him , she did not want to leave the bathroom . "
The boyfriend called police on Feb. 27 to report that " there was something wrong with his girlfriend , " Whipple said , adding that he never explained why it took him two years to call .
Police found the clothed woman sitting on the toilet , her sweat pants down to her mid-thigh .
She was " somewhat disoriented , " and her legs looked like they had atrophied , Whipple said .
" She said that she did n't need any help , that she was OK and did not want to leave , " he said .
She was reported in fair condition at a hospital in Wichita , about 150 miles southeast of Ness City .
Whipple said she has refused to cooperate with medical providers or law enforcement investigators .
Authorities said they did not know if she was mentally or physically disabled .
Police have declined to release the couple 's names , but the house where authorities say the incident happened is listed in public records as the residence of Kory McFarren .
No one answered his home phone number .
The case has been the buzz of Ness City , said James Ellis , a neighbor .
" I do n't think anybody can make any sense out of it , " he said .
Ellis said he had known the woman since she was a child but that he had not seen her for at least six years .
He said she had a tough childhood after her mother died at a young age and apparently was usually kept inside the house as she grew up .
At one time the woman worked for a long - term care facility , he said , but he did not know what kind of work she did there .
" It really does n't surprise me , " Ellis said .
" What surprises me is somebody was n't called in a bit earlier . "

I 'm fuzzy on the enacted legislation within 90 days .
How does this help ?
The truth is the truth regardless of timelines .
Lots of stuff has been covered up only to be uncovered years later .
So , Turkey has already obtained U.S. nuclear secrets via the black market and the Bush administration is now trying to cover it up by officially authorizing it after the fact .
Is this right ?

Well , this administration is playing the same strategy with FISA and domestic spying are n't they .
First they try and get the congress to pass fully legislation that would make what they are doing " legal " ( though arguably still unconstitutional as well as illegal from most people 's perspective ) , and then they 're trying to grant themselves and companies retroactive immunity with the latest FISA bill .
They are going to do the same thing here .
They will first try to " legitimize " us giving nuclear or other WMD secrets to Turkey .
Then they 'll try and to the retroactive immunity towards any companies involved with this too .
By giving retroactive immunity to the companies involved , they are of covering their own butt too , preventing civil lawsuits that might force their " state secrets " hands to stop which also stops scrutiny of the facts that would criminalize those in the government as well .
This is a group of criminals in charge we are dealing with now .
Let 's not forget that !
The Rev. Michael Dowd is preaching a surprising message : Evolution is real and science points to the existence of God .
For the last five years , the author and former evangelical pastor has lived out of a van with his wife , crisscrossing the nation to deliver the good news .
His latest book , Thank God for Evolution , drew endorsements from five Nobel laureates and dozens of religious leaders .
With the battle between science and religion at a fever pitch , it could n't come at a better time .
Just last week Texas papers reported that a curriculum director had been fired in October for forwarding information about an evolution lecture to friends and colleagues .
Dowd was n't always an evolution proselytizer .
Presented with an evolution textbook on his first day of biology classes at Evangel University , he stormed out and told his roommate that Satan had a foothold in the Christian school .
But after encountering the teachings of Catholic eco-theologian Thomas Berry , Dowd embraced what 's known as evolutionary theology .
Wired News spoke with Dowd by phone about science , religion and his belief that " a holy understanding of evolution will usher the world 's religions into their greatness in the 21st century . "
Wired News :
Last week we learned that a Texas science education official , purportedly fired in October for insubordination , was actually punished for promoting evolution and downplaying intelligent design .
What do you think of that ?
Michael Dowd : Anybody who says intelligent design should be taught on the same footing as evolution is coming from a place that has no legal backing .
I appreciate the heart of what intelligent design people are trying to do , but it 's a dead - end road .
It 's not science ; it 's philosophy .
My problem with intelligent design is from a scientific standpoint .
It fails to recognize the revelatory nature of science .
Science is uncovering the truth of the nature of reality .
WN : What kind of reception have you received from other Christians ?
Dowd :
Well , I do n't get the opportunity to speak in the most fundamental contexts .
Anybody who believes that evolution is the devil is n't going to invite me to their church .
Most of my audience is on the moderate end .
But there 's definitely interest .
Three weeks ago I was in the Bahamas with 125 evangelical ministers – progressive , but evangelical nonetheless .
There are people who are quite interested in this .
They 're finding that it opens up new ways of thinking .
WN : Have you visited the Creation Museum ?
Dowd :
The first time ( my wife ) Connie and I went there , we drove in with our big van with the Jesus and Darwin fish kissing on the side .
The folks working there kept us in sight , understandably , but they were cordial .
Then we went back a few weeks ago ... and they were very friendly .
WN : Science has n't proven that God exists , so why do you believe in him ?
Dowd : Atheists and believers agree that reality consists of nested spheres – subatomic particles within atoms within molecules within cells within organisms within planets within galaxies .
Each nested level exhibits divine creativity – the power to bring something new into existence that did n't exist before .
That creativity did n't exist at the beginning of time , making everything like a potter makes a pot , but exists through the universe in a nested sense .
God , Goddess , Allah – they 're just proper names for that ultimate reality .
God is a sacred proper name for ' largest nesting doll . '
You may choose to call it by another name .
Many people just call it the universe .
WN : So you embrace science , and therefore evolution .
But in your book , you commend conservatives who do n't .
Why ?
Dowd :
Most conservatives have never been exposed to thinking of evolution except as a chance , mechanistic , godless process .
Evolutionary theology talks about evolution in a way that gives people a sense of purpose as part of something infinitely meaningful .
Until conservatives are exposed to that , they should reject evolution .
It 's our responsibility to find more sacred , meaningful , holy ways of promoting evolution .
WN : How can evolution be meaningful in a personal , religiously enriching way ?
Dowd :
When I say evolution , I mean the cosmic , biological and human as one sacred story : galaxies , planets , life , human consciousness and culture .
When someone feels connected to ultimate reality , and knows themselves to be a part of that , it becomes so much easier to exist with integrity , with love and compassion for the whole .
Evolution helps us understand the challenges of life .
Why do we struggle with what we struggle with ?
Traditional religion says it 's the Fall , it 's original sin .
But from an evolutionary theology perspective , original sin is a way of talking about what we call animal instincts .
Take testosterone :
The more a person has , the more a person tends to take risks and think about sex .
If people think they have sex on the brain because their great - great - grandmother ate an apple , or because they 're fundamentally flawed , then they wo n't be able to live with integrity .
Evolutionary psychology gives us a way of understanding our true nature .
It makes it easier for us to live .
WN : Could n't someone just as easily argue that we ought to obey our base instincts , since we evolved that way ?
Dowd :
That 's where it 's important to understand the direction of evolution .
When we look at the pre-human world , then at human cultural evolution , we see greater spheres of cooperation , of complexity and interdependence at an ever - wider scale .
At first we cooperated with family and clan ; then at the level of tribe ; then , later on , at the level of the kingdom ; and now , at a planetary level .
Our list of enemies keeps shrinking , and the people for whom we have cooperation and compassion keeps expanding .
Why do n't we go act on base instincts ?
Because it goes counter to this trajectory .
WN : But science is full of arguments and disagreements .
It 's constantly being changed and revised .
How do you avoid having a momentary consensus turn into religious dogma ?
Dowd : Religious insights handed down by private revelation have often been understood to be eternal truth .
They 're more likely than science to create religious wars over divinely revealed truths .
The scientific enterprise tends to nurture humility .
Like you say , it 's always open to being corrected , being changed – and there 's a certain humility to realizing that one 's narrative , in terms of talking about facts , is open to change .
WN : Wo n't evolutionary theology leave a lot of scriptural truths behind ?
Dowd :
God did n't stop communicating truth vital to human well - being thousands of years ago , when people preserved insights on animal skins .
God communicates through science .
Facts are God 's native tongue .
Who of us would let a first - century dentist fix our children 's teeth ?
Yet every day we let first - century theologians fill our children 's brains .
There 's a difference between flat - earth faith and evolutionary faith .
In flat - earth Christianity , the core insights – sin , salvation , heaven and hell – are understood in the same way as when people first formulated ideas .
I still value the same concepts , but interpret them in a radically different way .
Google has topped a list of the world 's most powerful brands , with new research estimating its value to be $ 86bn ( £ 43bn ) .
WPP - owned research company Millward Brown puts Google at number one in its annual top 100 global brand power list for the second year in a row with a 30 % year - on - year increase in its value .
Google beat General Electric to the top spot , with the NBC Universal owner 's brand value estimated at $ 71.4bn .
The next most valuable brands are Microsoft at $ 70.89bn , Coca - Cola at $ 58.2bn and China Mobile at $ 57.2bn , according to Millward Brown .
" Google 's rank has been driven by fantastic financial performance and equity value , " said Peter Walshe , the global account director at Millward Brown .
The top five remained unchanged year - on - year , with each company recording an increase in brand valuation by between 15 % and 39 % compared with 2007 .
However , Millward Brown 's annual BrandZ research , which takes into account the financial performance of a company combined with a measure of brand equity determined by a 100,000 - strong global consumer survey , produced a number of changes in the ranking of the brands that make up the remainder of the top 10 .
IBM 's brand value increased by 65 % year - on - year to $ 55.3bn , moving the technology company up three places in the BrandZ list to sixth spot .
Apple was the biggest mover in the top 10 , and a new entry , moving up nine places to rank seventh , with a massive 123 % increase in brand value to $ 55.2bn .
" Apple 's 123 % rise has proved to be from a mix of a slue of innovative products such as the iTouch , iPhone , Leopard and computers for which consumers have given the brand a lot of credit , " said Walshe .
Fast food giant McDonald 's brand value grew by 49 % - in eighth at $ 49.49bn , while Nokia was up 39 % and in ninth at $ 43.9bn .
Cigarette giant Marlboro was the only marque to drop in the top 10 , down four spots to 10th , with a 5 % drop in brand value to $ 37.3bn .
" You have to remember that these are global valuations , " said Walshe , explaining why in an anti-smoking era the tobacco company still did so well in the ratings .
" The business is expanding in markets including Asia and South America .
It is only in the west that we see decline .
Its brand contribution [ to the brand valuation ] is also extremely high . "
Mobile operator Vodafone was the top - ranked British brand , up 12 places on the back of a 75 % increase in value to $ 36.9 bn ( £ 18.5 bn ) .
Millward Brown tracks 50,000 brands globally , which are whittled down for its annual BrandZ top 100 list .

Anti-gun hysteria has reached a fever pitch in the Golden State .
The California Assembly is considering a bill ( Assembly Bill 2062 ) this session that , if passed , will have dire consequences for California 's law - abiding gun owners .
AB2062 is scheduled to be heard on Wednesday , May 7 in the Assembly Appropriations Committee .
Sponsored by State Assembly Member Kevin De Leon ( D - 45 ) , AB2062 would require that law - abiding gun owners obtain a permit to buy handgun ammunition and would impose severe restrictions on the private transfers of handgun ammunition .
Applicants for a " permit - to - purchase " would be required to submit to a background check , pay a $ 35 fee , and wait as long as 30 days to receive the permit .
Ways to manage this deadly workplace disease : Attention Deficit Disorder .
Usually men are more vulnerable to A.D.D. because they do not have the benefit of the multi-tasking skills that evolution has given women .
Traditionally , very short attention spans have been associated with children .
Until the mid 80s , psychologists and physicians believed that A.D.D. hit at the stage of transition from child to adulthood .
But , now the researchers confirmed that childhood A.D.D. can continue well into adulthood .
Cell phone and e-mail , the biggest tools of multitasking are the greatest enemies of concentration .
Every e-mail message popping up at the corner of your monitor is the biggest hindrance to your concentration .
When you are disturbed while doing something , your brain cannot go back seamlessly to the job it was doing before the interruption .
For some of you , A.D.D. is an inbuilt condition .
They have very short attention spans as with children .
Responsibilities increase as they grow up , but concentration will not become better .
This condition finally leads to unfinished jobs , raising panic attacks and stress .
All of these finally cause psychological disorder .
A.D.D. can disrupt lives and leads to poor productivity .
It can be mild , moderate or severe and the symptoms vary from person - to - person .
Some of your lives with A.D.D. may be full of overwhelming chaos – never ending tasks , loads of stuff and out - of - control clutter .
Some with a very short attention span show hyperactivity .
How to Know if A.D.D. or A.D.H.D. lurks inside you ?
Check out these symptoms to confirm whether you have this disorder or not .
Having trouble in completing the projects and jumping from one activity to another .
Feeling irritable all the time .
Difficulty in falling asleep and difficulty in waking up all the time .
Getting bored easily within 15 minutes of starting something to do .
Trouble in remembering the daily tasks .
Forgetting the things like keys , phone numbers , important documents , etc .
Finding trouble in balancing your cheque book .
Difficulty to engage in leisure activities .
Having the habit of interrupting others or replying even before questioning by some one else .
Discovering yourself over - committed and often getting late .
Feeling overwhelmed and disorganized in your daily life .
Follow these steps to avoid A.D.D. :
Do one thing at a time .
When you are on the phone , give your full concentration towards the conversation .
Note down the points which are useful .
The same applies to your mail box .
Avoid multitasking like chatting with a colleague while checking your mails .

The strongest creature in the world , the Hercules Beetle , has a colour - changing trick that scientists have long sought to understand .
Research published today , Tuesday , 11 March , in the New Journal of Physics , details an investigation into the structure of the specie ’s peculiar protective shell which could aid design of ‘ intelligent materials ’ .
The Hercules Beetle is remarkable , not only for its strength , able to carry up to 850 times its own weight , the protective outgrowth of the insects ’ exoskeleton , aka its shell , also changes from green to black as its surrounding atmosphere gets more humid .
Researchers from the University of Namur in Belgium have used the latest imaging techniques to study the shell of the beetle - a scanning electronic microscope to determine the structure responsible for the colour and a spectrophotometer to analyze how the light interacts with this structure .
The light interferes with the structure to produce the green colour of the shell .
When water penetrates through the widely - open porous layers , it destroys the interferences phenomenon leading to a black colouration .
The researchers used dry specimen of the beetle ’s shell to test in laboratory conditions .
The beetle , usually found in the rainforests of Columbia , Venezuela , Peru , Ecuador , Bolivia , and Brazil , is still rather mysterious though .
As although dry specimen of the shell could be relied on to change when humid conditions were introduced , the living specie that researchers also had in the lab were not as consistent .
As to why the beetle changes colour , question marks also remain .
Some have suggested that it is to do with protection – it becomes more humid at night and is therefore good for cover to turn black .
Others have suggested that it is to do with warmth absorption at night .
Questions remain .
The techniques used to study the beetle ’s morphology included new scanning techniques for electron images which over recent years have been refined to yield great depth and therefore help to create three - dimensional images of miniscule structures .
Marie Rassart , who did the research at the University of Namur , said , “ The sort of structural behaviour displayed by the Hercules Beetle could be an important property for ‘ intelligent ’ materials ’ .
Such materials could be put to work as humidity sensors .
This could be useful for example in food processing plants to monitor the moisture level . ”

Yesterday ( March 31st ) , Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson announced the laying of the government�s foundation stone for the next big financial bubble , heralding an era of hyperinflation and probable further runs on the U.S. dollar .
Of course , like most politics , there is usually a �good� reason and a �real� reason for actions .
Today�s announcement was no exception .
In today�s case , the �good� reason was the effective �policing� of the financial , derivative , insurance and mortgage markets .
Some cynics could be excused for thinking that the so - called �restructuring � and massive increase in the powers of the Federal Reserve Board were like locking the stable doors after the horses had bolted .
The extension of the �supervisory � powers of the Fed to non-bank ( deposit ) financial houses ( like stock brokers ) , derivative dealers , insurance companies , and even to the private , high risk investment companies of the rich , like hedge funds , is dramatic to say the least .
But when it is realized that , in return for supervision , the Fed will stand behind those industries as a lender of last resort , the true revolutionary magnitude of today�s proposal becomes manifest .
The new initiative was described persuasively as an attempt to �modernize� our national financial monitoring systems and bring them in line to cope with the free - wheeling cowboy dealings that financed some $ 26 billion of bonuses paid to Wall Street firms alone in 2007 !
It all sounded so patriotically �good� and deserving of massive popular support .
The truth is staggeringly different ; so different that it commands a certain admiration for how the political / financial �pro� Paulson was able to keep a straight face !
The truth , or �real � reason , should alarm every hardworking American taxpayer who supports the improvement of our country and the handing of a working economy on to our descendants .
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , more than any two people on earth , were too well aware that two weeks ago , we faced a systemic collapse of our financial system and that it risked spreading to much of the developed world in short order .
Further , they knew that their emergency action to salvage Bear Stearns and other troubled brokerage houses would only postpone disaster , not prevent it .
What was needed , to stand a chance of long - term survival , was a lender of last resort with massive resources .
When Hank Paulson soothingly mentioned �deleveraging� , he knew more than most that it meant some $ 12 trillion in the residential real estate market alone , excluding the excessive debt in the commercial real estate , auto loan and credit card markets !
In other words , the �real � problem is far , far larger than the $ 800 billion balance sheet of the Fed can absorb !
This fact alone should provide a salutary shock to investors who still hold U.S. dollar assets .
It certainly did for our Treasury and Fed .
The Treasury and Fed realize that , over the past decade , they have pumped in so much money that has , in turn , become excessively leveraged , by banks and derivatives , that the government no longer has the funds available to avert a systemic financial disaster .
That sort of mega - money could only be �captured � directly from American citizens .
Behind Paulson�s responsible and pro-active sounding modernization plan is the most cynical plan to rob American citizens further , by making their government , through the Fed , the lender of last resort for Wall Street�s Billionaire speculators .
In the last resort , the Fed is financed by the Treasury , which , in turn , is financed by borrowing , taxing many Americans and robbing every single American through the debasement of their hard earned dollars .
Instead of allowing the free market to punish speculators , Paulson is now asking Congress to force the American citizen to stand as a lender of last resort , via the Fed , for the speculators on Wall Street , insurance companies , derivatives and , most amazingly , the most speculative of all rich investors - hedge funds !
The cynical arrogance of this �civic robbery � is hard to accept .
Make no mistake , the coming economic storm will be painful for us all .
As if to rub salt into the wound , the hard - pressed citizen is now to be forced into bailing out Wall Street with injections not of billions , but of trillions in dollar liquidity .
To make it more politically acceptable , the Government must focus peoples� attention on an attractive use of funds .
Green , alternative energy would fit the bill handsomely .
Indeed the President has already announced a massive increase in nuclear power generation as a first step .
Soon we should expect to see massive ( trillions of dollars ) government programs announced and the funding farmed out via the �needy� on Wall Street .
In the meantime , direct financial aid will be administered via the Fed as lender of last resort .
In addition , we should expect accounting rules to be changed to allow the reality of �marking to market� to be eradicated , allowing technically insolvent financial institutions to continue their vastly profitable operations .
The economic �drag� effect of the increased regulation is yet to be seen .
But it is likely to prove insignificant when compared to the great latent damage done to the basic productive economy of America by hyperinflation .
What does all this add up to for the investor ?
First , we should expect a continued erosion of the U.S. dollar as interest rates are lowered further to avert depression and as inflation subsequently morphs into hyperinflation .
Eventually , we should expect massive growth in the dollar earnings of green alternative energy companies as the confiscated largesse of the American citizen is pushed into that sector of the economy .
It remains to be seen whether Congress will authorize the required massive level of trillions of dollars in funding soon enough to avoid the present recession morphing into a depression .
Whatever the result , it is increasingly clear that the government intends to leave it for future generations to pay the �real� bill for the reckless conduct of Wall Street and our Fed over the past decade .
In the meantime , investors keen to preserve their wealth should look abroad to the productive corporations and currencies of economies that continue to produce more than they consume .

Automatic downvote script ( userscripts.org )
I discovered reddit last summer through its programming subsection .
Good submissions were pouring in every hour or so and each was accompanied by pertinent comments which added value to the whole .
Later , I moved on to the main reddit and found that it was pretty good also .
Not great , but good .
Many submissions were interesting , comments were not Slashdot level , but many were n't bad , dupes were often worthy for a repost , and every now and then there would be a submission that made you LOL in real life .
All in all it was a fun place to be .
But that seems like ages ago , because meanwhile the retard convention decided to move from other * wink * news websites to reddit .
Nowadays the first page is most of the time full of ... less - than - desirable submissions .
Let 's be frank , each has a new stupidity level of it's own .
But that 's ok , if that 's what the masses want , if that 's what 's hot on the intertoobes , well ... that 's what the masses get .
The problem
What is not ok is when a good idea turns bad only to later turn to really bad .
reddit tried to implement an Ask reddit feature , similar to Ask Slashdot .
It was n't long until some wise guys ( so to speak ... ) figured out that this feature could be used to gain karma points by exploiting certain members of the community , namely the ones less brainy , if I may ( I do n't give I fuck , I may ) .
How would they do that ?
By submitting entries that would awaken the 5th grader instinct in the others , stories such as
" Vote up if you like Ron Paul "
" Vote up if you think Bush should be impeached "
" Vote up if you love pie ! "
" Vote up if you did n't get laid on New Years Eve . "
" Vote up if you think today 's icon looks more like an alien holding a giant dildo than an alien holding the superbowl trophy "
" Vote " Vote up " Vote Up " stories " up " [ wait ... what ?
are you trying to make a fractal of some sort ? ]
What do this things have in common ?
Well ... everything .
They are all meaningless and stupid as hell , have no finality and they bring nothing valuable to reddit .
Their sole purpose is to feed karma into the submitter 's profile .
And the most stupid thing about this all is that karma does not bring you any advantages of any sort .
It 's just a number .
Got that , submitters ?
IT 'S JUST A FUCKING NUMBER .
There .
That went out .
The problem is that these submissions took the rightful place of the good stories on the front page .
Where 's the wisdom of crowds now ?
Nowhere , that 's where ...
The solution
So , this post 's title was " Enhancing reddit " .
How am I going to do that ?
Simple , by a grassroots effort to remove this " vote up if you 're a brainless monkey clicking on the vote up arrow " plague .
I usually went through the trouble of manually voting down each " Vote up " story I came across , but after a while that became boring enough to cause me to stop doing it .
But then a lightbulb came on :
I have Greasemonkey installed I know Javascript Idle Saturday . ???
You thought I was going to say PROFIT , did n't you ?
Improve reddit .
So yes , I made a teeny little script that automatically votes down " vote up " stories like a crazy hog , whenever it comes in contact with any of them .
Install it and browse away on reddit .
Whenever a " vote up " , " vote me up " or " upvote " story comes along it will be automatically voted down .
Whenever I have a couple of free minutes I go to the search page and browse for the first few pages , just to make sure none escaped me .
Will there be any tangible results ?
It depends .
If others install and use this script , I believe there will be , because many of the retardsome posts will never get to see the light of day .
So go ahead and grab the script from userscripts.org .
It will work on both the main reddit and any of the subreddits .
No need to say thanks , just bash this fuckers into oblivion .
R
ay Griffis had a chunk of his colon cut out recently .
He 's just finishing chemotherapy .
How 's it going ?
He is an old artillery sergeant major .
They do n't come any tougher .
That 's a good thing , because this is a hard story .
We met the other day at North York General .
He is 81 years old .
Over a cup of coffee he said , " They cut off about six inches of colon , near the appendix , and took the tumour away .
The chemo – if something got into my lymph glands , this is supposed to clean it out . "
The chemo is not the problem .
Nor is this : " The doctors here are fabulous .
My surgeon did an excellent job .
The way he sewed me up you 'd think he was a seamstress .
I was treated like a king . "
Here 's the problem :
There was a complication soon after he started the chemo .
He was hit with diarrhea , and what felt like the flu .
His daughter , a palliative care nurse , hustled him over to emergency at North York General .
It took three rough hours before he was admitted , and then he was put on a gurney in an isolation room in emergency and was left to fend for himself .
From a letter he recently sent to the premier : " I was in an awful state , sore throat , throbbing head ... so weak I could hardly move . "
He felt a bowel movement coming on .
He had to get to a washroom .
" I tried to get the attention of the nurse . "
She was sitting on the other side of a glass door , in his line of sight .
" It became obvious she did n't want to help me when she turned away on her chair and acted like I did n't exist . "
He could n't help it .
He let go .
" I had feces all over me and my clothing ... after several bowel movements I felt completely robbed of my dignity ... when the nurse finally noticed what had happened , this was her response : ` You 've had an accident and you better clean yourself up . ' ...
She returned about 15 minutes later and threw a couple of diapers on the bed and left me to clean up the mess . "
And as we went over the details , Ray shook his head and took a sip from his cup , as doctors and nurses came down to the coffee shop and went back to work , unmindful of us .
Ray said , " If you 're not in good hands in emergency , you wonder what you 'll be up against elsewhere ... you get scared . "
You ought not to be scared .
Again , from his letter to the premier :
" The following day I was admitted to the ward ... I started to get my trust back in the system . "
He had another accident around 10:30 p.m .
He cleaned himself up – I repeat , he cleaned himself up – and he asked for a new mattress cover , but a guy in the room pulled over a potty chair and spilled crap all over the floor , and a nurse looked in and left in a hurry .
From the letter : " The room smelled like a cesspool ... I was so sick I could hardly breathe . "
It was hours before the room was cleaned .
" I cried myself to sleep from sheer exhaustion and humiliation . "
Old artillery men do not cry easily .
The next night , another accident ; again , no help ; again , he cleaned himself up .
This time , to avoid the smell , he went to the lounge to read the paper .
When he returned a couple of hours later , the room had still not been cleaned .
Ray smiled .
" That 's when I decided to go AWOL . "

Jets are most fuel efficient when they have freedom to move around in the sky .
Climbing to a higher altitude allows a plane to maintain optimum cruise efficiency as it burns fuel , and when a plane changes altitude it is also able to catch winds that can speed it along .
Planes flying over the ocean do n't have this option .
They 're required to maintain a set speed and altitude so that they stay a safe distance from one another while out of range of ground - based radar .
But last month Airbus tested a GPS - based navigation procedure that lets pilots know what is happening in the skies around them without radar .
If it goes into effect , it will cut fuel consumption by allowing planes to cruise at their optimal speed and altitude .
Planes flying over land are monitored and tracked by a dense network of ground - based radars .
Air traffic controllers use these radars to guide aircraft through congested airspace and keep them a safe distance from one another .
Radar 's limited range means that aircraft can't be monitored this way over water , which is why the set speed and altitude tracks ( known as in - trail procedures ) are put into effect .
Airbus ' new procedure , called CRISTAL ITP ( ITP stands for in - trail procedures ) is built on a technology known as Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast ( ADS - B ) .
ADS - B does what radar can't – it gives pilots a clear view of what 's happening around them during ocean flights .
ADS - B- enabled cockpits are tricked out with GPS technology so that pilots can monitor not only their own position , but that of other aircraft in the area .
Which means they can change altitude and speed safely , without radar guidance .
Airbus conducted a recent test over Icelandic airspace to see if the technology works .
The test flight involved two planes , a Scandinavian Airlines Airbus A330 and an A340 owned by Airbus flying simultaneously through the same airspace .
The A330 flew steady at 31,000 feet , while the ADS - B - equipped A340 , able to constantly monitor the location of the Scandinavian plane , safely changed altitude and speed several times .
The potential fuel savings of CRISTAL ITP are bigger than you might think .
Airbus estimates that a widebody jet could cut its fuel consumption by 374 pounds per transatlantic flight if it were able to shift altitude to reach maximum fuel efficiency .
With 700 jets crisscrossing the Atlanticeach day , that means over 260,000 pounds of fuel per day .
Do the math , and that means a CO2 cut of 558,000 pounds per day ( 160,000 pounds of fuel = 23,390 gallons .
One gallon jet fuel produces 23.88 lbs CO2 according to Earthlab ) .
Airbus plans to have the CRISTAL ITP procedure up and running over the Atlantic no later than 2010 .
Airbus is n't the only one advocating the use of ADS - B technology .
America 's Air Transport Association can't stop talking about it , saying that replacing the United States ' antiquated radar - based navigation with a GPS technology is the only way to prevent U.S. flight delays from getting far worse .

Hundreds of protesters were on the streets of Paris
Paris protests
The Paris leg of the Olympic torch relay has been cut short following anti-Chinese protests along the route .
Security officials extinguished the torch at least three times due to the protests before it was carried on a bus to the relay 's end point .
It comes after 37 people were arrested in London as protesters disrupted the torch relay there on Sunday .
The Olympic flame is being carried through 20 countries before arriving for the Beijing Games in August .
Flame protected
The Paris relay started to go wrong almost from the start , despite the presence of 3,000 police along the route , riding motorcycles , jogging or on skates .
A member of the French Green party was restrained by police after attempting to grab the torch from the first of Paris 's 80 torch bearers , former world 400 metres hurdles champion Stephane Diagana , Reuters news agency said .
" Nothing 's happening as it was meant to , " Mr Diagana told French TV .
" It 's a shame .
It 's sad because of what this symbol represents but it can be explained by the context we 're aware of . "
Police were forced at least three times to put out the torch and carried it onto a bus , as police cleared protesters from the route .
On the second occasion , the flame was being relayed out of a Paris traffic tunnel by an athlete in a wheelchair when it was taken onto a bus because protesters booed and began chanting " Tibet " , the Associated Press news agency reported .
The flame itself has been kept alight the whole time in a safety lantern .
Later , Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe cancelled a ceremony to welcome the torch relay after Green party activists hung a Tibetan flag and a black banner depicting the Olympic rings as handcuffs from the Hotel de Ville ( city hall ) .
Activists have hung Tibetan flags or the black banners from several other Paris landmarks including the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame cathedral .
Several hundred protesters have been involved in the demonstrations , near the Eiffel Tower and along the torch 's zig - zag route through Paris to a stadium in the south of the city .
Finally , after several delays , security officials decided to put the torch on a bus to take it to Stade Charlety , where it arrived 30 minutes late at 1530 GMT .
Pro-Tibet activists and Chinese supporters scuffled outside the stadium before police intervened .
Olympic appeal
China condemned what it called an " attempt to sabotage and destroy " the torch relay .
" The Olympic flame belongs to the people around the world , " said Wang Hui , a spokesman for the Beijing Olympic organising committee .
" So the behaviour of a few separatists would not gain sympathy from people and will cause strong criticism and is doomed to fail . "
The Paris relay was meant to be a colourful advertisement for the Beijing Games , instead it has turned into a grotesque embarrassment , says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris .
US Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on President George W Bush to boycott the opening ceremony of the Olympics unless China improved its human rights record .
Speaking in Beijing earlier on Monday , IOC President Jacques Rogge said he was concerned over both the recent unrest in Tibet and the torch protests .
" The International Olympic Committee has expressed its serious concern and calls for a rapid peaceful resolution in Tibet , " Mr Rogge said .
He criticised the attempts to disrupt the torch relay , saying violent protests , " for whatever reason , " are " not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the Olympic Games " .
London 's relay saw protesters trying to douse and even snatch the Olympic flame as athletes and celebrities carried it through the city .
The demonstrations have been sparked by China 's security crackdown in Tibet following a series of protests against Chinese rule which swept the region last month .
Tibetan exile groups say Chinese security forces killed dozens of protesters .
Beijing says about 19 people were killed in rioting .
The torch was lit in Olympia , Greece , on 24 March and is being relayed through 20 countries before being carried into the opening ceremony at the Beijing Games on 8 August .
Writing was found to help cancer patients
Nancy Morgan , a " writing clinician " , approached patients waiting in a clinic at a cancer centre in Washington DC .
Half those who took part said the exercise changed the way they thought about the illness , according to the journal The Oncologist .
Younger people , and those recently diagnosed , were most likely to benefit .
Thoughts and feelings , or the cognitive processing and emotions related to cancer , are key writing elements associated with health benefits
Nancy Morgan , Lombardi Center
Ms Morgan developed her role as part of the Arts and Humanities Program at the Lombardi Center .
Her " expressive writing " exercise , lasting just 20 minutes , posed questions to leukaemia or lymphoma patients about how the cancer had changed them and how they felt about those changes .
When those taking part were contacted again a few weeks later , 49 % said that the writing had changed their thoughts about their illness , while 38 % said their feelings towards their situation had changed .
While there was no evidence of direct impact of the session on their illness , where the patients had reported greater changes in their mindset during the writing , this could be linked to more positive reports of quality of life given to their doctors during follow - up appointments .
Ms Morgan said : " Thoughts and feelings , or the cognitive processing and emotions related to cancer , are key writing elements associated with health benefits , according to previous studies .
" Writing only about the facts has shown no benefit . "
Dr Bruce Cheson , the head of haematology at Lombardi , said : " I 'm pleased to see that so many of our patients were interested in this kind of therapy .
" Our study supports the benefit of an expressive writing program and the ability to integrate such a program into a busy clinic . "
Background : Since the Nazis hated the Jews , one might at first think they would favor Zionism ’s campaign to build a Jewish state , thus encouraging Jews to leave Germany .
They did in fact encourage Jewish emigration to Palestine , even ordering newspapers in Germany not to print stories about the difficulties Jews faced there .
However , this article from one of the most widely circulated Nazi periodicals rejects the idea .
Zionism is seen as part of the general Jewish plot to control the world .
Der Schulungsbrief was a general interest Nazi periodical with a circulation of over 1,000,000 in 1936 .
Nazi block wardens attempted to sell copies to every German citizen .

Zionism by Arno Schickedanz Through Karl Marx - Mordechai , Jewry overcame the problems and difficulties that came with industrialization and the transformation of ownership resulting from the development of the fourth estate , falsifying their justified demands in a way that served Jewry ’s interests .
With his assertion of constant exploitation based on his materialist view of history , Karl Marx created a front that ran through all nations , stamping it with “ internationalism ” and the Jewish spirit .
His doctrine ripped nations apart .
Their resistance to outside forces collapsed as parties struggled bitterly with one another .
It is surprising that few have noticed that Karl Marx - Mordechai ’s doctrines were Jewish in nature .
He believed that he could take the materialist view of history and the exploitive nature of the Jewish people and apply them to all the other peoples .
The claim of “ constant exploitation ” removed the parasitic lifestyle of the “ chosen people ” from the center of attention of other nations as well as of the class claimed by Marxism .
But it continued to reign as the leader of speculative finance capital , bound to no territory or national community .
It also led the Marxist organization that spanned all boundaries of land and ethnicity , just as “ Jahwe ” rules over the universe .
The growing wealth of the Jews , along with the increasing influence that their wealth gave them led to a certain loosening of Jewish cohesiveness .
Increasing numbers went from the Mosaic to the Christian faith purely to gain further advantages .
There was a certain “ assimilation , ” and a “ liberal ” Jewry also developed that accepted those precepts of Jewish doctrine that were pleasant and comfortable , but rejected those that caused discomfort , without however leaving the Jewish faith .
Karl Marx - Mordechai ’s doctrines were even reflected in the Jewish organization “ Paole Zion ” among the poor Jews found only in the East who had not accomplished anything .
Zionism resulted from thinking about the position of the Jews within their host peoples and from knowledge of their financial and political power .
It was an attempt to balance these facts and combat the spiritually divergent tendencies in Jewry .
Its founder Herzl spoke more or less openly in various places in his diaries : “ Where it exists , one can no longer abolish the legal equality of the Jews .
This is not only because it goes against the modern mind , but also because all Jews , rich and poor , would immediately be forced into revolutionary parties .
There is really nothing they can do to us .
In the past one took their jewelry from the Jews ; can one today take their movable wealth ?
The impossibility of getting at the Jews has only strengthened and embittered hatred .
Anti-Semitism grows daily , even hourly , in the population .
It will continue to grow since its causes continue to exist and cannot be eliminated . ” ( Th. Herzl , The Jewish State ) .
“ I do not wish to write about the history of the Jews .
It is familiar .
I must mention only one thing :
In our two thousand years in the diaspora , there has been no unified leadership .
That is what I think is our primary misfortune . ”
To overcome this “ misfortune , ” Herzl founded political Zionism .
Gentile observers and writers on Zionism , who see political Zionism only as an attempt at “ national renewal ” rather than an effort to establish a unified Jewish leadership as well as Jewish rule over the world , are therefore incorrect .
The confusion of political Zionism with Palestine can be understood only through the Jewish prophecies in which Jewry is assured of control over all the goods of this world .
Knowing that the time was near , and would culminate in taking possession of Palestine , Zionism developed the nonsensical notion of an “ historic claim ” to the “ promised land , ” to which Jews “ without any outside pressure ” would gradually emigrate .
In the ideology of political Zionism , Palestine fulfilled the role of an indispensable part of prophecy , just as certain rules are the guarantee for success in the magical ceremonies of primitive peoples .
Political Zionism never intended Palestine to be the destination of all Jews , but rather it merely wants to make Palestine the center of Jewish world policy .
That must naturally be protected by a strong Jewish population .
The Zionist publication Jüdische Rundschau wrote : “ No one at any time has proposed that all Jews today should emigrate to Palestine . ” Nahum Sokolow , Weizmann ’s colleague and current chairman of the Zionist Committee , said it clearly in 1921 : “ The Jewish people wants to return to Palestine ; the Jewish people will have its center in Palestine .
Large parts of Jewry will live as a Jewish diaspora in the world .
They must be cared for ; their dignity and their national rights must be assured . ”
This is also clear from the text of the state treaty Jewry concluded with England , the so - called Balfour Declaration : “ His Majesty ’s Government favors the establishment of a national home in Palestine for the Jews , and we will make the greatest efforts to reach this goal , although it is clearly understood that nothing will be done that will affect the civil and religious rights of Gentile communities in Palestine or the rights and political standing of Jews in any other country . ”
That provides a correction to the idealization of Zionism , which springs from a different race .
From a political standpoint , it would be in the interests of the whole world , of all the host peoples , if the Jews now scattered throughout the whole world were to voluntarily emigrate to some habitable territory .
If political Zionism were not interested in such a solution to the Jewish Question , it would be in the interests of the host peoples to point it in that positive direction .
The only question would be whether Palestine is the proper gathering place , which no one would likely maintain .
Palestine is not able to absorb all the Jews in the world , entirely aside from the fact of increasing Arab opposition to Jewish infiltration .
The Arabs are , after all , the undisputed owners of the land .
But what other territory would be appropriate ?
And at the instant Palestine ceased to be the goal of Jewish emigration , political Zionism would collapse , since Palestine is seen as a means for the fulfillment of prophecy .
Without that , the whole enterprise would lose its point .
Jewry itself would make the most passionate and bitter attacks , and before long any undertaking that ignored Palestine would be crippled by Jewry itself .
Palestine incorporates for Jewry its special position .
Ignoring this would be ethnic suicide for Jewry , since political Zionism also has as a goal maintaining and strengthening Jewry ’s special situation .

Super Genintari is the latest mega - console mod by Richard DaLuz , a perfect cocktail of Atari 2600 , Nintendo Entertainment System , Genesis and Super NES enclosed in a retro -'80s bronze acrylic case , " formed and shaped on a homemade stript heater . "
It connects to a TV using a single cable , running four games simultaneously , and probably cooks bread with the generated heat — like the video shows after the jump .
We talked with Richard about his superconsole mod :

Jesús Díaz : Great mix and cool retro look .
Are these regular motherboards you are using ?
Richard DaLuz :
The systems inside the Super Genintari are n't anything you have to special - order .
They 're all the same old systems myself and many others grew up with through the ' 80s / '90s and regularly find floating around at garage sales to this day .
I used the beloved old gray and white " toaster " NES board , a model 3 Sega Genesis , the smaller redesigned SNES and an Atari Flashback 2 for the 2600 portion , since it 's much smaller and easier to work with than retrofitting the original board from the '70s .
It 's still official reworked Atari hardware and completely compatible as far as I know , so all is well .
The basic rule was that if any of the systems could n't play ANY game I threw at it , it was out .
I tend to avoid the much smaller " pirate / clone " systems for this reason .
Advertisement
JD : You did n't have to do any modifications to the boards to make them fit ?
RD : The only board I really had to do any " major " modification to was the NES , and that was just a simple A/V amplifier mod using parts that can easily be found at any Radioshack for pennies .
Other than that , just a lot of tedious rewiring and soldering to relocate the cartridge connectors .
JD : You have any background in electronics ?
RD : Believe it or not , very little !
I took one class way back in high school that basically just taught me how to operate a soldering iron without burning myself and / or others .
( I still can't even tell you what the hell Ohm 's Law is without Googling it . )
Other than that I have no official training .
Just a lot of dinking around by myself , finding out what works and what does n't .
It 's an area that I 've been curious about since I was a kid and still have yet to pursue professionally .
This should be inspiring news to anyone else that 's interested in this kind of stuff .
Advertisement
JD : What was the final bill for this wonderconsole ?
RD : Mmm .
You'd have to shell out whatever the going rate is for the four different consoles , plus about $ 50 or so for the casing materials , adhesives , machine screws and whatnot .
Easily a couple hundred bucks if you 're starting with nothing .
But that 's assuming you already have access to the necessary tools you 'd need .
( Soldering / desoldering irons , screw drivers , clamps , wiring , etc. )
I ended up spending much more than that considering how many changes I made along the way though and that 's something you have to consider when you 're doing this kind of work .
Nothing ever goes according to plan and the ole ' wallet ends up taking the hit .
JD : And for how long have you been working on it ?
RD : As far as what it 's cost me in time ... my God , I do n't even know where to begin .
I 've been working on this damn thing on and off since early 2002 !
Granted I 've taken many " sanity breaks " for several months at a time during the process and changed many things along the way , but that 's still a long freakin ' time .
It 's hard to come up with a figure for the time I 've put into this thing , but know this ...
I would n't allow myself to part with it for less that a few thousand .
I 'm pretty sure this thing literally has my blood in it somewhere !

According to Richard , the system is very easy to hook up .
Just one A/V cable is needed and you do n't have to depend on any external transformer : he put all the necessary power in the case itself .
Playing with it is as easy as the video shows : just plug in , put the cartridges in , turn the Super Genintari on , and enjoy .

The ( Cleveland ) Plain Dealer Politics Blog
Posted by Sabrina Eaton
After promising last week that he ’d mark President Bush ’s final “ State of the Union ” speech today by introducing articles of impeachment against Bush , Cleveland Democratic Rep.
Dennis Kucinich announced he ’s postponing the effort .
Kucinich said he met with members of the House Judiciary Committee after making last week ’s impeachment pledge on the House of Representatives floor , and came away “ hopeful there will be an inquiry by the Judiciary Committee . ”
“ I will give them the opportunity to proceed before introducing articles of impeachment , ” Kucinich said in a statement issued by his office .
The House Judiciary Committee ’s spokeswoman did not respond to The Plain Dealer ’s request for comment .
Last year , Kucinich introduced a measure to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney that has collected 24 cosponsors .
His November effort to bring the matter before the full House of Representatives won support from Republicans who wanted to embarrass House Democratic leaders , but was eventually referred to the Judicary Committee .
Kucinich told The Plain Dealer editorial board last week that nine members of the House Judiciary Committee favor his bid to impeach Cheney .
But that ’s shy of a majority ; the committee has 23 Democrats and 17 Republicans .
“ I do not believe that there will be an impeachment this year — I do n’t think that will happen – but I do think that the questions relating to an inquiry of both the president and the vice president are important so that our nation has a real understanding of the effort that was made , a consistent effort , to mislead the people into supporting a war , ” Kucinich said .

Recently , the city of Portland , Oregon opened an indoor traditional Chinese garden , of all things , smack in the middle of downtown .
The objective was to create something that was truly authentic to Chinese gardening , which is radically different from the traditional Western style .
Instead of sticking to aesthetically - arranged trees , flowers , and green lawns surrounding the occasional sculpture , this garden is only about one - third greenery .
The rest is rocks , wood , and other naturalistic architecture , sometimes decorated with Chinese pictograms , each object 's place and position possessing a special and deliberate meaning .
The designers of the garden were still very much American , but because of the significance of each object and even each color , they did their research exhaustively .
One of these designers had been responsible for choosing the flowers and had agonized over exactly what color of lotus should be used , finally settling on white .
Shortly after the opening of the garden , she saw a clearly Asian Buddhist monk watching her lotuses for a long time , and she decided to go an ask him his thoughts .
The monk said that he was very pleased with the garden .
Soon , the designer asked him what color of lotus he would have seen in his native China , and was surprised when he answered " pink . "
" Why is that ? " the designer asked .
The monk answered that in China , pink was the color of happiness .
He then asked why the designer chose white , and she replied that she thought that the virtue and purity which the color white represented would be significant and suitable for the garden .
To which the monk replied , in a low voice close to the designer 's ear , " You know , I think people would rather be happy than virtuous . "
It occurred to me that there could be no single anecdote , no single sentence , which underscored the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western thought than this .
New Policy for Menstruating Females , In Effect Immediately !
True Christian™ Bible Based Health Tips Freehold , Iowa - A recent survey of pre-menopausal Landover Baptist female church members ( nearly a quarter of the church ’s ranks ) shockingly revealed that a significant percentage continue to lead secular lives during their monthly curse , continuing to use forbidden devices like the Devil 's Cotton Fingers or ruining their husband ’s bathroom fixtures , as they walk around in complete ignorance , trying to hide the fact that they are abnormal , and according to the Bible , a health risk , full of contaminants that put obedient church members in immediate danger !
This sort of flippant disregard for church policy will no longer be tolerated .
Unclean women will henceforth follow Biblical principles to the letter .
Housewives will notify Pastor Deacon Fred 's secretary , Mrs. Watson each month when the first drop of blood is spotted .
Cursed females will immediately receive a seven - day departure pass .
Children will notify the school nurse and receive the same pass .
All filthy females will have 15 minutes to leave the church campus .
Buses will be available outside the east gate of the main sanctuary at the top of every hour to transport all defiled women to the Freehold Airport or the Greyhound Station .
( Given that every church bus must be sterilized after each trip , more frequent travel could not be scheduled . )
Any violations of this policy will result in immediate church expulsion , with the matter referred to the Freehold Iowa , Baptist Police Department for further investigation should legal action need to be taken .
Modernism will not be tolerated under any circumstances , we are a Bible believing church , and as such - we follow the Lord 's commandments in every aspect of our daily lives .
A female 's disregard for the safety and health of obedient church members is absolutely no exception !
If you do n't like it , find another place to worship !
The following steps are required : 1 . Find a substitute for your home for at least seven days .
If you touch anyone during this time , you will make them unclean ( Lev15:19 ) .
That would be shameful .
Do not contaminate your kids or hubby with a good - bye kiss .
Make sure there are plenty of pot roasts and stews in the fridge for your eldest daughter to cook ( so long as you prepared those dishes in anticipation of your uncleanness and not after the flow began ) .
Sever all ties with your family and friends for at least a week .
Check into whatever hotel your budget allows , making sure management knows not to let any of its employees touch you or your polluted sheets and towels .
The church will provide preprinted instructions in this regard , upon request .
2 . Prepare to remain in an upright position for seven days , perhaps in a hotel closet .
Anything you sit or lie upon will be unclean ( Lev15:20 ) , and that ’s not fair to those who might unwittingly touch the disgusting item later .
Show some respect for your fellow man !
Order room service so you do n’t have to contaminate restaurant chairs , and be sure you sign for the bill when it is not in the room service waiter ’s hand .
3 . If you accidentally sin by sitting on a bed or chair , notify management immediately .
That will give them the chance to track down those who may have touched the contaminated bedspread or sheets or moved the defiled chair , so they can vigorously wash the skank from their bodies , even though they will remain unclean all day , thanks to your irresponsibility ( Lev15:21 - 22 ) .
4 . Do NOT , under any circumstances , let your tainted vagina ( or “ flowers ” ) touch anyone , or you make him unclean for seven nights ( Lev15:24 ) .
In other words , you must suppress the female ’s natural tendency to be a harlot for at least a week .
5 . If the flow continues after seven days , repeat the above ( Lev 15:25 ) .
6 . Get your livestock ready for church .
Give your minister two turtles and two doves so that he may kill them to make up for your deplorable conduct in this matter , hopefully saving your sullied soul in the process ( Lev15:29 - 30 ) .
7 . For goodness sakes , burn your clothes from this week at a location far away from town !
8 . If you discover your husband has chosen another mate while you were away , you may report to the Landover Home for Unwanted Wives and Alleged Domestic Violence “ Victims ” .
Do n’t expect any more sympathy there than anyone else gets .

For a university professor , Francisco J. Ayala spends a lot of time on the road .
An evolutionary biologist and geneticist at the University of California , Irvine , he speaks often at universities , in churches , for social groups and elsewhere , usually in defense of the theory of evolution and against the arguments of creationism and its ideological cousin , intelligent design .
Usually he preaches to the converted .
But not always .
As challenges to the teaching of evolution continue to emerge , legislators debate measures equating the teaching of creationism with academic freedom and a new movie links Darwin to evils ranging from the suppression of free speech to the Holocaust , “ I get a lot of people who do n’t know what to think , ” Dr. Ayala said .
“ Or they believe in intelligent design but they want to hear . ”
Dr. Ayala , a former Dominican priest , said he told his audiences not just that evolution is a well - corroborated scientific theory , but also that belief in evolution does not rule out belief in God .
In fact , he said , evolution “ is more consistent with belief in a personal god than intelligent design .
If God has designed organisms , he has a lot to account for . ”
Consider , he said , that at least 20 percent of pregnancies are known to end in spontaneous abortion .
If that results from divinely inspired anatomy , Dr. Ayala said , “ God is the greatest abortionist of them all . ”
Federal Attorney - General Robert McClelland has backed the Prime Minister in again refusing to allow Chinese guards to protect the Olympic torch relay when it passes through Canberra .
The Government says Chinese officials will be restricted to a bus travelling behind the torch .
International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) board member , Kevan Gosper , yesterday suggested Chinese officials could be called on for help if Australian police cannot manage protesters .
But Mr McClelland has told ABC's AM program that is wrong and he does not know the root of Mr Gosper 's comments .
" I literally do n't know , I do n't know , I have n't spoken to Kevan but clearly they wo n't , clearly it will only be the Australian Federal Police who are entirely experienced in this sort of thing , " he said .
Police have been granted extra authority during the relay period to search people and to seize items , including eggs , paint bombs , fire extinguishers and flares .
ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope says police asked for the enhanced powers after learning that major groups of pro and anti-China groups will be descending on Canberra for the torch relay .
" The police have advised us in order to allow us to be proactive , not to be forced to react as other security forces and polices have around Australia , " Mr Stanhope said .
" This does give us an opportunity to be proactive , hopefully to protect the relay and to allow the relay to proceed without disruption .
" As the national capital we are used to demonstrations .
As the home of the national parliament it 's the place where there are often demonstrations .
" Our police are perhaps more experienced and more able to anticipate the sorts of trouble and responses that are needed . "
Mr Stanhope says fire extinguishers , eggs and flares will be banned , as well as bottled water .
But he says he does not think it will be a problem for people waiting to see the torch .
" The route has been published , there are 80 runners all traversing 250 metres , the relay moves past a post within a minute or two so there wo n't be people standing for hours , " he said .
" It 's an extensive and expansive course of almost 20 kilometres on broad boulevards and wide streets . "
Mr Stanhope says there will be no banning of flags and banners .
" We support the right of people to freedom of expression , " he said .
" The Government took the decision in the context of our support for human rights , we 're not banning banners . "
Student hopes relay is not political
A Chinese Australian student says he is encouraging his fellow countrymen and women not to go near Tibetan protesters during next week 's Australian leg of the Olympic torch relay .
A flyer which has been posted on a student website encourages Chinese Australian students to " protect " the Olympic torch in Canberra .
But student Zhang Rongan says that has been misinterpreted .
He says the Chinese community is not angry about the disruption of the torch relay so far , and they want a peaceful event next week .
" We hope that it will not be political , " he said .
" The torch is just a torch , its just the symbol of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Games is sports , not politics . "
Syrian envoy scoffs at CIA photos of reactor Diplomat refuses to offer details on building bombed by Israel last year
WASHINGTON — Syria 's ambassador to the United States said Friday that the CIA fabricated pictures allegedly taken inside a secret Syrian nuclear reactor and predicted that in the coming weeks the U.S. story about the site would " implode from within . "
" The photos presented to me yesterday were ludicrous , laughable , " Ambassador Imad Moustapha said .
However , he refused to say what the building in the remote eastern desert of Syria was used for before Israeli jets bombed it in September 2007 .
Senior U.S. intelligence officials said Thursday they believe it was a secret nuclear reactor meant to produce plutonium , which can be used to make high - yield nuclear weapons .
They alleged that North Korea aided in the design , construction and outfitting of the building .
Syria bulldozed the building 's ruins a month after it was bombed and constructed a new , larger building in its place , leaving little or no evidence of what had been on the site .
Moustapha would not explain the purpose of the new building .
But he said the lack of military checkpoints , air defenses or barbed wire fences around either building should show that it was not a sensitive facility .
So far , Syria has not allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect the area .
Rhetoric from both sides
Syria 's ambassador to the United Nations , Bashar Ja'afari , pledged on Friday to cooperate with the IAEA and suggested that " the main target of the American CIA allegations against Syria is to justify the Israeli attack against the Syrian side . "
In a message to employees , CIA Director Michael Hayden praised the agency 's " outstanding " work , calling it " a case study in rigorous analytic tradecraft , skillful human and technical collection . "
But some outside nuclear experts were questioning some of the CIA 's analysis , though not disputing its conclusions .
Nancy Pelosi is no ordinary superdelegate .
Even dubbing her a super - duper delegate might not do her justice .
Ms. Pelosi is in a class by herself when it comes to the nominating whirl since , as speaker of the House , she will preside over the Democratic National Convention as chairwoman .
So when the gavel comes down in Denver on or about Aug. 27 to finally and formally award the presidential nomination to either Hillary Rodham Clinton or Barack Obama , it most likely will be Ms. Pelosi wielding it .
Given her role at the convention , her position as the nation ’s highest ranking Democratic elected official , her long experience in the rough - and - tumble of party politics and her objective of padding her own House majority , it is no wonder that anything and everything she says about the state of the nominating contest is sifted for meaning .
In recent days , she was viewed as putting her thumb on the scale for Mr. Obama with an observation that it would be dangerous for the party if superdelegates such as herself took the nomination away from the candidate who had won the most primary delegates  a position that would seem to favor Mr. Obama at this stage of the game .

Yoo 's Memo Hints at Bush 's Secrets The Pentagon ’s declassification of a five - year - old memo authorizing military interrogators to use brutal methods to extract information from prisoners at Guantanamo Bay sheds new light into the dark corners of the Bush administration ’s legal theories that put the President and his subordinates beyond domestic and international law .

In the March 14 , 2003 , memo – which was released this past week – administration lawyer John Yoo cited the principle of national “ self - defense ” in combating terrorism as grounds for justifying harsh treatment of detainees up to and including death .
Yet , as Yoo advanced his argument for virtually unfettered presidential war - time powers regarding the treatment of prisoners , the memo also pointed to other still - secret documents suggesting the administration was prepared to take its authority even further , into domestic military operations that would brush aside constitutional protections .
Yoo footnoted one of his earlier memos , dated Oct. 23 , 2001 , entitled " Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States . ”
According to the footnote , that memo “ concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations . ”
The memo – with its provocative title – has remained a closely held administration secret , kept even from the House Judiciary Committee which renewed its request for the document on Thursday .
It ’s now clear , however , that from inside the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , Yoo and his colleagues were churning out a series of memos that fit with President George W. Bush ’s desire to be “ forward - leaning ” – or extremely aggressive – in the wake of the 9/11 attacks .
Though the Oct. 23 , 2001 , memo is still secret , some of Yoo ’s thinking on domestic military operations was revealed in an even earlier memo , written 10 days after the 9/11 attacks , on Sept. 21 , 2001 .
In that memo , Yoo cited hypothetical cases in which U.S. military action against suspected terrorists on U.S. territory – such as a raid against a hideout or use of military checkpoints – might endanger Americans or intrude on their constitutional rights .
Yoo argued that President Bush would “ be justified in taking measures which in less troubled conditions could be seen as infringements of individual liberties . …
We think that the Fourth Amendment should be no more relevant than it would be in cases of invasion or insurrection . "
The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that “ the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated . ”
But Yoo ’s Sept. 21 , 2001 , memo argued that the “ war on terror ” could justify domestic surveillance activities , such as monitoring telephone calls without a court warrant , that otherwise might violate the Fourth Amendment .
[ NYT , Oct. 24 , 2004 ]
In his 2006 book , War by Other Means : An Insider 's Account of the War on Terror , Yoo cites various arguments for local and federal law enforcement agencies , as well as a sitting U.S. President , to ignore the Fourth Amendment , especially regarding domestic surveillance .
“ If al - Qaeda organizes missions within the United States , our surveillance simply cannot be limited to law enforcement , ” Yoo wrote .
“ The Fourth Amendment ’s warrant requirement should not apply , because it is concerned with regulating searches , not with military attacks . ”
Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU 's National Security Project , said the Bush administration has never argued publicly that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to military operations within the United States .
Though Yoo ’s hypothetical domestic military actions , as described in his Sept. 21 , 2001 , memo , have not come to pass , his position that the “ war on terror ” justifies setting aside the Fourth Amendment ’s protection against warrantless searches did survive .
Starting in the months after the 9/11 attacks , Bush chose to override the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and authorize warrantless wiretaps of international communications to and from the United States .
Bush acknowledged the existence of these warrantless wiretaps in December 2005 , after they were disclosed by the New York Times .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said Thursday that the administration has n’t relied on Yoo ’s Oct. 23 , 2001 , memo for more than five years , but Congress still has spent a great deal of effort trying to pry it loose from the Justice Department .
Rep. John Conyers , D - Michigan , House Judiciary Committee chairman , renewed that effort on Thursday in a letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , saying the committee was rebuffed on two previous occasions – Feb. 12 and Feb. 20 – when requesting a copy of the memo .
“ Based on the title of the Oct. 23 , 2001 , memorandum , and based on what has been disclosed and the contents of similar memoranda issued at roughly the same time , it is clear that a substantial portion of this memorandum provides a legal analysis and conclusions as to the nature and scope of the Presidential Commander in Chief power to accomplish specific acts within the United States , ” Conyers wrote .
“ The people of the United States are entitled to know the Justice Department ’s interpretation of the President ’s constitutional powers to wage war in the United States , ” Conyers added .
“ There can be no actual basis in national security for keeping secret the remainder of a legal memorandum that addresses this issue of constitutional interpretation .
The notion that the President can claim to operate under ‘ secret ’ powers known only to the President and a select few subordinates is antithetical to the core principles of this democracy . ”
John
Yoo left the Justice Department in 2003 and some of his memos were later rescinded .
However , the administration continues to assert broad powers for Bush as Commander in Chief during the “ war on terror . ”
Yoo is now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley .

In the first analysis of proteins extracted from dinosaur bones , scientists say they have established more firmly than ever that the closest living relatives of the mighty predator Tyrannosaurus rex are modern birds .
The research , being published Friday in the journal Science , yielded the first molecular data confirming the widely held hypothesis of a close dinosaur - bird ancestry , the American scientific team reported .
The link was previously suggested by anatomical similarities .
In fact , the scientists said , T. rex shared more of its genetic makeup with ostriches and chickens than with living reptiles , like alligators .
On this basis , the research team has redrawn the family tree of major vertebrate groups , assigning the dinosaur a new place in evolutionary relationships .
Similar molecular tests on tissues from the extinct mastodon confirmed its close genetic link to the elephant , as had been suspected from skeletal affinities .
The book that is indirectly responsible for me getting my new job
A few months ago , I was in the pub with a couple of geekchums .
The topic of job interviews was going round the table , in part because I ’d been talking about my goal of getting a job and moving to the Bay Area .
Someone mentioned that they ’d interviewed at Google , had read Programming Interviews Exposed the night before the interview , and nearly every question they ’d been asked was pretty much out of the book .
This caught my attention , because a few months earlier I ’d had a phone interview with a division of Google that rhymes with TouYube which had gone pretty well until they pulled out one of those algorithmic questions that Google loves ;
Something about finding the median value in two sorted lists of integers .
I ’d come up with a solution , but clearly not a satisfactory solution .
( As Keith later described it , every Google interview question has to have an O ( log n ) solution … and at that time , Big O notation had n’t been on my radar in freakin’ years ) .
The next day , the recruiter called to say they ’d decided to pass on me .
So , the morning after the discussion , once the hangover had subsided , I ordered myself a copy .
I read the whole thing in a few days , absorbing details about graph theory , pointers , recursion and , oh yes , Big O notation that I had n’t thought about since receiving my CompSci degree 10 years ago .
But more important were the example interview questions throughout the book .
Generally these would be structured as the question , followed by a naïve solution , a better solution , and then any follow - up questions or limitations the interviewer might introduce .
For example , if you get the classic “ Reverse the order of words in a string ” question , it guides you through the initial solution of “ Start at the end of the string , scan backwards , and when you find whitespace , copy the word to a temporary buffer , then replace the original string with the new one ” , then explains what to do when the interviewer inevitably asks you to do it without using another buffer ( reverse the whole string , then iterate through reversing the characters in each word ) .
A week or so later , I had a phone interview and was able to answer algorithmic questions speaking authoritatively about binary trees and heaps .
That was enough to get me flown out to SF for in - person interviews , which at one point included a question word - for - word out of the book !
All that said …
For a variety of reasons , I did n’t take that job .
It just helped because I first spoke to Current during the weekend I was in town for the interviews , and got a chance to spend some face - to - face time at Current ’s offices that day .
( In fact , the interviews with Current went by without a single algorithmic pointers - and - big - O question .
And to me , that was a good sign , because as I say , I have n’t cared about that shit in 10 years —
In my line of work , rather than optimizing lines of code , I ’m more to get more bang by tweak a SQL query or throwing memcache at a problem . )
Which raises an interesting question :
Is reading this book cheating ?
Is it the equivalent of just reading the answer key before an exam ?
In my opinion , no .
For two reasons :
For the most part , it was just refreshing details I ’d already learned during my CompSci course , but had filed away in the trashcan of my neurons , along with “ Where ’s the best deep - fried pizza in Edinburgh ? ” , as no-longer relevant to my life .
This book probably wo n’t help too much if you do n’t have the first clue about pointers or recursion to begin with .
If your ability to answer algorithmic questions is the only ( or most important ) thing the employer is rating you on when you interview you , then they ’re fucking idiots and will get everything they deserve .
The book is just a handy tool for your belt when preparing for interviews , to get your mind in the right place to push past the algorithmic questions so you can present all the other amazing reasons why they must hire you right now .
Similarly , I highly recommend reading Joel Spolsky ’s Smart and Gets Things Done and Rands ’s guide to how your resumé is being read for an idea on what the person on the other side of the phoneline or table is ( or should be ) thinking .
But without this book , I might not have passed that phone screen , and thus might not have been in SF when Current called , and might not have met with them , and might not have gotten excited by the opportunity , and might not have the job I have now .
And for that reason , I unreservedly recommend this book to every software engineer who might be on either side of the interviewing process soon .
The title was a click - bait !
This article will actually try to explain five instead of three important notions in Shake .
These are :

Design Indaba 08 : continuing our series of stories about the 10x10 Housing Project in Cape Town , South Africa , here are the latest photos showing progress constructing the first sand - bag house .
Designed by MMA Architects , the house is the first of 100 experimental , low - cost homes for former shack dwellers that will be built at Freedom Park on the outskirts of Cape Town .
Work started on the houses last Monday and these photos were taken last Wednesday and Thursday , when local children joined in to help fill sand bags .
See our earlier story for plans of the houses and an explanation of the sand - bag construction method , and photos of the first day 's work here .
" The bags have now all been packed in for the bottom floor , and the shuttering was made right on the top for the concrete ringbeam , which was cast on Friday , " says project manager Nadya Glawe .
" Next week we 'll start plastering the bottom level to give support , before putting up the timber frame on the top level and packing bags again . "
The houses each have a budget of 65,000 Rand ( £ 4,300 / $ 8,600 ) .
HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cuban university students , in a rare public challenge to authorities , openly criticized government restrictions on access to the Internet , hotels and travel abroad .
Students carry a Cuban flag during the 155th birth anniversary of Cuba 's independence hero Jose Marti at Havana 's Revolution Square , January 28 , 2008 .

Their criticism in a video circulated this week comes as more Cubans begin to speak out about the shortcomings of Cuba ’s socialist system , a debate encouraged by acting President Raul Castro since taking over from his ailing brother Fidel Castro in 2006 .
In the 52 - minute video , students at the University of Information Sciences demanded explanations from National Assembly president Ricardo Alarcon on a series of issues .
The January 19 town - hall style meeting was shown over the closed - circuit television system of the 10,000 - student university built on the site of a former Soviet electronic listening post on the outskirts of Havana .
The video has since been circulated secretly on computer memory cards , although it has not been seen by most Cubans .
“ Why ca n’t the people of Cuba go to hotels or travel to other parts of the world ? ” asked one student , who identified himself as Eliecer Avila .
Only foreigners are allowed to stay at hotels at beach resorts .
To leave the island , Cubans need a permit from the government , which particularly restricts travel by young people .
Avila , who studies at Cuba ’s elite school for computer sciences -- a pet project of Fidel Castro ’s before he fell ill -- asked why the government had banned the use of Web sites Yahoo ! and Google for e-mail and messenger services .
Internet connectivity in Cuba is lower than in Haiti , the hemisphere ’s poorest country , and all servers belong to the state .
Many Cubans with Internet access provided by the government can use e-mail but not surf the Web , only an intranet of Cuban Web sites .
Alarcon , who is the speaker of Cuba ’s legislature , dodged some questions , saying he did not know about monetary and Internet matters .
The students criticized Cuba ’s leadership for being out of touch with the people and asked the government to be more forthcoming with proposals on how to solve pressing problems , from poor public transport to low wages .
RISING COMPLAINTS
Raul Castro has raised expectations of economic reforms since taking over from his 81 - year - old brother , who has not appeared in public since undergoing stomach surgery for an undisclosed illness more than 18 months ago .
In December , Raul Castro acknowledged before the National Assembly that Cuba had “ an excess of prohibitions ” that did more harm than good in an economy that is 90 percent owned by the state .
So far he has delivered little , but has invited Cubans to speak their minds without fear of reprisal on how best to solve Cuba ’s woes .
Some Cuba watchers believe he let the genie out of the bottle and there is no way to put the lid back on the growing debate about the country ’s future .
“ It ’s like a soup coming to the boil -- a bubble appears here , another there and then it ’s all bubbling up , ” said a long - time European resident of Havana who asked not be identified .
One week before the students met with Alarcon , Cubans working for foreign companies protested government plans to tax their hard currency earnings at a meeting that ended in disarray .
The first sector of Cuban society to speak up for their interests were intellectuals , writers and artists , who last year won an apology from the government for the reappearance of former television censors from the 1970s .
This week , famed Cuban folk singer Silvio Rodriguez , a high - profile supporter of Castro ’s government , said Cubans should be free to travel abroad and stay at hotels reserved for tourists .
He said the country was in “ transition . ”
PRINCETON , NJ -- Forty - nine percent of Democratic voters nationally support Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination compared with 44 % backing Hillary Clinton , giving Obama a slight but statistically significant five percentage point lead .
For the past week Clinton and Obama had been neck and neck in national Democratic support , but preferences have now returned to where they stood in late February when Gallup Poll Daily tracking found Obama consistently ahead by a 5 - to 8 - point margin .
This comeback for Obama started prior to his victory in the Wyoming caucuses on Saturday , March 8 , thus blunting Clinton 's winning streak coming off of the March 4 primaries .
Obama has led Clinton on each of the individual days included in today 's three - day rolling average , from March 7 - 9 . -- Lydia Saad
Methodology : Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The results reported here are based on combined data from March 7 - 9 , including interviews with 1,297 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters .
For results based on these samples , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

The critics have an obvious self - interest , of course :
They did n't get the contract .
But they also appear to have a point .
In February , Science Applications International Corp. ( SAIC ) landed a $ 28 million IT - administration contract from the Universal Service Administrative Company ( USAC ) , a non-profit organization that runs e-Rate , a controversial $ 2.25 - billion a year program that subsidizes school and library networks .
The e-Rate program is funded by consumers of telecommunications services through fees paid by carriers to the perpetually debated Universal Service Fund :
In other words , we all pay for this , which is why it matters .
According to a terrific story on the brouhaha in eSchoolNews , those complaining about the contract are miffed that SAIC was awarded the internal USAC administration contract despite also being a provider of outside e-Rate services , most prominently a $ 51 million pact with the Los Angeles school system .
Access to the entire story requires free registration , so I 've pulled a few of the choicer passages here .
From the article :
Critics note that , as the information systems administrator for the program , SAIC will have unfettered access to electronic information about all E - rate applicants and other service providers -- inside information that could help the company land even more E -rate business with schools .
SAIC will not be able to see the bids submitted for E - rate services during the application filing window , because service providers send their bids directly to applicants .
However , as the systems administrator for E-rate , the company will have access to electronically stored information on the winning bids once applicants file their Item 21 attachments , which explain the services to be provided and the cost of those services in great detail .
In theory , the company could use this information to submit a lower bid for the same services the next time an applicant requests these services through the E-rate program .
SAIC declined a number of requests to comment on these criticisms , accord to eSchoolNews .
As for USAC , the organization responsible for creating this arrangement , its spokesman says there 's no fire beneath all the smoke .
Eric Iverson , director of external relations for USAC , said the corporation anticipated such concerns when it awarded the contract to SAIC in February but was confident that SAIC has taken appropriate steps to deflect them .
" We 've looked very carefully at the possible conflicts of interest and have put in place some specific measures " to prevent abuse , Iverson said .
He noted that all SAIC employees who are working on the systems administration project have signed non-disclosure forms that legally prevent them from discussing any of the information related to their work .
This would prevent them from sharing information with their SAIC colleagues who submit bids for E- rate projects , Iverson said .
Not only are the doubters not satisfied by such assurances , they see a double standard in how USAC runs its own shop and what it expects from e-Rate service providers .
Critics of SAIC 's dual role as both systems administrator and E - rate service provider say it 's especially troubling in light of the intense scrutiny that E- rate applicants and service providers now must undergo as part of the Program Integrity Assurance ( PIA ) review process .
Responding to concerns about instances of E - rate waste , fraud , and abuse , USAC and its Schools and Libraries Division have implemented a number of measures in the last few years to protect the integrity of the program .
But some applicants and service providers say the corporation has , at times , carried these efforts to the extreme .
Here 's the only circumstance under which I could see USAC 's awarding of the job to SAIC passing the smell test :
Is it possible -- I 'm asking here -- that a decision on USAC 's part to bar any and all e-Rate service providers , or would - be e-Rate service providers , from bidding on USAC 's internal work leave USAC with a pool of applicants so shallow as to be detrimental to its own IT operations ?
Perhaps someone with knowledge of those waters can offer insight here .
Absent such cover , however , USAC appears to be left with little to counter this type of complaint :
" There 's a lot of talk about the ' appearance ' of impropriety [ as a reason for denying E- rate funding ] , " an anonymous source concluded .
" If this does n't give the appearance of impropriety , I do n't know what does . "
SAIC 's a huge $ 9 - billion company .
Tell them they can have the USAC network contract or be an e-Rate service provider .
Not both .
One of the Arab world ’s most widely respected non-governmental organizations is charging that at least 14 Middle East and North African governments are systematically violating the civil liberties of their citizens  and most of them are close U.S. allies in the war on terror .
In a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council , the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies ( CIHRS ) said that there have been " huge harassments of human rights organizations , and defenders have been increasingly subject to abusive and suppressive actions by government actors in the majority of Arab countries , particularly Egypt , Syria , Bahrain , and Tunisia . "
The group this week called upon the international community to " exert effective efforts to urge Arab governments to duly reconsider their legislation , policy , and practices contravening their international obligations to protect freedom of assembly , freedom of expression , and freedom to form associations , including non-governmental organizations "
It added , " Special attention should be awarded to providing protection to human rights defenders in the Arab World . "
As an example of typical area - wide human rights abuses , the CIHRS report cited the recent forced closure by Egyptian authorities of the Association for Human Rights Legal Aid , an organization active in exposing incidences of torture .
The Egyptian government claimed that the organization " received foreign funding without having the consent of the Minister of Social Solidarity . "
The organization warned of " increasingly repressive conditions " being imposed on non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) in Egypt , including a proposed amendment to the Law of Associations that it said would limit the right of association and expression .
Other Arab nations singled out for detailed criticism included Algeria , Bahrain , Iraq , Jordan , Libya , Morocco , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Sudan , Somalia , Tunisia , the United Arab Emirates , and Yemen .
The report also accused four other Arab countries of human rights abuses  Libya , Algeria , Sudan , and Morocco .
The U.S. and other Western governments have had close ties with Arab governments in the Middle East and North Africa for many years .
These ties have grown closer since the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
But since the administration of President Ronald Reagan ( 1981 - 89 ) , promoting democracy and freedom in the Arab world has been a staple in U.S. political rhetoric .
The rhetoric has ratcheted up significantly during the administration of President George W. Bush .
In his second inaugural address , Bush said , " It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture , with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world . "
Bush administration officials say they have used diplomatic pressure , foreign aid , and the architecture established by Reagan to help nurture democracy in the Middle East and North Africa .
Bush also said the democratic transformation of the Middle East would begin with regime change in Iraq .
Many observers have found the Bush administration ’s relationships with Egypt to be particularly problematic .
In the past , the president and his secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , have publicly expressed criticism of Egypt for repressing free political opposition , notably the imprisonment of liberal reformers such as Ayman Nour , the principal political opponent of longtime President Hosni Mubarak .
Earlier this year , the U.S. Congress put a " hold " on $ 100 million of military aid to Egypt , calling on the Mubarak government to protect the independence of the judiciary , stop police abuses and curtail arms smuggling from Egypt to Gaza .
In testimony to Congress , Margaret Scobey , the nominee to be ambassador to Egypt , said , " The government ’s respect for human rights remains poor , and serious abuses continue . "
But in January , the U.S. waived the hold in a bid to encourage Egypt to help in calming the Israeli - Palestinian crises .
In a visit to Egypt the same month , President Bush told his Egyptian counterpart , " I appreciate the example that your nation is setting . "
Egypt receives $ 2 billion a year , including $ 1.3 billion in military assistance from the U.S. annually  second only to the sum awarded to Israel .
Steve Carpinelli of the Center for Public Integrity ( CPI ) told IPS , " Billions of dollars in new military aid , accompanied by lax oversight and poor accountability , have flowed to governments with documented histories of human rights abuses , weak advancements toward democratic governance and the rule of law , among the findings of the Center ’s Collateral Damage project , which assessed the impact of U.S. military aid in the post 9/11 era . "
The CPI , a government accountability watchdog group , has just published a comprehensive report on U.S. military aid to repressive governments .
The CIHRS report to the UN details numerous human rights violations throughout the Arab Middle East and North Africa .
It accuses Syria of arresting " dozens tens of qualified professionals personnel belonging to human rights organizations and civil society revival committees . "
It says the Bahraini government closed the Bahrain Center for Human Rights , put the president of one civil society on trial , and charged seven other activists with " participating in an illegal gathering and creating disturbance . "
In Tunisia , the report charges , " The authorities have made it almost impossible for the Tunisian League for Human Rights ( LTDH ) and other civil society institutions to operate . "
Tunisian human rights defenders have not been allowed to travel abroad and the government undertook measures to freeze LTDH ’s grants from the European Union .
According to the CIHRS report , " Many Gulf countries , as well as Libya , do not allow for the existence of human rights organizations or civil society activists .
The long - running Algerian military influence has severely limited civil society organizations
Since the toppling of Sudan ’s democratic government in 1989 , Sudanese civil society has been deprived of many legal and political protections and rights .
Furthermore , civil society institutions in conflict affected countries , such as Iraq , come under constant violent attack ; the same applies to the situation in Palestine  whether due to the occupation or infighting between its two political parties . "
The report identifies Morocco as one of the few Arab countries that has made progress in the human rights field .
However , it notes that members of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights have been arrested , tried , and sentenced to prison for periods ranging between two and three years for displaying slogans during a peaceful protest during Labor Day celebrations .
The slogans were considered by the authorities to be " detrimental to the king and monarchy , " the report said .
The Acid 3
Test has been officially released .
The test has been in development for some time , with much of that development happening in the open .
The Acid 3 test is far more complex than the Acid 2 test .
It covers a wider range of standards and consists of many more individual tests .
Browsers have to render a sequence of boxes that display dynamically in a stairstep pattern .
For every cluster of tests passed successfully , the boxes will fill in with a color , which signifies that all of the tests covered by that block have passed .
If you run Acid 3 on the shipping versions of current browsers ( Firefox 2 , Safari 3 , Opera 9 , IE7 ) , you ’ll see that they all score quite low .
For example Safari 3 scores a 39/100 .
This percentage score is a bit misleading however .
The situation with all four browser engines really is n’t that bad .
You can think of the Acid 3 test as consisting of 100 individual test suites .
In order for a browser engine to claim one of these precious 100 points , it has to pass a whole battery of tests around a specific standard .
In other words it ’s like the browser is being asked to take 100 separate exams and score an A + on each test in order to get any credit at all .
The reality is that all of the browsers are doing much better than their scores would have you believe , since the engines are often passing a majority of the subtests and experiencing minor failures that cost them the point for that section .
Shipping Safari scores a 39/100 with some significant rendering errors .
We ’ve been working hard since the test surfaced and are pleased to report that we ’ve entered the “ A ” range on the test with a score of 90/100 .
So what did we fix to gain so many points ?
Bug 17064 has all the details , but here are the highlights .
Support for CSS3 Selectors
We added support for all of the remaining CSS3 selectors .
These include selectors like nth - child , nth - of - type , last - child , last - of - type , etc .
These selectors were already implemented in KHTML , and the KHTML developers had even kindly provided patches for us in the relevant WebKit bugs .
Therefore it was a simple matter of taking those patches , updating them to the WebKit codebase , and then merging them in .
A big thanks to the KHTML developers for their hard work in this area .
Parsing Bugs
WebKit had a number of minor parsing bugs that Acid 3 targeted .
The boxes did not render properly because of an obscure parsing bug that the test exploited ( thanks , Hixie ) .
In addition a number of other parsing bugs kept us from completely passing individual tests .
We have updated our parser to be much closer to the HTML5 - specified parsing rules .
WebKit has also never parsed DOCTYPEs before .
I re-wrote WebKit ’s DOCTYPE parsing to match the HTML5 specification , and so now if you put a DOCTYPE into your page it will be present in the DOM .
In addition many bugs centered around proper mode resolution ( quirks vs. strict ) have now been fixed .
You can document .
write a DOCTYPE for example in a new document and have the correct mode be selected .
SVG
Acid3 has many SVG tests .
We ’ve been hard at work making these tests pass .
In particular SVG font support and other aspects of the SVG DOM have been tested .
Many of the remaining 10 points are SVG failures .
We ’ll be working on SVG animation in order to pass the last few SVG tests .
DOM
Acid3 tests a lot of DOM level 2 features , like traversal and ranges .
It particularly focuses on the “ liveness ” of objects , e.g. , making sure everything updates properly when you dynamically change a document by adding / removing nodes .
Most of our failures in this area had to do with not behaving properly in the presence of these dynamic changes ( even though we tended to pass the more static tests ) .
Now that we ’re closing in on 100 % , we ’ll be blogging about each fix as it happens , so that you can follow our progress from the blog .
Percy Bysshe Shelley once wrote that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world .
Change “ poets ” to “ assistants , ” and you ’ve got it about right .
I should know .
As editor of the Web site savetheassistants.com , I get e-mails every day from assistants who want to vent about their jobs .
I ’ve been stopped on the street and at parties by people who want to talk about feeling unacknowledged , overworked and / or abused , or just tell the story about the time their boss made them come in at 8:30 a.m. on a Sunday because the office printer was jammed .
My mail comes from all over the country , but New York City takes the prize as the capital of beleaguered assistants .
There are tens of thousands of them in the Big Apple , working in industries from finance to publishing to public relations – and many of them are miserable and seeking a place to vent .
That ’s where my site comes in .
I started Save the Assistants ( STA ) with my friend Ashley Seashore in 2006 , after leaving a horrific job as the assistant to a corporate executive .
I answered his phone , arranged his schedule – and got yelled at constantly .
One day he ’d demand that I make changes to our official company stationery ( which I obviously could n’t do ) , the next he ’d tell a visiting client how incompetent I was while I was standing in front of them pouring coffee .
When I finally quit , he told me I was only leaving because I was having “ girl issues . ”
It was my first job out of college , and the only reason I did n’t have a nervous breakdown was that the other assistants all helped one another out .
So I started STA to provide a forum where coffee - fetchers , copy - makers and general office slaves can make their voices heard , as well as anonymously blast the boss who forced them to go on a diet , or threw a fit when she did n’t get a gift on Boss ’ Day .
Two years later , I ’ve gathered quite an earful from the city ’s assistants ; now it ’s time to have a word with the bosses .
I ’ll let you in on some of the worst boss behavior out there – and a few things you can do to make sure you do n’t end up getting bashed on a site like mine .
Appearances are deceiving - and usually none of your business .
Commenting on how your assistant is doing at work - related tasks is fair game .
If they missed a name while they were loading your contacts onto your BlackBerry or put too much Sweet ’N Low in your decaf , by all means say something .
But your assistant ’s appearance ?
Off limits .
Yes , I know you had to take an anti-harassment seminar when the company first hired you – I also know you spent the whole time sending text messages .
So let me sum up what you missed :
If it does n’t directly impact the company or relate to your assistant ’s job performance , it ’s not your problem .
If your assistant wears jeans to an office where suits are the norm , or shows up every day in a tube top and spikes , feel free to mention the company dress code .
But do n’t be like the Manhattan advertising executive who berated her assistant for wearing “ nondesigner labels ” that made the agency look “ cheap , ” or the fashion - industry boss who helpfully informed her assistant that she ’d look better in the new spring fashions if she lost her baby fat .
And here ’s another hint :
If you ’re determined to have your assistant project a certain image , you should pay him or her enough to afford it .
Mean it .
Or at least sound like you mean it .
One of my favorite stories we ’ve run on STA – and one of the most quoted – was from a girl who worked in a law office , whose boss had a tendency to yell commands at her from across the room .
The really bad part was n’t that he ’d shout “ I need those documents by noon , or else ! ! ” – it was that he ’d pause afterward , and then add “ . . . please . ”
It sounded like at some point said lawyer had been told it was not so nice to scream orders at his assistant , and thought tacking on a “ please ” at the end made him sound like less of a jerk .
Clearly , it did n’t .
If anything , it emphasized his rudeness even more .
Look , you ’re allowed to tell your assistant what to do .
That ’s why you have an assistant in the first place .
But when you say “ Thanks ” or “ Please , ” make sure you mean it .
And while you ’re at it , you might want to get out from behind your desk and talk to your assistant one - on - one , rather than screaming across the office .
Just an idea .
Keep your personal life personal .
STA reader Vicky in Manhattan dubbed her boss an “ oversharer , ” because she wanted to bend Vicky ’s ear about everything from her relationship problems to her menopause symptoms .
There are plenty more where she came from , which leads me to this next point :
If you need an assistant , hire an assistant .
If you need a therapist , get a therapist .
It ’s generally best not to mix the two .
It ’s not unusual for an assistant to know basic stuff about the boss ’ personal life .
Given the nature of the job , it ’s inevitable they ’ll learn things from the boss ’ PIN number to where she ’s going on vacation .
But when you make your assistant lie to your wife about your mistress , as was the case with one Wall Street executive assistant , you ’ve gone too far .
When it comes to personal stuff , keep people on a need - to - know basis .
And your assistant may not need – or want – to know .
If that does n’t dissuade you , consider that anything you tell your assistant probably wo n’t stay a secret for long .
In most companies , any interesting bit of gossip makes its way from the seventh floor to the reception desk in about five minutes .
And even if your assistant is a model of discretion , he or she probably sits in a cubicle where four other assistants overhear every phone call they make .
Set limits .
In addition to keeping your personal life personal , you should exercise discretion when figuring out what tasks are appropriate to assign your assistant .
Possibly the most common theme among the horror stories submitted to my site is assistants who have to handle personal tasks that are – or ought to be – far beyond their job description .
One of our “ Hall of Shame ” stories is about an assistant whose boss announced she had a below - the - belt infection , and sent her out to Duane Reade to pick up some cranberry juice and a “ special cream . ”
Then there ’s Ricki Lake , who in a recent interview for her documentary “ The Business of Being Born , ” told a story about how her assistant had to clean up after her when she gave birth to her son at home .
From these two stories , we can divine an important rule :
If it involves your bodily fluids , it does not fall under an assistant ’s jurisdiction , unless yours happens to be an RN .
Pretend you ’re the assistant .
Remember what it was like when you started out in your career ?
Not everyone had to be an assistant , but unless you ’re Donald Trump Jr. , you probably did n’t get to skip immediately from a dorm room to an executive suite .
And recalling what you were like when you were 23 might help you keep things in perspective .
I ’m not saying you should buy your assistant expensive gifts to win their affection – it did n’t work on your kids , and it wo n’t work on your assistant either .
I ’m saying you should treat your assistant like a human being .
That means using their name instead of saying “ Hey you , ” understanding why they want the day off on their birthday even though you have a presentation that day and not asking them to change your baby ’s diapers because the nanny has the afternoon off .
When assistants like you , they ’re way more likely to stay an extra half - hour or not mind when you send them back to Starbucks because your latte has too much milk in it .
It ’s well documented that people like to work for people they respect .
So if you ’re a better boss , you ’ll have a better assistant .
And that benefits everyone .
tips for the other side of the desk
I ’m not naive enough to assume every assistant is a saint and every boss a cruel tyrant .
There are plenty of lousy assistants out there giving everyone else in the profession a bad name , and plenty of ways even decent assistants can get better .
Here are a couple of things an assistant can do to try and improve things from your end .
* Pick up on your boss ’ weaknesses : I ’m not saying you should find out your boss ’ vulnerabilities in order to exploit him .
I ’m saying you can be a bigger asset by finding out what your boss does n’t like to do and doing it yourself .
If he ’s always late for meetings , put them in his calendar as starting 15 minutes earlier .
If you make his life easier , you ’ll make your relationship better , too .
* Do n’t expect a rose garden :
At the end of the day , you ’re an assistant .
Make sure your demands about job duties and treatment are consistent with that position .
If you ’re supposed to be learning about an industry and your boss refuses to let you sit in on meetings and learn how to negotiate a contract , you should speak up and say you ’re missing out on something .
But if you think you ’re too good make coffee ?
Sadly , you ’re not .
They call it “ paying your dues ” for a reason .
* Plan ahead :
You sometimes schedule meetings for your boss a year in advance .
So when it comes to taking days off or going on vacation , giving plenty of notice means your boss wo n’t get as flustered about covering your absence .
You also have more time to make sure any important tasks are taken care of before you leave .
After all , no one wants to be lying on a beach somewhere and get interrupted by a screaming phone call .
* Be a smart complainer : I ’m not going to tell you not to complain about your boss – if you did , I ’d be out of a job .
But the trick to complaining is to do it wisely .
A good way is to vent to a friend on the phone or over happy - hour drinks .
A bad way is to bash your boss via an e-mail sent from the company account , or to a co-worker whose loyalty is n’t to you .
Venting can help ease your stress – just make sure you do it in a way that wo n’t cause more problems later .
STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) - A Swedish artist threatened with death over his drawing of Islam ’s Prophet Mohammad has been told by police he is no longer safe living at home .
Abu Omar al - Baghdadi , leader of the self - styled Islamic State in Iraq , offered up to $ 150,000 on Saturday for the murder of artist Lars Vilks for drawing the head of the Prophet on the body of a dog .
“ I ca n’t live here , ” Vilks told Reuters by phone .
“ SAPO ( Sweden ’s security service ) have judged that it ( the threat ) is very serious . ”
He was allowed to go home and collect some things but it may be a long time before he is able to return again , he said .
“ We have had contact with him ( Vilks ) and together with him are taking the decisions that are necessary , ” a police spokesman said .
In an audiotape posted on the Internet , Baghdadi offered a lower bounty for the death of the editor of daily Nerikes Allehanda , which published the drawing last month in what it called a defense of free speech .
Top Swedish firms such as truck maker Volvo , mobile network builder Ericsson and retailer Ikea were also threatened unless an apology was forthcoming for the drawing .
The threats against Vilks and the newspaper mirror a crisis in Denmark last year .
Cartoons published in a Danish paper and reprinted around the world sparked riots in the Middle East , Asia and Africa in which at least 50 people died , and attacks against Danish embassies and a boycott of Danish goods .
In " The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies " , Daniel Dennett says :
To date , several philosophers have told me that they plan to accept my challenge to offer a non-question - begging defense of zombies , but the only one I have seen so far involves postulating a " logically possible " but fantastic being — a descendent of Ned Block 's Giant Lookup Table fantasy ...
A Giant Lookup Table , in programmer 's parlance , is when you implement a function as a giant table of inputs and outputs , usually to save on runtime computation .
If my program needs to know the multiplicative product of two inputs between 1 and 100 , I can write a multiplication algorithm that computes each time the function is called , or I can precompute a Giant Lookup Table with 10,000 entries and two indices .
There are times when you do want to do this , though not for multiplication — times when you 're going to reuse the function a lot and it does n't have many possible inputs ; or when clock cycles are cheap while you 're initializing , but very expensive while executing .
Giant Lookup
Tables get very large , very fast .
A GLUT of all possible twenty - ply conversations with ten words per remark , using only 850 - word Basic English , would require 7.6 * 10585 entries .
Replacing a human brain with a Giant Lookup Table of all possible sense inputs and motor outputs ( relative to some fine - grained digitization scheme ) would require an unreasonably large amount of memory storage .
But " in principle " , as philosophers are fond of saying , it could be done .
The GLUT is not a zombie in the classic sense , because it is microphysically dissimilar to a human .
( In fact , a GLUT can't really run on the same physics as a human ; it 's too large to fit in our universe .
For philosophical purposes , we shall ignore this and suppose a supply of unlimited memory storage . )
But is the GLUT a zombie at all ?
That is , does it behave exactly like a human without being conscious ?
The GLUT - ed body 's tongue talks about consciousness .
Its fingers write philosophy papers .
In every way , so long as you do n't peer inside the skull , the GLUT seems just like a human ... which certainly seems like a valid example of a zombie : it behaves just like a human , but there 's no one home .
Unless the GLUT is conscious , in which case it would n't be a valid example .
I can't recall ever seeing anyone claim that a GLUT is conscious .
( Admittedly my reading in this area is not up to professional grade ; feel free to correct me . )
Even people who are accused of being ( gasp ! ) functionalists do n't claim that GLUTs can be conscious .
GLUTs are the reductio ad absurdum to anyone who suggests that consciousness is simply an input - output pattern , thereby disposing of all troublesome worries about what goes on inside .
So what does the Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle ( GAZP ) say about the Giant Lookup Table ( GLUT ) ?
At first glance , it would seem that a GLUT is the very archetype of a Zombie Master — a distinct , additional , detectable , non-conscious system that animates a zombie and makes it talk about consciousness for different reasons .
In the interior of the GLUT , there 's merely a very simple computer program that looks up inputs and retrieves outputs .
Even talking about a " simple computer program " is overshooting the mark , in a case like this .
A GLUT is more like ROM than a CPU .
We could equally well talk about a series of switched tracks by which some balls roll out of a previously stored stack and into a trough — period ; that 's all the GLUT does .
A spokesperson from People for the Ethical Treatment of Zombies replies : " Oh , that 's what all the anti-mechanists say , is n't it ?
That when you look in the brain , you just find a bunch of neurotransmitters opening ion channels ?
If ion channels can be conscious , why not levers and balls rolling into bins ? "
" The problem is n't the levers , " replies the functionalist , " the problem is that a GLUT has the wrong pattern of levers .
You need levers that implement things like , say , formation of beliefs about beliefs , or self - modeling ...
Heck , you need the ability to write things to memory just so that time can pass for the computation .
Unless you think it 's possible to program a conscious being in Haskell . "
" I do n't know about that , " says the PETZ spokesperson , " all I know is that this so - called zombie writes philosophical papers about consciousness .
Where do these philosophy papers come from , if not from consciousness ? "
Good question !
Let us ponder it deeply .
There 's a game in physics called Follow - The - Energy .
Richard Feynman 's father played it with young Richard :
It was the kind of thing my father would have talked about : " What makes it go ?
Everything goes because the sun is shining . "
And then we would have fun discussing it :
" No , the toy goes because the spring is wound up , " I would say .
" How did the spring get wound up ? " he would ask .
" I wound it up . "
" And how did you get moving ? "
" From eating . "
" And food grows only because the sun is shining .
So it 's because the sun is shining that all these things are moving . "
That would get the concept across that motion is simply the transformation of the sun 's power .
When you get a little older , you learn that energy is conserved , never created or destroyed , so the notion of using up energy does n't make much sense .
You can never change the total amount of energy , so in what sense are you using it ?
So when physicists grow up , they learn to play a new game called Follow - The - Negentropy — which is really the same game they were playing all along ; only the rules are mathier , the game is more useful , and the principles are harder to wrap your mind around conceptually .
Rationalists learn a game called Follow - The - Improbability , the grownup version of " How Do You Know ? "
The rule of the rationalist 's game is that every improbable - seeming belief needs an equivalent amount of evidence to justify it .
( This game has amazingly similar rules to Follow - The - Negentropy . )
Whenever someone violates the rules of the rationalist 's game , you can find a place in their argument where a quantity of improbability appears from nowhere ; and this is as much a sign of a problem as , oh , say , an ingenious design of linked wheels and gears that keeps itself running forever .
The one comes to you and says : " I believe with firm and abiding faith that there 's an object in the asteroid belt , one foot across and composed entirely of chocolate cake ; you can't prove that this is impossible . "
But , unless the one had access to some kind of evidence for this belief , it would be highly improbable for a correct belief to form spontaneously .
So either the one can point to evidence , or the belief wo n't turn out to be true .
" But you can't prove it 's impossible for my mind to spontaneously generate a belief that happens to be correct ! "
No , but that kind of spontaneous generation is highly improbable , just like , oh , say , an egg unscrambling itself .
In Follow - The - Improbability , it 's highly suspicious to even talk about a specific hypothesis without having had enough evidence to narrow down the space of possible hypotheses .
Why are n't you giving equal air time to a decillion other equally plausible hypotheses ?
You need sufficient evidence to find the " chocolate cake in the asteroid belt " hypothesis in the hypothesis space — otherwise there 's no reason to give it more air time than a trillion other candidates like " There 's a wooden dresser in the asteroid belt " or " The Flying Spaghetti Monster threw up on my sneakers . "
In Follow - The - Improbability , you are not allowed to pull out big complicated specific hypotheses from thin air without already having a corresponding amount of evidence ; because it 's not realistic to suppose that you could spontaneously start discussing the true hypothesis by pure coincidence .
A philosopher says , " This zombie 's skull contains a Giant Lookup Table of all the inputs and outputs for some human 's brain . "
This is a very large improbability .
So you ask , " How did this improbable event occur ?
Where did the GLUT come from ? "
Now this is not standard philosophical procedure for thought experiments .
In standard philosophical procedure , you are allowed to postulate things like " Suppose you were riding a beam of light ... " without worrying about physical possibility , let alone mere improbability .
But in this case , the origin of the GLUT matters ; and that 's why it 's important to understand the motivating question , " Where did the improbability come from ? "
The obvious answer is that you took a computational specification of a human brain , and used that to precompute the Giant Lookup Table .
( Thereby creating uncounted googols of human beings , some of them in extreme pain , the supermajority gone quite mad in a universe of chaos where inputs bear no relation to outputs .
But damn the ethics , this is for philosophy . )
In this case , the GLUT is writing papers about consciousness because of a conscious algorithm .
The GLUT is no more a zombie , than a cellphone is a zombie because it can talk about consciousness while being just a small consumer electronic device .
The cellphone is just transmitting philosophy speeches from whoever happens to be on the other end of the line .
A GLUT generated from an originally human brain - specification is doing the same thing .
" All right , " says the philosopher , " the GLUT was generated randomly , and just happens to have the same input - output relations as some reference human . "
How , exactly , did you randomly generate the GLUT ?
" We used a true randomness source — a quantum device . "
But a quantum device just implements the Branch Both Ways instruction ; when you generate a bit from a quantum randomness source , the deterministic result is that one set of universe - branches ( locally connected amplitude clouds ) see 1 , and another set of universes see 0 .
Do it 4 times , create 16 ( sets of ) universes .
So , really , this is like saying that you got the GLUT by writing down all possible GLUT - sized sequences of 0s and 1s , in a really damn huge bin of lookup tables ; and then reaching into the bin , and somehow pulling out a GLUT that happened to correspond to a human brain - specification .
Where did the improbability come from ?
Because if this was n't just a coincidence — if you had some reach - into - the - bin function that pulled out a human - corresponding GLUT by design , not just chance — then that reach - into - the - bin function is probably conscious , and so the GLUT is again a cellphone , not a zombie .
It 's connected to a human at two removes , instead of one , but it 's still a cellphone !
Nice try at concealing the source of the improbability there !
Now behold where Follow - The - Improbability has taken us : where is the source of this body 's tongue talking about an inner listener ?
The consciousness is n't in the lookup table .
The consciousness is n't in the factory that manufactures lots of possible lookup tables .
The consciousness was in whatever pointed to one particular already - manufactured lookup table , and said , " Use that one ! "
You can see why I introduced the game of Follow - The - Improbability .
Ordinarily , when we 're talking to a person , we tend to think that whatever is inside the skull , must be " where the consciousness is " .
It 's only by playing Follow - The - Improbability that we can realize that the real source of the conversation we 're having , is that - which - is - responsible - for the improbability of the conversation — however distant in time or space , as the Sun moves a wind - up toy .
" No , no ! " says the philosopher .
" In the thought experiment , they are n't randomly generating lots of GLUTs , and then using a conscious algorithm to pick out one GLUT that seems humanlike !
I am specifying that , in this thought experiment , they reach into the inconceivably vast GLUT bin , and by pure chance pull out a GLUT that is identical to a human brain 's inputs and outputs !
There !
I 've got you cornered now !
You ca n't play Follow - The - Improbability any further ! "
Oh .
So your specification is the source of the improbability here .
When we play Follow - The - Improbability again , we end up outside the thought experiment , looking at the philosopher .
That which points to the one GLUT that talks about consciousness , out of all the vast space of possibilities , is now ... the conscious person asking us to imagine this whole scenario .
And our own brains , which will fill in the blank when we imagine , " What will this GLUT say in response to ' Talk about your inner listener ' ? "
The moral of this story is that when you follow back discourse about " consciousness " , you generally find consciousness .
It 's not always right in front of you .
Sometimes it 's very cleverly hidden .
But it 's there .
Hence the Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle .
If there is a Zombie Master in the form of a chatbot that processes and remixes amateur human discourse about " consciousness " , the humans who generated the original text corpus are conscious .
If someday you come to understand consciousness , and look back , and see that there 's a program you can write which will output confused philosophical discourse that sounds an awful lot like humans without itself being conscious — then when I ask " How did this program come to sound similar to humans ? " the answer is that you wrote it to sound similar to conscious humans , rather than choosing on the criterion of similarity to something else .
This does n't mean your little Zombie Master is conscious — but it does mean I can find consciousness somewhere in the universe by tracing back the chain of causality , which means we 're not entirely in the Zombie World .
But suppose someone actually did reach into a GLUT - bin and by genuinely pure chance pulled out a GLUT that wrote philosophy papers ?
Well , then it would n't be conscious .
IMHO .
I mean , there 's got to be more to it than inputs and outputs .
Otherwise even a GLUT would be conscious , right ?
Oh , and for those of you wondering how this sort of thing relates to my day job ...
In this line of business you meet an awful lot of people who think that an arbitrarily generated powerful AI will be " moral " .
They can't agree among themselves on why , or what they mean by the word " moral " ; but they all agree that doing Friendly AI theory is unnecessary .
And when you ask them how an arbitrarily generated AI ends up with moral outputs , they proffer elaborate rationalizations aimed at AIs of that which they deem " moral " ; and there are all sorts of problems with this , but the number one problem is , " Are you sure the AI would follow the same line of thought you invented to argue human morals , when , unlike you , the AI does n't start out knowing what you want it to rationalize ? "
You could call the counter - principle Follow - The - Decision - Information , or something along those lines .
You can account for an AI that does improbably nice things by telling me how you chose the AI 's design from a huge space of possibilities , but otherwise the improbability is being pulled out of nowhere — though more and more heavily disguised , as rationalized premises are rationalized in turn .
So I 've already done a whole series of posts which I myself generated using Follow - The - Improbability .
But I did n't spell out the rules explicitly at that time , because I had n't done the thermodynamic posts yet ...
Just thought I 'd mention that .
It 's amazing how many of my Overcoming Bias posts would coincidentally turn out to include ideas surprisingly relevant to discussion of Friendly AI theory ... if you believe in coincidence .
Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros , stars of the ABC megahit " Lost , " were arrested by Honolulu cops in December 2005 and charged with drunk driving .
Rodriguez , 27 , and Watros , 37 , were nabbed minutes apart as their respective cars weaved along a highway linking Kailua and Honolulu .
The actresses , both of whom failed field sobriety tests , were each charged with driving under the influence and released after posting $ 500 bail .
Rodriguez , pictured in a Honolulu Police Department mug shot , plays " Ana Lucia " on the TV series .
Watros , who looks pretty toasted in her booking photo , plays " Libby " on the top -rated series .
Today Amazon Web Services launched two new features in Amazon EC2 that are essential tools in building highly resilient applications : Elastic IP addresses and Availability Zones .
In summary :
Elastic IP addresses are associated with a customer account and allow the customer to do its own dynamic mapping of IP address to instance .
Using this dynamic mapping applications can remain reachable even in the presence of failures .
This is an area where for example DNS reconfiguration is too slow a technique .
are associated with a customer account and allow the customer to do its own dynamic mapping of IP address to instance .
Using this dynamic mapping applications can remain reachable even in the presence of failures .
This is an area where for example DNS reconfiguration is too slow a technique .
Availability Zones allow the customer to specify in which location to launch a new EC2 instance .
The world is divided up into Regions and a Region can hold multiple Availability Zones .
These Zones are distinct locations within a region that are engineered to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones and provide inexpensive , low latency network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same region .
By launching instances in separate Availability Zones , applications can be protected from failure of a single location .
With these two features EC2 customers now have tools to build applications that can tolerate a wide range of failure scenarios .

Update : excellent articles by the guys at RightScale : Using Elastic IP in switch - over scenarios , using Availability Zones to set up a fault - tolerant site and combining Elastic IP and Availability Zones .

The Bush administration is proposing that Congress authorize it to buy billions of dollars in federal student loans to make sure the nation ’s credit crunch does not block borrowing for higher education .
The proposal , outlined in a letter to be sent Wednesday to members of Congress from the Education and Treasury Departments and the Office of Management and Budget , endorses a provision in a bill passed by the House this month .
It is the latest sign of deepening concern that the combination of tougher standards for borrowers , lender withdrawals from federal student loan programs and falling housing prices poses a threat to families struggling to cope with rising tuition .
By buying loans , the government would provide capital to lenders to make new loans .
“ I want to make double - dog sure that we have the tools necessary ” to make sure federal loans continue to be available , Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said in an interview on Tuesday .
“ If we do n’t need to use them , so be it . ”
Ms. Spellings said she was not sure under what circumstances the Education Department would actually begin to buy the loans .
“ This is dynamic , ” she said .
“ We do n’t know . ”
WASHINGTON , Dec. 10  Lawyers within the clandestine branch of the Central Intelligence Agency gave written approval in advance to the destruction in 2005 of hundreds of hours of videotapes documenting interrogations of two lieutenants from Al Qaeda , according to a former senior intelligence official with direct knowledge of the episode .
The involvement of agency lawyers in the decision making would widen the scope of the inquiries into the matter that have now begun in Congress and within the Justice Department .
Any written documents are certain to be a focus of government investigators as they try to reconstruct the events leading up to the tapes ’ destruction .
The former intelligence official acknowledged that there had been nearly two years of debate among government agencies about what to do with the tapes , and that lawyers within the White House and the Justice Department had in 2003 advised against a plan to destroy them .
But the official said that C.I.A. officials had continued to press the White House for a firm decision , and that the C.I.A. was never given a direct order not to destroy the tapes .
“ They never told us , ‘ Hell , no , ’ ” he said .
“ If somebody had said , ‘ You cannot destroy them , ’ we would not have destroyed them . ”

A few years ago , I used to spend a lot of time on eBay trying to spot attractive bargains for LCD screens and video projectors .
Auctioning sites are an excellent place to find out about price levels and market demand but they also provide impostors and swindlers with a stage .
In the eBay offerings you ’ll often find DIY and step by step books that will tell you how easy it is to make a video projector yourself using only a cardboard box and an old LCD screen .
Out of curiosity I decided to invest the $ 39.99 to purchase such an online book but , to my great disappointment , I never received it .
Not only was I upset about losing my money but I was frustrated I would n’t get a chance at building the projector .
All this time , I thought the whole “ build your own projector ” was a scam and that it was technologically impossible to realize until I found this cool video on Youtube where you can see how to do it yourself .
In fact , using an LCD monitor , an overhead projector , a cooling fan and a little of your time you can actually create your own home cinema projector .
You do n’t need to spend a foolish 40 bucks , just check out the video to find out .

Kenny
Richey wishes he was back in prison at times
Not many people can say they have looked Death in the face and lived to tell the tale .
Kenny Richey can .
He was sentenced to death in America and spent over 21 years in prison , much of that time on Death Row .
Kenny was born in Scotland but moved to the States to live with his father in 1982 , when he was 18 .
Two years later he was charged with the murder of two - year - old Cynthia Collins , who died in a fire in the flat she shared with her mother .
Choice of death Kenny denied he was responsible for setting the fire but was found guilty .
He became prisoner 194764 on death row .
At one point he was one hour away from execution and asked how he would like to die .
" Would you like to be lethal injection or the electric chair " , he told me as we sat on the sofa of his mother 's cramped Edinburgh flat sipping strong tea .
" What did you say ? " I asked .
" I said neither " , was his dead - pan reply .
Kenny continued to insist he was an innocent man .
Even when he was offered a plea bargain that would have seen him released more than ten years ago , he refused to confess .
' Flawed prosecution ' " I 'm not about to admit to something I did n't do , " Kenny Richey told the BBC in 2000 .
" Not for anything . "
And Kenny was innocent .
A BBC investigation in 2000 exposed crucial flaws in the prosecution case , adding more momentum to the campaign for his release .
Nevertheless it took eight years before Kenny 's appeal was successful .
He was finally released from prison on 7 January 2008 .
Kenny Richey was one hour away from execution
The next day he flew back to his home in Scotland .
It is now three months since Kenny returned home but , as I discovered when I met him , if anything freedom has been even more difficult than captivity .
" I do n't feel free , " Kenny tells me , his hands shaking as he lights another cigarette .
" I feel like I 'm still imprisoned - inside it 's like I 'm still in prison . "
It is a familiar story .
Difficult freedom
Other victims of miscarriages of justice have found it very difficult to adjust when they are finally released .
Paddy Hill was one of the so - called Birmingham Six , wrongfully accused of an IRA bomb attack in 1974 .
He was released 17 years ago and is still trying to come to terms with what happened to him .
Paddy
Hill now works for a charity which helps victims of miscarriages of justice .
The ONE Show arranged for him to meet Kenny to help him adjust to life outside .
Their meeting is an emotional moment .
They last spoke 10 years ago when Kenny was still on death row .
' Poxy cell ' " One of the best things for us is we have shared experience " , Paddy tells him .
" Even though your cell may have been a few thousand miles away one poxy prison cell is the same as the other . "
But Kenny 's problems are deep - rooted .
" I lost 21 and a half years of my life and I 've got nothing to show for it , " he says .
" The world has left me behind . "
He says back in Scotland he is lonely and has seriously contemplated suicide .
He has even fantasised about going back to prison .
It is a common phenomenon , according to Paddy .
Paddy
Hill says innocent people freed from jail need support
He says one of the biggest problems for victims of miscarriages of justice like Kenny is the lack of professional support .
Medical help
His charity , the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation ( MOJO ) , helps victims to seek medical help , counselling and to try and get them work .
But it is not going to be easy , he warns Kenny .
Adjusting to life outside prison after more than two decades inside is going to take many , many years .
Before I leave , I ask Kenny what he hopes for in his life now .
" I hope get a life .
Just to find a wee bit of happiness - just a smidgeon - that 's probably all I can find if I find it . "
That does n't sound like much , I say .
" I 'm telling you it 's a hell of an ambition , " Paddy Hill tells me .

What are these ?
Do you support this move or are you against it ?
Make your voice heard in our poll at the end of this article .
The English Premier League clubs are considering a proposal to play some matches at overseas venues starting from the 2011 /2012 season .
The idea is to extend the regular season to 39 games , with the extra 10 games being played at 5 select venues around the world ( US , Middle East and Far East Asia are the obvious 3 destinations , but will we see clubs going to Africa , South East Asia , South America and Australia as well ? ) .
The proposal suggests picking actual fixtures by draw , although the star clubs may not always be paired with each other to avoid drab fixtures like Derby County v Bolton Wanderers being played in Buenos Aires to an empty stadium ( I could n’t resist … ) .
Why , you ask ?
Chris from EPL
Talk puts it succinctly :
The reason why the Premier League is considering this revolutionary idea is because the international TV rights deal could soon be worth more than the domestic TV deal in the United Kingdom .
If this does happen , which looks very probable , then the Premier League will value the international rights deal as being able to produce more revenue for its clubs .
It ’s for the MONEY !
And the direct ( and indirect ) support ( financial ) of millions … and millions of Premier League fans around the world ( all of whom support Manchester United , or Chelsea , or Arsenal , depending on who was champion when they started watching – another reason why Liverpool is struggling to attract worldwide support for their takeover bid – if it was Manchester United ( lots of fans ) or Arsenal ( very active online community ) they would have put up the money by now… ) .
Mihir Bose – BBC Sport :
“ The market in the United Kingdom is becoming saturated and it is the overseas market which is now the big target area .
A number of top - flight clubs already play matches around the world as they seek to capitalise on the huge global interest in the English game . ”
Some simple questions that have difficult answers :
Will the points from these games count ?
I sure hope so …
Are n’t the home fans ( and away fans , for clubs that are actually supported ) being shortchanged ?
That problem seems to have been neatly sidestepped by adding an extra game in the season instead of shifting a regular fixture .
And considering the support of the Premier League , you can expect matches to be mostly sold - out for the top 5 - 6 clubs , and the rest , well , the Premier League are excellent marketers and I ’m sure they will be able to fill all the seats for 80 - 90 percent , if not all , games .
Will my club ever come play in my country ?
Indian fans would be most likely to ask this question and the answer is yes , there is a very good chance that a top Premier League club will play in India in the next decade .
Pakistan – well , I seriously doubt it .
Australian fans – yes again , I think a Premiership club will go there as well .
Not so sure about South America , although South Africa will be a popular destination too .
One more match in an already congested fixture list ?
Yes , one more game , and frankly , one that will help build the profile of these clubs and the league as a whole abroad , and as such would be far more important than a domestic cup game ( shoot me if you will ) .
Fixture congestion is a different issue and reducing one game or adding one game is not going to make much of a difference .
What WILL change things is if we rearranged the structure of the league to introduce a winter break , and that ’s a different debate .
When will they decide ?
A formal decision will not be taken until the annual Premier League meeting in June .
Considering the financial benefits , I doubt that any club will disagree , although the technicalities of managing
No local fans = no atmosphere = soulless games !
Is this really football ?
If it ’s for points , then yes , it really is football , no matter where you play it .
If it ’s not for points , then the games become meaningless friendlies and lose their commercial value .
The atmosphere at the recent United friendly in Riyadh was quite good , even if there were n’t any ‘ traditional ’
United support there .
So how much money is really involved ?
From the above - linked BBC article :
The Premier League ’s income from the sale of overseas TV rights has already increased from £ 178 m in 2001 to £ 625 m for the current deal that runs until 2010 .
Broadcaster NowTV paid around £ 100 m for the rights to Hong Kong alone .
Premier League games are broadcast to over 600 m homes in 202 countries worldwide , while an estimated 1bn people watched the Premier League game between Manchester United and Arsenal in November 2007 .
There ’s money there alright , just not in the Wigan v Birmingham fixtures …
But wo n’t this turn supporters against the clubs ?
EPL
Talk makes some excellent arguments for this point , all of which you can read here .
I strongly disagree though – the emotional ties that bond a club to its local support will still remain , and only sentimental fools would consider this as betrayal if their clubs go and play an EXTRA fixture in the season at an overseas venue .
Thing is , football is full of sentimental fools and devoid of reason .
Oh well …
The co-chairman of the Football Supporters Federation , Malcom Clarke , had this to say :
“ I ’m fairly confident in predicting that the overwhelming majority of football supporters will be totally opposed to this proposal .
This is yet another case of the Premier League threatening the tradition of our game simply to follow money .
The idea that teams can play a league game in a place where their supporters wo n’t be able to go and watch them will be totally opposed by the vast majority of supporters .
What I want to do is put a challenge to the Premier League to abandon this completely if the majority of supporters turn out to be against it . ”
Sure , let ’s put it to the supporters – hang on , are we going to include those supporters who would die for their clubs around the world , or is it a case of only England - based supporters qualifying as true supporters ?
Lawrie Sanchez :
“ Other national associations wo n’t be happy about the Premier League coming into their game , taking sponsors , taking advertising , taking revenue from their game . ”
Would n’t it increase football ’s exposure in those regions ?
Any more questions – list them below and I ’ll add answers here in the article .
Should Premier League Clubs Play An Extra Fixture Overseas Every Season ?

What it means to be a Christian after George W. Bush
President Bush joins marines in prayer at Camp Lejeune , N.C. , on April 3 , 2003 .
Accordiing to a Pew Charitable Trusts poll that month , 87 percent of white American evangelicals supported the president 's decision to invade Iraq .
( Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP )
If God 's on our side , He 'll stop the next war -- Bob Dylan EARLY ONE SUNDAY morning in the spring of 2003 , in the quiet hours before services would begin at the evangelical church where I worship in Charlottesville , Virginia , I opened files compiled by my research assistant and read the statements drafted by Christians around the world in opposition to the American invasion of Iraq .
The experience was profoundly moving and shaming : From Pentecostals in Brazil to the Christian Councils of Ghana , from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East to the Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem , from Pope John Paul II to the The Waldensian Reformed Church of Italy and the Christian Conference of Asia , the voices of our brothers and sisters in the global ecumenical church spoke in unison .
Why did American evangelicals not pause for a moment in the rush to war to consider the near - unanimous disapproval of the global Christian community ?
The worldwide Christian opposition seems to me the most neglected story related to the religious debate about Iraq : Despite approval for the president 's decision to go to war by 87 percent of white evangelicals in April 2003 , according to a Pew Charitable Trusts poll , almost every Christian leader in the world ( and almost every nonevangelical leader in the United States ) voiced opposition to the war .
In their enthusiastic support of the White House 's decision to invade Iraq , evangelicals in the United States practiced an ecumenical isolationism that mirrored the prevailing political trend .
Rush Limbaugh may have pleased his " dittoheads " in mocking the dissenting pastors , archbishops , bishops , and church leaders who stuck their noses into our nation 's foreign policy , but the people in the United States who call themselves Christian must organize their priorities and values on a different standard than partisan loyalty .
These past six years have been transformative in the religious history of the United States .
It is arguably the passing of the evangelical moment -- if not the end of evangelicalism 's cultural and political relevance , then certainly the loss of its theological credibility .
Conservative evangelical elites , in exchange for political access and power , have ransacked the faith and trivialized its convictions .
It is as though these Christians consider themselves to be recipients of a special revelation , as if God has whispered eternal secrets in their ears and summoned them to world - historic leadership in the present and future .
One thing , however , is clear :
Any hope for renewal depends on the willingness to reach out to our brothers and sisters abroad .
We must reshape the way we live in the global Christian community and form a deeper link to the human family and to life .
To do this , we must begin by learning to be quieter , and by reaffirming the simple fact that our faith transcends political loyalty or nationhood .
. . .
In a German concentration camp in 1944 , the theologian , pastor , and Christian martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer pondered the future of the church in Germany as it lay in the ruins of its fatal allegiance to Hitler .
" The time of words is over , " he wrote .
" Our being a Christian today will be limited to two things : prayer and righteous action . "
Bonhoeffer , who had actively opposed the Nazis since the passage of the Aryan Laws of 1933 and was executed in April 1945 , believed that the church had so compromised its witness to Jesus Christ that it was now incapable of " taking the word of reconciliation and redemption to mankind and the world . "
The misuse of the language of faith had humiliated the Word ; any hope for renewal would need to begin with the humble recognition that God was most certainly tired of all our talk .
It is time to give Bonhoeffer 's meditations a new hearing .
With many other Christians in the United States and many more abroad , I have watched with horror in recent years as the name of Jesus has been used to serve national ambitions and justify war .
Forgetting the difference between discipleship and partisanship , and with complete indifference to the wisdom and insights of the Christian tradition , we have recast the faith according to our cultural preferences and baptized our prejudices , along with our will - to - power , in the shallow waters of civic piety .
By the time American troops began bombing Baghdad before sunrise on March 20 , 2003 , the collective effort of the evangelical elites had sanctified the president 's decision and encouraged the laity to believe that the war was God 's will for the nation .
Evangelicals preached for the war , prayed for the war , sang for the war , and offered God 's blessings on the war .
Sometime after Operation Iraqi Freedom began , I made a remarkable discovery .
I had gone to one of my local Christian bookstores to find a Bible for my goddaughter .
On a whim , I also decided to look for a Holy Spirit lapel pin , in the symbolic shape of a dove , the kind that had always been easy to find in the display case in the front .
Many people in my church and in the places where I traveled had been wearing the American flag on their lapel for months now .
It seemed like a pretty good time for Christians to put the Spirit back on .
But the doves were nowhere in sight .
In the place near the front where I once would have found them , I was greeted instead by a full assortment of patriotic accessories -- red - white - and - blue ties , bandanas , buttons , handkerchiefs , " I support our troops " ribbons , " God Bless America " gear , and an extraordinary cross and flag button with the two images interlocked .
I felt slightly panicked by the new arrangement .
I asked the clerk behind the counter where the doves had gone .
The man 's response was jarring , although the remark might well be remembered as an apt theological summation of our present religious age .
" They 're in the back with the other discounted items , " he said , nodding in that direction .
I have thought of this visit to the local Christian bookstore many times in the past several years .
I remember the outrage I felt when I saw a photograph in Time magazine during the 2004 presidential election of Christian Coalition activists in Ohio .
Two men , both white , and both identified as Coalition members , are holding two crosses aloft .
The crosses upon closer inspection appear to be made of balloons twisted together .
Across the beam - section of one of the crosses was the " Bush - Cheney " logo , and alongside the president 's name was the image of an American flag .
In the second cross , the president 's name appeared in full at the places where Jesus 's hands were nailed .
. . .
Like Bonhoeffer , I fear that the gospel has been humiliated in our time .
But if this has happened , it is not because the message -- the good news that God loves us unconditionally in Jesus Christ , that we are freed and forgiven in God 's amazing grace -- has changed .
Nor is it due to the machinations of secularists , or because the post - Enlightenment world has dispensed with the hypothesis of God .
The Christian faith has not only endured modernity and post - modernity , but flourished in its new settings .
The gospel has been humiliated because too many American Christians have decided that there are more important things to talk about .
We would rather talk about our country , our values , our troops , and our way of life ; and although we might think we are paying tribute to God when we speak of these other things , we are only flattering ourselves .
If only holiness were measured by the volume of our incessant chatter , we would be universally praised as the most holy nation on earth .
But in our fretful , theatrical piety , we have come to mistake noisiness for holiness , and we have presumed to know , with a clarity and certitude that not even the angels dared claim , the divine will for the world .
We have organized our needs with the confidence that God is on our side , now and always , whether we feed the poor or corral them into ghettos .
To a nation filled with intense religious fervor , the Hebrew prophet Amos said :
You are not the holy people you imagine yourselves to be .
Though the land is filled with festivals and assemblies , with songs and melodies , and with so much pious talk , these are not sounds and sights that are pleasing to the Lord .
" Take away from me the noise of your congregations , " Amos says , " you who have turned justice into poison . "
Psalm 46 tells us , " Be still and know that I am God . " Dietrich Bonhoeffer , in his classic work on Christian community , " Life Together , " spoke of a silence " before the Word . "
He affirmed the wisdom of the Psalmist , and spoke of a listening silence that brings " clarification , purification , and concentration upon the essential thing . "
After all the talk and the noise , it is time for Christians in the United States to enter a season of quietness , being still , and learning to wait on God ( perhaps for the first time ) .
Bonhoeffer wrote " Life Together " during the years he directed an illegal seminary in the North German village of Finkenwalde .
The school 's mission was training pastors in the Confessing Church , a reform movement that opposed the nazified German Evangelical Church .
Bonhoeffer had served in the Abwehr , the Nazi counterintelligence agency , as a double agent -- helping Jewish families escape to Switzerland and organizing a coup attempt against the Nazi regime -- and he participated in several assassination attempts on Hitler .
For Bonhoeffer , being still in a time of enormous historical and ecclesial crisis was no invitation to idleness or indifference ; rather , it was a call to discernment and responsible action .
. . .
Indeed , there are times when silence is an admonition fraught with danger .
Martin Luther King Jr. warned of the " appalling silence of the good people " and those who turned their faces from suffering and oppression .
But Dr. King also knew that careful and respectful speech was born of honest discernment of God 's moral demands for the present age -- a discernment that begins in humility and quiet introspection .
I came of age in the American South in the 1960s , and the moral values shared by most families in the churches of my childhood were deeply interwoven with our culture 's hold on white supremacy .
The vigilant and quite often neurotic defense we made of the Southern Way of Life blinded us not only to the sufferings of African - Americans -- the victims of our collective self - righteousness -- but also to our spiritual arrogance and group pride .
We believed that our conception of Christianity and our cherished family values were the most wholesome and pure the world had ever known .
Inside this serene delusion , we presumed ourselves to be paragons of virtue , although we rarely lifted a finger to help anyone but our own .
It was unsettling to learn , sometime in my adolescence , that the moral values I inherited as a white Southerner were not the marks of true Christian piety .
When Jesus spoke of the family , he had in mind the new community of God .
" Who are my mother and my brothers ? " he said one day upon hearing that his family was asking for him .
" Here are my mother and my brothers ! "
Jesus said , pointing to the people gathered around him , who marveled at his words .
" Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother . "
Jesus knew that loyalty to the Kingdom of Heaven would often require the renunciation of family traditions , habits , culture , and custom .
Today , in the national debate on faith and politics , there are signs of hope as an emerging generation of Christian leaders holds out the promise of a more comprehensively just and moral account of faith than the narrow agendas of the Christian right .
In particular , the success of Sojourners magazine editor Jim Wallis 's 2005 book , " God 's Politics , " introduced many Americans to a vibrant culture of progressive Christianity ready to exert its growing influence over national politics and mobilize the churches around global poverty and AIDS relief .
And there are other encouraging signs : Criticisms of torture and detention practices of the US military by prominent Christian conservatives have been symbolically powerful moments .
The emerging environmental consciousness among an increasing number of evangelical leaders and laity signals a more holistic social mission .
Even so , as welcome as these developments are , no explicitly partisan movement -- left or right -- to reclaim the soul of politics can reckon successfully with the grave effects of the Christian saturation of the American public square .
Unless conditioned by clear and public confession of our support of the immoral and catastrophic war in Iraq , and our complicity in the humiliation of the Word , these efforts will lack coherence and a vital center .
Franklin Graham , the evangelist ( and son of Billy Graham ) , boasted that the American invasion of Iraq opens up exciting new opportunities for missions to non-Christian Arabs .
This is not what the Hebrew or Christian prophets meant by righteousness and discipleship .
In fact , the grotesque notion that preemptive war and the destruction of innocent life pave the way for the preaching of the Christian message strikes me as a mockery and a betrayal .
But if Franklin Graham speaks truthfully of the Christian faith and its mission in the world -- as many evangelicals seem to believe -- then we should have none of it .
Rather , we should join the ranks of righteous unbelievers and big- hearted humanists who rage against cruelty and oppression with the intensity of people who live fully in this world .
I am certain that it would be better for Christians to stand in solidarity with compassionate atheists and agnostics , firmly resolved against injustice and cruelty , than to sing " Amazing Grace " with the heroic masses who cannot tell the difference between the cross and the flag .

Maybe Big D can handle Pacman Jones .
The Dallas Cowboys and Tennessee Titans agreed in principle on a trade on Wednesday for the suspended cornerback .
The agreement , which was first reported by ESPN's Ed Werder , was confirmed to The Associated Press by both teams .
There were so many loose ends that needed to be tied down that the trade was not finalized Thursday .
It might not happen Friday , either .
Yet it seems likely to be settled by early afternoon Saturday , in time for the start of the NFL draft .
Sources told Werder that Dallas will send its fourth - round pick ( the 126th overall ) in Saturday 's draft to the Titans for Jones .
" We 're still in the process of finalizing the trade papers , the contracts , so it 's a very complicated process with Dallas , the NFL , the player , ourselves , " Titans general manager Mike Reinfeldt said Thursday , according to The Associated Press .
" So until that situation is finalized , we will not comment on it .
However , as soon as it is finalized , we will have some type of get - together to address the situation in detail . "
There are also conditions attached to the trade related to Jones being reinstated by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and how much he plays for the Cowboys .
If he plays a significant amount of time in 2008 , the Titans will get an additional pick from the Cowboys in 2009 .
If he does n't get reinstated by the NFL , sources said the Cowboys get the Titans ' fourth - round pick in 2009 .
The talks represent a change of sides for Mr. Murdoch .
Just days after Microsoft made its bid , he flew to the West Coast and had dinner with Jerry Yang , Yahoo ’s chief executive , offering his assistance in fending off Microsoft .
A deal between them would have involved joining forces with Google to use its lucrative advertising system on the companies ’ sites .
Antitrust concerns have , however , all but scuttled those talks , at least in that form .
On Wednesday , Yahoo suggested that it might be willing to cede part of its core business to Google , an archrival , to remain independent .
Yahoo said it would begin outsourcing a small portion of its search advertising to Google .
The limited test is meant to determine whether the company could extract more revenue if Google ran its search advertising system .
The test results might also back Yahoo ’s contention that Microsoft ’s offer undervalues the company , a person briefed on the plan said .
In the two - week test , Yahoo will use Google ’s search advertising system to deliver ads that appear alongside Yahoo ’s search results .
The test will involve searches conducted in the United States on Yahoo.com , not on any of the company ’s search affiliates , and will be limited to no more than 3 percent of all search queries , Yahoo said in a statement .
Yahoo also said there was no guarantee that the test would lead to a broader deal .
Microsoft immediately blasted the idea of a search advertising partnership between Yahoo and Google , saying it would be anticompetitive .
“ Any definitive agreement between Yahoo and Google would consolidate over 90 percent of the search advertising market in Google ’s hands , ” Microsoft said in a statement .
In Washington , Senator Herb Kohl , a Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee ’s Subcommittee on Antitrust , Competition Policy and Consumer Rights , also warned about the potential anticompetitive implications .
Over 10 days , we visited just about every farm and homestead in the two principal islands .
We were greeted everywhere - and we could see the slogans and the union flag from the air before we landed - with the same messages : " Chalfont Go Home " and sometimes " We Want To Stay British " .
The islanders were adamant .
They wanted nothing to do with Argentina , and Chalfont left them with a promise that nothing would happen without their agreement .
Fourteen years later , in 1982 , Britain and Argentina were at war over the islands , and nearly a thousand people lost their lives .
Today we are invited to recall the 25th anniversary of that event , and the Argentinian government has reminded us of its claim , pulling out of the 1995 agreement about joint oil exploration that had been fondly embraced by the Foreign Office as an alternative to discussing anything as conflictive as sovereignty .
People sometimes ask me why Argentinians make such an endless fuss about the islands they call Las Malvinas .
The answer is simple .
The Falklands belong to Argentina .
They just happen to have been seized , occupied , populated and defended by Britain .
Because Argentina 's claim is perfectly valid , its dispute with Britain will never go away , and because much of Latin America is now falling into the hands of the nationalist left , the government in Buenos Aires will enjoy growing rhetorical support in the continent ( and indeed elsewhere , from the current government in Iraq , for example ) , to the increasing discomfiture of Britain .
All governments in Argentina , of whatever stripe , will continue to claim the Malvinas , just as governments in Belgrade will always lay claim to Kosovo .
The Falklands were seized for Britain in January 1833 during an era of dramatic colonial expansion .
Captain John Onslow of HMS Clio had instructions " to exercise the rights of sovereignty " over the islands , and he ordered the Argentinian commander to haul down his flag and withdraw his forces .
Settlers from Argentina were replaced by those from Britain and elsewhere , notably Gibraltar .
Britain and Argentina have disagreed ever since about the rights and wrongs of British occupation , and for much of the time the British authorities have been aware of the relative weakness of their case .
An item in the Public Record Office refers to a Foreign Office document of 1940 entitled " Offer made by His Majesty 's government to reunify the Falkland Islands with Argentina and to agree to a lease - back " .
Though its title survives , the document itself has been embargoed until 2015 , although it may well exist in another archive .
It was presumably an offer thrown out to the pro-German government of Argentina at the time , to keep them onside at a difficult moment in the war , though perhaps it was a draft or a jeu d'esprit dreamt up in the office .
The record suggests that successive UK governments have considered the British claim to the islands to be weak , and some have favoured negotiations .
Recently released documents recall that James Callaghan , when foreign secretary in the 1970s , noted that " we must yield some ground and ... be prepared to discuss a lease - back arrangement " .
The secretary of the cabinet pointed out that " there are many ways in which Argentina could act against us , including invasion of the islands ... and we are not in a position to reinforce and defend the islands as a long - term commitment .
The alternative of standing firm and taking the consequences is accordingly not practicable . "
Of course , some people argue that Britain 's physical possession of the islands , and its declared intention to hold them against all comers , makes its claim superior to Argentina's .
Some believe that the Argentine invasion of the islands in 1982 , and their subsequent forced retreat , in some way invalidates their original claim .
Britain , above all , owes some debt to the heirs to the settlers who were originally sent there , a debt recognised in the Foreign Office mantra that , in all dealings with Argentina about the islands ' future , the wishes of the islanders will be " paramount " .
Yet no such debt was recognised in the case of the inhabitants of Diego Garcia , perhaps because Britain inherited them from the French rather than planting the settlers themselves .
Ironically , the Falkland islanders are the outcome of a 19th - century scheme of settlement not very different from the experience of Argentina in the same century , which brought in settlers from Italy , Germany , England and Wales , and planted them on land from which the native Indians had been cleared and exterminated .
The record of the islanders looks rather cleaner by comparison .
Yet the Argentinian claim is still a good one , and it will never go away .
At some stage , sovereignty and lease - back will have to be on the agenda again , regardless of the wishes of the islanders .
Ideally , the Falklands should be included in a wider post - colonial cleanup of ancient territories .
This would rid Britain of responsibility for Northern Ireland ( almost gone ) , Gibraltar ( under discussion ) , and for Diego Garcia ( de facto given to the Americans ) , and anywhere else that anyone can still remember .
This post - colonial policy should have been adopted many years ago ( and perhaps Harold Wilson 's government was groping towards this end in the 1960s when Denis Healey abandoned British commitments east of Suez , and when Chalfont was sent to Port Stanley ) , and it should at least have been considered when we abandoned Hong Kong in the 1990s .
Yet the strength of Blair 's imperial revivalism , forever echoed in the popular press , suggests that this prospect is as far away as it was in 1982 .

Thanks to Mok for sharing this photos .
This photos were taken in one of the shopping complex parking in Malaysia .
The photo was taken when they were having a chat at the car park before everyone going off .
The photographer taken a few shots at their cars and 2 of them show an uninvited guest “ a ghost ” .
He was shocked and distribute to all his friends and of course their reaction was shocking .
Updates :
One of the visitor wrote to me that a girl was hit several years ago at this parking lot .
Many security guards there had seen her before during their routine patrol check .
Most of them were reluctant to patrol this floor .
In a study of New Zealand 's " living dinosaur " the tuatara , evolutionary biologist , and ancient DNA expert , Professor David Lambert and his team from the Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution recovered DNA sequences from the bones of ancient tuatara , which are up to 8000 years old .
They found that , although tuatara have remained largely physically unchanged over very long periods of evolution , they are evolving - at a DNA level - faster than any other animal yet examined .
" What we found is that the tuatara has the highest molecular evolutionary rate that anyone has measured , " Professor Lambert says .
The rate of evolution for Adélie penguins , which Professor Lambert and his team have studied in the Antarctic for many years , is slightly slower than that of the tuatara .
The tuatara rate is significantly faster than for animals including the cave bear , lion , ox and horse .
" Of course we would have expected that the tuatara , which does everything slowly -- they grow slowly , reproduce slowly and have a very slow metabolism -- would have evolved slowly .
In fact , at the DNA level , they evolve extremely quickly , which supports a hypothesis proposed by the evolutionary biologist Allan Wilson , who suggested that the rate of molecular evolution was uncoupled from the rate of morphological evolution . "
Allan Wilson was a pioneer of molecular evolution .
His ideas were controversial when introduced 40 years ago , but this new research supports them .
Professor Lambert says the finding will be helpful in terms of future study and conservation of the tuatara , and the team now hopes to extend the work to look at the evolution of other animal species .
" We want to go on and measure the rate of molecular evolution for humans , as well as doing more work with moa and Antarctic fish to see if rates of DNA change are uncoupled in these species .
There are human mummies in the Andes and some very good samples in Siberia where we have some collaborators , so we are hopeful we will be able to measure the rate of human evolution in these animals too . "
The tuatara , Sphendon punctatus , is found only in New Zealand and is the only surviving member of a distinct reptilian order Sphehodontia that lived alongside early dinosaurs and separated from other reptiles 200 million years ago in the Upper Triassic period .

Rob Foster has almost all the Star Wars figures and models known to mankind , Hutts and Bothans .
He and his girlfriend share their home with an overwhelming army of Star Wars collectibles , from vintage 1977 figures to full battalions of the latest Storm Troopers and giant Ultimate Collector LEGO models , in and out of their original boxes , in formation or reenacting movie scenes .
Amazing 134 - image gallery documenting every figure and angle , plus an exclusive interview with Rob after the jump .

It 's Toy Fair 2008 and Rob Foster is looking for what figures and models to get next .
Every year , companies like Hasbro , LEGO or Gentle Giant release new products related to Rob 's favorite toy franchise ever : Star Wars .
Jesús Díaz : Hello Rob , stunning collection .
The sheer scale , all those figures forming on the shelves , the models hanging everywhere , even all that LEGO stuff ... it 's just amazing .
As I was going through each image , my only thought was : " omfg , it ca n't be real . "
So first of all : how many figures does your collection have ?
Advertisement
Rob Foster : In terms of 3 3/4 " figures , I 'd say that there are a little under 2,000 open figures , and 800 or so that are still in the packaging .
JD : When it all started ?
RF : I started collecting in 1995 when Hasbro brought the line back .
I was 15 at the time .
JD : Long time .
How much do you calculate it is all worth now ?
Something along the lines of the Transformers $ 1,000,000 collection ?
RF : To be honest , I have no idea .
The vintage and Gentle Giant products do well when you 're trying to sell them , but the modern stuff is over - produced compared to the 1970's and ' 80s .
It 's not about making money , so I do n't worry about that .

JD : You mention overproduction and I see that you really enjoy getting massive numbers of troopers as well as different models ... inside all this plastic horde , are there any favorites ?
RB : Probably my favorite is actually the custom vintage Gargan .
She was the fat dancer in Jabba 's palace and was set to be made into the vintage line before it fell apart in the mid ' 80s .
She was sculpted by Ryan Shaw to match the vintage style , and to my knowledge only about 25 of them were made .

JD : What 's the oldest one ?
RF :
The oldest ones are the first series of vintage toys that came out with the movie in 1977 .
Advertisement
JD : And your latest acquisition ?
RF : I 've slowed down a bit recently , but the latest items I picked up were Hasbro 's new wave of figures , the 2008 models , wave 1 .
JD : What 's the one that took longer to collect ?
You know , the one (s ) you really went the extra mile to grab .
RF : I 've been very picky about the loose vintage set .
I 've been working on it off and on for about six or seven years now .
It 's taken a long time because they have to be perfect when it comes to paint chips and discoloration .
Also , the accessories have to be original vintage too , no reproductions .
I hope to get into that later this year .
JD : So no reproductions whatsoever , all originals ... what about custom pieces from independent model makers ?
RF : Apart from Gargan , I 've stayed away from customs for the most part .

JD : How often do you get there figures ?
Or in other words , are you done yet ?
RF : I 'm certainly not done yet .
I 've been slowing down because I 'm running out of room ( everything has to be contained in that one room ) , but I want to get more into collecting vintage , and as long as Hasbro keeps making a solid product , I 'll stick with the new figures too .
JD : Do you think this is the most complete Star Wars figure collection in the world ... or about to get that title , this side of Skywalker Ranch ?
RF : No , not at all .
A lot of people tell me that it's way up there , but I 've seen some pretty incredible collections over the years , lots of them with much more money sunk into them .

JD : I also see you have the LEGO stuff ; do you have them all ?
RF : I do n't have everything Lego has put out , I 've just picked up those here and there .
The Ultimate Collector Series on the other hand , I actively collect .
I just need to get around to buying the Death Star and Naboo Fighter to have them all .

JD : I see the Ultimate Collectors ... and the Falcon .
How long did it take you to build it ?
RF : I 'm guessing it took about 25 - 30 hours .
I worked on it for a weekend and then in evenings after work for a few days .

JD : I see you have many of the figures in their package yet .
Does every figure ( or almost every one of them ) have the equivalent still inside the original packaging ?
RF : If a figure came on a regular card , I have it open and in the package .
If it came in a big box like with a vehicle or a 5 - pack , I only have them opened .
JD : I think the only question left is how the heck do you support this amazingly dedicated hobby — what 's your job ?
RF : I work in the Art Department at a visual effects / animation studio called Reel FX Creative Studios although my department is now being called " Radium Dallas " ) doing Motion Graphics work .
We do a lot of commercials , but the most recent thing that I worked on that had anything to do with movies , was the opening credits for Mr. Magorium 's Wonder Emporium .
I animated about half of it .

JD : And what does your other half thing about this ?
RB : She 's great about it .
When my girlfriend and I started shopping for a home , the only thing I asked for was an extra room to put the toys in .
She fell in love with this place we live in now , which only has one bedroom and one large main room .
I told her the toys were going in the bedroom , and she said that was just fine .
So that 's our shared bedroom and has been for the last five years .
She 's a champ !
Indeed , she is .
In fact , I can guarantee Rob — whose favorite Star Wars movie is Empire Strikes Back and recently bought a Blu-ray player , just in time — that if she is going through all this , they will go through everything together .
Or at least , that 's what I tell myself every time I look at all that LEGO .

To me , college was a break .
I had spent two and a half years working alongside going to school and bowling every Saturday and Sunday morning , and before that it was the same without the work .
I was an introvert , with very little of a social life , but that was fine , as the person I was then could n't deal with a social life .
I think I was getting ready to crack , going to that damn hell known as high school which is a boot camp in its own way .
Then , I left for a small little college , eight hours away from home .
All of a sudden the amount of responsibility decreased - keeping myself clean , my room clean , my clothes clean , and going to class and doing the assignments .
Ripped out of that rut I was in , forced to grow and change .
Meeting friends , and not the minor kind many people have in high school .
Friends that I spend almost as much time with as I would family .
Friends that get to watch the changes .
I believed college was the real world , but it 's not .
It 's even more of a bubble than it was before , as you do n't need to leave the campus .
The rest of the world disappeared in front of my eyes .
I am in the real world now .
Sure , I have money , and my own place .
But I have to work , I have so many more responsibilities , bills , and the like .
The future can no longer be set aside until later , it stares me in the face every day .
I 'd go back to college in a heartbeat , especially since the changes that started there took until afterward to really have their biggest effects , and I 'd love to spend more time there , adjusting to the person I 'm becoming , being able to experiment with who I am some more ...
Maybe it 's just the type of school that can do it ... maybe going to that state - run megacollege is what can do it ...

Gamers in China , desperate to get their powerups by cheating , are seeding Microsoft IIS servers with exploit code that will steal game logins .
So far the mass attack has hit over 500k webservers .
Brian Krebs has the details , including some of the high - profile webservers affected at his blog on the Washington Post here .
Hundreds of thousands of Web sites – including several at the United Nations and in the U.K. government — have been hacked recently and seeded with code that tries to exploit security flaws in Microsoft Windows to install malicious software on visitors ’ machines .
On Thursday , Spanish anti-virus vendor Panda Security said that it had alerted Microsoft that a flaw IIS was the cause of all the break - ins .
When I asked Microsoft whether they ’d heard from Panda or if the hundreds of thousands of sites were hacked from a patched or unpatched flaw in IIS , a spokesman for the company did n’t offer much more information .
According to Finnish anti-virus maker F - Secure , the number of hacked Web pages serving up malicious software from this attack may be closer to half a million .
All of the hacked sites appear to have Javascript coding adding to their page source that silently pulls down malware from a few domains in China , namely nihaorr1.com , and haoliuliang .
net .
F - Secure says this is due to SQL injection and provides the details here :
So far three different domains have been used to host the malicious content — nmidahena.com , aspder.com and nihaorr1.com .
There ’s a set of files that gets loaded from these sites that attempts to use different exploits to install an online gaming trojan .
Right now the initial exploit page on all domains are unaccessible but that could change .
So if you ’re a firewall administrator we recommend you to block access to them .
The bad news is your webserver could be hacked .
The good news is right now , users visiting your site wo n’t get pwn3d because of your webserver .
Now is the time to harden your databases to make sure no one can inject code onto your webserver .
Do it before the attackers come up with a new domain to host their malware .

One of Irving 's newly - discovered letters .

When British slaver James Irving was shipwrecked and himself enslaved by Arabs , did he see the dark irony of his predicament ?
Not a bit of it , according to newly recovered journals , which provide a rare , self - justifying account of a slave trader .
It started with a shipwreck .
It was swiftly followed by capture and then 14 months working as a slave .
Such a traumatic experience might change the outlook of most people .
But not James Irving .
Irving was an 18th Century , Scottish - born surgeon , who served on slave ships trading out of Liverpool .
Having completed five voyages he became a skipper himself when tragedy struck .
On his first voyage to West Africa as captain of a slave ship , the Anna , in 1789 , Irving and his 10 - man crew were washed up on the coast of what is now Morocco .
After wandering on the beach they were captured , marched deep into the Sahara Desert and sold .
The slaver became a slave - expressly , a domestic servant .
Yet in letters written by Irving , and only recently uncovered , he clearly remained oblivious to the dark irony of his situation .
Writing to British officials for help , he said : " For the sake of Almighty God , neglect us not ...
Let that spirit of humanity which at present Manifests itself throughout the realm actuate you to rescue us speedily from the most intollerable Slavery .
Suffer us not any longer to be the Slaves of Negroes , which reflects an unpardonate Negligence on the man who should see them liberated .
If we are allowed to stay here to toil and be maltreated under a vertical Sun , we Shall soon be lost forever to ourselves , our Wives and familys , our Country and all we hold dear . "
( Letter appealing for help from Vice - Consul , June 1789 ) James Irving 's signature ( Pic courtesy Lancashire Record Office )
After long drawn - out negotiations he and his crew were freed .
One strategy had been for officials to offer medical treatment to the favoured son of the Sultan in return for the release of the Anna 's crew .
Furious at his treatment , Irving never seemed to stop and consider he was simply getting a taste of his own medicine .
Writing to his wife Mary shortly after his release , he explained : " ... I dare say my Good Girl you 'll feel as happy as I do on the termination of my bondage , which I have weathered with ten Thousand difficultys .
Such a severe Affliction happens seldom and one such trial in a mans life , is more than sufficient to prove his fortitude . "
( Letter to his wife , August 1790 ) " Irving remained completely blind to the irony of his situation , " says Suzanne Schwarz , professor of modern history at Liverpool Hope University , who found James Irving 's writings .
" Even though he had direct experience of being treated as a commodity for sale and of the emotional pain of separation from his wife and family , he did not draw any parallels with the trade in Africans . "
JAMES IRVING
Born in Dumfriesshire in 1759
First post at 24 as ship surgeon keeping alive slaves on the " Middle Passage " from Africa to the Americas Died in 1791 on another slaving voyage , probably from disease
The writings are an important counterpoint to those of John Newton , the former slave trader who repented and then gave spiritual advice to William Wilberforce in his campaign against the trade .
Indeed , after being released after two years in enforced labour he returned to Liverpool and sailed again to Africa as the captain of another slave ship .
Ms Schwarz discovered the letters and diaries by accident while researching another project at the Lancashire Record Office .
The papers also detail Irving 's thoughts and feelings once he reaches the Caribbean and provide an unsettling insight into contemporary attitudes towards African slaves .
" ... our Black Cattle are intolerably Noisy and I 'm almost Melted in the Midst of five or six Hundred of them . "
( Letter to his wife from Tobago , December 1786 ) " These are n't the first accounts of a slave ship captain to be discovered , " says Ms Schwarz .
" But most writings came after the abolition of the slave trade .
They 're self - justifying and defensive .
Whereas Irving 's writings come from an earlier period - chatty newsletters not intended for publication which are entirely unselfconscious and without self - censorship . "
In another letter to his wife , Irving spoke of his relief at his safe arrival in the Caribbean , referring only in passing to the deaths of dozens of Africans : " With extatic pleasure am I again enabled to address you from a Christian country .
I arrived off this place this morning after a passage of 46 Days We have been all healthy and buried 48 slaves . "
( Letter to his wife from Barbados , November 1786 )

Modmylife is an awesome website .
Basically someone in New York City has got a video camera and internet connection and walks around doing what you tell them to .
Everyone online at the time makes suggestions , and then votes .
The winning suggestion is what the person must do .
You can read some of the suggestions there in the picture .
They currently have predetermined times to log in ( the next " show " is 8:00 tonight , Friday ) , but they hope to have people out 24/7 in the near future .
I suggest everyone schedule a time to meet on the website so we can sway the vote with an incredible Geekologie presence .
That way we 'll be voting on actions like " punch that hooker " , â€ œmake out with the bag - ladyâ€ and " throw yourself in front of a bus " instead of the typical boring suggestions .

An internet posse of Canadian gearheads used an online forum , Facebook and Google Maps to take down what might be the world 's dumbest car thief – and posted video of the arrest on YouTube .
The thief took a tricked - out Nissan Skyline GT - R for a test drive in Calgary and never came back .
The owner , Shaun Ironside , 27 , called the cops but figured the car was headed for a chop shop , never to be seen again .
Desperate , Ironside posted a thread at Beyond.ca , an automotive discussion forum with 46,000 members .
They 'd nabbed a hit - and - run driver last year , so if anyone could find the car – or what might be left of it – they could stop the thief , Ironside thought .
" I had more confidence in the forum guys finding the car because I know how many of them there are , and they 're all car guys , " said Ironside .
He owns Envision Auto , where the 1991 Nissan was stolen around 1:30 p.m. March 26 .
James Lynch snapped this picture of Shaun Ironside 's stolen car – with the alleged thief behind the wheel – after reading about the theft on the website Beyond.ca .

The thief would be easy to spot , Ironside wrote in the post , because he 's missing the middle and right fingers of his left hand .
The car was pretty unique too – a right - hand - drive model imported from Japan .
The thread languished until the following afternoon when forum moderator James Lynch happened to spot the stolen Skyline and snapped a picture of the suspect behind the wheel – waving his disfigured hand .
" I pulled out my camera , but I wanted to see his hand , so I did the rock out sign , " Lynch , 22 , told Wired.com , referring to the splayed finger gesture that 's ubiquitous at heavy metal concerts .
" He did it back and I saw his hand .
I rolled down my window and yelled , ' Nice stolen car ! '
He 's like , ' It 's not stolen , ' "
The suspect sped off in the turbocharged 400 - horsepower car at more than 100 mph , almost running off the road in the process .
" He 's a lousy driver , " said Lynch , who decided chasing him would n't be wise .
Instead , he called the police and posted the suspect 's picture at Beyond.ca .
" Once the picture was posted , it was like throwing fuel on a fire , " Ironside said of the thread , which racked up more than 1 million pageviews as automotive sites around the world linked to it .
" It just took off . "
Someone christened the suspect " The Claw . "
Several people reported seeing him driving around challenging people to race .
Before long , people were raiding his Facebook page and posting his name , address and photos .
The internet sleuths caught another break around 10:30 p.m. March 27 when a forum member called Numi spotted the GT - R outside the suspect 's house .
Numi could n't read the address , but reported the general location to Ironside and Beyond.ca .
" Next thing you know , there 's Google map postings on the site , showing exactly where he lives , " Ironside said .
Numi – who could not be reached for comment – met Ironside at a gas station near the suspect 's house , but suspect and the car were gone by the time Ironside and the police arrived .
Ironside called it a night and went home to bed .
Punit Patel , a member of the website Beyond.ca , was surprised to find the stolen Nissan parked outside the suspect 's house , so he boxed it in with his Acura Integra and called the owner of the car and the police , who arrested the suspect .
Punit Patel
The next morning , Punit Patel logged on to Beyond . ca to get the latest on the search .
" I figured I 'd go by his place and see where he lived , " Patel , 20 , said .
" The car was parked there .
I was in shock .
I thought he was the dumbest criminal in the world . "
The Skyline sat between two pickup trucks .
Patel parked his Acura Integra in front of it , and then called Ironside .
Ironside arrived 20 minutes later and called the police .
The suspect was in handcuffs 15 minutes later ; Calgary police identified him as Jamie Jacobsen , 18 , and said he 's been charged with theft .
As for the car , it 'll need a little work before Ironside can sell it .
The tires are shot , the alignment is off and the interior reeks of marijuana .
But on the other hand , Ironside found $ 22 and the suspect 's New York Yankee 's cap inside .
He pocketed the money and put the hat on eBay .
The latest bid is $ 265 .
" Considering the circumstances , " Ironside said , " I could n't have asked for a better outcome . "

Naming twins in Python & Perl [ Jan. 6th , 2008 | 02:16 pm ] Brad Fitzpatrick
Last night at Beau 's party , one of Beau 's guests mentioned he 's expecting twins shortly , which is why is wife was n't at the party .
I drunkenly suggested he name his kids two names that were anagrams of each other .
I then wandered off downstairs to find such suitable names .
Because I 'm supposed to be be working in Python these days , not Perl , I gathered what little Python knowledge I had and wrote out : #!/usr/bin/python by_anagram = {} names_file = open ( " dist.male.first " ) for line in names_file : # lines in file look like : # WILLIAM 2.451 14.812 5 # we want just the first field .
name = ( line.split ( ) ) [ 0 ] letters = [ letter for letter in name ] letters.sort ( ) sorted_name = " " .join ( letters ) if not sorted_name in by_anagram : by_anagram[ sorted_name ] = [ ] by_anagram[sorted_name].append( name ) for sorted_name in by_anagram : if len( by_anagram [ sorted_name ] ) < 2 : continue print by_anagram [ sorted_name ]
Not so happy with it , but it worked , and I printed out the results and brought them up to the guy : [ ' TROY ' , ' TORY ' ] [ ' CLAY ' , ' LACY ' ] [ ' JEFFREY ' , ' JEFFERY ' ] [ ' ANGEL ' , ' GALEN ' ] [ ' FOREST ' , ' FOSTER ' ] [ ' ANDRE ' , ' DAREN ' , ' ARDEN ' ] [ ' LEROY ' , ' ELROY ' ] [ ' LEONARD ' , ' RENALDO ' , ' LEANDRO ' ] [ ' ARIEL ' , ' ARLIE ' ] [ ' BRENDAN ' , ' BRANDEN ' ] [ ' WARREN ' , ' WARNER ' ] [ ' DEAN ' , ' DANE ' ] [ ' CHRISTOPER ' , ' CRISTOPHER ' ] [ ' COLE ' , ' CLEO ' ] [ ' CARLO ' , ' CAROL ' ] [ ' ELMER ' , ' MERLE ' ] [ ' REUBEN ' , ' RUEBEN ' ] [ ' JOSEPH ' , ' JOESPH ' , ' JOSPEH ' ] [ ' COREY ' , ' ROYCE ' ] [ ' JASON ' , ' JONAS ' ] [ ' RAMON ' , ' ROMAN ' ] [ ' JAMIE ' , ' JAIME ' ] [ ' CARMELO ' , ' MARCELO ' ] [ ' BYRON ' , ' BRYON ' ] [ ' LEON ' , ' NOEL ' , ' OLEN ' ] [ ' NEAL ' , ' LANE ' ] [ ' MICHAEL ' , ' MICHEAL ' , ' MICHALE ' ] [ ' KEITH ' , ' KIETH ' ] [ ' BERT ' , ' BRET ' ] [ ' BRIAN ' , ' BRAIN ' ] [ ' OLIN ' , ' LINO ' ] [ ' DION ' , ' DINO ' ] [ ' DANA ' , ' ADAN ' ] [ ' RONALD ' , ' ROLAND ' , ' ARNOLD ' ] [ ' ISRAEL ' , ' ISREAL ' ] [ ' DARNELL ' , ' RANDELL ' ] [ ' ANTOINE ' , ' ANTIONE ' ] [ ' ORLANDO ' , ' ROLANDO ' , ' ARNOLDO ' ]
Just now , I was wondering the equivalent in Perl , and wrote : #!/usr / bin/perl use strict ; open ( my $fh , " dist.male.first " ) or die ; my % by_anagram ; while ( < $ fh > ) { chomp ; s/\s.*// ; my $ name = $ _ ; my $ sorted_name = join ( '' , sort split // , $ name ) ; push @{$by_anagram { $ sorted_name}} , $ name ; } foreach my $ sn ( grep { @{$by_anagram {$_}} > 1 } keys % by_anagram ) { print " @{$by_anagram{$sn}}
" ; } In particular , I like about Python that errors - are - exceptions is the norm .
But I like that regexps are built into Perl. ( also hate Python 's general hating on functional programming , unrelated to this post ) I 'm sure my Python could be way shorter , too .
Anybody want to post either their short Python version , or their more - idiomatic Python version ?

Thomas Jefferson is reputed to have said that , “ If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money , first by inflation and then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . ”
Jefferson did not need a crystal ball to see the rise of The Federal Reserve , a private bank which controls the United States ’ Money .
Jefferson was well aware of the international banksters even in his time .
The inevitability of small groups of elite , well - heeled people to group together and prey on their fellow man is not exactly a new thing either .
Black ’s Law Dictionary [ Sixth Edition , 1991 ] defines “ fiat ” as an “ A command or order to act .
Arbitrary or authoritative order or decision . ”
“ Fiat money ” is likewise defined as , “ inconvertible paper money made legal tender by a government decree . ”
Inconvertible to , for example , gold or silver .
Made legal only by government decree .
“ Colored money ” , i.e. money with the “ deceptive appearance , assumed exterior , concealing a lack of reality . ”
Federal Reserve Notes ( FRNs ) are colored money .
They have no value , except by virtue of a government decree -- a decree arrived at under conditions of duress , and thus in all probability invalid .
Just as The Decree of Franklin Roosevelt in recalling gold from the hands of the citizenry was under the direction of the international Banksters , the use of FRN ’s is a continuation of this directive .
This in turn is linked to the US Bankruptcy , the questionable use of Executive Orders , and what has become to be a Crisis in American Government -- including Social InSecurity and the Infernal Revenue Service .
Consider , for example , the response of The Federal Reserve to questions about the validity of this state of affairs .
A little research can be very enlightening .
The following dialogue is reputed to be a conversation with a Mr. Ron Supinski of the Public Information Department of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank .
GGG " GG " GG " " GGG " " GG
CALLER - Mr. Supinski , does my country own the Federal Reserve System ?
MR. SUPINSKI - We are an agency of the government .
CALLER - That ’s not my question .
Is it owned by my country ?
MR. SUPINSKI - It is an agency of the government created by congress .
CALLER - Is the Federal Reserve a Corporation ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Yes
CALLER - Does my government own any of the stock in the Federal Reserve ?
MR. SUPINSKI - No , it is owned by the member banks .
CALLER - Are the member banks private corporations ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Yes
CALLER - Are Federal Reserve Notes backed by anything ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Yes , by the assets of the Federal Reserve but , primarily by the power of congress to lay tax on the people .
CALLER - Did you say , the power to collect taxes is what backs Federal Reserve Notes ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Yes
CALLER - What are the total assets of the Federal Reserve ?
MR. SUPINSKI - The San Francisco Bank has $ 36 Billion in assets .
CALLER -
What are these assets composed of ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Gold , the Federal Reserve Bank itself and government securities .
CALLER - What value does the Federal Reserve Bank carry gold per oz .
on their books ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I do n’t have that information , but the San Francisco Bank has $ 1.6 billion in gold .
CALLER - Are you saying the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has $ 1.6 billion in gold , the bank itself and the balance of the assets is government securities ?
MR. SUPINSKI - - Yes .
CALLER - Where does the Federal Reserve get Federal Reserve Notes from ?
MR. SUPINSKI - They are authorized by the Treasury .
CALLER - How much does the Federal Reserve pay for a $ 10 Federal Reserve Note ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Fifty to seventy cents .
CALLER - How much do they pay for a $ 100.00 Federal Reserve Note ?
MR. SUPINSKI - The same fifty to seventy cents .
CALLER -
To pay only fifty cents for a $ 100.00 is a tremendous gain , is n’t it ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Yes
CALLER - According to the US Treasury , the Federal Reserve pays $ 20.60 per 1,000 denomination or a little over two cents for a $ 100.00 bill , is that correct ?
MR. SUPINSKI - That is probably close .
CALLER - Does n’t the Federal Reserve use the Federal Reserve Notes that cost about two cents each to purchase US Bonds from the government ?
MR . SUPINSKI - Yes , but there is more to it than that .
CALLER - Basically , that is what happens ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Yes , basically you are correct .
CALLER - How many Federal Reserve Notes are in circulation ?
MR. SUPINSKI - $ 263 billion and we can only account for a small percentage .
CALLER -
Where did they go ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Peoples ’ mattress , buried in their back yards and illegal drug money .
CALLER - Since the debt is payable in Federal Reserve Notes , how can the $ 4 trillion national debt be paid - off with the total Federal Reserve Notes in circulation ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I do n’t know .
CALLER - If the Federal Government would collect every Federal Reserve Note in circulation would it be mathematically possible to pay the $ 4 trillion national debt ?
MR. SUPINSKI - No
CALLER - Am I correct when I say , $ 1 deposited in a member bank $ 8 can be lent out through Fractional Reserve Policy ?
MR.SUPINSKI - About $ 7 .
CALLER - Correct me if I am wrong but , $ 7 of additional Federal Reserve Notes were never put in circulation .
But , for lack of better words were “ created out of thin air ” in the form of credits and the two cents per denomination were not paid either .
In other words , the Federal Reserve Notes were not physically printed , but in reality were created by a journal entry and lent at interest .
Is that correct ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Yes
CALLER -
Is that the reason there are only $ 263 billion Federal Reserve Notes in circulation ?
MR. SUPINSKI - That is part of the reason .
CALLER - Am I mistaking that when the Federal Reserve Act was passed ( on Christmas Eve ) in 1913 , it transferred the power to coin and issue our nations money and to regulate the value thereof from Congress to a Private corporation .
And my country now borrows what should be our own money from the Federal Reserve ( a private corporation ) plus interest .
Is that correct and the debt can never be paid off under the current money system of country ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Basically , yes .
CALLER - I smell a rat , do you ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I am sorry , I ca n’t answer that .
I work here .
CALLER - Has the Federal Reserve ever been independently audited ?
MR. SUPINSKI - We are audited .
CALLER -
Why is there a current House Resolution 1486 calling for a complete audit of the Federal Reserve by the GAO and why is the Federal Reserve resisting ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I do n’t know .
CALLER - Does the Federal Reserve regulate the value of Federal Reserve Notes and interest rates ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Yes
CALLER - Explain how the Federal Reserve System can be Constitutional if , only the Congress of the US , which comprises of the Senate and the House of Representatives has the power to coin and issue our money supply and regulate the value thereof ?
[ Article 1 Section 1 and Section 8 ]
Nowhere , in the Constitution does it give Congress the power or authority to transfer any powers granted under the Constitution to a private corporation or , does it ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I am not an expert on constitutional law .
I can refer you to our legal department .
CALLER - I can tell you I have read the Constitution .
It does NOT provide that any power granted can be transferred to a private corporation .
Does n’t it specifically state , all other powers not granted are reserved to the States and to the citizens ?
Does that mean to a private corporation ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I do n’t think so , but we were created by Congress .
CALLER - Would you agree it is our country and it should be our money as provided by our Constitution ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I understand what you are saying .
CALLER -
Why should we borrow our own money from a private consortium of bankers ?
Is n’t this why we had a revolution , created a separate sovereign nation and a Bill of Rights ?
MR. SUPINSKI - ( Declined to answer ) .
CALLER - Has the Federal Reserve ever been declared constitutional by the Supreme Court ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I believe there has been court cases on the matter .
CALLER - Have they been Supreme Court Cases ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I think so , but I am not sure .
CALLER - Did n’t the Supreme Court declare unanimously in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. vs. US and Carter vs. Carter Coal Co. the corporative - state arrangement an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power ?
[ “ The power conferred is the power to regulate .
This is legislative delegation in its most obnoxious form ; for it is not even delegation to an official or an official body , presumptively disinterested , but to private persons . ”
Carter vs. Carter Coal Co ...]
MR. SUPINSKI - I do n’t know , I can refer you to our legal department .
CALLER -
Is n’t the current money system a house of cards that must fall because , the debt can mathematically never be paid - off ?
MR. SUPINSKI - It appears that way .
I can tell you have been looking into this matter and are very knowledgeable .
However , we do have a solution .
CALLER - What is the solution ?
MR. SUPINSKI - The Debit Card .
CALLER - Do you mean under the E.F.T. Act ( Electronic Funds Transfer ) ?
Is n’t that very frightening , when one considers the capabilities of computers ?
It would provide the government and all it ’s agencies , including the Federal Reserve such information as :
You went to the gas station @ 2:30 and bought $ 10.00 of unleaded gas @ $ 1.41 per gallon and then you went to the grocery store @ 2:58 and bought bread , lunch meat and milk for $ 12.32 and then went to the drug store @ 3:30 and bought cold medicine for $ 5.62 .
In other words , they would know where we go , when we went , how much we paid , how much the merchant paid and how much profit he made .
Under the E.F.T. they will literally know everything about us .
Is n’t that kind of scary ?
MR. SUPINSKI - Yes , it makes you wonder .
CALLER - I smell a GIANT RAT that has overthrown my constitution .
Are n’t we paying tribute in the form of income taxes to a consortium of private bankers ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I ca n’t call it tribute ; it is interest .
CALLER - Have n’t all elected officials taken an oath of office to preserve and defend the Constitution from enemies both foreign and domestic ?
Is n’t the Federal Reserve a domestic enemy ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I ca n’t say that .
CALLER - Our elected officials and members of the Federal Reserve are guilty of aiding and abetting the overthrowing of my Constitution and that is treason .
Is n’t the punishment of treason death ?
MR. SUPINSKI - I believe so .
CALLER -
Thank you for your time and information and if I may say so , I think you should take the necessary steps to protect you and your family and withdraw your money from the banks before the collapse , I am .
MR. SUPINSKI - It does n’t look good .
CALLER - May
God have mercy on the souls who are behind this unconstitutional and criminal act called the Federal Reserve .
When the ALMIGHTY MASS awakens to this giant hoax , they will not take it with a grain of salt .
It has been a pleasure talking to you and I thank you for your time .
I hope you will take my advice before it does collapse .
MR . SUPINSKI - Unfortunately , it does not look good .
CALLER - Have a good day and thanks for your time .
MR. SUPINSKI - Thanks for calling .
If the reader has any doubts to the validity of this conversation , call your nearest Federal Reserve Bank , YOU KNOW THE QUESTIONS TO ASK !
You wo n’t find them listed under the Federal Government .
They are in the white pages , along with Federal Express , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . ( FDIC ) , and any other business .
Find out for yourself if all this is true .
And then , go to your local law library and look up the case of Lewis vs. US , case # 80-5905 , 9th Circuit , June 24 , 1982 .
It reads in part : “ Examining the organization and function of the Federal Reserve Banks and applying the relevant factors , we conclude that the federal reserve are NOT federal instrumentality ’s ... but are independent and privately owned and controlled corporations ... federal reserve banks are listed neither as ‘ wholly owned ’ government corporations [ under 31 USC Section 846 ] nor as ‘ mixed ownership ’ corporations [ under 31 USC Section 856 ] ... 28 USC Sections 1346 ( b ) , 2671 .
‘ Federal agency ’ is defined as : the executive departments , the military departments , independent establishments of the United States , and corporations acting primarily as instrumentality ’s of the United States , but does not include any contractors with the United States ...
There are no sharp criteria for determining whether an entity is a
federal agency within the meaning of the Act , but the critical factor is the existence of the federal government control over the ‘ detailed physical performance ’ and ‘ day to day operations ’ of that entity .
Other factors courts have considered include whether the entity is an independent corporation ... whether the government is involved in the entity ’s finances ... and whether the mission of the entity furthers the policy of the United States ...
Examining the organization and function of the Federal Reserve Banks , and applying the relevant factors , we conclude that the Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentality ’s ... ”
It is evident from the legislative history of the Federal Reserve Act that Congress did not intend to give the federal government direction over the daily operation of the Reserve Banks ...
The fact that the Federal Reserve Board regulates the Reserve Banks does not make them federal agencies under the Act ...
Unlike typical federal agencies , each bank is empowered to hire and fire employees at will .
Bank employees do not participate in the Civil Service Retirement System .
They are covered by worker ’s compensation insurance , purchased by the Bank , rather than the Federal Employees Compensation Act .
Employees traveling on Bank business are not subject to federal travel regulations and do not receive government employee discounts on lodging and services ...
Finally , “ the Banks are empowered to sue and be sued in their own name .
12 USC Section 341 .
They carry their own liability insurance and typically process and handle their own claims ... ”
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia , “ When the Federal Reserve was created , its stock was sold to the member banks . ”
( “ The Hats The Federal Reserve Wears ” , published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia )
The original Stockholders of the Federal Reserve Banks in 1913 were the Rockefeller ’s , JP Morgan , Rothschild ’s , Lazard Freres , Schoellkopf , Kuhn - Loeb , Warburgs , Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs .
The MONEYCHANGERS wanted to be insured they had a monopoly over our money supply , so Congress passed into law Title 12 , Section 284 of the United States Code .
Section 284 specifically states , “ NO STOCK ALLOWED TO THE US . ”
* Monopoly - “ A privilege or peculiar advantage vested in one or more persons or companies , consisting in the exclusive right [ or power ) to carry on a particular business or trade , manufacture a particular article , or control the sale of the whole supply of a particular commodity , A form of market structure in which only a few firms dominate the total sales of a product or service .
‘ Monopoly ’ , as prohibited by Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act , has two elements : possession of a monopoly power in relevant market and willful acquisition or maintenance of that power , as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior power , business acumen , or historical product .
A monopoly condemned by the Sherman Act is the power to fix prices , or exclude competition , coupled with policies designed to use and preserve that power . ” ( Black 's Law Dictionary , 6th Edition ) The Federal Reserve
Act goes one step farther , “ No Senator or Representative in Congress shall be a member of the Federal Reserve Board or an officer or director of a Federal Reserve Bank . ”
They did n’t want We The People to have any say in the operation of their monopoly through our elected officials .

Recall the quote from John Mayard Keynes :
“ There is no subtler , no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency .
The process engages all the hidden forces of economic laws on the side of destruction , and does it in a manner which not one in a million is able to diagnose . ”
Keynes seems to be quite accurate in his statement .
So far , anyway .
Congressman McFadden The Federal Reserve
Forward to :
Zimbabwe 's state - run press is floating the possibility that Robert Mugabe will annul last month 's presidential election and call for a national unity government with himself as president while a new constitution is negotiated and a fresh ballot held .
The proposal , in an opinion piece in the Herald , is not a formal Zanu - PF plan .
But the newspaper is often used by the ruling party to lay the ground for policy changes .
The proposal is viewed by the opposition as another attempt by Mugabe to overturn the election results .
Yesterday , Gordon Brown repeated British accusations that Mugabe was trying to rig the elections .
The prime minister said he would propose an embargo on all arms going to Zimbabwe .
With the results of the ballot still unannounced 25 days after it was held , and a partial recount of parliamentary and presidential votes taking days , it is increasingly apparent that the Zimbabwean government is undecided on the way forward .
Zanu - PF has touted the idea of a presidential run-off with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change 's candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai .
But despite the ruling party 's campaign of violence against opposition voters , Mugabe can be far from certain of winning , particularly with growing regional scrutiny .
His government appears to be stalling while it finds a credible way to hold on to power .
In the Herald article , Obediah Mukura Mazombwe , a pro-Zanu - PF academic , wrote : " The [ ruling ] party should allow MDC - Tsvangirai , now in virtual exile , to return home and freely negotiate its participation in a [ Southern African Development Community - mediated ] process that should lead to the establishment of a transitional government of national unity led by the incumbent president . "
He also suggested fresh elections after a referendum on the constitution .
Tsvangirai said he would accept a power - sharing government if he is installed as president and Mugabe retires .

Miss Rice will meet with Gulf nations in Kuwait on Tuesday where she will push for more support for Iraq
United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has arrived in Baghdad 's Green Zone for a previously unannounced visit to Iraq .
Yesterday Shia cleric Muqtada al - Sadr threatened an " open war " against the current Iraqi government unless they stopped their operations against his Mahdi Army .
In response to this , a US - Iraqi coalition clashed with his forces in Baghdad and to the south .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki has also threatened to ban al - Sadr and his supporters from political life if they continue to use militias .
Miss Rice hopes to see more reconciliation of the various factions in Iraq .
She praised al - Maliki 's work , saying that she has seen a " coalescing of a centre in Iraqi politics " .
The primary purpose of Rice 's visit is to attend conferences in Gulf states .
She called on these states to offer diplomacy and debt relief to Iraq earlier today .
" The neighbours could do more to live up to their obligations because I do believe the Iraqis are beginning to live up to theirs , " she told reporters on her plane .
On Tuesday she is attending a meeting in Kuwait which will have representation from Iraq 's bordering nations in which she is expected to push for further aid for Iraq .

Roundup on Parallel Connections
A lot of blogging and follow - up discussion ensued with the announcement that IE8 supports six connections per host .
The blogs I saw :
It ’s likely that Firefox 3 will support 6 connections per server in an upcoming beta release , which means more discussion is expected .
I wanted to pull all the facts into one place and make several points that I think are important and interesting .
Specifically I talk about :
the HTTP / 1.1 RFC
settings for current browsers
upperbound of open connections ( cool ! )
effect of proxies
will this break the Internet ?
The HTTP / 1.1 RFC
Section 8.1.4 of the HTTP / 1.1 RFC says a “ single - user client SHOULD NOT maintain more than 2 connections with any server or proxy . ”
The key here is the word “ should . ”
Web clients do n’t have to follow this guideline .
IE8 is n’t the first to exceed this guideline .
Opera and Safari hold that honor supporting 4 connections per server .
It ’s important to understand that this is on a per server basis .
Using multiple domain names , such as 1.mydomain.com , 2.mydomain.com , 3.mydomain.com , etc. , allows a web developer to achieve a multiple of the per server connection limit .
This works even if all the domain names are CNAMEs to the same IP address .
Settings for Current Browsers
The table below shows the number of connections per server supported by current browsers for HTTP / 1.1 as well as HTTP / 1.0 .
Browser HTTP /1.1 HTTP/1.0 IE 6,7 2 4 IE 8 6 6 Firefox 2 2 8 Firefox 3 6 6 Safari 3,4 4 4 Chrome 1,2 6 ? Chrome 3 4 4 Chrome 4 + 6 ? i Phone 2 4 ? i Phone 3 6 ? i Phone 4 4 ? Opera 9.63,10.00 alpha 4 4 Opera 10.51 + 8 ?
I provide ( some of ) the settings for HTTP / 1.0 in the table above because some of the blog discussions have confused the connections per server settings for HTTP / 1.0 with those for HTTP / 1.1 .
HTTP / 1.0 does not have persistant connections so a higher number of connections per server is supported to achieve faster performance .
For example , IE7 supports 4 connections per server in HTTP / 1.0 .
In fact , AOL intentionally downgrades their responses to HTTP / 1.0 to benefit from this increase in parallelization , although they do it at the cost of losing the benefits of persistent connections .
They must have data that supports this decision , but I do n’t recommend it .
It ’s possible to reconfigure your browser to use different limits .
How to configure Internet Explorer to have more than two download sessions describes how the MaxConnectionsPerServer and MaxConnections Per1_0
Server settings in the Windows Registry control the number of connections per hostname for HTTP / 1.1 and HTTP / 1.0 , respectively .
In Firefox these values are controlled by the network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server and network.http.max -connections-per-server settings in about : config .
Note that IE8 automatically drops back to 2 connections per server for users on dialup connections .
Also , web developers can detect the number of connections per server currently in effect by accessing window.maxConnectionsPerServer and window.maxConnectionsPer1_0
Server in JavaScript .
These are read - only values .
Upperbound of Open Connections
What ’s the maximum number of connections a browser will open ?
This is relevant as server adminstrators prepare for spikes from browsers with increased parallelization .
This Max Connections test page contains 180 images split across 30 hostnames .
That works out to 6 images per hostname .
To determine the upperbound of open connections a browser supports I loaded this page and counted the number of simultaneous requests in a packet sniffer .
Firefox 1.5 and 2.0 open a maximum of 24 connections ( 2 connections per hostname across 12 hostnames ) .
This limit is imposed by Firefox ’s network .
http.max - connections setting which defaults to a value of 24 .
In IE 6,7&8 I was n’t able to determine the upperbound .
At 2 connections per server , IE 6&7 opened 60 connections in parallel .
At 6 connections per server , IE8 opened 180 connections in parallel .
I ’d have to create more domain names than the 30 I already have to try and find where IE maxes out .
( If you load this in other browsers please post your results in a comment below and I ’ll update this text . )
Effect of Proxies
Note that if you ’re behind a proxy ( at work , etc. ) your download characteristics change .
If web clients behind a proxy issued too many simulataneous requests an intelligent web server might interpret that as a DoS attack and block that IP address .
Browser developers are aware of this issue and throttle back the number of open connections .
In Firefox the network.http.max - persistent-connections-per-proxy setting has a default value of 4 .
If you try the Max Connections test page while behind a proxy it loads painfully slowly opening no more than 4 connections at a time to download 180 images .
IE8 drops back to 2 connections per server when it ’s behind a proxy , so loading the Max Connections test page shows an upperbound of 60 open connections .
Keep this in mind if you ’re comparing notes with others – if you ’re at home and they ’re at work you might be seeing different behavior because of a proxy in the middle .
Will This Break the Internet ?
Much of the debate in the blog comments has been about how IE8 ’s increase in the number of connections per server might bring those web servers to their knees .
I found the most insightful comments in Mozilla ’s Bugzilla discussion about increasing Firefox ’s number of connections .
In comment # 22 Boris Zbarsky lays out a good argument for why this increase will have no effect on most servers .
But in comment # 23 Mike Hommey points out that persistent connections are kept open for longer than the life of the page request .
This last point scares me .
As someone who has spent many hours configuring Apache to find the right number of child processes across banks of servers , I ’m not sure what impact this will have .
Having said that , I ’m please that IE8 has taken this step and I ’d be even happier if Firefox followed suit .
This change in the client will improve page load times from the user ’s perspective .
It does put the onus on backend developers to watch closely as IE8 adoption grows to see if it affects their capacity planning .
But I ’ve always believed that part of the responsibility and joy of being a developer is doing extra work on my side that can improve the experience for thousands or millions of users .
This is another opportunity to do just that .
To upper middle - class white suburbanites , few things are more terrifying than a roving gang of hooligans , with the notable exceptions of poor fuel economy and the maid stealing decorative soaps .
But even those people would be hard pressed to find too many reasons to fear the following gangs , most of whom would probably be mistaken for dance troupes and second - rate children 's entertainers in real life .

The entire Batman franchise is responsible for some seriously awful gang activity .
None so heinously combined our fear of gang violence with our terror of carneys as the Red Triangle Circus Gang as portrayed in the second Batman film .

So with clown makeup , fire eaters and a tiny poodle that catches Batarangs , they left their big - top roots behind and went to work trying to fulfill their vision of whatever the fuck it is a group of malevolent circus freaks thought they 'd accomplish by making their dumpy leader mayor of Gotham .

It ’s all very depressing , and there ’s a tendency to blame it all on people like Wolfowitz and Perle .
But we ca n’t blame them alone .
Ironically enough , blaming these individuals only makes it easier for the future Wolfowitzes of the world to start new wars .
To see where the rotten apples came from , you have to turn back to the tree .
All of these intellectual currents combined in spectacularly disastrous fashion in Iraq , with certainty being their theoretical foundation .
The certainty of our own good allowed us to ignore obstacles to our desires ( both laws and IAEA reports ) .
Similarly , the certainty of the “ Other ’s ” evilness allowed us to rationalize overthrowing a secular Arab nationalist regime in the name of fighting transnational radical fundamentalists who viewed them as infidels .
But back to the lecture at hand , the neoconservative certainty had a number of practical implications in both the Cold War and beyond .
Pre -1989 , excessive certainty about the evils of communism provided the foundation of the opposition to Kissinger ’s détente ( which also provided the impetus for Reagan ’s challenge to Ford and his ultimate ascension ) .
Post - Cold War , the same excessive certainty led to the Wolfowitz / Libby worldview that American foreign policy should consciously attempt to maintain a global monopoly on power .
Even back in 1992 , obstacles such as the UN were being theoretically jettisoned for ad hoc coalitions that some would later call “ willing . ”
The Straussian legacy that matters , then , is his absolute certainty in “ our ” own goodness and in the “ Other ’s ” evilness .
That ’s the true theoretical underpinning of neoconservatism -- everything they espouse follows if you are certain that you are good and certain that you are fighting evil .
If arms control treaties or the UN or torture statutes prohibit fighting evil , then they must be put aside .
It ’s as un-Burkean as you can get .
As Andrew Sullivan has explained at length , doubt is a far better foundation for conservatives .
[ UPDATE : One point I should have stressed better is that the most practical harm of neoconservatism is its extreme over - reliance on military force to solve problems and to pursue goals .
This militancy , in turn , is made possible by underlying certainty of one 's correctness . ]
To back up , Mann does a good job laying out the basic intellectual foundations of neoconservatism , including its Straussian influences .
Personally , I think the whole “ Straussian noble lie ” is a conspiracy theory too far .
The real influence of Strauss upon modern politics was his Manichean worldview of absolute good and absolute evil .
Evil ( or tyranny ) existed , Strauss believed , and strong action was necessary to confront it .
Rather inexplicably , I ’m only now reading James Mann ’s Rise of the Vulcans : The History of Bush ’s War Cabinet ( it ’s good ) .
If anything , though , Mann ’s book has made me somewhat less angry at the individual neoconservatives responsible for our disastrous Iraq policy .
My net levels of anger have n’t changed -- it ’s just that I ’ve reallocated some of that anger from these individuals to the American public .
Specifically , I ’ve realized that neoconservatism is not so much a cause , but a manifestation of larger political movements .
Wolfowitz did not lead a Lenin - esque vanguard -- he was himself created by underlying structural forces .
Thus , blaming the individual neoconservatives lets the American public ( and American nationalists in particular ) escape their own culpability .
And indeed , the rot runs much deeper -- the overly nationalist American public is to blame for the rise of neoconservatism .
These men were not merely agents of change , they were themselves caused -- they were superstructure upon larger underlying movements and resentments that gained strength in the venomous aftermath of Vietnam .
That ’s one point I ’ve taken from Mann .
For instance , take détente .
Many of the neoconservatives cut their political teeth opposing détente .
Wolfowitz and Perle in particular got started opposing ( in distinctive ways ) Nixon ’s arms control efforts .
But the nationalist resentment toward détente pre-existed them both .
Nixon and Kissinger faced increasing pressure from the right as the 70s progressed , and that pressure ultimately resulted in Ronald Reagan .
Indeed , Reagan himself was “ structural ” in this sense -- he too was a product of the certainties of our own goodness , and of the evil of our enemies .
We needed that affirmation following Vietnam and Carter .
But that comforting vision blinded us to some very un-American activities .
For instance , why let things like statutory bans on funding “ freedom fighters ” stand in the way when evil was advancing in Latin America ?
Why seek peace with evil ?
Neoconservatives , then , rose to power not so much because of their individual treachery , but because their worldview reflected much of the American public ’s foreign policy worldview .
Embittered and embarrassed by Vietnam , many Americans escaped reality by embracing a conception of America as the unambiguous Platonic ideal of good .
These conceptions are only possible with an Other , so communism became -- or perhaps remained -- pure evil .
( I ’m certainly not defending communism -- it was a wretched system .
The problem is the Manichean conceptions , which led -- and continue to lead -- to extreme actions . )
The larger point for today ’s purposes is that the worldview underlying neoconservatism -- excessive certainty of good and evil -- is shared by too many Americans even today .
Indeed , we saw it in full display in the run-up to , and aftermath of , Iraq .
We had to go to war because Saddam was evil .
The war was good because we are good and you ’re blaspheming the troops .
The names had changed , but the song otherwise remained the same .
Looking ahead , real progress requires us to shed the kindergarten view of both ourselves and our adversaries .
What seems at first glance to be steely - spined moral clarity is actually a failure to engage with the grey complexities of the real world .
We are good , but not perfect .
Those who oppose America are not always good , but neither are they fantasy embodiments of pure evil ( with certain exceptions ) .
That ’s not to say we ca n’t be proud of America -- there is much to be proud of .
It ’s just that overly simplistic abstract views are leading to horrible practical consequences .
If we do n’t change this underlying view , nothing will change even if the Democrats win the White House .
People like Wolfowitz may come and go , but the worldview that created him will linger on .
For that reason , we ’ll keep repeating history until that worldview -- that excessive certainty -- is confronted .
In particular , I fear the political aftermath of our eventual withdrawal from Iraq .
Like Vietnam , it will trigger poisonous resentment among nationalists .
The temptation will be to hide from -- rather than confront -- the cognitive dissonance by doubling down on a fantasy version of America .
We may well see the rise of a new nationalism movement fueled by Iraq resentment , and a particularly nasty one at that .
This is all a long way of saying that it ’s not enough for the public to oppose the Iraq War .
The real goal is to change the mindset that led to the Iraq War .
There are hundreds of aspiring young Wolfowitzes toiling away in the Bush executive branch as we speak , gaining valuable resume lines .
The only way to make sure they do n’t ascend to power is to make their preferred policies politically unviable , regardless of what party controls the government .
Almost half a century after he fled to India , the Dalai Lama has raised the extraordinary prospect of travelling to Beijing and holding face - to - talks with the Chinese regime in an effort to resolve Tibet 's most serious crisis for two decades .
Having watched helplessly from exile as his Tibetan homeland has suffered under Chinese rule , the man regarded as a living god by millions of his followers said yesterday that he was ready to negotiate personally with the Chinese leadership .
The Dalai Lama , 73 , acknowledged the difficulty associated with a face - to - face summit , but said he was even ready to meet President Hu Jintao , notorious in Tibet for his hardline approach when he served as Tibet 's local Communist leader .
" I am always ready to meet the Chinese leaders , and particularly Hu Jintao .
I am very happy to meet , " he told a small group of journalists at his office in Dharamsala .
" But as I mentioned earlier , to go to Beijing and meet leaders ... that would be big news .
Many Tibetans would think ... may develop some unrealistic expectations .
I have to think very carefully . "
While a visit to Beijing would leave him open to criticism of appeasing the Chinese , the undertaking the Dalai Lama gave yesterday underlines his desperate wish to avoid further bloodshed in the country of his birth .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Seeking to put pressure on China , he said he was willing to travel to Beijing in a matter of weeks if there was a " concrete indication " that the Chinese authorities were prepared to negotiate and if the protests in Tibet had concluded .
His spokesman later confirmed that while he did not wish to simply provide the Chinese with a photo - opportunity that could be used against him , he was ready to discuss a " mutually agreeable solution " to the issue of Tibet .
The remarkable prospect of a summit between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese leadership – either in Beijing or elsewhere – came as China said police had opened fire and wounded four Tibetan protesters in Sichuan province and arrested dozens of others who had ignored a deadline to end the most serious demonstrations to rock Tibet for more than two decades .
Earlier this week , the Chinese leadership indicated it would be prepared to talk to the Dalai Lama if he stopped " separatist activities " and recognised Tibet and Taiwan as parts of China .
Gordon Brown told the Commons on Wednesday that the Chinese Premier , Wen Jiabao , had told him he was ready to meet the Dalai Lama if he renounced violence .
But assessing the genuine intentions of the Chinese leadership remains at best a guessing game .
Beijing is concerned about sullying its reputation ahead of the upcoming Olympic Games , but while giving an undertaking to meet the Dalai Lama , various Chinese officials have continued to demonise him and accuse him and his " clique " of orchestrating the demonstrations in Tibet .
" For the Dalai Lama , we not only listen to what he says , but more importantly , we focus on what he does , " said the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman , Qin Gang .
" He has said he is not a separatist .
But all of his propositions and actions prove that he has never stopped his splittist words and deeds . "
The Dalai Lama knows his only real leverage as head of a Tibetan government in exile is in winning over international opinion to his cause .
Today he is due to meet Nancy Pelosi , Speaker of the US House of Representatives , while tomorrow he is scheduled to have lunch with the actor Richard Gere in Delhi .
Both have supported him for many years .
Winning the backing of camera - friendly celebrities and power - wielding politicians has long been the strength of the smiling and avuncular 1989 Nobel laureate .
Laughing , joking and yet utterly serious all in the space of a sentence , this is a role he continues to play to perfection as the cause to which he has devoted his life receives unprecedented world attention .
Never more than now has he needed to stress the importance of non-violent protest and the limited nature of the movement 's demands .
" The Chinese constitution already mentions autonomy [ for Tibet ] .
So that should not be just a word on paper but implemented on the spot , " he said , sitting in front of a statue of the Buddha .
" The whole world knows Dalai Lama is not seeking independence , one hundred times , a thousand times I have repeated this .
It is my mantra – we are not seeking independence . "

In Beijing , the authorities admitted for the first time that the often violent protests that swept through Lhasa 10 days ago in protest against Chinese rule had spread to other Tibetan communities in additional provinces .
Subsequently , the government has dispatched more troops and paramilitaries across the region as it seeks to reassert its control in those areas .
It has banned the media and foreign tourists from travelling to the region .
Precisely how many people have been killed or injured as a result of the protests and the subsequent crackdown is unclear .
The Chinese government says 16 people have died while the Tibetan exiles say the number stands at 80 .
On walls and buildings throughout Dharamsala , exiles have posted graphic and disturbing photographs of Tibetans apparently killed by Chinese police or soldiers .
" It 's horrible .
There are many bodies .
The Chinese are holding the bodies , " claimed Tenzin Thangh , who was participating in a candlelit vigil through the main street of the town – a procession that has become a nightly occurrence .
" The soldiers are going into all parts of Tibet . "
From Dharamsala , a former British hill station established on the peaceful fringe of the Himalayas , Chinese accusations regarding the Dalai Lama 's ability to direct events in Tibet and the description of him as " a devil with a human face but the heart of a beast " , appear little short of preposterous .
Indeed , his cautious " middle way " approach has been criticised by some Tibetans , including the Tibetan Youth Congress which seeks full independence from China .
While many younger Tibetans have been outspoken in their criticism of the Dalai Lama 's tactics , in recent days they have halted such comments in an apparent effort not to appear divided at a crucial juncture .
What certainly does not seem in doubt is the reverence with which he is held as the community 's religious leader .
Before meeting reporters yesterday , the Dalai Lama spent time in the flower - filled gardens of the compound receiving and blessing various visitors , including a family who had travelled secretly from Shanghai .
Asked later how he felt about the personal insults that Chinese officials had directed towards him , he said such comments mattered little to him .
He also said he did not believe that the international community was taken in by what the Chinese said .
" As a Buddhist monk , it does not matter what they call me , " he said with a chuckle .
" The outside world does n't believe that I am [ a ] devil . "

The connection between music and mathematics has fascinated scholars for centuries .
More than 2000 years ago Pythagoras reportedly discovered that pleasing musical intervals could be described using simple ratios .
And the so - called musica universalis or " music of the spheres " emerged in the Middle Ages as the philosophical idea that the proportions in the movements of the celestial bodies -- the sun , moon and planets -- could be viewed as a form of music , inaudible but perfectly harmonious .
Now , three music professors -- Clifton Callender at Florida State University , Ian Quinn at Yale University and Dmitri Tymoczko at Princeton University -- have devised a new way of analyzing and categorizing music that takes advantage of the deep , complex mathematics they see enmeshed in its very fabric .
Writing in the April 18 issue of Science , the trio has outlined a method called " geometrical music theory " that translates the language of musical theory into that of contemporary geometry .
They take sequences of notes , like chords , rhythms and scales , and categorize them so they can be grouped into " families . "
They have found a way to assign mathematical structure to these families , so they can then be represented by points in complex geometrical spaces , much the way " x " and " y " coordinates , in the simpler system of high school algebra , correspond to points on a two - dimensional plane .
Different types of categorization produce different geometrical spaces , and reflect the different ways in which musicians over the centuries have understood music .
This achievement , they expect , will allow researchers to analyze and understand music in much deeper and more satisfying ways .
The work represents a significant departure from other attempts to quantify music , according to Rachel Wells Hall of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at St. Joseph 's University in Philadelphia .
In an accompanying essay , she writes that their effort , " stands out both for the breadth of its musical implications and the depth of its mathematical content . "
The method , according to its authors , allows them to analyze and compare many kinds of Western ( and perhaps some non-Western ) music .
( The method focuses on Western - style music because concepts like " chord " are not universal in all styles . )
It also incorporates many past schemes by music theorists to render music into mathematical form .

" The music of the spheres is n't really a metaphor -- some musical spaces really are spheres , " said Tymoczko , an assistant professor of music at Princeton .
" The whole point of making these geometric spaces is that , at the end of the day , it helps you understand music better .
Having a powerful set of tools for conceptualizing music allows you to do all sorts of things you had n't done before . "
Like what ?
" You could create new kinds of musical instruments or new kinds of toys , " he said .
" You could create new kinds of visualization tools -- imagine going to a classical music concert where the music was being translated visually .
We could change the way we educate musicians .
There are lots of practical consequences that could follow from these ideas . "
" But to me , " Tymoczko added , " the most satisfying aspect of this research is that we can now see that there is a logical structure linking many , many different musical concepts .
To some extent , we can represent the history of music as a long process of exploring different symmetries and different geometries . "
Understanding music , the authors write , is a process of discarding information .
For instance , suppose a musician plays middle " C " on a piano , followed by the note " E " above that and the note " G " above that .
Musicians have many different terms to describe this sequence of events , such as " an ascending C major arpeggio , " " a C major chord , " or " a major chord . "
The authors provide a unified mathematical framework for relating these different descriptions of the same musical event .

The trio describes five different ways of categorizing collections of notes that are similar , but not identical .
They refer to these musical resemblances as the " OPTIC symmetries , " with each letter of the word " OPTIC " representing a different way of ignoring musical information -- for instance , what octave the notes are in , their order , or how many times each note is repeated .
The authors show that five symmetries can be combined with each other to produce a cornucopia of different musical concepts , some of which are familiar and some of which are novel .
In this way , the musicians are able to reduce musical works to their mathematical essence .
Once notes are translated into numbers and then translated again into the language of geometry the result is a rich menagerie of geometrical spaces , each inhabited by a different species of geometrical object .
After all the mathematics is done , three - note chords end up on a triangular donut while chord types perch on the surface of a cone .
The broad effort follows upon earlier work by Tymoczko in which he developed geometric models for selected musical objects .
The method could help answer whether there are new scales and chords that exist but have yet to be discovered .
" Have Western composers already discovered the essential and most important musical objects ? " Tymoczko asked .
" If so , then Western music is more than just an arbitrary set of conventions .
It may be that the basic objects of Western music are fantastically special , in which case it would be quite difficult to find alternatives to broadly traditional methods of musical organization . "
The tools for analysis also offer the exciting possibility of investigating the differences between musical styles .
" Our methods are not so great at distinguishing Aerosmith from the Rolling Stones , " Tymoczko said .
" But they might allow you to visualize some of the differences between John Lennon and Paul McCartney .
And they certainly help you understand more deeply how classical music relates to rock or is different from atonal music . "
RIYADH ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia defended on Tuesday a court ’s decision to sentence a woman who was gang - raped to 200 lashes of the whip , after the United States described the verdict as “ astonishing ” .
The 19 - year - old Shi’ite woman from the town of Qatif in the Eastern Province and an unrelated male companion were abducted and raped by seven men in 2006 .
Ruling according to Saudi Arabia ’s strict reading of Islamic law , a court had originally sentenced the woman to 90 lashes and the rapists to jail terms of between 10 months and five years .
It blamed the woman for being alone with an unrelated man .
Last week the Supreme Judicial Council increased the sentence to 200 lashes and six months in prison and ordered the rapists to serve between two and nine years in jail .
The ruling provoked rare criticism from the United States , which is trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to attend a Middle East peace conference in Annapolis , Maryland next week .
A State Department spokesman told reporters on Monday that “ most ( people ) would find this relatively astonishing that something like this happens ” .
The court also took the unusual step of initiating disciplinary procedures against her lawyer , Abdul - Rahman al - Lahem , forcibly removing him from the case for having talked about it to the media .
“ The Ministry of Justice welcomes constructive criticism ...
The system allows appeals without resort to the media , ” said Tuesday ’s statement issued on the official news agency SPA .
It berated media for not specifying that three judges , not one , issued the recent ruling and reiterated that the “ charges were proven ” against the woman .
It also repeated the judges ’ attack against Lahem last week , saying he had “ spoken insolently about the judicial system and challenged laws and regulations ” .
Lahem was not available for comment .
New York - based Human Rights
Watch has called on King Abdullah , who last month announced plans to overhaul the system , to drop all charges against the woman .
A series of erratic verdicts have focused attention on the Saudi legal system , which is dominated by clerics who adhere to the kingdom ’s austere Sunni form of Islamic law .
Personal status law remains uncodified and the system does not recognize the concept of precedent .

A Costly Addiction
The damage that the human body can survive these days is as awesome as it is horrible : crushing , burning , bombing , a burst blood vessel in the brain , a ruptured colon , a massive heart attack , rampaging infection .
These conditions had once been uniformly fatal .
Now survival is commonplace , and a large part of the credit goes to the irreplaceable component of medicine known as intensive care .
If a new drug were as effective at saving lives as Peter Pronovost ’s checklist , there would be a nationwide marketing campaign urging doctors to use it .
Illustration by Yan Nascimbene
It ’s an opaque term .
Specialists in the field prefer to call what they do “ critical care , ” but that does n’t exactly clarify matters .
The non-medical term “ life support ” gets us closer .
Intensive - care units take artificial control of failing bodies .
Typically , this involves a panoply of technology — a mechanical ventilator and perhaps a tracheostomy tube if the lungs have failed , an aortic balloon pump if the heart has given out , a dialysis machine if the kidneys do n’t work .
When you are unconscious and can’t eat , silicone tubing can be surgically inserted into the stomach or intestines for formula feeding .
If the intestines are too damaged , solutions of amino acids , fatty acids , and glucose can be infused directly into the bloodstream .
The difficulties of life support are considerable .
Reviving a drowning victim , for example , is rarely as easy as it looks on television , where a few chest compressions and some mouth - to - mouth resuscitation always seem to bring someone with waterlogged lungs and a stilled heart coughing and sputtering back to life .
Consider a case report in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery of a three - year - old girl who fell into an icy fishpond in a small Austrian town in the Alps .
She was lost beneath the surface for thirty minutes before her parents found her on the pond bottom and pulled her up .
Following instructions from an emergency physician on the phone , they began cardiopulmonary resuscitation .
A rescue team arrived eight minutes later .
The girl had a body temperature of sixty - six degrees , and no pulse .
Her pupils were dilated and did not react to light , indicating that her brain was no longer working .
But the emergency technicians continued CPR anyway .
A helicopter took her to a nearby hospital , where she was wheeled directly to an operating room .
A surgical team put her on a heart - lung bypass machine .
Between the transport time and the time it took to plug the inflow and outflow lines into the femoral vessels of her right leg , she had been lifeless for an hour and a half .
By the two - hour mark , however , her body temperature had risen almost ten degrees , and her heart began to beat .
It was her first organ to come back .
After six hours , her core temperature reached 98.6 degrees .
The team tried to put her on a breathing machine , but the pond water had damaged her lungs too severely for oxygen to reach her blood .
So they switched her to an artificial - lung system known as ECMO — extracorporeal membrane oxygenation .
The surgeons opened her chest down the middle with a power saw and sewed lines to and from the ECMO unit into her aorta and her beating heart .
The team moved the girl into intensive care , with her chest still open and covered with plastic foil .
A day later , her lungs had recovered sufficiently for the team to switch her from ECMO to a mechanical ventilator and close her chest .
Over the next two days , all her organs recovered except her brain .
A CT scan showed global brain swelling , which is a sign of diffuse damage , but no actual dead zones .
So the team drilled a hole into the girl ’s skull , threaded in a probe to monitor her cerebral pressure , and kept that pressure tightly controlled by constantly adjusting her fluids and medications .
For more than a week , she lay comatose .
Then , slowly , she came back to life .
First , her pupils started to react to light .
Next , she began to breathe on her own .
And , one day , she simply awoke .
Two weeks after her accident , she went home .
Her right leg and left arm were partially paralyzed .
Her speech was thick and slurry .
But by age five , after extensive outpatient therapy , she had recovered her faculties completely .
She was like any little girl again .
What makes her recovery astounding is n’t just the idea that someone could come back from two hours in a state that would once have been considered death .
It ’s also the idea that a group of people in an ordinary hospital could do something so enormously complex .
To save this one child , scores of people had to carry out thousands of steps correctly : placing the heart - pump tubing into her without letting in air bubbles ; maintaining the sterility of her lines , her open chest , the burr hole in her skull ; keeping a temperamental battery of machines up and running .
The degree of difficulty in any one of these steps is substantial .
Then you must add the difficulties of orchestrating them in the right sequence , with nothing dropped , leaving some room for improvisation , but not too much .
For every drowned and pulseless child rescued by intensive care , there are many more who do n’t make it — and not just because their bodies are too far gone .
Machines break down ; a team ca n’t get moving fast enough ; a simple step is forgotten .
Such cases do n’t get written up in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery , but they are the norm .
Intensive - care medicine has become the art of managing extreme complexity — and a test of whether such complexity can , in fact , be humanly mastered .
On any given day in the United States , some ninety thousand people are in intensive care .
Over a year , an estimated five million Americans will be , and over a normal lifetime nearly all of us will come to know the glassed bay of an I.C.U. from the inside .
Wide swaths of medicine now depend on the lifesupport systems that I.C.U.s provide : care for premature infants ; victims of trauma , strokes , and heart attacks ; patients who have had surgery on their brain , heart , lungs , or major blood vessels .
Critical care has become an increasingly large portion of what hospitals do .
Fifty years ago , I.C.U.s barely existed .
Today , in my hospital , a hundred and fifty - five of our almost seven hundred patients are , as I write this , in intensive care .
The average stay of an I.C.U. patient is four days , and the survival rate is eighty - six per cent .
Going into an I.C.U. , being put on a mechanical ventilator , having tubes and wires run into and out of you , is not a sentence of death .
But the days will be the most precarious of your life .
A decade ago , Israeli scientists published a study in which engineers observed patient care in I.C.U.s for twenty - four - hour stretches .
They found that the average patient required a hundred and seventy - eight individual actions per day , ranging from administering a drug to suctioning the lungs , and every one of them posed risks .
Remarkably , the nurses and doctors were observed to make an error in just one per cent of these actions — but that still amounted to an average of two errors a day with every patient .
Intensive care succeeds only when we hold the odds of doing harm low enough for the odds of doing good to prevail .
This is hard .
There are dangers simply in lying unconscious in bed for a few days .
Muscles atrophy .
Bones lose mass .
Pressure ulcers form .
Veins begin to clot off .
You have to stretch and exercise patients ’ flaccid limbs daily to avoid contractures , give subcutaneous injections of blood thinners at least twice a day , turn patients in bed every few hours , bathe them and change their sheets without knocking out a tube or a line , brush their teeth twice a day to avoid pneumonia from bacterial buildup in their mouths .
Add a ventilator , dialysis , and open wounds to care for , and the difficulties only accumulate .
The story of one of my patients makes the point .
Anthony DeFilippo was a forty - eight - year - old limousine driver from Everett , Massachusetts , who started to hemorrhage at a community hospital during surgery for a hernia and gallstones .
The bleeding was finally stopped but his liver was severely damaged , and over the next few days he became too sick for the hospital ’s facilities .
When he arrived in our I.C.U. , at 1:30 A.M. on a Sunday , his ragged black hair was plastered to his sweaty forehead , his body was shaking , and his heart was racing at a hundred and fourteen beats a minute .
He was delirious from fever , shock , and low oxygen levels .
“ I need to get out ! ” he cried .
“ I need to get out ! ”
He clawed at his gown , his oxygen mask , the dressings covering his abdominal wound .
“ Tony , it ’s all right , ” a nurse said to him .
“ We ’re going to help you .
You ’re in a hospital . ”
He shoved her — he was a big man — and tried to swing his legs out of the bed .
We turned up his oxygen flow , put his wrists in cloth restraints , and tried to reason with him .
He eventually let us draw blood from him and give him antibiotics .
The laboratory results came back showing liver failure , and a wildly elevated white - blood - cell count indicating infection .
It soon became evident from his empty urine bag that his kidneys had failed , too .
In the next few hours , his blood pressure fell , his breathing worsened , and he drifted from agitation to near - unconsciousness .
Each of his organ systems , including his brain , was shutting down .
I called his sister , who was his next of kin , and told her of the situation .
“ Do everything you can , ” she said .
So we did .
We gave him a syringeful of anesthetic , and a resident slid a breathing tube into his throat .
Another resident “ lined him up . ”
She inserted a thin , two - inch - long needle and catheter through his upturned right wrist and into his radial artery , and then sewed the line to his skin with a silk suture .
Next , she put in a central line — a twelve - inch catheter pushed into the jugular vein in his left neck .
After she sewed that in place , and an X - ray showed its tip floating just where it was supposed to — inside his vena cava at the entrance to his heart — she put a third , slightly thicker line , for dialysis , through his right upper chest and into the subclavian vein , deep under the collarbone .
We hooked a breathing tube up to a hose from a ventilator and set it to give him fourteen forced breaths of a hundred - per - cent oxygen every minute .
We dialled the ventilator pressures and gas flow up and down , like engineers at a control panel , until we got the blood levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide where we wanted them .
The arterial line gave us continuous arterial blood - pressure measurements , and we tweaked his medications to get the pressures we liked .
We regulated his intravenous fluids according to venous - pressure measurements from his jugular line .
We plugged his subclavian line into tubing from a dialysis machine , and every few minutes his entire blood volume washed through this artificial kidney and back into his body ; a little adjustment here and there , and we could alter the levels of potassium and bicarbonate and salt in his body as well .
He was , we liked to imagine , a simple machine in our hands .

In case you 've been canoodling with your supermodel and not reading this blog , you may not know that the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is due to go online .
(1) Or is it ?
No one can really be certain .
After 14 years and billions of dollars , it 's had a number of delays but they have intended to make up for lost time by just eliminating minor steps , like a low energy run .
( 2) “ We ’ll be starting up for physics in May 2008 , as always foreseen , and will commission the machine to full energy in one go , ” said LHC Project Leader Lyn Evans .
Oh my .
But before you get concerned , let 's keep in mind that science is often done without being absolutely certain about every little detail .
As train engines were being developed , they tested them using dogs because they were not certain how humans would respond to high speeds , 30 plus miles per hour .
In hindsight that seems quaint but it was scientifically prudent .
You can think of the LHC experiments like the early days of trains , except if something goes wrong you , your loved ones and the entire galaxy could be sucked into some alternate universe and be ruled by our new Strangelet Overlords .
European scientists do n't worry about that because they did numerical studies and stuff so they want to just get it cold and smack together protons with gazillions of electron volts .
Not so fast , say Walter L. Wagner and Luis Sancho ( 3 ) .
They filed suit in federal court in Hawaii to halt use of the LHC until environmental ' assessments ' can be done .
What ?
I live in California and I can't even put in a pool without an environmental impact report , permits and weeks of paperwork and Europeans can just build a particle accelerater and duplicate the energy from fractions of a second after the Big Bang ?
I want to move there .
It 's a Libertarian wonderland .
Okay , it is n't .
They actually have done studies and concede , because they are scientists and understand how big ' infinity ' really is , that it is statistically possible for things to go wrong in a quantum universe , just darn unlikely .
If you are n't aware , the LHC is basically a time machine .
Not the kind of time machine that will allow you to visit Raquel Welch on the set of One Million Years BC , but rather the kind of time machine that will allow us to examine the conditions right after the Big Bang .
It 's cosmic ray stuff , the kind of thing that happens every day , except , like I said , this will be protons with gazillions of electron volts smacking into each other in a confined space .
Thus the huge black hole devouring the planet or opening a portal to another universe and letting alien invaders in that Wagner and Sancho are worried about .
Wagner has filed this kind of suit before , against Brookhaven National Lab .
He is , not surprisingly , a Berkeley graduate .
Filing these suits before and being wrong is not an indication that he 's wrong this time .
Heck , we even let Ralph Nader run for president and he only has about a .01 % rate of actually being right .
Are they right ?
Should you be worried ?
Well , it 's a lot of strange energy and effects to sift through , and understanding the beginning of the universe is why the thing was built .
In an infinite universe almost anything can happen , like black holes in small spaces , the Cubs winning a World Series this year or the nations of Europe that back CERN actually showing up in a district court in Hawaii to defend against this lawsuit .
In other words , I would n't worry too much .

Apple has confirmed a security glitch that , in many situations , will let someone with physical access to a Macintosh computer gain access to the password of the active user account .
The vulnerability arises out of a programming error that stores the account password in the computer 's memory long after it 's needed , meaning it can be retrieved and used to log into the computer and impersonate the user .
" This is a real problem and it needs to be fixed , " said Jacob Appelbaum , a San Francisco - area programmer who discovered the vulnerability and reported it to Apple .
He said he disagreed with the company 's response : " They wo n't put it in the latest security update or release a security update just for this issue . "
Appelbaum is one of the team of researchers who published a " cold boot " paper last week describing unrelated vulnerabilities in encrypted filesystems , including Apple 's FileVault , Windows Vista 's BitLocker , and a number of open - source ones .
Under the drawdown already planned , the departure of five combat brigades from Iraq by July should allow the Army to announce that tours will be shortened to 12 months from 15 by the end of summer .

Even so , senior officers warn that time at home must be increased from the current 12 months between combat tours .
Otherwise , they say , the ground forces risk an unacceptable level of retirements of sergeants  the key leaders of the small - unit operations  and of experienced captains , who represent the future of the Army ’s officer corps .
The mental health study conducted by the Army was carried out in Iraq last October and November , and does not represent a purely scientific sampling of deployed troops , because that is difficult to accomplish in a combat environment , the authors of the study have said .
Instead , the study was based on 2,295 anonymous surveys and additional interviews from members of frontline units in combat brigades , and not from those assigned primarily to safer operating bases .
Since the study was distributed last month , it has become a central topic of high - level internal discussions within the Army , and its findings have been accepted by Army leaders , senior Pentagon and military officials say .
The survey found that the proportion of soldiers serving in Iraq who had encountered mental health problems was about the same as found in previous studies  about 18 percent of deployed soldiers .
But in analyzing the effect of the war on those with previous duty in Iraq , the study found that “ soldiers on multiple deployments report low morale , more mental health problems and more stress - related work problems . ”
By the time they are on their third or fourth deployments , soldiers “ are at particular risk of reporting mental health problems , ” the study found .
The range of symptoms reported by soldiers varies widely , from sleeplessness and anxiety to more severe depression and stress .
To assist soldiers facing problems , the Army has begun to hire more civilian mental health professionals while directing Army counselors to spend more time with frontline units .
Senior officers at the Pentagon have tried to avoid shrill warnings about the health of the force , cognizant that such comments might embolden potential adversaries , and they continue to hope that troop levels in Iraq can be reduced next year .
Still , none deny the level of stress on the force from current deployments .
The debate on Paris ' role within NATO comes ahead of a summit in April in Strasbourg , in eastern France , and Kehl in nearby Germany , that could confirm the new command structure encompassing France .

The negotiations are being conducted by church leaders who are very importanthere , said Alain Joyandet , French state secretary for cooperation .
University of Florida professor Michael Moulton thinks copyright law protects the lectures he gives to his students , and he 's headed to court to prove it .
Moulton and his e-textbook publisher are suing Thomas Bean , who runs a company that repackages and sells student notes , arguing that the business is illegal since notes taken during college lectures violate the professor 's copyright .
Faulkner Press filed suit in a Florida court Tuesday against the the owner of Einstein 's Notes , which sells " study kits " for classes , including Professor Michael Moulton 's course on " Wildlife Issues in the New Millennium . "
Those notes are illegal , Faulkner and Moulton contend , since they are derivative works of the professor 's copyrighted lectures .
If successful , the suit
(.pdf ) could put an end to a lucrative , but ethically murky businesses that have grown up around large universities to profit from students who do n't always want to go to the classes they are paying for .
The suit could also have ramifications for more longstanding businesses such as Cliffs Notes , which summarize copyrighted novels .
Faulkner Press publishes two e-textbooks that Moulton wrote and uses in his classes , and sells its own set of class notes for the course .
But James Sullivan , Faulkner Press ' attorney , says the suit is n't about money for the professors , it 's about protecting its intellectual property .
" Students are buying a particular note packet to do well on a particular exam by a particular professor , " Sullivan said .
" The commercial appeal of the product is that it is a copy or close derivative work of that professor 's intellectual property . "
But if a professor 's lectures are copyrighted , are n't students already infringing just by taking the notes in the first place ?
Yes , Sullivan answers , student notes do infringe , but they are protected infringement .
" That 's absolutely fair use , " Sullivan said .
What if a student took notes , but did n't copy anything verbatim from a professor 's lecture , and then decided to publish the notes online or sell them ?
" While that may not be slavish copy , the notes would be a derivative work and a copyright holder has the exclusive right to create derivative notes , " Sullivan said .
Sullivan says his case is more solid than a similar 1996 Florida lawsuit against a company called A - Plus Notes , which was rejected by the courts .
Moulton has registered his copyrights , cleared them with the university and recorded his lectures .
" Professor Moulton used an overhead projector in class and would write out the high points of the lecture and that 's what Einstein's
Notes ' note - taker would write down , " says Sullivan .
Moulton 's writing on the transparency fixes the copyright , and the words can easily be compared to the student notes , he adds .
Einstein's Notes , which operates online as HowIgotAnA.com , pays students to write down what professors say in class so that the notes can be re-sold to other students in advance of exams , Sullivan claims .
He also notes that Einstein 's Notes puts a copyright notice on the cheat sheets and prints its material with black ink on dark green paper in an attempt to thwart photocopying .
A less exotic copyright claim in the lawsuit alleges that Einstein 's Notes also copied and reprinted hundreds of test prep questions included in the professor 's text book and in his course software .
The lawsuit seeks any profits made off of the Moulton study guides .
Neither Einstein's Note 's owner nor Professor Moulton responded to requests for comment .

Colbert turns NY Times ' McCain story into a dirty limerick David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday February 27 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Last week , the New York Times reported on allegations of an inappropriate sexual relationship between Sen.
John McCain and lobbyist Vicki Iseman during McCain 's 2000 presidential campaign .
However , Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert found the Times story lacking a certain pizazz .
" I am angry at the Grey Lady for this one , " Colbert complained , " and I am not alone . "
He then played a clip of Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly calling the Times article " bad , bad journalism . "
" Papa Bear is right , " stated Colbert .
" This is worse than bad journalism .
It 's bad bad journalism . "
Colbert suggested that what was needed instead was " good bad journalism . "
" Shame on you , New York Times , Colbert explained .
" Not for printing innuendo , speculation , and anonymous sources .
But for doing it so poorly .
Character assassination is an art . "
Colbert pointed out that the Times article about an alleged sex scandal never even uses the word " sex " and lamented that " with this weak , weak tea , New York Times , you are giving poor journalism a bad name .
You left - wing smear machines need to take a lesson from the right - wing smear machines . "
" Take the rumors that swirl around Barack Obama like a tuban around a terrorist 's head , " Colbert suggested , playing a clip of a Fox News host asserting that Obama was raised as a Muslim and attended a madrassa .
" They started as a whisper campaign on the internet , then it was blogged , and soon enough the media picked it up and reported it as news .
A single unsubstantiated rumor is meaningless .
But add them all up and they 're true . "
" Besides , folks , " Colbert continued .
" Sex scandals are so passe .
If you need to allege something , try murder . "
He then played a clip of Sean Hannity insinuating something darker behind the 1993 suicide of Clinton advisor Vince Foster .
" Worst of all , this newspaper article has way too many words , " Colbert concluded .
" If bad journalism is good enough , it can be done in a sonnet .
Or , better yet , a limerick . "
He then recited : There once was a man named McCain
Who had the whole White House to gain
But he was quite a hobbyist
Of boning his lobbyist
So much for his oh - eight campaign
This video is from Comedy Central 's The Colbert Report , broadcast February 26 , 2008 .
Transcript via closed captions :: speaking of beef , in an undisclosed location , last week " the new york times " -- " the new york times " ran a smear article alleging an inappropriate relationship between senator john mccain and one vicky iseman a female telecom lobbyist and professional cindy mccabe mccabe -- mccain impersonator .
make no mistake , folks , i hate john mccain but unlike the times he does n't employ maureen dowd .
you have to give him credit for that .
i'm angry at the gray lady for this one and i'm not alone .
jim ? :: this is bad , bad journalism , man . :: stephen : papa bear is right .
it 's worse than bad journalism .
it 's bad , bad journalism which brings us to tonight 's word .
good bad journalism .
shame on you " new york times " , not for printing innuendos , speculation and anonymous sources but for doing it so poorly .
character assassination is an art .
first of all , terrible headline .
okay , fox 's bill hemmer knows exactly what i'm talking about . :: the article headline is for mccain self - confidence on ethics pose its own refkism what is that .
:: stephen : for mccain self - confidence on ethics poses own risks .
i've seen catchier titles on physician discertificatations .
-- sisserser -- dissertations .
folks , you need -- you -- they share my anger .
you need something punch dwlai says mccain and sex .
okay ?
because -- [ laughter ] hello , this is supposed to be a sex scandal .
word sex is n't anywhere in this article .
it 's just implied .
well , -- [ laughter ] you know what ?
i'm sorry but as a red blooded man , when i'm with a beautiful lady , i do n't imply things all night among .
and i certainly do n't vaguely suggest things from behind .
[ laughter ] with this -- with this weak article you are giving journalism a bad name .
take a lesson from the right wing machine .
take the rumors that swirl around barack obama like a turbine around his head .
they started as a whisper campaign on the internet .
then it was blogged and soon enough the media picked it up and reported it as news . :: now the news that he was raised a muslim went to a madrassa for four years , you add it up . :: stephen : that 's right a single rumor is meaningless but add them all up and they are true .
besides -- [ cheers and applause ] besides , folks -- sex scandals are so passe .
if you need to allege something , try murder .
[ laughter ] like sean hannity describing the tragic 1993 suicide of an old clinton friend and advisor .
of all the clinton chapters we 've covered so far we dwefl into chapter eight the mysterious death of vince foster part one . :: stephen : what is brilliant is that you can interpret it in two ways .
either it's why a success man man -- ing successful man take his own life and succumb to the grief and despair that touches all of us or hillary clinton stabbed him in the head with an ice pick .

Top Bush aides directed torture from the White House
By Joe Kay
12 April 2008
Senior Bush administration officials , including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , participated in White House meetings to discuss and approve specific methods of torture of detainees in the custody of US security forces , according to media reports .
These reports are a further confirmation that those at the highest levels of the US government bear direct responsibility for war crimes committed over the past several years under the cover of Washington ’s “ global war on terror . ”
Citing unnamed sources , ABC News reported on Wednesday that the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee met in 2002 and 2003 to review the interrogation of several alleged Al Qaeda members held by the CIA .
ABC reported , “ The high - level discussions about these ‘ enhanced interrogation techniques ’ were so detailed , these sources said , some of these interrogation sessions were almost choreographed — down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic . ”
Among the “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” — a euphemism for torture — was waterboarding , a notorious method that involves the near drowning of the prisoner .
The Principals Committee at that time was chaired by then - National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice .
It included Cheney , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet , and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
According to ABC , the discussions began after the capture of Abu Zubaydah in the spring of 2002 .
Earlier this year , the Bush administration officially acknowledged that the CIA had used waterboarding on Zubaydah , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
In December 2007 , the administration also acknowledged that the CIA had destroyed videotapes depicting the interrogation of Zubaydah and al - Nashiri .
It is quite possible that the Principals Committee or President Bush viewed these tapes in the course of supervising and approving the torture of these prisoners .
In any case , the officials were involved in planning torture down to the intricate details , indicating an almost sadistic interest .
According to an AP article published Friday , “ At times , CIA officers would demonstrate some of the tactics , or at least detail how they worked , to make sure the small group of ‘ principals ’ fully understood what the al - Qaida detainees would undergo . ”
ABC News reported that the CIA asked repeatedly for approval of specific interrogation plans .
“ Sources said that at each discussion , all the Principals present approved . ”
Several measures taken by administration officials make it apparent that they were acutely aware that what they were approving violated international and domestic law .
All of those participating could be subject to war crimes prosecution , in the US or in other countries .
The AP reports , “ The officials also took care to insulate President Bush ” from the meetings .
That is , there was an attempt to give the president plausible deniability in the event that the discussions were made public .
Nonetheless , Bush defended the meetings and the torture decisions in an interview with ABC News Friday .
“ Well , we started to connect the dots , in order to protect the American people , ” he told ABC News White House correspondent Martha Raddatz .
“ And , yes , I ’m aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . ”
The meetings coincided with the drafting of at least two memoranda designed to give a legal fig leaf for torture , one dated August 2002 and another March 2003 .
The memos argued for unconstrained power of the president to authorize torture and commit other illegal acts , citing the “ war on terror ” as justification .
A former senior US intelligence official familiar with the meetings told the AP , “ If you looked at the timing of the meetings and the memos you ’d see a correlation . ”
Those attending the meetings wanted “ a legal opinion on the legality of these tactics ” before proceeding .
That is , the Bush administration decided it wanted to use torture , and commissioned the drafting of a pseudo - legal justification for this decision , one designed to protect both the administration officials and the CIA agents who carried out the torture .
In 2004 , the Justice Department formally withdrew the memoranda on torture , but the administration never repudiated the legal arguments contained in them .
Indeed , a future memo on interrogation upheld the content of the previous memos .
Those involved in drafting the memos included John Yoo , a lawyer at the Justice Department ; David Addington , Cheney ’s legal counsel ; and Alberto Gonzales , then - White House Counsel .
The hands - on involvement of the White House in organizing torture also made some of the principals nervous , including Ashcroft .
According to an official cited by ABC News , Ashcroft asked at one meeting , “ Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . ”
ABC said that Ashcroft supported the general interrogation program by the CIA , but thought it unseemly for the White House to micromanage the techniques employed .
There is no doubt that the use of torture has continued to this day .
ABC reported that after the CIA captured another suspect in the summer of 2004 , the agency went back to the administration for approval of the torture techniques .
“ Then - National Security Advisor Rice , sources said , was decisive .
Despite growing policy concerns — shared by Powell — that the program was harming the image of the United States abroad , sources say she did not back down , telling the CIA , ‘ This is your baby .
Go do it ! ’ ”
These revelations are further confirmation that the crimes at Abu Ghraib and other instances of torture were not the actions of rogue individuals , but were planned and ordered by the White House .
Speaking to the WSWS , Francis Boyle , a professor of international law and human rights at the University of Illinois , said , “ Clearly this was criminal activity at the time they committed it .
At the very least , it violated the Geneva Conventions , the Convention Against Torture , the War Crimes Act , and the federal anti-torture statutes .
Clearly these would be impeachable offenses . ”
Boyle , who has campaigned for the impeachment and prosecution of administration officials , said that with the recent revelations , Rice should be added to the list of top officials guilty of war crimes .
Asked why there have been no moves for impeachment , Boyle noted , “ The Democrats have been complicit in pretty much everything the administration has done since September 11 .
They have continued to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since they assumed control of Congress in January 2007 .
It does n’t surprise me that they do n’t oppose torture . ”
The fact that the leading figures of the United States government were involved in detailed discussions of torture methods is an indictment not only of the Bush administration , but of the entire political system in the US .
From the beginning , the Democrats have given the White House a green light to carry out such policies without constraint .
Top Congressional Democrats , including the current Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , were briefed as early as 2002 on the CIA ’s program and were given a presentation on the methods the agency was using .
Others were aware of the existence and destruction of the videotapes depicting torture .
There can be no doubt that the Democratic Party leadership was fully aware that the CIA has been using torture techniques and that the administration approved it .
Nothing has been done to halt these practices , however , or to inform the American people of the actions of the government .
In 2006 , Democrats helped pass the Military Commissions Act , which amended the War Crimes Act so as to provide greater cover for administration officials .
The question of torture has not been made an issue in the current presidential elections .
Neither of the Democratic Party candidates , Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , has made statements on the recent revelations or the release last week of one of the memos justifying torture .
Far from being opposed within the political establishment , torture goes unpunished , the media presents the use of torture as a legitimate policy choice , and lawyers who argue for torture get leading positions at major universities .
Such is the decay of democracy in the United States .
New Findings Directly Contradict Company Explanation , Excuse ...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/5/2008 , 1:33 pm PT
Princeton computer science professor and now - well known academic hacker of e-voting systems , Ed Felten , reports on his blog ...
This week we obtained six new summary tapes , from machines in Bergen and Gloucester counties .
Two of these new tapes contradict Sequoia ’s explanation and show more serious discrepancies that we saw before .
His article offers the details of the latest findings , but for the disturbing --- and too - often hilarious --- background on this incredible continuing scandal ...
On Super Tuesday , Sequoia 's AVC Advantage touch - screen voting machines failed to boot up in many places , forcing the Governor himself to wait 45 minutes before he could cast his vote .
After Super Tuesday it was found that the Sequoia AVC Advantage has misreported voter turnouts .
Sequoia offered a feeble excuse for the failure , without offering evidence to support it , which blamed both voters and poll - workers instead of themselves for the multi-million dollar embarrassment .
County election officials across NJ then unanimously called for an independent investigation of the machines by Princeton computer profs Felten and Andrew Appel .
Sequoia then threatened legal action against both the professors and the counties should they undertake such a technical review of their self - described " tamperproof " machines .
The counties folded to the company 's strong - arm tactics , while hoping either the state AG or SoS would commission such a review .
Sequoia 's website was then hacked , but not before they could release misleading propaganda claiming they loved third party independent reviews so much they were willing to then sponsor one on their own by selecting and paying an unknown " independent company " named " Kwaidan Consulting " to do one on behalf of Sequoia .
Kwaidan was then revealed by The BRAD BLOG to be no more than a " blonde nymphomaniac " - seeking babe - magnet named Mike Gibbons , who , after being commissioned by Sequoia for this important analysis , suddenly discovered a new - found love for George Bush , Jesus Christ , Albert Einstein , and the U.S. constitution .
The babes and the Jim Beam would have to wait .
Much as those voters and election officials in Pennsylvania , set to use the exact same machines two weeks from now in the upcoming , all - important , Democratic Primary , will have to wait to see if the machines work at all .
Then , of course , they will simply have to trust the reported results , no matter what the machines tell them , since it is strictly impossible to discern whether any single vote cast on them was actually recorded as any single voter intended .
UPDATE 4/8/08 : Sequoia touch - screens ordered subpoenaed and examined by NJ Judge .

Stone gave an interview while on the red carpet at Cannes this weekend in which -- after recounting all of China 's atrocities -- she wondered , " All these earthquake and stuff happened and I thought , ' Is that karma ? '
When you are not nice that bad things happen to you . "
My name is Sharon !
We 've seen a lot of attempts to cut the costs of solar cells , but a team in Japan has managed to create an inexpensive flexible cell that 's as thin as a sheet of paper using what they describe as traditional printing techniques .
The team , composed of researchers from Toin University in Yokohama and private firm Fujimori Kogyo , managed to eliminate the expensive silicon component of regular solar cells , reducing thickness to just .4 mm ( .015 inches ) , and allowing a factory to pump out reams of the material every month -- enough to generate 10 megawatts of juice .
That 's actually a fairly low estimate , as the cells are only at 6 % efficiency right now , but we can imagine that number shooting upwards after they start shipping in February .
The Chevrolet Volt might just prove to be the game - changing car its supporters say it is , but General Motors expects to lose money on the car " for years , " said Vice Chairman Bob Lutz .
Maximum Bob 's frank admission is n't terribly surprising given the resources GM is pouring into the Volt and the expense of the technology behind the range - extended EV , but you 've got to admire his honesty .
" We wo n't make a dime on this car for years , and the board is OK with that , " he told a group of Volt enthusiasts at the New York International Auto Show , according to the Detroit News .
As for the car itself , Lutz says it 's still on pace for a late 2010 launch .
Battery testing is going well , he said during a meeting with reporters , and the competition to supply the batteries is " a horse race " that will run " a little longer . "
And why is GM prepared to lose its shirt ?
Lutz said GM screwed up by ceding the hybrid market to Toyota even though it had largely mastered EV technology in the 1960s .
The General wo n't make that mistake again , he said , even if it means subsidizing the Volt until it 's firmly established .
That 's a noteworthy about - face , because according to Lutz , GM dropped the ball on hybrids because it believed it would lose $ 250 million a year selling them .
Toyota , on the other hand , decided that short - term losses on the Prius would pay huge dividends once it caught on .
GM clearly hopes the same strategy will work with the Volt and put the company at the forefront of automotive technology .
There 's no question GM hopes to leapfrog Toyota and claim the green mantle – a point Lutz stressed in an interview with Wired.com not long ago .
Johan Willems , global director of communications for GM , told us he could n't confirm the Detroit News story but said " it is absolutely normal " to " not prioritize making money for some time "
when adopting new technology .
" We need to get people rallying behind new technology and the Volt will not be an exception to that rule , " he said .
" In general , it takes a couple of generations of learning before a certain volume can be reached and that with volume the making money question is solved . "
And about those batteries ?
Lutz says GM hoped to name a battery supplier next month but is still testing battery packs from Compact Power and Continental Automotive Systems .
As for who 's got the edge , Lutz would n't say .
" It 's a horse race , " he said , according to the Associated Press .
GM plans to " run the two in parallel for a while longer " before deciding which batteries to put in the Volt .
Both " have extreme strengths and some weaknesses , but the balance of strengths and weaknesses are different between the two potential suppliers . "
Lutz still says the Volt will be done by late 2010 , and so far the engineers have n't hit any major snags .
" We are doing all of the testing and so far I will say , no failures , no problems .
The battery technology is working great . "

Traditionally , the idea of insurance was to spread the costs of paying for the sick .
“ This is an erosion of the traditional concept of insurance , ” Mr. Mendelson said .
“ Those beneficiaries who bear the burden of illness are also bearing the burden of cost . ”
And often , patients say , they had no idea that they would be faced with such a situation .
It happened to Robin Steinwand , 53 , who has multiple sclerosis .
In January , shortly after Ms. Steinwand renewed her insurance policy with Kaiser Permanente , she went to refill her prescription for Copaxone .
She had been insured with Kaiser for 17 years through her husband , a federal employee , and had had no complaints about the coverage .
She had been taking Copaxone since multiple sclerosis was diagnosed in 2000 , buying a 30 days ’ supply at a time .
And even though the drug costs $ 1,900 a month , Kaiser required only a $ 20 co-payment .
Not this time .
When Ms. Steinwand went to pick up her prescription at a pharmacy near her home in Silver Spring , Md. , the pharmacist handed her a bill for $ 325 .
There must be a mistake , Ms. Steinwand said .
So the pharmacist checked with her supervisor .
The new price was correct .
Kaiser ’s policy had changed .
Now Kaiser was charging 25 percent of the cost of the drug up to a maximum of $ 325 per prescription .
Her annual cost would be $ 3,900 and unless her insurance changed or the drug dropped in price , it would go on for the rest of her life .
“ I charged it , then got into my car and burst into tears , ” Ms. Steinwand said .
She needed the drug , she said , because it can slow the course of her disease .
And she knew she would just have to pay for it , but it would not be easy .
The Pakistani detective who solved the 2002 murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl has joined the investigation into the killing of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto .
Zubair Mahmood will work with a team of British detectives to investigate the assassination , which plunged Pakistan into turmoil and forced the postponement of key elections .
Daniel Pearl was kidnapped in Karachi in 2002 and beheaded by Al Qaeda 's number three , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Mr Zubair was the lead investigator and unearthed the gang of Islamic militants who planned and carried out the killing of Mr Pearl .
An interior ministry official says Mr Zubair 's experience in handling high - profile cases will be invaluable .
Mr Zubair was also sent to the West Indies last year to assist Jamaican police in their investigation into the death of Pakistan cricket team coach Bob Woolmer .
Mr Zubair 's role in the Pearl murder probe featured heavily in the 2007 film A Mighty Heart based on the book of the same name by Mariane Pearl , the journalist 's widow .
Bhutto investigation
President Pervez Musharraf invited Scotland Yard to help with the investigation into Ms Bhutto's death , amid widespread disbelief at the authorities ' initial findings on her cause of death and their shambolic efforts at gathering evidence .
Her supporters have accused the Government of failing to protect Ms Bhutto - who headed Pakistan 's most powerful political dynasty - after a suicide bombing attempt on her life in October .
They have called for an independent UN - led probe into the murder , but Mr Musharraf , who met the Scotland Yard team today , has ruled out any further foreign involvement in the inquiry .
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack and the man believed to have shot Ms Bhutto died in the bomb blast .
Ms Bhutto's assassination triggered riots that left at least 58 people dead and forced general elections to be delayed by almost six weeks .
They are now planned for February 18 .
The Government has blamed a local Al Qaeda leader , but he has denied any role in the killing .
Initial finding
Mr Musharraf has since backed away from the Interior Ministry 's initial assessment that the two - time prime minister died from hitting her head against her car sunroof due to the shockwave from the bomb blast .
Aides from her political party who were with her at the time insist she was killed by a shot to the head from a gunman who was seen firing at least three rounds from close range as Ms Bhutto waved to supporters through her car sunroof .
The confusion has fuelled suspicions among Bhutto loyalists that the Government is trying to cover up what it knows about the murder , after Ms Bhutto had publicly accused senior officials of plotting to kill her .
The British detectives , who arrived last week , inspected the crime scene and Ms Bhutto's car over the weekend but have made no statements to the media .
Much of the evidence is believed to have been destroyed in the hours after the attack when officials hosed down the crime scene , and no autopsy of Ms Bhutto 's body was carried out , due to her family 's objections .

One of the things I decided when I started working was that I was not going to be one of those guys who worked 12 hours a day for a company ( if I ever become an entrepreneur , all bets are off since I ’m working for myself ) .
So far , I ’ve been pretty successful , and I ’ve noticed a few things that may help others .
Some of these are more observations than practices .
1. Understand reality : Work Load
The first thing to realize is that the amount of work to do will always exceed the time available .
This is why effective management is important .
If you are being ineffectively managed , it may be difficult to force a change in some of the following areas .
Just because there is always more work to do , this is no reason to kill yourself trying to get it all done .
Or even overexert yourself ( except in rare instances ) .
Do n’t misunderstand : I ’m not saying you have an excuse to slack .
Giving all of your time and attention to your employer / projects / job is the baseline here .
I am saying that just because you have a lot of work is not a valid reason to work 12 hour days .
Unless you enjoy it …in which case you ’re reading the wrong article .
If you ’re a workaholic , sacrificing your health , family , and free time to get ahead , knock yourself out .
You can stop reading now .
There are always special circumstances , though .
If you operate in an environment that runs 24/7 services and Something Bad happens–well , then you need to fix it if takes you 24 hours .
Hopefully , you ’ll get corresponding time off in return .
If it ’s the last week before release of a project and a major bug comes up–get it done .
I ’m talking about normal days , normal work .
If you are working 12 hour days and you do n’t like it , then change .
No excuses .
Change the job or change jobs .
2 . Do n’t waste time
I knew someone who always complained about having so much work to do , working 60 - 70 hour weeks , always been pressured , etc .
I know he did have quite a bit of pressure to do a number of things , but I eventually stopped feeling empathy for him because I constantly saw him talking to so many people ( friends , not direct co-workers ) during work .
If you ’re so busy working long hours , why do you waste so much time ?
Why is it that the people who complain loudest about being overworked mostly create the situation themselves ?
Do n’t wander the halls looking for distractions –chances are you ’ll find them .
There is a balance to strike here between enjoyable work environment , having friends , being part of a team , and actually getting things done .
There is also something to be said for the difficulty of concentrating on challenging topics for a long time at a stretch .
Breaks are definitely needed .
There are trade offs to everything .
If you spend an hour or two every day reading blogs instead of working on your projects , you ’ll pay for it in time later .
If this is a trade off you ’re willing to make , so be it , but make sure you understand your priorities and the consequences of your decisions .
I know someone else who used 100 words to say something when 4 would do .
This made meetings long , tortuous affairs ( unless strong ground - rules were created , endorsed , and enforced ) .
Even simple questions were avoided because nobody wanted to sit there and endure a longer - than necessary answer about the history of the universe .
Do n’t waste people ’s times , and do n’t stand for people wasting yours .
Be wise , what can I say more ?
3 . Do n’t micro-manage
The topic of micro-management is something that could take up other blog posts and books dedicated to the subject , but I just want to focus on aspects of it related to time .
This is an inverse of wasting time on trivialities .
I once had another boss who spent unbelievable amounts of time responding to every trivial e-mail ( and he insisted on being CC ’d on every topic of course ) and he also complained about working extremely long weeks .
And he worked all weekend .
He checked on the status of things constantly and was usually the first to spot potential problems .
( There were other reasons for this , too : he was usually a main point - of - contact for customers and he had more domain knowledge of everything we were doing ) .
He was very , very smart and usually not wrong , but he did spend a lot of time doing things that were arguably someone else ’s job .
We never felt invested in these aspects of work , though , because he just did them .
If you find yourself with your fingers in every aspect of your organization , you have a problem , and need to take some time out for consideration :
Why do you feel the need to be connected to everything going on ?
Is it because you have to feel in control , or do you not trust others to do a good job ?
Do you not trust your employees ?
If not , why not ?
Do they really do a bad job ?
If they do a bad job , why ?
Are they fundamentally lazy , unqualified , dumb ?
If so , why are they still working there ?
Why are you paying them and doing their job anyway ?
Would better training help ?
Maybe expectations are n’t clear .
Instead of you picking up the slack , review the expectations you have for them and go over deficiencies .
Make them responsible and give them ownership .
Do n’t undermine their jobs by taking it away .
Check on them in the future to make sure things are improved , but do n’t involve yourself day - to - day .
Is it necessary to involve yourself in every discussion or can you just ignore until it reaches a level you need to get into ?
Resist the urge to comment on things you were n’t asked about .
If nothing else , micro-management always breeds resentment .
4 . Set boundaries
I have tried to make it clear to my bosses over the years that when I ’m working on a task , I am not to be bothered on a whim .
When I ’m concentrating , do n’t bug me .
This is a somewhat loose rule for me , because it really depends on what I ’m working on .
However , it is more true than not .
The context switching that can happen with interruptions is dangerous for productivity .
Eric Gunnerson wrote about “ flow state ” years ago .
Flow state is a zone you get in where your brain is completely engaged –you ’re firing on all cylinders , fully committed and involved –pick your metaphor .
It ’s hard to get into and easy to leave .
I have a nice pair of Bose QuietComfort 2 Noise Cancelling Headphones .
These are essential for me now .
The whole topic of listening to music while programming is a separate one , with some debate , but I find it usually beneficial .
Sometimes I put them on to block sound without listening to music .
This also minimizes casual interruptions .
I rarely listen to music while trying to create a new solution for something –only when I ’m coding something I understand .
Also make sure to enforce a work / life boundary .
I have made it clear in my job that I am not be called unless it ’s an emergency that needs to be fixed RIGHT NOW .
I ignore IMs and e-mails ( unless I ’m in the mood to answer something , or it ’s trivial , or I know it would make somebody happy to know the answer to ) .
If there ’s a critical problem , I ’ll get a phone call .
I also communicate vacations and just how far out of reach of civilization I will be well ahead of time .
5. Limit Meetings
There is an abundance of resources out there for effective meeting management .
I ’m more in favor of limiting the occurrences of meetings in the first place .
How well you can do this depends a lot on your organization and the projects you ’re working on .
Pointless meetings are a waste of everyone ’s time .
They can be demoralizing , energy - sucking vortexes .
Recovering from a bad meeting can take further attention away from actually getting things done .
In my case , we have mercifully few meetings–only when the entire team needs to give input , we need to brainstorm about a tricky problem , or general status updates ( yearly or quarterly ) .
Much of what goes on in meetings can be substituted by effective individual planning , e-mail , issue tracking , or planning better in the first place .
6 . Know your tasks
Spinning your wheels is death .
Do n’t be wasting your time unconsciously ( If I ’m going to waste time , I ’d rather do it consciously with Desktop Tower Defense ) .
If you ’re stuck on a task , get help , change gears , do something else .
Make sure you have a process to detect when you and others are stuck so that you do n’t waste time .
Always know what you ’re supposed to be working on .
In addition to have issue - tracking software , make sure priorities are communicated clearly and often .
Once you finish something , you should know what the next task is , whether you do it then or not .
Whenever I have a problem of knowing my priorities , I ask my manager .
It ’s his responsibility to know and set them .
I do n’t have to worry about it .
There is usually a list of “ nice - to - haves ” that you can work on once high - priority stuff is done .
Do n’t let that list get lost , but track it the same way you do regular issues .
7. Effective Information Management
This means all sorts of data : e-mail , documents , data , scheduling , task lists .
Simplify , automate , streamline .
I wo n’t go into specific techniques –you can find them elsewhere .
Just a few simple points that I use :
Do n’t read what you do n’t need to
Do n’t respond when you do n’t need to
File away or delete ASAP
It ’s easy to get buried in information these days–and consequently it ’s easy to think it ’s at all important .
Do n’t fall into that trap .
8. External Motivations
A little obvious , this one , but important to ponder .
None of this will work if you do n’t have strong outside motivations .
You have to really enjoy being outside of work–and I do n’t think the satisfaction of doing nothing is enough .
You ’ll get bored of that eventually .
Sitting in front of a TV every night “ unwinding ” for three hours is not a motivational experience ( quite the opposite , usually ) .
Hobbies , projects , sports , exercise , cooking , family , church , books , culture , service are all part of life and should be enjoyed .
I usually schedule my evenings to some degree–whether it ’s working out , moving ahead on personal programming projects , building my latest LEGO model , watching a movie with Leticia , or reading a book –I ’ve got a long list of things I enjoy doing .
If I do n’t follow the schedule exactly , or ca n’t fit everything in , I do n’t sweat it–as long as I ’m enjoying myself , that ’s what matters .
Work is n’t everything –in fact , it is n’t even the greatest part of anything .
Be well - rounded .
* Exceptions
Unfortunately , not every job can be forced into a neat 8 - hour work day .
My wife , for example , works for a news wire service .
She works 8 - hour days most of the time , but quite often she ends up staying late to take care of things .
Unfortunately , when your job depends so much on other people , it can be a bit hard to plan days , and it ’s very possible that work comes up right when you leave , or there is too much work to fit in in a day .
However , this is unsustainable in the long run .
Either more efficient processes have to be introduced , the work load decreased , or more people hired .
A word or two about politeness as well : it ’s difficult in some environments to enforce better behaviors without being considered rude , grouchy , or holier - than - thou .
Sometimes firmness has to give way to politeness .
The carrot usually works better than the stick anyway in the long term .

— The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 's slain student body president will be laid to rest Sunday in her hometown of Athens , Ga .
Eve Carson 's family on Friday announced a visitation planned at the fellowship hall of First United Methodist Church on Lumpkin Street from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday .
Carson will be buried at the church 3 p.m. Sunday .
As investigators searched for more clues in the 22 - year - old UNC senior 's shooting death , those who knew Carson during her years at Clarke Central High School in Athens , remembered her as a generous and large - hearted spirit .
( Read more about the investigation . )
" Eve valued life .
All life , all people .
It did n't matter to Eve .
She just embraced the world , " Principal Maxine Easom said .
Carson lived with a family in Ecuador and volunteered with a doctor in a peasant health - care center one summer , they remembered .
" There 's not too many good human beings around anymore , and she was really one of them , " Buddy Simms , Carson 's biology teacher , said .
She was " just a person who was going to do good things for people .
She was so kind , so compassionate , so caring . "
Meanwhile , state flags flew at half - staff on UNC 's campus , and a number of professors canceled classes Friday .
The university is on spring break next week .
Dozens of students wrote stories about their " Memories of Eve " on walls and posted pictures of Carson on announcement boards near the center of campus .
" I think it is a true testament to her leadership , " Josh Criscoe , co-president of the Campus Y , said .
" She was about empowering other people , including other people and making them feel important and helping them succeed . "
Carson Leaves Legacy
UNC System President Erskine Bowles and other members of the Board of Governors remembered Carson and her family at a meeting Friday , with a moment in prayer .
Bowles said Carson left " an indelible mark " on him during their many meetings while she was student body president .
" I 've known lots of young people and young leaders , but I have rarely met someone who immediately made you feel like she was your friend and you were her friend , " he said .
" I can remember her coming to talk to me about the need to keep the university affordable .
( She ) was as strong and on point as anybody you can imagine , " he continued .
She also made a mark on UNC athletics .
Basketball Coach Roy Williams said Carson 's death has deeply affected his basketball team as it prepares for a Saturday - night matchup against rival Duke University .
Williams said he gathered the team at practice to put the game and Carson 's death into perspective .
" It shows that this is just a basketball game .
And it 's a big game , it 's a game that 's going to get a lot of attention , but it 's still a game , " Williams said .
" I mean , we 're talking about a young person .
And we , as old people , we 're supposed to die before our children , not have our children died before us , " he added .
Two players knew her well , he said , though he declined to identify them .
A photo submitted to WRAL.com shows standout Tyler Hansbrough posing with Carson .
" One of the headlines in this morning 's '( The ) Daily Tar Heel ' hit me , " Williams said .
" It said , she loves the Quad in the spring and the arboretum in the fall , and ' I love Roy all the time . ' "
UNC players will wear a tribute on their uniforms , and there will be a moment of silence before Saturday 's game .
A Duke graduate student is also leading an effort to have everyone who attends the game wear light - blue - and - white ribbons .
Carson , a pre-med major studying political science and biology , was active in leadership and service roles .
As a Morehead - Cain scholar , she spent her summers volunteering and working overseas in Ecuador , Egypt and Ghana .
She was considering spending the summer after graduation volunteering in Kibera , a section of Kenya 's capital , Nairobi , that was wracked by rioting early this year .
Carson pushed her class to make its senior gift a donation to the nonprofit group Carolina for Kibera to build a medical clinic .
" We would have been lucky to have her infectious spirit and life - force on the ground , " said Rye Barcott said in a statement from CFK .
" She embodied hope and goodness .
This world is much less without her in it .
But she will always be a part of us in spirit . "
Kelli Clifton , who attended high school and college with Carson , remembered that as a freshman without a car , Carson would chat about her plans for the university when they shared rides home to Athens .
" Eve would want to talk about all the great things that she would want to do at Carolina and that she would want to make a difference , " Clifton said .
" There 's nothing that she could not do . "
A tribute to Carson in the student newspaper , " The Daily Tar Heel , " on Friday praised Carson as " the epitome of the Carolina student " with an " extensive dedication to service and student groups . "
" Eve is really the epitome of what Carolina tries to bring out in their students , " Clifton said .
" And for her to be able to accomplish that in less than four years ; it takes some of us a lifetime to be able to do what Carolina wants us to do . "

Get out your list , because you can add another application to the tally of legitimate uses of BitTorrent .
Apparently , software updates are getting so big these days that simply downloading them from a server is becoming prohibitively time consuming , especially when the same updates need to be applied to many different machines .
A Dutch university has some 6,500 desktop PCs in ten locations , which on occasion need to download 3.5 GB worth of different types of updates .
That 's a handsome 22.2TB in total .
In a traditional client - server world , that 's some modest lifting .
In fact , INHOLLAND University 's IT department used to have almost two dozen servers distributed over the university 's locations to serve up these downloads .
The school was able to retire 20 of them after adopting a new way to distribute updates : BitTorrent .
The peer - to - peer protocol allows PCs to download most of the updates from each other — the remaining servers are mostly needed to send out the first few copies and then coordinate the up - and downloading .
One of the advantages of the BitTorrent protocol is that it uses bandwidth where it can find it : faster links are automatically used more .
Using this technology , updating all 6,500 PCs can be done in less than four hours .
Previously , this took four days .
Four days down to four hours for the same needs !
Leo Blom of ITeleo , who came up with the idea of using BitTorrent , told Ars , " Let me put it this way : if INHOLLAND wants to migrate to Windows Vista , they only have to send out an image through BT .
All 6,500 desktops can be migrated overnight in two hours ' time — with one push of a button .
It 's a real migration killer .
Migration used to mean a lengthy and trying process .
At INHOLLAND , we took a different approach . "
According to TorrentFreak , the university 's management team was reluctant to adopt the peer - to - peer technology , but they quickly changed their minds after seeing a demonstration .
Students and staff who think they can use the modified BitTorrent client for other purposes will be disappointed to learn that the system is completely locked down .
For the first time , physicists have been able to identify individual returning photons after firing and reflecting them off of a space satellite in orbit almost 1,500 kilometres above the earth .
The experiment has proven the possibility of constructing a quantum channel between Space and Earth .
Research in the New Journal of Physics , discusses the feasibility of building a completely secure channel for global communication , via satellites in space , all thanks to advances in quantum mechanics .
The research team , led by Paolo Villoresi and Cesare Barbieri from Padova University , Italy , has taken intricate steps to fire photons directly at the Japanese Ajisai Satellite .
The researchers have been able to prove that the photons received back at the Matera ground - based station , in southern Italy , are the same as those originally emitted .
This news will be welcomed by communication companies , banks , and MI5 - types worldwide as it paves the way for quantum - encrypted communication - the only form of communication that could ensure beyond any doubt that there are no eavesdroppers .
Until now , quantum - encrypted communication has only been proven possible at distances up to about 150 kilometres , either down optical fibres or via telescopes .
When sent down optical fibres , photons are dissipated due to scattering and adsorption and , when using telescopes , photons are subject to interfering atmospheric conditions .
Anton Zeilinger , 2008 winner of the Institute of Physics ’ premier award , the Newton Medal , was involved in the research .
The team now believes that Space - to - Earth quantum communication is possible with available technology .
The scientists write , “ We have achieved significant experimental results towards the realization of a quantum communication channel , as well as how to actually adapt an existing laser ranging facility for quantum communication . ”
The team will now be furthering the research by making it possible to emit and receive quantum keys , uncrackable strings of 1s and 0s that enable quantum communication from an active sender in space .
Very recently , the Italian Space Agency has funded the initial phase of this project .
The published version of the paper " Experimental verification of the feasibility of a quantum channel between Space and Earth " was published March 28 , 2008 in the New Journal of Physics 10 033038 .

Writing in the New York Times in the aftermath of President Nixon ’s August 1971 decision to sever the dollar ’s link to gold , author John Brooks observed , “ that the president and his advisers , in making their Draconian move , did not understand what they were doing . ”
Truer words have rarely been written .
Given the absence of policy that must coincide with the notion of a “ floating ” currency , the dollar , previously defined as 1/35th of an ounce of gold , suddenly had no market definition .
With U.S. monetary authorities lacking a benchmark whereby they could manage the greenback , the latter ’s value quickly eroded .
Though the oil “ shocks ” that followed are to this day described in establishment economic quarters as a function of OPEC ’s largely symbolic " embargo , " the real answer lay in a currency that was quickly losing value .
This materialized first in the form of a rising gold price , and it soon led to broad increases in the prices of all manner of commodities .
OPEC , previously toothless due to the stability of the oil price under a world - currency regime centered around a stable dollar , had its heyday amidst a period of rising petroleum prices that shifted enormous amounts of increasingly worthless paper currency to the Middle East .
In concert with inflation ’s rise , so did OPEC ’s stature grow ; its power every bit as inflated as the cheap dollars sent over in exchange for oil .
Had OPEC ’s newfound heft been merely coincidental , this would have been made quickly apparent by non-oil commodities that would have remained inexpensive alongside oil ’s rise .
In fact , the exact opposite situation materialized .
While the dollar price of oil rose 300 % during the dollar ’s first major devaluation , other commodities not impacted by OPEC machinations similarly became dear .
In 1973 , meat prices were rising at a 75 percent annual rate .
From 1972 to 1973 the cost of a bushel of wheat rose 240 percent .
Soybeans rose from $ 3.50 a bushel in 1972 to $ 12.00 in 1973 .
With commodities priced in dollars , a change in the dollar ’s value has a near instantaneous impact on the spot price of those same commodities .
The greenback ’s fall post - Bretton Woods in a sense made a broad commodity rally inevitable .
And perhaps foreshadowing the bipartisan hysteria concerning food prices today , the doomsayers of thirty years ago had their day in the sun .
In 1972 , the Club of Rome released The Limits to Growth , which said if economic growth were allowed to continue , the world would run out of food and commodities ; oil disappearing from the earth by 1992 .
Ever eager to latch on to any crackpot notion embraced by the intelligentsia , President Jimmy Carter commissioned a study from Gerald Barney at the Rockefeller Foundation titled Global 2000 .
The report predicted rising commodity prices thanks to declining food and oil production wrought by falling supplies of both .
It is said that the report greatly impacted our 39th president , and partially explained his dour countenance throughout the 1980 election .
Moving to the present , a number of commentators from both sides of the political spectrum have called attention to rising food and commodity prices .
Parroting the “ visionaries ” from the Club of Rome , New York Times columnist Paul Krugman recently asked whether , “ limited supplies of natural resources pose an obstacle to future world economic growth ? ”
Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute has bemoaned a World Bank study showing global food prices have risen 83 percent over the last three years ; a period in which “ almost all of the increase in global maize production from 2004 to 2007 went for biofuels production in the U.S. ''
Hassett ’s stance becomes more interesting when we consider the long - held view of many right - of - center think tanks that U.S. farmers produce too much food .
The often insightful Ambrose Evans - Pritchard of London ’s Daily Telegraph recently wrote of a “ Malthusian crunch [ that ] has been building for a long time , ” thanks to the world ’s addition of 73 million mouths per year .
Evans - Pritchard channels Hassett in his proclamation that the “ mass diversion of the North American grain harvest into ethanol plants for fuel is reaching its political and moral limits . ”
Not defending the hoax that is ethanol for one second , the fears expressed by Hassett and Evans - Pritchard are somewhat overdone .
No doubt the dollar price of wheat , corn and soybeans has increased respectively 136 , 203 and 205 percent since 2001 .
It seems like a lot , and in isolation would make their worries ( along with those of Krugman ) understandable .
But what all three left out of their analysis is the dollar ’s near singular role in the above .
Indeed , over the same timeframe the objective benchmark that is gold is up 244 percent in dollar terms .
Rather than expensive , food in real terms has n’t kept pace with a severe dollar devaluation that has spread to currencies around the world .
When inflation outside the U.S. is considered , it ’s seemingly hidden owing to the desire of currency experts to compare the interplay of paper currencies lacking any market definition .
But in truth , dollar devaluations going back to 1971 have historically occurred in concert with inflationary outbreaks worldwide .
And that ’s what ’s happened over the last several years .
Since the summer of 2001 when the dollar started to fall , we ’ve heard persistent chatter about the strength of foreign currencies relative to the greenback .
The strength , however , has been highly illusory in that it ’s merely shown that currencies not our own have been stronger than the even weaker U.S. dollar .
Measured in gold , it would be hard to find any currency that has n’t lost value in this decade ; hence the worldwide inflationary outbreak that has spread to food prices , and that ’s shown up in government measures of inflation that have reached multi-year highs .
So rather than a tragedy of too much growth , too much ethanol production or too little moral fiber , the food “ shortage ” story is as it ’s always been : a dollar story .
Going back to 1971 and our mistaken decision to float the dollar , periods of weakness since then have regularly led to commodity shortages of all kinds , including corn .
A simple solution to the present food problem would involve the Bush Treasury making plain that it would not just prefer a stronger dollar , but a stable one defined in terms of something real like gold .
Food shortages and the alleged power of OPEC would quickly become historical relics if Treasury made such a move , but in considering our present monetary authorities , it seems that they , much like their predecessors in the Nixon Administration , do not know what they ’re doing .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Senate Ethics Committee issued a letter of admonition Thursday to New Mexico Republican Sen .
Pete Domenici for his role in contacting the U.S. attorney in his state about a pending federal grand jury investigation into public corruption .
Sen .
Pete Domenici , who suffers from a brain disease , is retiring after six terms in the Senate .
" The committee finds no substantial evidence to determine that you attempted to improperly influence an ongoing investigation , " the letter said about his call to David Iglesias , then the U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico .
Iglesias is one of eight U.S. attorneys fired by Bush administration Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , which led Democrats to allege the firings were politically motivated .
Iglesias has said Domenici called him before the 2006 election to inquire about an ongoing corruption investigation involving Democrats , which he interpreted as political pressure .
The controversy led to Gonzales ' resignation .
" The committee does find that you should have known that a federal prosecutor receiving such a telephone call , coupled with an approaching election which may have turned on or been influenced by the prosecutor 's actions in the corruption matter , created an appearance of impropriety that reflected unfavorably on the Senate . "
In a public statement issued in March 2007 about the October 2006 call , Domenici wrote , " In retrospect , I regret making the call and I apologize .
However , at no time in that conversation or any other conversation with Mr. Iglesias did I ever tell him what course of action I thought he should take on any legal matter .
I have never pressured him nor threatened him in any way . "
Thursday 's letter from the committee represents a black mark for Domenici , 75 , who is retiring after six terms in the Senate .
He is suffering from a progressive brain disease .
Do n't Miss Senate seeks federal inquiry of altered earmark
In a written statement , Domenici said Thursday , " I am gratified the Senate Ethics Committee has concluded its inquiry favorably without a formal adjudicatory review , confirming what I have always maintained : I did not attempt to improperly influence an ongoing investigation when I telephoned the former United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico .
" Nevertheless , as I said publicly last March when this complaint was originally filed , I regret the distraction this controversy has caused my colleagues , my staff , my family and , most importantly , my constituents .
Now that this matter has concluded favorably , I am anxious to focus all of my time and attention on the business of the people of New Mexico . "

We 've known about the new Subaru diesel for some time now , but we have n't had a real good walkthrough of this first - to - market boxer turbodiesel .
You know , the whole shebang — specs , dimensions , power , transmissions , tricks .
It 's high time we rectified that .
Luckily , TechOn did a sit - down with the chief engineers of the program a little while ago and got the whole kit , caboodle and whatever else goes along with it .
What we came away with — other than a severe case of information overload — is that this clever little 2.0 - liter horizontally - opposed four cylinder has some serious tricks up it bores .
Advertisement
Though perhaps a small note in the story , the engine is over 2.4 inches shorter front to back than Subarus 2.0 - liter four cylinder gasoline EJ20 .
That 's impressive considering the new block is stronger and up to 10 kg lighter than it 's inline competitors .

Subie 's also shifted to a fracture split bearing for the crank end of the connecting rods .
What does that mean ?
Well , the connecting rod is forged as one unit , complete with holes at the crank bore and wrist pin ends .
Machining operations clean up the surfaces and create the threaded holes for the bearing cap bolts , then the rod is scored along the split plane of the crank end bearing with a high powered laser .
An expanding mandrel is then inserted and breaks the end of the rod in a controlled manner inline with that laser etching .
The rough surface remains and acts to positively locate the connecting rod cap in space without any fancy machining .
Fuel is delivered through a positively massive high pressure fuel rail operating at around 26,000 PSI .
The actual injection is handled by Denso developed units and are based on solenoid technology .
Subaru has indicated the next generation may utilize Piezo injectors , and thus operate at even higher pressures for the next level of emissions regulations .
For a little fresh air to go with that fuel , the turbo is a variable nozzle geometry unit mounted close to the manifold to reduce turbo lag and can spin all the way up to 190,000 RPM .
There was a bunch of other stuff having to do with emissions and all that good stuff , but thats boring , so go read that yourself if you like .

Interestingly , the engine is only currently planned with a 5 speed manual — with taller gears due to the high torque available .
Speaking of power , lets remember this thing is planned currently to put out 147 HP at 3600 RPM and 258 lb.ft. at 1800 RPM .
We 're not what you 'd call experts , but thats a pretty healthy bite of grunt down low .
With the inherently smooth operation of the boxer design , and the apparently compact and relatively lightweight design , this seems like a winner without consequence .
Though it 's widely anticipated this engine will eventually make from Europe to the US , nothing has been confirmed yet , but we can only hope .

AMERICANS are unaccustomed to recessions , particularly ones that involve shopping less .
During the past quarter - century , the world 's most powerful economy has suffered only two official downturns , in 1990 - 91 and 2001 .
Both were short and shallow .
In 2001 consumer spending barely skipped a beat ; a decade earlier it fell , but only briefly .
Buoyed by rising asset prices and financial innovations that allowed ever more people to tap ever more debt , the collective American wallet has not snapped shut in almost two decades .
That may be about to change .
Evidence is mounting that the economy has slipped into recession — and this time consumer weakness is to the fore ( see article ) .
The doughty American shopper is being pummelled by four things : the housing bust , the credit crunch , higher fuel and food costs and , most recently , a weakening labour market .
The unemployment rate rose to 5.1 % in March , while the private sector lost jobs for the fourth month in a row .
Feeling poorer and with fewer people prepared to lend them money , consumers are cutting back : witness the slump in car sales .
And seeing that consumer spending accounts for 70 % of American demand , that hurts , especially when it is coupled with a collapse in the once mighty construction industry .
The IMF now officially predicts an American recession in 2008 ; many at the Federal Reserve think output is contracting .
Shallow but lengthy : you could do a lot worse
There are two big questions about this downturn for America and the world : how long ?
And how deep ?
On the second count , there is room for guarded optimism : although American recessions have usually sent the world economy into a funk , this time the slowdown need not be so severe — especially for the emerging world .
The economic tests instead may come from the length of this downturn : an America that stays sluggish for several years could cause all sorts of problems .
That is not to imply that a severe global slowdown is out of the question .
The IMF reckons that there is a 25 % chance of the world economy growing by less than 3 % in 2008 and 2009 , the equivalent of recession , in its view .
The origins of this crisis lie in the biggest asset bubble in history ; financial markets have already suffered arguably their biggest shock for 80 years ; and America is not the only developed economy suffering ( Britain 's housing market , for instance , is showing the same symptoms as America 's — see ) .
But so far at least there is little evidence that the world economy is falling off a cliff .
The pace of job losses in America has been mild compared with previous downturns , and there are a couple of reasons to suppose it will stay that way .
The first is the activism of American policymakers .
Congress started throwing money at the problem early , and a second fiscal stimulus is already being discussed ( alongside a bail - out for the housing market ) .
The Fed has slashed interest rates , promised more cuts if the economy stays weak and — perhaps most important — sharply reduced the odds of financial - market catastrophe by extending its safety net to investment banks .
The second is the changing structure of the world economy .
The dynamism and resilience of emerging markets mean that America does not matter as much as it once did .
The IMF expects global growth to fall from 4.9 % in 2007 to 3.7 % this year — hardly catastrophic .
Moreover , these foreigners can now do a bit to cushion the blow for Americans : already global demand , coupled with a weak dollar , is boosting American exports .
Meanwhile , some losses from America 's housing bust have been borne abroad , although not without pain .
With these props , America can avoid a deep slump , but do n't expect a vigorous recovery .
Spending will be supported by tax rebates in the second half of the year , but the hangover from the housing bust will linger much longer .
Judging by the experience of other rich countries that have suffered financial crises spawned by housing busts , such as Sweden and Norway in the early 1990s , weak balance sheets will weigh on consumers ' spending for years rather than months .
The 2008 recession may be mild , but the 2009 recovery will be feeble .
Beware the slithering snail
If the world economy 's biggest problem turns out to be America remaining snail - like for longer than most people expect , many will breathe a sigh of relief .
Given the scale of the financial mess , it could be a lot worse .
You can even argue that after five years of breakneck growth , a more sedate global expansion would be no bad thing : it would dampen inflationary pressures in the emerging world , and weaker domestic demand should shrink America 's gaping external deficit — already down from above 6 % of GDP to below 5 % .
But that is about as far as optimism can take you .
The main fear is that the rest of the world proves less resilient than now seems likely : commodity exporters , say , may rely on American demand less than they did , but are hardly cut off from it .
The weak dollar also causes problems .
Importing America 's loose monetary policy will become harder to sustain for countries , such as the Gulf states , that peg their currencies to the greenback .
They will need to let their exchange rates rise .
Politics too can do plenty of damage .
A sluggish America next year will be a hard inheritance for the next president .
With the budget deficit rising , big domestic reforms , such as expanding health - care coverage , will become more difficult ; with a fragile economy , the Democrats , if they get in , may have to rethink their plan to roll back George Bush 's tax cuts .
And do not forget populism and protectionism .
Already eight out of ten Americans say their country is on the wrong track .
A protracted malaise will spawn an angry search for scapegoats .
Even though free trade is helping save Americans from a worse downturn , Mr Bush is struggling to get a trade deal with Colombia through Congress ( see ) : heaven help the Doha round .
Meanwhile , the momentum to re-regulate financial markets and punish the oil industry , credit - card firms or indeed any other malefactors of great wealth will grow .
The great American slowdown may be less calamitous than many people fear ; but it is fraught with dangers .
Functional Program Correctness Through Types Functional Program Correctness Through Types
Nils Anders Danielsson
PhD thesis , Chalmers University of Technology and Göteborg University , 2007 . [ pdf ]
Abstract
This thesis addresses the problem of avoiding errors in functional programs .
The thesis has three parts , discussing different aspects of program correctness , with the unifying theme that types are an integral part of the methods used to establish correctness .
The first part validates a common , but not obviously correct , method for reasoning about functional programs .
In this method , dubbed " fast and loose reasoning " , programs written in a language with non-terminating functions are treated as if they were written in a total language .
It is shown that fast and loose reasoning is sound when the programs are written in a given total subset of the language , and the resulting properties are translated back to the partial setting using certain partial equivalence relations which capture the concept of totality .
The second part discusses a method for ensuring that functions meet specified time bounds .
The method is aimed at implementations of purely functional data structures , which often make essential use of lazy evaluation to ensure good time complexity in the presence of persistence .
The associated complexity analyses are often complicated and hence error - prone , but by annotating the type of every function with its time complexity , using an annotated monad to combine time complexities of subexpressions , it is ensured that no details are forgotten .
The last part of the thesis is a case study in programming with strong invariants enforced by the type system .
A dependently typed object language is represented in the meta language , which is also dependently typed , in such a way that it is impossible to form ill - typed terms .
An interpreter is then implemented for the object language by using normalisation by evaluation .
By virtue of the strong types used this implementation is a proof that every term has a normal form , and hence normalisation is proved .
This also seems to be the first formal account of normalisation by evaluation for a dependently typed language .
Errata Chapter 2 , Section 11 : The first sentence of the last paragraph should be extended as follows : " ( with modified preconditions : the translations of all terms have to belong to ℒ₁′ ) . "
Chapter 3 , Section 10 : In the typing rule for fix the term fix t should be replaced by fix ( λx.t ) .

This list is in response to all the suggestions in the comments on the Top 10 Sci Fi Inventions that Should n’t be Invented .
While there are tons of inventions that have various dangerous aspects there are many that would benefit the human race with hardly any dangers .
10 Interstellar Travel
Interstellar space travel is unmanned or manned travel between stars .
The concept of interstellar travel in starships is a staple in science fiction .
Interstellar travel is tremendously more difficult than interplanetary travel due to the vastly larger distances involved .
Imagine being able to travel to distant worlds , discover new horizons and colonize space , all in the blink of an eye .
Can it be done ?
The NASA Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project identified two breakthroughs which are needed for interstellar travel to be possible :
A method of propulsion able to reach the maximum speed which it is possible to attain
A new method of on - board energy production which would power those devices .

9 Terraforming
Terraforming ( literally , “ Earth - shaping ) is the hypothetical process of deliberately modifying its atmosphere , temperature , surface topography or ecology to be similar to those of Earth in order to make it habitable by humans .
This must become a reality if there is to ever be interstellar colonization .
But is n’t the ultimate dream for humans to propagate and colonize the entire galaxy ?
Can it be done ?
Well , in theory , yes .
Here ’s how :
Ecosynthesis .
This is a term used to describe the use of introduced species to fill niches in a disrupted environment , with the aim of increasing the speed of ecological restoration .
Paraterraforming :
This is the construction of a habitable enclosure on a planet which eventually grows to encompass most of the planet ’s usable area .
[ Wikipedia ]
8 Space Elevator
A space elevator is a proposed structure designed to transport material from a celestial body ’s surface into space .
The term most often refers to a structure that reaches from the surface of the Earth to geosynchronous orbit ( GSO ) and a counter - mass beyond .
This device would facilitate construction in space , launching of satellites and space travel ( via the “ slingshot effect ” ) .
Can it be done ?
Absolutely .
The most common theory is a tether , usually in the form of a cable or ribbon , spanning from the surface near the equator to a point beyond geosynchronous orbit .
As the planet rotates , the inertia at the end of the tether counteracts gravity , and also keeps the cable taut .
Vehicles can then climb the tether and reach orbit without the use of rocket propulsion .

7 Energy Shield
Typically , energy shields are some form of force field designed to protect against weapons or elements by deflecting or absorbing their impact .
The field is projected along the surface of , or into the space around an object .
They usually work by absorbing or dissipating the energy of the incoming attack ; prolonged exposure to such attacks weakens the shield and eventually results in the shield ’s collapse , making the protected area vulnerable to attack .
Can it be done ?
This one is a toughie .
Scientists are toying with the possibility , but a number of obstacles must be overcome before it could ever be conceived .
Energy .
The cost of the projection of such a shield would be phenomenal , to say the least .
Technology .
It all comes down to projecting energy into a solid form .
Once we can do that , the rest is history .

6 Panacea
The panacea is a remedy that would cure all diseases , and prolong life .
It is the ultimate cure for cancer , aids , viruses , everything .
For millennia it has been thought of as simply a pipe dream , but as medical science advances the idea of a panacea is coming far closer to reality .
Can it be done ?
In theory , yes .
The advances of medical science in genetics ( specifically the interplay of inherited genes and the environment ) , and the immune system are lending more credibility to this idea every year .
It is certainly imaginable within the lifetime of the current generation .

5 Antigravity
Antigravity is the idea of creating a place or object that is free from the force of gravity .
It does not refer to countering the gravitational force by an opposing force of a different nature , as a helium balloon does ; instead , anti-gravity requires that the fundamental causes of the force of gravity be made either not present or not applicable to the place or object through some kind of technological intervention .
The practical applications of antigravity range from reduced transportation costs , to gravity manipulation in space .
Can it be done ?
The short answer to this one is no .
However , there are theories that seem to indicate the existence , or at least possibility of antigravity .
One of the most common is the Biefeld - Brown effect .
This effect is not technically antigravity , however it duplicates the effects .
Basically , a cloud of positively charged ions are attracted to a negative smooth electrode , where they are neutralized again .
In the process , thousands of impacts occur between these charged ions and the neutral air molecules in the air gap , causing a transfer in momentum between the two , which creates a net directional force on the electrode setup .
[ Wikipedia ]
4 Bionics
Bionics is a term which refers to flow of ideas from biology to engineering and vice versa .
Hence , there are two slightly different points of view regarding the meaning of the word .
In medicine , Bionics means the replacement or enhancement of organs or other body parts by mechanical versions .
Bionic implants differ from mere prostheses by mimicking the original function very closely , or even surpassing it .
In technology , Bionics refers to the development of specific technologies which mimic biological adaptation to the environment .
Examples include a ships hull that mimics the thick skin of a dolphin , or sonar , radar , and medical ultrasound imaging imitating the echolocation of bats .
Can it be done ?
Yes .
This technology has been in development for a number of years and , while still in the early stages , has already produced many devices .
Examples of technological bionics include Velcro and Cat ’s eye reflectors .
Examples of medical bionics include artificial hearts and the cochlear implant .

3 Global Municipal Wi-Fi
Municipal Wi-Fi is the concept of turning an entire city into a Wireless Access Zone , with the ultimate goal of making wireless access to the Internet a universal service .
This is usually done by providing municipal broadband via Wi -Fi to large parts or all of a municipal area by deploying a wireless mesh network .
The typical deployment design uses hundreds of routers deployed outdoors , often on utility poles .
The operator of the network acts as a wireless internet service provider .
Can it be done ?
Actually , this technology already exists in many cities throughout the world .
However , it is not common enough to be considered mainstream .
Usually , a private firm works closely with local government to construct such a network and operate it .
Financing is usually shared by both the private firm and the municipal government .
Once operational , the service may be free , supported by advertising , provided for a monthly charge per user or some combination .

2 Transatlantic tunnel
A transatlantic tunnel is a theoretical tunnel which would span the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe and would carry mass transit of some type — trains are envisioned in most proposals .
Using advanced technologies , speeds of 300 to 5,000 mph ( 500 to 8,000 km/h ) are envisioned .
The implications of such a tunnel are massive .
Imagine being able to go from New York to London in less than an hour .
Or shipping goods overseas at a fraction of the cost and time .
Can it be done ?
Plans for such a tunnel have not progressed beyond the conceptual stage , and no one is actively pursuing such a project .
The main barriers to constructing such a tunnel are cost — as much as $ 12 trillion — and the limits of current materials science .
A Transatlantic Tunnel would be 215 times longer than the longest current tunnel and would cost perhaps 3000 times as much .

1 Ocean Colonization
Ocean colonization is the theory and practice of permanent human settlement of oceans .
Such settlements may float on the surface of the water , or be secured to the ocean floor , or exist in an intermediate position .
Advantages of ocean colonization include the expansion of livable area and expanded resource access .
Many lessons learned from ocean colonization will likely prove applicable to space colonization .
The ocean may prove simpler to colonize than space and thus occur first , providing a proving ground for the latter .
Can it be done ?
Yes , but the economic realities must be considered .
To become self - sustaining , the colony must aim to produce output of a kind which holds a comparative advantage by occurring on the ocean .
While it can save the cost of acquiring land , building a floating structure that survives in the open ocean has its own costs .
One of the most realistic possibilities is the export of electricity from tidal energy .

Baseball season is once more upon us .
Millions of Americans will be heading to stadiums across the country to root for their team .
At the game you ’ll find hundreds of souvenir options : pennants , programs , jerseys , and the like .
These will all cost you an arm and a leg , and they ’re not even that great .
The best souvenir to bring home is a baseball you caught .
It does n’t cost you anything extra and it was actually used for play .
It comes with real memories attached .
But a ball is n’t going to simply fall into your lap ; catching one takes a bit of finesse .
Here ’s how you can walk away from a ballpark with a souvenir baseball :
Equipment
Make sure to bring your glove to the game .
Sure , you may look like a dork , but when a foul ball is coming at you at over 100 MPH , you ’re going to wish you had it .
Moreover , most foul balls have a wicked spin coming off the bat .
Catching a ball with such a spin with your bare hand is pretty much impossible .
So , bring your glove .
Do n’t be an uber dork and bring a fish net .
That ’s just cheating .
How to snag a ball before the game
Go to batting practice .
This is your best chance to snag a baseball .
The ideal place to stand is in an aisle near the field , about three quarters of the way from third base to the foul pole .
Most players are right handed and will be pulling the ball during batting practice .
By placing yourself in this spot , you up your chances of catching a ball .
Just ask the players for a ball .
While batting practice is going on , there are other players out fielding the balls .
Oftentimes , if a ball goes near the stands , they will just toss the ball to the fans .
If you get near a player who has a ball in his hand , politely ask him for it .
He ’ll probably just give it to you .
How to snag a ball during the game
Do you want a foul ball or a home run ?
Snagging a ball during the game is much more difficult and takes more planning and strategy than trying to snag one during batting practice .
Yet pulling it off is far more satisfying .
The first decision you need to make is : what kind of ball do you want ?
Are you happy just settling for a foul ball or do you want to catch a home run ?
The answer to this question will determine where you should purchase your seats .
If you can walk away with any ball , it ’s been a good day .
But home run balls carry with them greater sentimental ( and possibly economic ) value .
If you ’re happy with just a foul ball , you ’ll want to sit somewhere near the alley between third base and the foul pole or first base and the foul pole .
It ’s easier to grab a foul there .
And if you want a homer ?
Well , that pretty self - explanatory .
Sit in the outfield bleachers .
Do your research .
You ’ll want to do some research before the game about the opposing team ’s pitcher .
If it ’s a lefty , the batting lineup will be loaded with righties .
In that case , sit near the first base line .
It ’s harder for batters to pull during a game , and they are more likely to swing late , and thus foul in that direction .
If the pitcher is a righty , sit near the third base line .
Also do some research on the stadium .
Are the walls very high along the base lines ?
If they are n’t , try to get as near to the wall as you can .
It ’s easy to reach over and field ground foul balls .
If the walls are high , your chances might better if you go a little further back to catch a pop up foul .
A great resource to research stadiums for optimum foul ball catching is Snagging Baseballs .
Zack Hample has caught over 3,000 game balls at every major league stadium .
In his blog , he discusses each trip to a stadium and chronicles how he snagged a foul ball there .
Check it out before you make your ticket purchase .
If you ’re interested in catching a home run , an excellent resource to check out is HitTracker .
It tracks how far each home run went for each player and where it went in a stadium .
Most players consistently hit homeruns in the same area .
Looking at these statistics can give you an idea of where to sit in the outfield so you can walk away with a home run ball .
Catch it .
Put your glove on and get ready to catch your ball .
If you ’re near the baseline wall , you can always try picking up a grounded foul ball .
If you ’re behind home plate , you ’ll definitely want to use a glove .
The spin on foul balls that go behind home plate can be quite wicked .
Only a glove will do .
Fan Interference
Do n’t get in the way of the players .
If you ’re going for a ball make sure it ’s clearly out of play before you go for it .
This can be difficult to tell , especially if you ’re near a wall where it ’s easy for you to take the ball out of play .
Not sure ?
Spectator interference is defined as anytime a spectator “ reaches out of the stands , or goes on the playing field , and touches a live ball . ”
Here ’s the official MLB rule for fan interference :
3.16
When there is spectator interference with any thrown or batted ball , the ball shall be dead at the moment of interference and the umpire shall impose such penalties as in his opinion will nullify the act of interference .
APPROVED RULING :
If spectator interference clearly prevents a fielder from catching a fly ball , the umpire shall declare the batter out .
So , if the ump decides that you clearly got in the way of a fielder catching the ball , the batter is out .
However , any ball on the spectators ’ side of the wall is fair game for you .
The player reaches over the wall at his own risk .
With ground balls that roll near the wall , make sure it ’s a foul before you reach over and grab it .
Avoid fan interference at all costs or you risk becoming the most hated person in a stadium full of thousands of people .
The most notorious example of fan interference is that of 12 year old Jeffery Maier during the 1996 American League Conference Series between the New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles .
During the 8th inning , Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter hit a fly to the right field wall .
Oriole right fielder Tony Tarasco backtracked and positioned himself to catch the ball just short of the wall .
12 - year - old Jeffery Maier , a spectator seated in the bleachers , reached out to catch the ball , and deflected it away from Tarasco and over the fence .
Umpire Rich Garcia ruled the play a home run , which resulted in the Yankees tying the game .
The Yanks went on to win the game and the series .
Jeffery Maier went on to be the most hated 12 year old in Baltimore .
Do n’t do what he did .
Ethical and legal ramifications of ball catching
Give the kids a chance .
Do n’t be a douchebag and prevent a little kid from catching a ball .
I ’ve seen this happen at several ball games .
It ’s quite unseemly and everyone will hate you .
Do n’t be that guy .
Do n’t resort to violence .
When you go after a ball , it ’s natural for you to get banged up .
Especially if there is a scuffle for a prized home run ball .
However , in your effort to snag a ball , do n’t resort to violence to get it .
Do n’t punch , bite , scratch , or intentionally push somebody to get a ball .
First , you ’re tool if you do .
Second , it ’s just a damn ball .
No need to bloody someone else up for it .
Who owns the ball ?
Surprisingly , your snagging of a ball could carry some legal ramifications .
As many of you know , I ’m a law student .
One of the most interesting cases I ’ve read during my law school career was Popov v. Hayashi : the Barry Bonds 73rd home run ball case .
Basically what happened was that two guys claimed they caught Bonds ’ 73rd homer .
They took it court and a judge decided they both had valid claims for legal ownership .
So the judge ordered them to sell it and split the proceeds .
Here ’s a link to the court opinion .
It ’s a fun read and you ’ll pick up some basic property law principles to boot .
Also , if you get a chance , watch the documentary about the case called Up For Grabs .
It ’s hilarious .
You ’ll be amazed by the greed of the two men fighting over a ball .
Popov is a complete character : a total media whore .
He ended up racking up over $ 473,000 in attorney fees .
The ball only sold for $ 450,000 , of which Popov got $ 225,000 .
That means this guy was in the hole a quarter of a million dollars .
Lesson learned : do n’t go to court for a dumb ball .

How to Snag Major League Baseballs
AFP | March 26 , 2008
President George W. Bush has cleared the way for giving millions of dollars to Pakistan to fight terrorism this year , the White House said Tuesday as a new government took power in Islamabad .
In a memo to the secretary of state dated Monday , Bush used his authority to exempt Pakistan from a law that restricts funding countries where the legitimate head of state was deposed by a military coup , as in Pakistan .
The waiver , which Bush has approved every year since 2003 , opens the way for the United States to provide about 300 million dollars this year to key " war on terror " ally Pakistan to boost its counter - terrorism operations .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the Bush administration still had concerns about the human rights situation in Pakistan , where President Pervez Musharraf took power by force in 1999 , but stressed its major strategic role .
" Pakistan is a key ally in the ‘ war on terror . ’
The Pakistani government is conducting military , police , and intelligence operations to fight terrorist groups on Pakistani soil and bring terrorists to justice , " Johndroe said .
The White House said Bush had asked the US Congress for about 300 million dollars for security assistance in Pakistan .
The announcement came as Pakistan ’s new prime minister , Yousuf Raza Gilani , a key aide of slain opposition icon Benazir Bhutto , was sworn in by Musharraf after being picked as premier by parliament on Monday .
He will lead a coalition of Musharraf ’s opponents , who won general elections last month and who have indicated they plan to review the president ’s cooperation with the United States .

Enlarge By Chris Gardner , Getty Images Drivers upset by increasing gas prices attend a truck stop rally Saturday in Harrisburg , Pa .
A convoy to the state capitol is planned .
Facing mounting diesel fuel costs and shrinking profits , some truckers nationwide are making plans to protest this week by parking their semis or clogging traffic by driving slowly .
The truckers say average diesel gas prices , which AAA reported had risen over the past month from $ 3.38 to $ 3.91 a gallon nationally as of Friday , are forcing some drivers out of business .
MORE : Record fuel prices blow budgets RELATED : Automakers pump up models with diesel power Independent trucker Bob Kuzniar , 60 , of Churubusco , Ind. , who drives a 200 - gallon semitrailer , said that though there is no centrally organized effort , he has heard some truckers plan to call in sick today to protest .
He said there are plans for truckers across the nation to pull over and park for two to three hours starting midnight on Tuesday .
Indiana State Police Sgt. Kim Riley says he's aware of the truckers ' protest plans but does n't think they will cause major traffic disruptions .
His officers will be on the lookout for problems , he says , including motorists who might get frustrated if truckers slow traffic .
" We just want to make sure that road rage is n't going to be a problem , " Riley says .
Pennsylvania State Police spokeswoman Linette Quinn says her department expects truckers to form a convoy along Interstate 81 this morning and converge on the Capitol in Harrisburg .
" If there is any need for additional response , we 'll make appropriate changes , " she says .
Kuzniar said his fuel costs more than doubled from $ 1,255 a week at the beginning of January to $ 2,684 last week .
" As fuel prices go up , so do delivery costs , " Kuzniar said .
" That gets passed on to the consumer . "
Dana Greenlaw , 40 , an independent driver from Ontario , Canada , said he plans to participate in the shutdown Tuesday .
" Out West , I 've been paying $ 4.20 a gallon .
In Canada , it 's already over $ 5 .
It 's not pretty , " Greenlaw said .
Independent drivers are being squeezed by the soaring price of fuel , said Norita Taylor , spokeswoman for the Grain Valley , Mo. - based Owner - Operator Independent Drivers Association , which has 160,000 members .
" They 're faced with the slow economy , there 's less freight than trucks , and then you have diesel prices jumping in a volatile manner over a short period of time , " Taylor said .
George Vincent , 44 , a driver from Monroe , Mich. , does n't support a trucker strike because he fears it will " throw the economy into a spiral . "
Vincent said he copes by spending more time on the road .
" I do n't know how some people are making it .
I have to work more to earn less . "

A COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
Washington policy in recent years has been to boycott and punish political factions or governments that refuse to accept United States mandates .
This policy makes difficult the possibility that such leaders might moderate their policies .
Two notable examples are in Nepal and the Middle East .
About 12 years ago , Maoist guerrillas took up arms in an effort to overthrow the monarchy and change the nation ’s political and social life .
Although the United States declared the revolutionaries to be terrorists , the Carter Center agreed to help mediate among the three major factions : the royal family , the old - line political parties and the Maoists .
In 2006 , six months after the oppressive monarch was stripped of his powers , a cease - fire was signed .
Maoist combatants laid down their arms and Nepalese troops agreed to remain in their barracks .
Our center continued its involvement and nations  though not the United States  and international organizations began working with all parties to reconcile the dispute and organize elections .
The Maoists are succeeding in achieving their major goals : abolishing the monarchy , establishing a democratic republic and ending discrimination against untouchables and others whose citizenship rights were historically abridged .
After a surprising victory in the April 10 election , Maoists will play a major role in writing a constitution and governing for about two years .
To the United States , they are still terrorists .
During the first years of the Clinton Administration in the early 1990s , there was much fanfare about a new policy to “ reinvent government . ”
It was sold as a way to make government more efficient and less costly .
It would , said its proponents , “ bring business technologies to public service . ”
Pro-business , anti-big government conservatives were intrigued .
The backbone of the plan was a call for “ public / private partnerships ” ( PPPs ) .
That sounded like their kind of program .
Government , they said , would finally tap the tremendous power of the entrepreneurial process and the force of the free market into making government more effective and efficient .
It sounded so revolutionary and so American .
Today that “ reinvention ” has evolved into the policy known as Sustainable Development and much of it has been embraced by the “ free - trade ” movement which advocates open borders , free trade zones and one - size fits all regulations and currencies and the use of public / private partnerships .
Many of the biggest proponents of the policy are conservative and libertarian think tanks .
The North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) was the first of the “ free trade ” policies to use the concept of public / private partnerships as a major tool to drive policy .
The program was sold simply as a means to expand markets for American industry and agriculture beyond U.S. borders into Canada and Mexico , thereby offering American business and workers “ better jobs , better wages and more exports . ”
However , NAFTA has brought about much more than unencumbered trade .
It is creating great change in the economic order of the nation .
NAFTA comes with its own tribunal overseers ; its own courts ; and its own set of rules — all of which can , in fact , override laws passed by local , state and federal government .
Such a policy is not “ free trade , ” rather it is a new government structure – reinvented , indeed .
Here is how Henry Kissinger described NAFTA in July , 1993 : “ It will represent the most creative step toward a new world order taken by any group of countries since the end of the Cold War , and the first step toward an even larger vision of a free - trade zone for the entire Western Hemisphere .
[ NAFTA ] is not a conventional trade agreement , but the architecture of a new international system . ”
NAFTA , under close examination seems to be little more than a redistribution of the wealth scheme .
Profiting from it are a few selected corporations which get wealthy in their elite partnerships with government while American jobs , industry and wealth get redistributed to third world nations .
Since 1994 , under NAFTA , the U.S. trade deficit has soared and now approaches $ 1 trillion per year .
The U.S. has lost some 1.5 million jobs and real wages in the U.S. have fallen significantly .
However , the concept continues to be highly touted by “ free traders ” as a success .
Thirteen years after its inception there are now more calls for similar programs to cover South America , Central America , Africa and Asia .
The Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) is designed to further enhance and strengthen the NAFTA concept over North America .
It is little understood by the general public how public / private partnerships can be used , not as a way to diminish the size of government , but in fact , to increase its power .
These bonds between government and private international corporations are a double — edged sword .
They come armed with government ’s power to tax , enforce policy or enforce eminent domain .
At the same time , the private corporations use their wealth and extensive advertising budgets to entrench the policy into our national conscience .
PPPs can be used by international corporations to get a leg up on their competition by entering into contracts with government to obtain favors such as tax breaks and store locations not available to their competition , thereby creating an elite class of connected businesses .
A private developer which has entered into a PPP with local government , for example , can now obtain the power of eminent domain to build on land not open to its competitors .
The government gains the higher taxes created by the new development .
The only ones to lose are the property owners .
Using PPPs , power companies can obtain rights of way over private land .
Private companies can obtain control of the nation ’s highway system or local community water supplies .
Of course , it ’s not just American companies entering into PPPs with governments .
Foreign companies are being met with open arms by local , state and federal officials who see a way to use private corporations to fund projects .
As the Associated Press reported July 15 , 2006 , “ On a single day in June ( 2006 ) an Australian - Spanish partnership paid $ 3.6 billion to lease the Indiana Toll Road .
An Australian company bought a 99 year lease on Virginia ’s Pocahontas Parkway , and Texas officials decided to let a Spanish - American partnership build and run a toll road from Austin to Seguin for 50 years . ”
In fact , that Spanish - American partnership in Texas is a company called Cintra and its lease with the Texas Department of Transportation to build and run the Trans Texas Corridor contains a “ no - compete ” clause which prohibits anyone , including the Texas government from building new highways or expanding exiting ones which might run in competition with the TCC .
That is not free enterprise .
With inside information from its PPP , Kansas City Southern Railroad ( KCSR ) has been able to grow overnight from a two bit belt around Kansas City to controlling a 2,600 - mile artery from Lazaro Cardenas to Kansas City , straight up the Trans Texas Corridor .
KCSR has obtained the exclusive rail rights up the corridor .
It is now a government - sanctioned monopoly .
That is not free enterprise .
At an April , 2007 meeting in Calgary , Canada , as part of the Security and Prosperity Partnership , government officials , business leaders and academics met to discuss redistributing Canada ’s water to Mexico and the U.S. Southwest .
Canada has water , lots of it , and the public / private partnerships of the SPP are swarming on it like locusts as they seek to drain it out of Canada ’s rivers and lakes and ship it to potential profit centers in the south .
The Trans Texas Corridor will provide water pipelines for the shipping and PPPs will buy up the rights and dispose of the water as they see fit .
Canadians are suddenly feeling the raw power of the lethal combination of government and private industry as they dictate policy .
The people of Canada now understand that they will have little say in the matter .
PPPs are one of the reasons many people find they can no longer fight city hall .
The private companies gain the power of government to do as they please – and the governments earn the independence of the companies no longer needing to answer to voters .
It ’s the perfect partnership .
Such a process allows the private companies to be little more than government - sanctioned monopolies , answerable to no one .
Their power is awesome and near absolute .
Some call such policy corporatism .
Another term would be corporate fascism .
What public / private partnerships are not , however , is capitalism or free enterprise , though it may have some of the trappings of such .
The marketplace is still there .
Its laws have not been repealed .
But ultimately , corporatism does not trust the marketplace to do what the elites want .
Thus the alignment of corporations and government is done at the expense of ordinary people – the exact opposite of free markets controlled by consumers
Democratic consultant Donna Brazile brought home America 's reluctance to talk openly about race in a New York Times article that preceded the Barack Obama speech that now has the whole nation buzzing .
In essence , she said in her quote , any serious discussion about race has the effect of clearing a room .
Brazile 's remark and the presidential hopeful 's groundbreaking speech about a subject that politicians generally tiptoe around in public hint at the complexities of race relations in America today .
As we approach the second decade of the 21st century , research shows that many Americans feel anxious during interracial interactions whether or not race is even mentioned .
Now a provocative new study from Northwestern University suggests that whites who are particularly worried about appearing racist seem to suffer from anxiety that instinctively may cause them to avoid interaction with blacks in the first place .
" The Threat of Appearing Prejudiced and Race - based Attentional Biases , " by Jennifer A. Richeson , associate professor of psychology and African - American studies and faculty fellow at the Institute for Policy Research ( IPR ) at Northwestern , and Sophie Trawalter , post - doctoral fellow , IPR , recently appeared in the journal Psychological Science .
Study participants indicated that they worry about inadvertently getting in trouble for somehow seeming biased .
As a result , the study suggests , they behaved in a way that research shows people respond when faced with stimuli that cause them to feel threatened or anxious : they instinctively look at what is making them feel nervous and then ignore it .
In this case , study participants , 15 white college students , indicated that they were motivated to respond in non-prejudiced ways toward blacks primarily for appearance 's sake because of concern about social disapproval -- rather than because of their internal values .
advertisement
They then took a standard psychological test that measures attention patterns related to anxiety provoking or threatening stimuli .
The white students initially focused on images of black faces with neutral expressions , relative to white faces with similar expressions , and then quickly disengaged and paid greater attention to the white faces .
Participants who were selected for the study first had to complete a Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice Scale .
Those who were selected had scores that indicated that they were externally , rather than internally , motivated to not appear racially biased .
On a one - to - nine scale , they rated their agreement with statements that included : " Because of today 's politically correct standards , I try to appear non-prejudiced toward black people . "
They then participated in a computer test that featured in all the trials a black face and a white face , with either similar neutral expressions or similar happy expressions .
Theoretically , they should n't have paid attention to either of the two faces , one black and one white , appearing on either side of the computer screen , because they were told to keep their attention fixated on a cross in the middle of the screen .
But , as expected , they inevitably turned their attention to the faces .
Because everything happened so fast , however , they were n't aware that they had paid different amounts of attention to black faces , compared to the white faces .
When a dot appeared on the computer screen where one of the faces had previously appeared , they had to quickly say whether it appeared on the right or the left side of the fixation point .
Finding the dot the fastest was an indication that attention had been directed to the face that had just disappeared from the position where the dot was displayed .
For the shorter trials ( 30 milliseconds ) with the neutral faces , study participants tended to find the dot quickly when it was located behind the black face , which tended to be the initial focus of attention .
advertisement
During the slightly longer trials ( 450 milliseconds ) , however , the dot - probe test indicated that they tended to quickly turn their attention away from the neutral black face to the white face with the same expression .
" Think of it as initially turning your attention to something that poses a threat or causes anxiety and then ignoring it because you do n't want to deal with it , " said Richeson .
" These low - level psychological processes happen dynamically , and our tests indicate that people probably avoided the neutral black faces because they provoke anxiety , not necessarily because of racial animus . "
Patterns of attentional biases were eliminated when the faces were smiling .
Well - established clinical and cognitive psychology research shows that people process expressions of emotion quickly , and presumably black male faces with smiling expressions did not seem threatening or provoke anxiety .
The article cites a similar study that tested how children with chronic pain responded to pain - relevant words .
In short trials , they tended to look at the pain - relevant words , and in the longer trials they avoided them .
Richeson 's study draws from a body of such clinical psychology research on threat and attention .
Basically , that research shows that people who have anxiety about various stimuli in everyday life tend to ignore what is stressing them out , unlike people with clinical anxiety , who tend to fixate on what triggers their anxiety .
Richeson stresses in every class she teaches on stereotyping and prejudice that a solution to a problem often presents another problem .
Ironically , her study suggests , standards to create a diverse yet harmonious society may unwittingly be encouraging anxious responses toward blacks .
" Norms and standards to achieve diversity are a great solution to undermining racial bias , " Richeson said .
" Our research suggests that we now also need to start thinking about creating opportunities to undermine anxieties about living up to those standards , to let people know they are going to be okay if they engage in interracial relationships . "
The rescue operation was called off overnight
Blast footage
They happened as specialists were dismantling obsolete munitions at the site , next to Gerdec village .
The blasts caused injuries and damage in a wide surrounding area , and were heard more than 170 km ( 100 miles ) away in the Macedonian capital Skopje .
Some 4,000 people were evacuated and it is feared the death toll could rise .
Rescuers have been unable to reach the main blast site as ammunition continues to detonate at the dump , many hours after the first blast .
Special army units have been deployed in armoured vehicles .
The rescue operation was halted after night fell , but is due to resume at daybreak on Sunday .
The problem of ammunition in Albania is one of the gravest , and a continuous threat
Prime Minister Sali Berisha
Hospitals have taken in injured people suffering burns , concussion , broken limbs and cuts from flying glass and shrapnel .
Juela Mecani , a spokeswoman for Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha , said a number of homes near the depot had been " completely destroyed " , and that the authorities had evacuated all neighbouring villages .
Rescuers had managed to find and save 25 residents who had hidden in a communist - era bunker when the explosions began , she added .
' Ten minutes to flee '
Police said the cause of the explosions was not immediately clear , but terrorism was not suspected .
Mr Berisha 's office quoted witnesses as saying the initial explosion was smaller than subsequent blasts , allowing many of the estimated 110 workers on the site to escape .
" Ten minutes passed before the biggest blast and many workers used this time to flee , " its statement said .
" The government is trying to identify all the workers , one by one , but the situation is difficult and the explosions continue . "
Mr Berisha , a heart specialist , promised an official inquiry into the accident after visiting victims in hospitals in Tirana .
" The problem of ammunition in Albania is one of the gravest , and a continuous threat , " Mr Berisha said .
" There is a colossal , crazy amount of it dating back to 1945 . "
Aid offered
The blasts smashed windows at Tirana 's nearby international airport , and prompted a brief suspension of flights .
The base was a central collection point for an arsenal amassed by Albania 's former communist dictatorship .
Albania has been offered international medical and other aid
Albania has about 100,000 tons of excess ammunition stored in former army depots across the country , according to Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu .
The military experts at the base where the blasts occurred were being assisted by employees of a US company contracted by Nato to help the Albanian army dispose of surplus munitions .
It is unclear whether Americans or other foreigners were among the victims .
The US embassy in Tirana said it was unable to confirm whether there were foreigners present at the dump .
Countries including the US , Italy , Greece , Macedonia , Turkey and Kosovo have offered medical and other aid to the Albanian authorities in the wake of the explosions .
I ’ve noticed that two topics seem to get more responses than anything else : Ron Paul and religion .
I ’m not ready for Part 2 of my RP tirade , so we ’ll go back to the latter .
It seems that whenever I write anything even moderately anti-religion , or even not at all anti-religion but rather anti-you - acting - like - a - jerk - about - your - religion , I get comments and email that either say I ’m a terrible person and that someone is praying for me , or I should leave America because America is a Christian nation .
How terrible I am is pretty debatable and I can’t really say these people are n’t praying for me ( though I suspect they are n’t ) , but I can say with absolute certainty that America is not a Christian nation .
Oh sure , it ’s citizenry is predominantly Christian and I can count on one hand the number of non-Judeo - Christians in Washington , but that just means that the American people are Christian .
That ’s obvious .
America itself , however , is not .
People have later attempted to turn it into one , I ’ll agree , but the United States of America is not founded on the Christian religion .
Myth : How can you say that ?
It totally is !
Fact :
No , it ’s not .
Washington said it himself in the Treaty of Tripoli , which was ratified by the Senate under then - president John Adams : “ the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion . ”
Unless you think this was a trick or a lie , in which case I ’m not sure what to tell you .
Myth : Right , but , what about the pledge ?
It says “ one nation under God ” !
Fact :
It did n’t always .
In fact it was n’t until the 1950s that the Knights of Columbus decided that “ under God ” should be a part of the pledge , and it was n’t until 1954 that the words were officially changed to include them .
For the first 62 years of its existence , there was no God in the pledge .
Myth : Okay , fine , but our money DEFINITELY says “ in god we trust ” .
It ’s the national motto , you ca n’t deny that !
Fact : I ca n’t deny that it ’s on our coins and bills or that it ’s the current national motto , but again this was n’t always the case .
The phrase did n’t start appearing on money until the Civil War , and it was n’t until the 1930s that the phrase was on money nationally .
As for our motto , up until 1956 it was e pluribus unum : from many , one .
Interesting that it was changed from a declaration of unity to one of separation .
Myth :
Well look on your calendar .
I do n’t see Darwin ’s birthday or Ramadan as federal holidays .
Christmas and Easter are , though !
Fact :
Once again , it is now but it did n’t used to be .
Christmas was n’t declared a federal holiday until 1870 .
For the first nearly 100 years of the republic the birth and resurrection of Jesus were not considered federal holidays .
Interestingly enough , prior to that , many Christians criticized it as the Bible never instructs followers to celebrate Christ ’s birth and found the holiday too commercialized .
So I suppose you could say that ’s why it was n’t designated a holiday initially , but that ’s pushing it .
Myth : Yeah , yeah , but the important thing is our LAWS .
They ’re based on Christian laws like the 10 Commandments !
Fact : I have a feeling that most people who make this claim have not read either the Constitution or the Bible .
Exodus 20:2 - 17 from whence the commandments come , numbering roughly 14 but varyingly grouped together to make it the more attractive 10 , outlines a whole lot of things , but few are actually in American lawbooks .
We have no laws against worshiping other gods , against graven images , mandating keeping the Sabbath holy , against coveting , legislating honoring your mother and father , or against adultery .
In the whole list , we only have laws about murdering , stealing , and bearing false witness , none of which are exactly unique to the Decalogue .
Myth : But God ’s in the Constitution !
Fact : Again , read the thing .
No he ’s not .
The only mentioning of any deity is “ their creator ” in the Declaration which was intentionally worded so as to refer to the ambiguous cause of our being rather than “ God ” ( basically saying “ we ’re born with them ” ) , and “ nature ’s god ” in the Constitution in a rather throwaway passage .
Aside from that , God is not anywhere to be found .
So if his laws are n’t used and he ’s never mentioned by name , I think the conclusion is obvious .
Myth :
No , I mean the founders were Christians , so whatever they wrote was inspired by God !
Fact :
This is a big ol ’ can of worms , but no matter how you slice it the majority of the men who founded this nation were at least deists , if not agnostics and a few atheists .
Washington may have gone to church periodically , but he was n’t exactly devout and hardly talked of his beliefs .
Jefferson was particularly harsh against Christianity , as were others such as Adams and Franklin .
Additionally they took much of their inspiration from secularists philosophers , not the devout .
Myth :
That ’s BS left - wing propaganda !
They WERE Christians !
Fact :
You know what ?
Let ’s say you ’re right .
Every one was a Christian .
That does n’t negate their obvious efforts to keep Christianity out of the nation ’s formation .
God is not mentioned and the laws are not built around Christian principles .
There are laws which coincide with those of Christianity , but generally only in cases where they also coincide with every other major religion ( they all have anti-murder and anti- theft laws , for example ) .
The founding fathers went out of their way to keep America secular , allowing all to practice as they want with neither the government interfering in worship or worship interfering in government .
Myth : Shut up , the 1st Amendment was to keep government out of church , not church out of government !
Fact :
That ’s semantical flim - flam at best and you know it .
Keeping the government out of the church is the same as keeping the church out of government .
Myth : Nuh-uh !
Fact : Yuh - huh .
Let ’s say Church A has a law that Church B does not .
The government cannot enact Church A’s law because that would be encroaching upon Church B ’s freedom of worship .
Thus in order to protect Church B , Church A ’s law can not be put on the books .
The only way to keep the government out of religion is to keep religion out of government .
It ’s a wall between them , as Jefferson wrote , not a one - way tunnel .
Myth :
But that would mean that no laws could be made that disagree with any religion , so we ’d have no laws at all !
Fact : Not quite .
It means the laws must be made independently of religion .
You do n’t have to be a Bible - thumper to know murder and slavery are wrong , for example ( although it was largely the religious who fought against civil rights advancements … ) , and as long as a law is made for secular reasons it is not “ an establishment of religion ” .
That ’s why sodomy laws had to go but perjury ’s still around , or why there are laws against stealing but not saying God ’s name in vain .
Myth : Right … but … hgnkgnl …
Fact : I thought so .
So you see , this is not a country founded upon the Bible and its teachings , and the nation ’s founders would likely be mighty peeved to hear of George Bush saying God chose him to be president and hearing of the massive influence the likes of James Dobson have over public policy .
If anyone out there would like to continue trying to prove me wrong , go for it .
I ’ve got no problems making this little Q&A session longer .
( I ’m a girl , and I work in a video game store . )
Dude : “ Are you guys hiring ? ”
Me : “ No , we just let some people go actually . ”
Dude : “ Oh , I assumed they were desperate .
I mean , they hired a girl . ”
Me : “ I ’ve worked here for three years . ”
Dude : “ Oh , well can I ask the manager anyway ? ”
Me : “ Sure , he ’s standing right over there . ” * points to next register *
Manager : “ Do n’t even ask .
You just insulted my assistant manager . ”
ABSTRACT
Immigration has become highly significant to the UK economy : immigrants comprise 12 % of the total workforce and a much higher proportion in London .
However , we have found no evidence for the argument , made by the Government , business and many others , that net immigration immigration minus emigration generates significant economic benefits for the existing UK population .
Overall GDP , which the Government has persistently emphasised , is an irrelevant and misleading criterion for assessing the economic impacts of immigration on the UK .
The total size of an economy is not an index of prosperity .
The focus of analysis should rather be on the effects of immigration on income per head of the resident population .
Both theory and the available empirical evidence indicate that these effects are small , especially in the long run when the economy fully adjusts to the increased supply of labour .
In the long run , the main economic effect of immigration is to enlarge the economy , with relatively small costs and benefits for the incomes of the resident population .
The economic impacts of immigration depend critically on the skills of immigrants .
Different types of immigrant can have very different impacts on the economy .
The issue is not whether immigration is needed but what level and type of immigration is desirable .
In this context , net immigration from the EU  which we expect to remain positive cannot be controlled .
The question then is whether additional immigration from elsewhere carries benefits or disadvantages .
Many businesses and public services at present make use of the skills and hard work of immigrants .
But this is not an argument for immigration on a scale which exceeds emigration and thus increases the population of the country .
We do not support the general claims that net immigration is indispensable to fill labour and skills shortages .
Such claims are analytically weak and provide insufficient reason for promoting net immigration .
Vacancies are , to a certain extent , a sign of a healthy economy .
Immigration increases the size of the economy and overall labour demand , thus creating new vacancies .
As a result , immigration is unlikely to be an effective tool for reducing vacancies other than in the short term .
We also question the Government 's claim that immigration has generated fiscal benefits .
Estimates of the fiscal impacts are critically dependent on who counts as an immigrant ( or as a descendant of an immigrant ) and on what items to include under costs and benefits .
The overall fiscal impact of immigration is likely to be small , though this masks significant variations across different immigrant groups .
Rising population density has potentially important economic consequences for the resident population , including impacts on housing , as well as wider welfare effects , especially in parts of England where immigrants are most concentrated .
Although immigration is only one of a number of factors affecting the demand for housing , it does exert a significant impact on the housing market in particular areas .
Some of the wider impacts from rising population are hard to measure and highly regional .
Some , such as the impact of increasing population density on the cost and speed of implementation of public infrastructure projects , remain poorly understood .
Arguments in favour of high immigration to defuse the " pensions time bomb " do not stand up to scrutiny as they are based on the unreasonable assumption of a static retirement age as people live longer and ignore the fact that , in time , immigrants too will grow old and draw pensions .
Increasing the retirement age , as the Government has done , is the only viable approach to resolving this issue .
There are significant unknowns and uncertainties in the existing data on immigration and immigrants in the UK .
There are insufficient data about people leaving the UK and about short - term immigration to the UK .
Existing data do not allow for accurate measurement of the stock of immigrants at national , regional and local levels .
Inevitably , even less is known about the scale of illegal immigration and illegal employment of immigrants .
The gaps in migration data create significant difficulties for the analysis and public debate of immigration , the conduct of monetary policy , the provision of public services and a wide range of other public policies .
Our overall conclusion is that the economic benefits to the resident population of net immigration are small , especially in the long run .
Of course , many immigrants make a valuable contribution to the UK .
But the real issue is how much net immigration is desirable .
Here non-economic considerations such as impacts on cultural diversity and social cohesion will be important , but these are outside the scope of our inquiry .
Against this background , we have identified the following priorities for Government action .
The Government should :
improve radically the present entirely inadequate migration statistics ;
review its immigration policies and then explain , on the basis of firm evidence on the economic and other impacts , the reasons for and objectives of the policies , and how they relate to other policy objectives such as improving the skills of the domestic workforce ;
better enforce the minimum wage and other statutory employment conditions , with effective action taken against employers who illegally employ immigrants or who provide employment terms which do not meet minimum standards ;
clarify the objectives and implications of the new , partially points - based immigration system .
It is far from clear that the new arrangements will in fact constitute the radical overhaul of the present system suggested by the Government ;
monitor immigration by publishing periodic Immigration Reports giving details of the numbers and characteristics of non-EEA nationals entering the UK under each Tier of the new system ;
give further consideration to which channels of immigration should lead to settlement and citizenship and which ones should be strictly temporary ;
review the implications of its projection that overall net immigration in future years will be around 190,000 people .
The Government should have an explicit and reasoned indicative target range for net immigration and adjust its immigration policies in line with that broad objective .

The bank may write down as much as $ 12 billion from the value of fixed - income assets in the first quarter , cutting earnings per share 63 percent to 15 cents from a prior estimate of 40 cents .
Citigroup Inc. , the biggest U.S. bank by assets , may post its second - straight quarterly loss and fall short of profit estimates for the year because of writedowns on home - equity loans and junk - grade corporate loans , Oppenheimer & Co. ’s Meredith Whitney said .
Whitney , whose downgrade of Citigroup last year triggered an 8 percent decline in the company ’s stock price , said the bank may report a loss of $ 1.6 billion , or 28 cents a share , for the first quarter , compared with a profit of about $ 5 billion , or $ 1.01 , a year earlier .
Her prediction today compares with the 45 - cent per - share average gain expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst William Tanona said Citigroup may have to take a writedown of as much as $ 12 billion .
The rate of loan losses is “ grossly underestimated by consensus estimates ” at Citigroup and other U.S. banks , Whitney wrote .
“ Core fundamentals are rapidly deteriorating . ”
She cut her per-share prediction for 2008 earnings by more than 70 percent to 75 cents .
The New York - based company ’s shares could fall more than 36 percent to less than $ 16 , she wrote .
Citigroup fell 38 cents , or 1.5 percent , to $ 24.74 at 4:10 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
The shares have declined about 16 percent this year .

McCain tells
Fox reports of temper are ' false or exaggerated ' Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday April 9 , 2008

Print This Email This Conservative net ignores spat with wife in interview Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) for the first time has personally addressed some of the more explosive allegations in a new book on him , although his Fox News interviewer did not see fit to ask about his the vulgarity he allegedly flung at his wife during a Senate campaign .
Speaking to Fox 's Megyn Kelly Wednesday , McCain said reports of his explosive temper were " false or exaggerated , " and he denied that punches were thrown during a meeting with fellow Arizona Republican Rep. Rick Renzi .
" No , in fact there were witnesses every time I have been around , " McCain said .
" The congressman is a good friend of mine , and we have a good relationship .
...
Those reports are either false or exaggerated . "
Kelly also had asked about McCain 's reported " profanity laced exchanges with other lawmakers , " but she made no mention of perhaps the most vulgar alleged exchange , in which McCain called his wife a " trollop " and a " cunt " during a 1992 campaign stop .
Those reports all come from a new book , The Real McCain by Cliff Scheter .
RAW STORY first reported McCain 's tirade toward his wife Monday .
As he has in the past when questioned about his hot - headedness , McCain tried to turn his anger into a positive , and he railed against corruption in Washington .
" I have gotten angry when I see ... things like in the Abramoff scandal , which I investigated , which ended up with people in federal prison , " he said .
" I get angry when I see these cost overruns and the waste of taxpayers ' dollars , and earmark and pork - barrel spending .
And if I lose the capacity to be angry , then I do n't think I should be president . "
Lacking a follow - up , Kelly turned to asking the Republican president about The McCain Girls .
" I know one thing that will likely not make you angry , " Kelly said , turning the discussion to the three pro-McCain crooners who have posted videos to YouTube .
" I think it 's wonderful , " McCain said .
" I have watched the video several times . "
This video is from Fox 's American Newsroom , broadcast April 9 , 2008 .

Zimbabwe is a deeply religious country .
Daily discussions of the country 's crisis end with Zimbabweans , black and white , saying : " We can only pray . "
So when the leaders of Zimbabwe 's churches unanimously warn that the country faces " genocide " unless the international community intervenes , it is an important moment .
The clerics were speaking more than three weeks after a presidential election whose result President Robert Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party refuse to disclose , almost certainly because he was soundly defeated by Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
A recount of 23 parliamentary seats is under way in an apparent attempt to restore Zanu - PF 's lost majority , and a wave of violence and intimidation has swept the country ahead of any possible presidential run-off .
" Organised violence perpetrated against individuals , families and communities who are accused of campaigning or voting for the ' wrong ' political party ... has been unleashed throughout the country , " said a joint statement by the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe , the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops ' Conference and the Zimbabwe Council of Churches .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" People are being abducted , tortured , humiliated by being asked to repeat slogans of the political party they are alleged not to support , ordered to attend mass meetings where they are told they voted for the ' wrong ' candidate . "
The religious leaders call for voter intimidation to stop , adding that there is " widespread famine " in the countryside , that basic goods are unavailable or too expensive and that there are no medicines to treat people injured in the post-election violence .
But their message to the international community is an uncomfortable reminder of previous occasions on which the world failed to act in time .
" If nothing is done to help the people of Zimbabwe from their predicament , we shall soon be witnessing genocide similar to that experienced in Kenya , Rwanda , Burundi and other hot spots in Africa and elsewhere , " they warn .
" We appeal to the Southern African Development Community [ SADC ] , the African Union and the United Nations to work towards arresting the deteriorating political and security situation in Zimbabwe . "
This directly confronts the issue of what other countries can , or should , do to prevent abuses of the kind happening in Zimbabwe .
Britain is in a particularly difficult position : Mr Mugabe has cast Mr Tsvangirai as a puppet of the former colonial power , and British criticism can be seen as making the 84 - year - old autocrat 's case .
But Gordon Brown and now the Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , who called on African leaders this week to isolate Mr Mugabe , have clearly decided that tactful silence is no longer an option when the Zimbabwean leader , in the Foreign Secretary 's words , is " clinging to power and beating his own people to death to ensure he retains it " .
There is very little that Britain , its European partners , the UN or even the African Union can do about Zimbabwe if its neighbours are not prepared to act , but here there is at last some hope for Mr Mugabe 's battered opponents .
The feeble response of SADC at a summit called 10 days ago by Levy Mwanawasa , Zambia 's President , caused outrage among the more democratic of its 14 member countries , particularly in South Africa , where the " quiet diplomacy " of the designated mediator , President Thabo Mbeki , came to be seen as simple appeasement of Mr Mugabe .

The rising tide of discontent at the region 's failure found its bluntest expression yesterday when Jacob Zuma , the man who ousted Mr Mbeki as president of the African National Congress , said Africa must send a mission to Zimbabwe to end the delay in issuing election results .
" It 's not acceptable , " said Mr Zuma , who is favourite to succeed Mr Mbeki as South African president next year .
" It 's not helping the Zimbabwean people who have gone out to ... elect the kind of party and presidential candidate they want , exercising their constitutional right . "
Mr Zuma , who is visiting European countries and is due to meet Mr Brown in London today , was the first to express public dissatisfaction with President Mbeki 's approach , drawing support from many sections of the ANC .
Eventually , Mr Mbeki himself was forced to acknowledge the inaccuracy of his statement in Harare the weekend before last , while holding Mr Mugabe 's hand , that there was " no crisis " in Zimbabwe .
Breaking southern Africa 's conspiracy of silence over Zimbabwe has now had a tangible effect : yesterday Beijing said a shipment of weapons bound for the landlocked country may head home after the vessel was turned away from one port after another .
First South African dockers refused to unload the vessel , upon which it headed for Mozambique , then Angola .
There are tentative signs that Zimbabwe 's neighbours , many of whom have absorbed millions of economic migrants due to the ongoing crisis , may have run out of patience with the erstwhile liberator in Harare .
Mr Mwanawasa yesterday called on all African countries to follow suit and refuse entry to the arms .
It seems that even those of Mr Mugabe 's neighbours who regard his oppression as none of their business , or possibly even praiseworthy , could not quite stomach the idea of sending him bullets and grenades for use on his own people .
The Rhodesian leader Ian Smith knew he was finished when South Africa pulled the plug on him , and while no one expects Mr Mbeki to do the same to Mr Mugabe , there is much that pressure groups in South Africa can do to squeeze the regime in Harare , which is more fragile than it seems to the country 's desperate opposition .
If Mr Mugabe is open to reason , he might realise it would be better to do a deal before Mr Zuma takes over as leader of his powerful southern neighbour .
What happens next ?
HAND -WRINGING
For
Everyone except Thabo Mbeki agrees something must be done to get rid of the Mugabe regime , but there is no clear strategy yet as all approaches have been rejected .
The international community needs to consult before taking a rash decision that could backfire .
Against
This crisis has been going on since Mugabe rigged the elections in 2000 .
How many more million Zimbabweans will be forced out of the country or beaten up by Mugabe 's so - called war veterans before the international community takes a stand ?
Handwringing brings nothing but shame on countries which have stood by while other African dictators have ignored the will of their people .
How likely ?
9/10
NEGOTIATIONS
For
Mugabe 's henchmen need more gentle persuasion to ditch their leader in favour of a negotiated solution which would allow them to keep their corruptly obtained wealth .
Southern African leaders need to make Mugabe and his allies aware that the game is up .
Against
Mugabe should not be allowed to get off scot free but should pay the penalty for his crimes against hispeople , preferably in court .
There can be nocompromise with members of a regime who have been tainted by their association with Mugabe , who has deliberately isolated himself from the rest of the world .
How likely ?
6/10
SANCTIONS
For
A travel ban in the European Union and United States and an assets freeze is already hurting Mugabe and 130 of his cronies , and tougher sanctions could be put in place .
An EU arms embargo has also been in place since 2002 .
The existing sanctions could be tightened in order to be more effective , and should not have get - out clauses .
Against
Existing sanctions are a joke and have been waived at every opportunity , allowing Mugabe to thumb his nose at the international community .
Broader economic sanctions would hurt the Zimbabwean people .
And Mugabe has turned to China for weapons .
How likely ?
4/10
INVASION
For
Even the Pope highlighted the UN principle of " responsibility to protect " , providing for collective action against states which refuse to protect their citizens from human rights abuses .
If UN Security Council authorisation cannot be obtained , a coalition of the willing should go in to save the Zimbabwean people from catastrophe .
Against
South Africa , with a seat on the UN Security Council , will ensure no UN action is ordered to unseat Mugabe by force .
The Iraq invasion proved military action can produce unintended consequences .
How likely ?

( Fortune Magazine ) --
What in the world is going on here ?
Why is Washington spending billions to bail out Wall Street titans while leaving struggling homeowners to fend for themselves ?
Why are the Federal Reserve and the Treasury acting as if they 're afraid the world may come to an end , while the stock market seems much less concerned ?
And finally , what does all this mean to those of us who are n't financial professionals ?
Okay , take a few breaths , pour yourself a beverage of your choice , and I 'll tell you what 's happening - and what I think is going to happen .
Although I expect these problems will resolve themselves without a catastrophic meltdown , I 'll also tell you why I 'm more nervous about the world financial system now than I 've ever been in my 40 years of covering business and markets .
Finally , I 'll tell you why I fear that the Wall Street enablers of the biggest financial mess of my lifetime will escape with relatively light damage , leaving the rest of us - and our children and grandchildren - to pay for their misdeeds .
We 're suffering the aftereffects of the collapse of a Tinker Bell financial market , one that depended heavily on borrowed money that has now vanished like pixie dust .
Like Tink , the famous fairy from Peter Pan , this market could exist only as long as everyone agreed to believe in it .
So because it was convenient - and oh , so profitable !
- players embraced fantasies like U.S. house prices never falling and cheap short - term money always being available .
They created , bought , and sold , for huge profits , securities that almost no one understood .
And they goosed their returns by borrowing vast amounts of money .
The first shoe
The fantasies began to fade last June when Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) let two of its hedge funds collapse because of mortgage - backed - securities problems .
Debt market - both here and abroad - went sour big - time .
That , in turn , became a huge drag on the U.S. economy , bringing on the current economic slowdown .
And before you ask :
It 's irrelevant whether or not we 're in a recession , which National Bureau of Economic Research experts define as " a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months . "
What matters is that we 're in a dangerous and messy situation that has produced an economic slowdown unlike those we 're used to seeing .
How is this slowdown different from other slowdowns ?
Normally the economy goes bad first , creating financial problems .
In this slowdown the markets are dragging down the economy - a crucial distinction , because markets are harder to fix than the economy .
A leading political economist , Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon , calls it " an unusual situation , but not unprecedented . "
When was the last time it happened in the U.S. ?
" In 1929 , " he says .
And it touched off the Great Depression .
No , Meltzer is n't saying that a Great Depression - 25 % unemployment , social unrest , mass hunger , millions of people 's savings wiped out in bank collapses - is upon us .
Nor , for that matter , am I .
But the precedent is unsettling , to say the least .
You can only imagine how unsettling it is to Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke , a former economics professor who made his academic bones writing about the Great Depression .
Academics now feel that the 1929 slowdown morphed into a Great Depression in large part because the Fed tightened credit rather than loosening it .
With that precedent in mind , you can see why Bernanke 's Fed is cutting rates rapidly and throwing everything but the kitchen sink at today 's problems .
( Bernanke will probably throw that in too , if the Fed 's plumbers can unbolt it . )
None of this Alan Greenspan ( remember him ? ) quarter - point - at - a - time stuff for him .
Fear is the culprit
So why has n't the cure worked ?
The problem is that vital markets that most people never see - the constant borrowing and lending and trading among huge institutions - have been paralyzed by losses , fear , and uncertainty .
And you can't get rid of losses , fear , and uncertainty by cutting rates .
Giant institutions are , to use the technical term , scared to death .
They 've had to come back time after time and report additional losses on their securities holdings after telling the market that they had cleaned everything up .
It 's whack - a- mole finance - the problems keep appearing in unexpected places .
Since the Tink market began tanking , so many shoes have dropped that it looks like Imelda Marcos 's closet .
We 've had problems with mortgage - backed securities , collateralized debt obligations , collateralized loan obligations , financial insurers , structured investment vehicles , asset - backed commercial paper , auction rate securities , liquidity puts .
By the time you read this , something else - my bet 's on credit default swaps - may have become the disaster du jour .
To paraphrase what a top Fednik told me in a moment of candor last fall :
You realize that you do n't know what 's in your own portfolio , so how can you know what 's in the portfolio of people who want to borrow from you ?
Combine that with the fact that big firms are short of capital because of their losses ( some of which have to do with accounting rules I wo n't inflict on you today ) and that they 're afraid of not being able to borrow enough short - term money to fund their obligations , and you can see why credit has dried up .
The fear - a justifiable one - is that if one big financial firm fails , it will lead to cascading failures throughout the world .
Big firms are so interlinked with one another and with other market players that the failure of one large counterparty , as they 're called , can drag down counterparties all over the globe .
And if the counterparties fail , it could drag down the counterparties ' counterparties , and so on .
Meltdown City .
The long - term view
In 1998 the Fed orchestrated a bailout of the Long - Term Capital Management hedge fund because it had $ 1.25 trillion in transactions with other institutions .
These days that 's almost small beer , because Wall Street has created a parallel banking system in which hedge funds , investment banks , and other essentially unregulated entities took over much of what regulated commercial banks used to do .
But there 's a vital difference .
Conventional banks have reason to take something of a long - term view : Mess up and you have no reputation , no bank , no job , no one talking to you at the country club .
In the parallel system a different ethos prevails .
If you take big , even reckless , bets and win , you have a great year and you get a great bonus - or in the case of hedge funds , 20 % of the profits .
If you lose money the following year , you lose your investors ' money rather than your own - and you do n't have to give back last year 's bonus .
Heads , you win ; tails , you lose someone else 's money .
Bernanke and his point man on Wall Street , New York Fed president Tim Geithner , know everything I 've said , of course .
As does Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , former head of Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) .
They know a lot more too - such as which specific institutions are running out of the ability to borrow and have huge obligations they need to refinance day in and day out .
Walk by Fed facilities in New York City or Washington , and you can feel the fear emanating from the building .
Because these are n't normal times , the Fed has tried to reassure the markets by inventing three new ways to inundate the financial system with staggering amounts of short - term money .
This is in addition to the Fed 's existing mechanisms , which are vast .
ANTHONY , Texas ( CNN ) --
Texas may be best known for " Big Oil . "
But the oil that could some day make a dent in the country 's use of fossil fuels is small .
Microscopic , in fact : algae .
Literally and figuratively , this is green fuel .
Plant physiologist Glen Kertz believes algae can some day be competitive as a source for biofuel .
" Algae is the ultimate in renewable energy , " Glen Kertz , president and CEO of Valcent Products , told CNN while conducting a tour of his algae greenhouse on the outskirts of El Paso .
Kertz , a plant physiologist and entrepreneur , holds about 20 patents .
And he is psyched about the potential algae holds , both as an energy source and as a way to deal with global warming .
" We are a giant solar collecting system .
We get the bulk of our energy from the sunshine , " said Kertz .
Algae are among the fastest growing plants in the world , and about 50 percent of their weight is oil .
That lipid oil can be used to make biodiesel for cars , trucks , and airplanes .
Watch how pond scum can be turned into fuel »
Most people know algae as " pond scum . "
And until recently , most energy research and development projects used ponds to grow it .
But instead of ponds , Valcent uses a closed , vertical system , growing the algae in long rows of moving plastic bags .
The patented system is called Vertigro , a joint venture with Canadian alternative energy company Global Green Solutions .
The companies have invested about $ 5 million in the Texas facility .
" A pond has a limited amount of surface area for solar absorption , " said Kertz .
" By going vertical , you can get a lot more surface area to expose cells to the sunlight .
It keeps the algae hanging in the sunlight just long enough to pick up the solar energy they need to produce , to go through photosynthesis , " he said .
Kertz said he can produce about 100,000 gallons of algae oil a year per acre , compared to about 30 gallons per acre from corn ; 50 gallons from soybeans .
Using algae as an alternative fuel is not a new idea .
The U.S. Department of Energy studied it for about 18 years , from 1978 to 1996 .
But according to Al Darzins of the DOE's National Renewable Energy Lab , in 1996 the feds decided that algae oil could never compete economically with fossil fuels .
The price of a barrel of oil in 1996 ?
About 20 bucks !
Government scientists experimented with algae in open ponds in California , Hawaii , and in Roswell , New Mexico .
But that involved a lot of land area , with inherent problems of evaporation and contamination from other plant species and various flying and swimming critters .
Darzins said NREL switched from algae research to focus on cellulosic ethanol .
That 's ethanol made from plants like switchgrass and plant stover -- the leaves and stalks left after a harvest -- but not edible crops such as corn and soybeans .
Valcent research scientist Aga Pinowska said there are about 65,000 known algae species , with perhaps hundreds of thousands more still to be identified .
A big part of the research at the west Texas facility involves determining what type of algae produces what type of fuel .
One species may be best suited for jet fuel , while the oil content of another may be more efficient for truck diesel .
In the Vertigro lab , Pinowska studies the care and feeding of algae for just such specifics .
She said even small changes in the nutrients that certain algae get can help create a more efficient oil content .
And she said a knowledge of algae 's virtues goes way back .
" Even the Aztecs knew it was beneficial ; they used it as a high protein food , " said Pinowska .
The other common commercial use of algae today is as a health food drink , usually sold as " Spirulina . "
I 'm too sexy for my pond
And who knew that single celled plants could be such " hotties " when it comes to sex ?
Kertz said it 's a real " algae orgy " under the microscope .
Some algae reproduce sexually , some asexually , while many combine both modes .
In some green algae the type of reproduction may be altered if there are changes in environmental conditions , such as lack of moisture or nutrients .
Intriguing details like that keep Kertz and other scientists searching for more and different algae .
While dusty west Texas may not be the best hunting grounds , he said he is always on the lookout for samples in puddles , streams or ponds .
Locating algae processing plants intelligently can add to their efficiency .
Locating algae facilities next to carbon producing power plants , or manufacturing plants , for instance , the plants could sequester the C02 they create and use those emissions to help grow the algae , which need the C02 for photosynthesis .
And after more than a decade hiatus , the U.S. government is back in the algae game .
The 2007 Energy Security and Independence Act includes language promoting the use of algae for biofuels .
From the Pentagon to Minnesota to New Zealand , both governments and private companies are exploring the use of algae to produce fuel .
But Al Darzins of the National Renewable Energy Lab said the world is still probably 5 to 10 years away from any substantial use of biofuels .
" There 's not any one system that anyone has chosen yet .
Whatever it is has to be dirt , dirt cheap , " said Darzins .

Senator Levin ’s amendment called for United Nations approval before force could be authorized .
It was unambiguous and compatible with international law .
Acutely cognizant of the dangers of the time , and the reality that diplomatic options could at some point be exhausted , Senator Levin wrote an amendment that was nimble : it affirmed that Congress would stand at the ready to reconsider the use of force if , in the judgment of the president , a United Nations resolution was not “ promptly adopted ” or enforced .
Ceding no rights or sovereignty to an international body , the amendment explicitly avowed America ’s right to defend itself if threatened .
An opponent of the Levin amendment said that the debate was not over objectives , but tactics .
And he was right .
To a senator , we all had as our objectives the safety of American citizens , the security of our country and the disarming of Saddam Hussein in compliance with United Nations resolutions .
But there was a steadfast core of us who believed that the tactics should be diplomacy and multilateralism , not the “ go it alone ” approach of the Bush doctrine .
Those of us who supported the Levin amendment argued against a rush to war .
We asserted that the Iraqi regime , though undeniably heinous , did not constitute an imminent threat to United States security , and that our campaign to renew weapons inspections in Iraq — whether by force or diplomacy — would succeed only if we enlisted a broad coalition that included Arab states .
We also urged our colleagues to take seriously the admonitions of our allies in the region — Egypt , Jordan , Kuwait , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and Turkey .
As King Abdullah of Jordan warned , “ A miscalculation in Iraq would throw the whole area into turmoil . ”
Unfortunately , these arguments fell on deaf ears in that emotionally charged , hawkish , post - 9/11 moment , less than four weeks before a midterm election .
The Levin amendment was defeated by a 75 to 24 vote .
Later that night , the Iraq War Resolution was approved , 77 to 23 .
It was clear that most senators were immune to persuasion because the two votes were almost mirror images of each other — no to the Levin amendment , aye to war .
Their minds were made up .
A person within the Clinton campaign said Sunday that Mrs. Clinton was “ disappointed ” that Mr. Penn had taken on Colombia as a client and had met with Colombian officials to advise them on how to win passage of a pact she has publicly denounced .
Mrs. Clinton was said to be furious when she learned that he was employed by and consulting with the Colombians on the trade treaty .
Mr. Penn apologized Friday and said the meeting had been a mistake .
The Colombians , offended by what they called an insult from a hired lobbyist and spokesman , fired him and Burson - Marsteller on Saturday .
The Clinton campaign aide said Mr. Penn concluded over the weekend that he had to step aside as chief strategist to avoid further embarrassment to Mrs. Clinton .
She did not try to talk him out of it , but the aide said Mrs. Clinton did not dismiss him outright .
“ He will continue to provide polling and advice as part of the team , ” the Clinton aide said .
Mr. Penn is deeply unpopular among Mrs. Clinton ’s most loyal aides because of his reputation as a self - promoter , his refusal to accept responsibility for the campaign ’s setbacks and because he has refused to sever his ties to Burson - Marsteller .
He has engaged in a number of widely reported conflicts with other top aides , particularly Mandy Grunwald , a longtime and extremely loyal advertising expert who has advised both Clintons since Mr. Clinton ’s 1992 presidential campaign .
Mr. Penn has also disavowed any responsibility for the campaign ’s blunders and its poor performance in the Feb .
5 Super Tuesday contests , in which Mrs. Clinton lost the presumed inevitability of her nomination .
In an interview with The Los Angeles Times , he said he had nothing to do with the campaign ’s day - to - day message and was chiefly a pollster .
That infuriated other aides who welcomed his demotion on Sunday , according to campaign officials .
Among Mr. Penn ’s other public relations clients was Countrywide Financial , the nation ’s largest home mortgage lender , which operates in an industry that Mrs. Clinton has criticized .
Burson - Marsteller has also provided public relations advice to Blackwater Worldwide , the private security firm under investigation by numerous government agencies for the deaths of civilians in Iraq .
Marine biologists believe seahorses could be breeding in the UK ’s River Thames as the water becomes cleaner .
About five short - snouted seahorses ( Hippocampus hippocampus ) have been spotted during routine conservation surveys over the last year or so , leading scientists to think they have probably established a resident population .
The news has been kept secret until now because the seahorse has not been protected by law .
But beginning on Monday , the marine creature and its environment will have protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 .
The seahorse has been spotted near Dagenham , Tilbury and Southend .
It is thought to be mainly a salt water creature , usually found in shallow muddy waters , estuaries or seagrass beds , so it is not clear how far up the Thames it will go .

But the Zoological Society of London , which released its findings , said the discoveries suggested that the Thames was becoming cleaner .
“ It demonstrates that the Thames is becoming a sustainable , bio - diverse habitat for aquatic life , ” said Alison Shaw , manager of the Society ’s marine and freshwater conservation programme .
“ It is not clear how endangered short - snouted seahorses are because there is little data known , particularly in the UK , so every scrap of information is valuable , ” she said .
There are signs that the seahorse is breeding on the south coast , too .
Other creatures protected by the Act from Monday include the water vole , angel shark , Roman snail and long - snouted seahorse .

7:20 pm I 'm happy to report that we now have pictures from the spacecraft , downlinked through Mars Odyssey .
The pictures are what we refer to as " postcards . "
They 're black and white pictures meant primarily to tell whether our deployments successfully occurred .
From what we can see , the solar arrays have successfully deployed as well as the Surface Stereo Imager and Biobarrier .
The pictures also show a beautiful Martian landscape of which I personally can't wait to see color panoramas in the days to come .
Even in black and white , the pictures gave everyone in the room cause to break into cheers and gaze in awe and amazement at a landscape that suggests we simply dropped in on another peaceful day on Mars .
Needless to say , these pictures will be shown at the press conference that will take place at 9:00 pm ( PST ) tonight .
This will conclude the Approach and EDL blog .
This has been a wonderful opportunity and experience .
On behalf of my fellow bloggers Leslie Tamppari and Deborah Bass , and the whole Phoenix team , I 'd like to thank everyone for all their comments and wishes .
The excitement that everyone has for what we do at JPL is part of what makes our jobs so exciting .
I apologize to anyone whose questions I could n't get to .
Please be sure to continue to watch the websites listed at the bottom of the blog , where you 'll be able to find more images and updates on the mission as we continue our exploration of the arctic plains of Mars for the next several months .
Thanks again to all !

Now that things have settled down a bit , I 'd like to answer a few more questions .
On reader asked a question about the temperature of the ground .
At night we expect this temperature to be as low as 196 degrees Kelvin ( - 106 degrees Fahrenheit ) and as much as 256 degrees Kelvin ( 1.13 degrees Fahrenheit ) during the day .
Another reader was asking whether it 's normal that we only had communication with Odyssey until one minute after touchdown .
This is by design .
We turn off our radio at one minute after touchdown .
This is in order to conserve our energy .
At this point , we have n't yet confirmed that our solar arrays are deployed .
Therefore we only keep the spacecraft awake long enough to do those deployments , after which it goes to sleep for a while until the next pass by Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
This brings me to another question regarding whether Phoenix can communicate directly to Earth .
The answer to this question is no .
Phoenix communicates to the Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft which then communicate with Earth .
Their orbits , however , allow at least two passes per Sol ( a Martian day ) .
We use one for uplink and the other for downlink .
Although an antenna at Green Bank , West Virginia listened for our UHF signal during EDL , it can only pick up a faint carrier signal .
It ca n't discern any data .
Consequently , we communicate with Phoenix only through Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance orbiters .
Another reader asks what platform we use on our computers here in Mission Control .
The computers that display data coming from the Deep Space Network use custom displays operating on Unix machines .
Of course I realize that everyone reading is just as anxious to see pictures from the surface of Mars as I am .
Odyssey will begin its first pass over Phoenix at about 6:43 pm ( PST ) .
We may have pictures as soon as 40 minutes from then .
If we have them , they 'll be posted to the internet as fast as possible , and also be shown at the 9:00 pm ( PST ) press conference .
5:30 pm Phoenix is now on the surface of Mars , much to the joy of everyone here in Mission Control .
As icing on the cake , we 've found that the lander is tilted only one quarter of a degree , which means we 've landed nearly perfectly level .
The next step for Phoenix is surface initialization during which the solar arrays , Surface Stereo Imager ( SSI ) , Biobarrier ( which has been protecting the robotic arm from contamination since it was sterilized on Earth ) and meteorological mast will deploy .
We should have data regarding the status of these deployments when Odyssey makes its first pass in less than two hours .
Engineers in Mission Control are saying that our actual landing went far smoother than any simulation or test that was ever done .
Stay tuned .
4:53 pm Touchdown detected !!
We 're on the surface of Mars and there is celebration in Mission Control !!
4:50 pm Parachute deploy detected !
Heat shield deploy detected !
Radar ground lock detected !
4:48 pm Odyssey has maintained a signal from Phoenix through the period of peak heating when we might have experienced a loss of communications due to plasma blackout .
4:45 pm Phoenix has now entered the atmosphere .
We expect possible plasma blackout in about a minute .
Phoenix is less than three minutes to parachute deploy and less than seven minutes to touchdown .
4:39 pm
We have now verified a successful cruise stage separation and turn to entry .
The Phoenix UHF signal is also being picked up by Mars Odyssey .
We 're now less than six minutes from entry , at which point events will happen in rapid succession .
Less than a minute after entry , Phoenix will begin heating to the point of plasma blackout due to the friction created by the atmosphere , during which we may lose communication briefly .
Phoenix will then come out of plasma blackout about two minutes later .
Over the four minutes following that , Phoenix will deploy its parachute , heat shield , lander legs , and then hopefully come to a soft landing on Mars .
4:29 pm The Mission Manager , Joe Guinn , has just announced that we should all be at our stations in preparation to bid farewell to our cruise stage , which has provided us an excellent trip to Mars .
Cruise stage separation is in eight minutes .
4:18 pm
We 've now confirmed completion of the successful pressurization of the descent engines .
This is a critical event that is now behind us .
We 're expecting cruise stage separation in less than twenty minutes .
4:10 pm
There has been a request for clarification regarding the EDL timeline .
The timeline posted below is what we refer to as the " Earth Receive Time . "
This is the time when we get the signal here in Mission Control .
Since it takes fifteen minutes for a signal to get from Mars to Earth , all the EDL events occur about fifteen minutes prior to the data we received confirming that these events happened .
We 've also just received confirmation that Odyssey has completed a slew in preparation for relay operations during EDL .
Also , it was just announced that the peanuts are being opened and distributed here in Mission Control .
This is a JPL tradition that goes back to the Ranger missions to the moon in the sixties .
4:07 pm
For those of you watching NASA TV , you 're seeing periodic shots of Mission Control in between and during interviews .
From where I sit , and what your probably can't see , are the rooms surrounding Mission Control , which are also full of people .
Two of the four walls are glass windows , opening to to the " dark room " from which Gay Yee Hill is broadcasting on NASA TV , as well as another conference room .
I can also see a viewing gallery above the " dark room " which is also full of people .
Everyone is excited and you can feel a nervous tension building .
Some folks in Mission Control are even talking via cell phones through the glass as they wish each other luck .
3:35 pm
It 's great to see so many people following along in the comments .
We are currently receiving real - time data from the spacecraft via the Deep Space Network .
In fact , we had near continuous coverage for the last couple weeks in order to keep a careful eye on the spacecraft status .
Some of you may notice from the live shot on NASA TV a green and black chart on the wall .
This chart shows our Doppler shift as a result of the increase in speed of our spacecraft due to the Mars " gravity well . "
As get closer and closer to Mars , we pick up speed due to gravity .
We enter the atmosphere at over 12,000 miles per hour , relative to Mars .
We are now about an hour from EDL .
3:15 pm
We 've just completed the 90 - minute ( from EDL ) poll , verifying that the Mars Odyssey orbiter , Mars Reconaissance Orbiter , and Mars Express are " go " for EDL communications support .
While Mars Odyssey relays data back to Earth during EDL , Mars Reconaissance Orbiter will play back data later .
3:04 pm
For those of you who'd like to follow along on NASA TV , live shots are now being shown periodically from the MSA .
There will be some interviews as well .
We just completed voice checks as we make our way through the EDL procedure .
If you notice folks referring to a thick book at their desks , this is the Approach and EDL procedure , several hundred pages long , that lists each step executed throughout our approach to and landing on Mars .
This procedure , in fact , starts several weeks back .
Also , the Project Manager just stopped by and wanted me to say hi to everyone reading on the web .
2:45 pm
We are now two hours out from EDL .
The team has assembled in Mission Control , from where I 'm now blogging .
Everyone is excited and nervous as the spacecraft nears Mars .
All the final uploads have been made and we are now along for the ride as five years of hard work reaches its climax .
The project manager is making his way through Mission Control wishing everyone luck as we ready ourselves for EDL .
Stay tuned for updates .
12:00 pm Welcome back to the Phoenix landing blog , being written from JPL in Pasadena , CA , where today engineers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Phoenix spacecraft at Mars .
Less than seven hours from now , Phoenix will enter the Martian atmosphere , heading towards its landing site in the northern arctic plains of Mars .
It was decided yesterday afternoon that no trajectory correction maneuver ( TCM ) would be needed last night , but left open the option for another TCM eight hours before landing .
Likewise , it was again decided this morning that the spacecraft trajectory is close enough that no correction is needed today either .
Sleeping bags and cots scattered throughout offices and cubicles hint at the long night team members have had making final preparations for EDL this afternoon .
The final EDL parameters were uploaded to the spacecraft this morning , drawing to a close the task of preparing the spacecraft for landing .
Everything from this point out will happen autonomously .
In addition , the final EDL timeline was issued just this morning .
The table below shows the time at which important events will be taking place in the course of EDL .
A number of questions have come up in response to the blog regarding the search for life on Mars .
To be sure , Phoenix is n’t looking for life itself .
Instead , Phoenix will evaluate whether life could survive here , or the habitability of Mars , by looking at the building blocks of life : water and any organics which may be located in the soil .
Depending on what Phoenix finds , future missions will follow Phoenix in response to these discoveries ; much as Phoenix followed the Mars Odyssey in response to its discovery of subsurface water ice in the Northern plains .
In addition , we ’ve taken numerous precautions to avoid bringing organic material with us to Mars .
The spacecraft is assembled in a clean room and kept under such stringent cleanliness requirements all the way through launch .
In addition , the Phoenix robotic arm is kept within what we call the “ biobarrier . ”
This is a protective bag that encases the robotic arm , which is the tool that will actually do the digging on Mars and comes in direct contact with any samples we analyze .
After being sterilized in an autoclave , the robotic arm was placed within the biobarrier , which will only be opened once we ’re safely on the surface .
The Phoenix science team has gone to great lengths to ensure that all the science we do on the surface of Mars will be valid .
As you can imagine the excitement is building in anticipation of a big day here at JPL .
News vans are filling the parking lot , and special guests will be arriving before long to view the landing .
As you can imagine , the Phoenix team is excited but nervous , and everyone is finding their own way to burn that energy in the last few hours of waiting that ’s left before we take our seats in Mission Control around 2:00 pm ( PST ) .
Check back to this page often , as updates will be posted here throughout the day .

EU foreign ministers met for what were said to be intense talks
While France confirmed that it would recognise independence , as expected , several member states led by Spain made clear their legal concerns .
US President George W Bush said Kosovo 's people were " independent " but stopped short of formal recognition .
Russia has backed Serbia in its refusal to recognise Kosovo 's secession .
About 10,000 students protested in Belgrade on Monday , and thousands of the city 's taxi- drivers went on strike in protest at the declaration of independence , while thousands of ethnic Serbs in Kosovo 's enclaves also rallied .
On Sunday , Kosovo 's majority ethnic Albanians celebrated the declaration with fireworks late into the night .
Serbian security forces were driven out of Kosovo in 1999 after a Nato bombing campaign aimed at halting the violent repression of ethnic Albanian separatists .
The province has been under United Nations administration and Nato protection since then .
' Many doubts '
Sunday 's declaration by the Kosovo parliament said independence would be built in accordance with the UN plan drawn up by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari .
Mitrovica saw a big protest by Kosovo Serbs on Monday
This outlines several limits on independence including an international presence and provision for the protection of the Serb minority .
Mr Bush , speaking in Tanzania during an Africa tour , said the plan would be the " blueprint forward " .
One of the first states which recognised Kosovo was Afghanistan which referred to " the right of sovereignty " .
In Brussels , the EU presidency announced after a day of intense talks between foreign ministers that member countries were free to decide individually whether to recognise Kosovo 's independence .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said after the meeting that Paris would recognise Kosovo 's independence .
The issue exposed major splits within the EU , the BBC's Oana Lungescu reports .
Spanish Minister for Europe Alberto Navarro told the BBC he was frustrated that the future of Kosovo was being decided by the world 's big powers in breach of international law , and said he feared it would boost separatism .
I think many people have many doubts about the international legality of what it is going on
Alberto Navarro
Spanish Minister for Europe
Anger in Serbia Legal arguments Readers debate declaration
" What I say as a European is that I 'm really frustrated that the future of Kosovo has been decided in Washington and to some extent in Moscow , and not in Europe , " he added .
" ... I think many people have many doubts about the international legality of what it is going on about this declaration of independence . "
Cyprus , Greece , Romania , Bulgaria and Slovakia also expressed anxiety about the signal that recognition might send to separatists .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband had said it was critical for the EU to show leadership and end the cycle of violence in the Balkans .
Together with France , Germany and Italy , Britain insists Kosovo is a unique case , not a precedent , our correspondent adds .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said her country was seeking a " platform of unity within the EU " and would not declare its position on Monday .
The EU has already agreed to send about 2,000 police , justice and civil administration officials to oversee Kosovo and help develop the province 's institutions .
' False state '
Russia 's parliament passed a motion on Monday condemning the declaration of independence .
KOSOVO PROFILE
Population about two million Majority ethnic Albanian ; 10 % Serb Under UN control since Nato drove out Serb forces in 1999 2,000 - strong EU staff to take over from UN after independence Nato to stay to provide security
Full text : Kosovo declaration
In pictures : Celebrations
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council , Russia can block Kosovo 's entry into the organisation as a sovereign state and it said on Sunday that Kosovo 's declaration should be null and void .
Serbia 's interior ministry filed criminal charges on Monday against Kosovo Albanian leaders instrumental in proclaiming independence .
It accused Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and two others of proclaiming a " false state " on Serbian territory .
Chanting and playing music , students marched in Belgrade under a huge banner reading " Kosovo is a part of Serbia and Serbia is a part of the world " .
The scenes were in stark contrast to riots that took place in the capital a few hours earlier when a few hundred , mainly football hooligans , went on the rampage clashing with police and stoning embassies , the BBC's Nick Hawton reports .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is an ugly victory for demographic warfare SEQ , London
Some acts of violence were reported in Kosovo itself after Sunday 's declaration .
A hand grenade thrown at a UN court building in the divided town of Mitrovica , and a UN car was reported to have been destroyed in the nearby village of Zubin Potok .
In the divided town of Mitrovica some chanted " This is Serbia " while others carried banners appealing for help from Russia , which has opposed Kosovo 's independence .
If more cats could learn to play the theremin , the world would be a better place .
UPDATE : Oh look , here ’s a cat playing with Theremin .
One of the cardinal rules of computer programming is to never trust your input .
This holds especially true when your input comes from users , and even more so when it comes from the anonymous , general public .
Apparently , the developers at Oklahoma ’s Department of Corrections slept through that day in computer science class , and even managed to skip all of Common Sense 101 .
You see , not only did they trust anonymous user input on their public - facing website , but they blindly executed it and displayed whatever came back .
The result of this negligently bad coding has some rather serious consequences : the names , addresses , and social security numbers of tens of thousands of Oklahoma residents were made available to the general public for a period of at least three years .
Up until yesterday , April 13 2008 , anyone with a web browser and the knowledge from Chapter One of SQL For Dummies could have easily accessed – and possibly , changed – any data within the DOC ’s databases .
It took me all of a minute to figure out how to download 10,597 records – SSNs and all – from their website :
As the title of that last screenshot indicates , the records were made available through the state ’s Sexual and Violent Offender Registry .
For those unaware , the SVOR is a federally - mandated , publically - available registry designed to protect us from the truly horrendous specimens of humanity by forever branding those convicted of a certain crimes with a big “ SO ” .
These registries also protect us from the truly unlucky offenders , such as fornicating teenagers , children who take nude pictures of themselves , and public urinators .
But I digress .
Not only did Oklahoma make avaiable the SSN of those types of offenders , but that of every type of offender in their system .
It was all accessible through an innocent looking link on both the SVOR and Offender search pages :
Mousing over that " Print Friendly " link revealed this rather long URL :
http://docapp8.doc.state.ok.us/pls/portal30/url/page/sor_roster?sqlString=select distinct o.offender_id,doc_number,o.social_security_number,o.date_of_birth,o.first_name,o.middle_name,o.last_name,o.sir_name,sor_data.getCD(race ) race , sor_data.getCD(sex ) sex,l.address1 address,l.city,l.state stateid,l.zip,l.county,sor_data.getCD(l.state ) state,l.country countryid, sor_data.getCD(l.country ) country , decode ( habitual , 'Y ' , 'habitual ' , '') habitual , decode ( aggravated , 'Y ' , ' aggravated ' , '' ) aggravated,l.status,x.status,x.registration_date,x.end_registration_date,l.jurisdiction from registration_offender_xref x , sor_last_locn_v lastLocn , sor_offender o , sor_location l , ( select distinct offender_id from sor_location where status = ' Verified ' and upper ( zip ) = ' 73064 ' ) h where lastLocn.offender_id( %2B ) = o.offender_id and l.location_id( %2B ) = lastLocn.location_id and x.offender_id = o.offender_id and x.status not in ( ' Merged ' ) and x.REG_TYPE_ID = 1 and nvl( x.admin_validated , to_date ( 1 , 'J ' ) ) >= nvl( x.entry_date , to_date ( 1 , 'J ' ) ) and x.status = ' Active ' and x.status <> ' Deleted ' and h.offender_id = o.offender_id order by o.last_name,o.first_name,o.middle_name&sr=yes
And , of course , following that link brought up this rather innocent - looking page :
Now , those of you even vaguely familiar with SQL SELECT statements will notice the correlation .
The absurdly long URL contained the database query used to display the page 's data .
The SELECT also included a few non-displayed columns such as " social_security_number " and " date_of_birth " , and even had several conditionals to make sure that only Active records were returned .
It does n't take too much SQL knowledge to display " social_security_number " instead of " doc_number " , remove the conditionals , and create a URL like this ...

It was an identity thief 's dream , especially one who learned to target SO registries .
According to the roster page 's HTML comments , it 's a wonder how many ID thiefs stumbled across this vulneability since Feb 3 , 2005 .

Shortly after discovering this problem ( thanks to reader AJ , who hesitantly pointed it out ) , I spent the following day working my way up the DOC 's call tree .
Eventually , I found my way to George Floyd and explained how bad of an idea it was to to have a SQL query as a parameter .
Fortunately , he did n't accuse me of hacking their site .
In fact , he seemed appreciative and promised to pass the details along to their developers .
The following day , both the SVOR and Offender Search were taken down " for routine maintenance " .
Great , I figured , they discovered an overlooked hole were working to patch it up .
However , when the sites came back up , I noticed that that the " print - friendly page " still had a SQL query in the URL .
Putting the " social_security_number " in , however , no longer displayed social security numbers .
It took me all of ten seconds to figure out a way around their fix .
This slightly - modified URL brought back all 10,597 SSNs once again :
http://docapp8.doc.state.ok.us/pls/portal30/url/page/sor_roster?sqlString=select distinct o.offender_id,o.Social_security_number doc_number,o.social_security_number,o.date_of_birth,o.first_name,o.middle_name,o.last_name,o.sir_name,sor_data.getCD(race ) race , sor_data.getCD(sex ) sex,l.address1 address,l.city,l.state stateid,l.zip,l.county,sor_data.getCD(l.state ) state,l.country countryid, sor_data.getCD(l.country ) country , decode ( habitual , 'Y ' , 'habitual ' , '') habitual , decode ( aggravated , 'Y ' , ' aggravated ' , '' ) aggravated,l.status,x.status,x.registration_date,x.end_registration_date,l.jurisdiction from registration_offender_xref x , sor_last_locn_v lastLocn , sor_offender o , sor_location l where lastLocn.offender_id( % 2B ) = o.offender_id and l.location_id( %2B ) = lastLocn.location_id and x.offender_id = o.offender_id order by o.last_name,o.first_name,o.middle_name&sr=yes
Did you spot the difference ?
I used " Social_security_number " instead of " social_security_number " .
Their brilliant developers plugged this pothole with a pebble by doing nothing more than a case - sensisitve search / replace of " social_security_number " with " doc_number " .
Clearly , they had no idea why it was so bad to let any SELECT anything from their databases .
I emailed George again , this time explaining the problem much more clearly and advising in BOLD , RED , CAPS that the " roster page " should be taken down immediately .
I also demonstrated the power of the ALL_TABLES table , the contents of an " interesting " table named MSD_MONTHLY_MEDICAL_ACTIVITY , and how even their information was available for all to see :
That , aparently , did the trick .
Soon thereafter , the sites underwent " routine maintenance " and the " roster pages " were no more .
I guess they were n't too thrilled about having their personal data up on the ' net for all to see .
Women are more likely to give birth to boys if they have a high - calorie diet in the run-up to becoming pregnant , according to a team of scientists .
The finding is the first clear evidence that a mother 's eating habits around the time of conception can influence the sex of her baby .
The discovery points to a natural way for women to boost , if only slightly , their chances of having a boy or a girl , depending on whether they consume large amounts of foods such as bananas and cereals , or have a more restricted diet .
Scientists at Oxford and Exeter universities asked 740 women , who had become pregnant for the first time , about their eating patterns in the year before they conceived .
They then divided the women into high , medium and low calorie groups .
They found that 56 % of women in the high calorie group gave birth to boys , compared with 45 % in the lower calorie group .
None of the women was obese or aware of the gender of her baby throughout her pregnancy .
" For the first time , we 've shown there is a clear association between a mother 's diet and the gender of her infant , " said Fiona Mathews , a specialist in mammalian biology at Exeter University , who led the research .
" The mother seems to be able to influence the survival of either the sperm or the fertilised egg in its very early stages , probably before it has even implanted in the womb . "
When the researchers looked more closely at the women 's diets , they found that certain nutrients were key to the effect , she said .
" We were able to confirm the old wives ' tale that eating bananas and so having a high potassium intake was associated with having a boy , as was a high sodium intake .
But the old tale about drinking a lot of milk to have a girl does n't seem to hold up .
In fact , more calcium meant they were again more likely to have a boy .
" It does not seem to matter whether you get most of your energy from carbs or fat , it 's about the total amount of calories consumed , " she said .
The study , which appears today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , showed that 59 % of women who ate breakfast cereal every day had boys , compared with only 43 % of women who rarely or never ate cereal .
Nutritional data was collected for three time periods : usual intake before conception ( preconception ) ; intake at around 16 weeks ' gestation ( early pregnancy ) and usual intake between 16 and 28 weeks ' gestation ( later pregnancy ) .
While it might be possible for a woman to boost the effect by substantially changing her diet , scientists warned that consuming high levels of salt or dramatically altering levels of other nutrients could be harmful .
" If you 're looking for a boy , then eating breakfast cereal every day and within safe limits , having a reasonable intake of sodium , potassium and calcium , plus a good intake of protein looks like a sensible option .
It 's the converse of that if you 're hoping for a girl , but again , only within safe limits , " Mathews said .
The finding makes evolutionary sense and mirrors a similar effect seen in other animals .
Females are more likely to be born when food is scarce , since they are more likely to produce at least some babies .
Males are more of a gamble though , with some having lots of offspring and others having none .
" If times are good , it can make a lot of sense to invest in boys because you might produce a strapping great warrior , who could go on to produce far more grandchildren than a daughter would , " said Mathews .
Professor Stuart West , of Edinburgh University , said women should be extremely cautious about using diet to influence the sex of their offspring .
He pointed out that similar studies in animals showed huge variations in the effect and warned that changing diet could have other health implications for mothers and children .
Patrolling the June skies above Long Island Sound ’s tiny FalknerIsland , one roseate tern spies another flying 15 feet below with a fish in its beak .
The first bird dives , grabs the fish and repairs to a nearby pebbly beach to feed its chicks .
“ That ’s Supertern , ” says biologist Dave Shealer of the fish thief .
“ Good catch ! ” says Shealer ’s colleague , Jeff Spendelow , who , peering through a spotting scope , reads an identifying number on a band around the bird ’s leg .
The men — Shealer , a 37 - year - old behavioral ecologist based at Loras College in Dubuque , Iowa , and 53 - year - old Spendelow , a U.S. Geological Survey research biologist at Maryland ’s Patuxent Wildlife Research Center — are shoulder to shoulder in a small bird blind on the island ’s north end .
Thanks to these two researchers , Supertern and several other FalknerIsland roseate terns are among science ’s most celebrated practitioners of kleptoparasitism , or food theft , from the Greek word kleptes , meaning thief .
The practice of stealing food to feed themselves , their young or a mate — common to other bird species such as frigate birds , parasitic jaegers , skuas and several types of gulls — was first noticed in roseate terns in 1973 .
But Shealer and Spendelow ’s recently published research has shed new light on this unorthodox behavior .
They have found that , contrary to conventional wisdom , crime does pay — at least among roseate terns .
Spendelow and Shealer ’s “ laboratory , ” about three miles off the Connecticut coast , is a slip of an island consisting of four and a half acres of rocky beach , poison ivy , six - foot - high black mustard plants and staghorn sumac trees .
The north end of the banana - shaped island rises 60 feet from the sea like the prow of a ship ; the island ’s midsection is marked by a 200 - year - old working lighthouse .
But birds dominate the landscape : nearly 3,000 pairs of common terns and 45 pairs of their smaller , endangered cousins , the roseates , make their nest here .
Much appreciated by bird lovers , roseates have a slightly rosy breast that glows “ with the faintest blush of some rare seashell , ” wrote early 20th - century ornithologist Arthur C. Bent .
Their effortlessness in the air prompted John James Audubon to describe them as “ the Hummingbirds of the sea . ”
Spendelow first began studying roseates on Falkner 25 years ago .
In 1987 , he devised an ingenious system of banding that did not require recapturing the birds to identify them : unique combinations of colored plastic bands that can be seen with a spotting scope from as far as 75 yards away .
Spendelow estimates that he and his colleagues have outfitted more than 50,000 roseates in Connecticut , Massachusetts and New York with these bands .
Using this system , Spendelow has been able to make detailed histories of thousands of individual roseates and monitor the ups and downs of their population .
In 1994 , Spendelow invited Shealer to come to Falkner .
Shealer had just spent four summers researching how roseates in Puerto Rico forage for food and had observed some terns stealing fish from others .
He wondered whether this was normal behavior or just opportunism .
Shealer felt that Spendelow ’s banding system would enable him to distinguish one bird from another and thus answer this question .
During the next four years on Falkner , Shealer would fold his 6 - foot - 1 frame into the bird blind for a total of 774 hours to watch the terns .
“ When you get to know them as individuals , you ca n’t help but anthropomorphize , ” he says .
“ There ’s one that abuses her offspring , one that [ acts like he ’s ]
God ’s gift to terns , another that loves mackerel .
There are devoted parents , and a male that courts anything that moves . ”
Shealer found that kleptoparasitism is indeed a way of life for some roseates , if only for two males and eight females , or 4 percent of what was then FalknerIsland ’s nesting roseate population .
The thieves employed a number of scams and tricks .
Supertern and a female dubbed the Good Mother swooped on their quarry from above or slashed from below .
Other klepto terns —sly as purse snatchers — pre ferred to jump their victims on the ground .
Afew crafty females bided their time until a neighbor arrived home with a fish , then blocked the neighbor ’s access to its chicks and grabbed the fish .
“ One brazen female actually solicited sex repeatedly , ” Shealer adds .
She would flirt with a fish - laden male by being submissive and begging , behavior that is a prelude to mating .
“ When the foolish male would fall for it and attempt a mounting on her back in preparation for copulation , ” says Shealer , “ she tilted her head upward , snatched the fish from the distracted suitor and took off without so much as a backward glance . ”
There were other surprises .
Shealer and Spendelow often watched Supertern bring several fish in rapid succession to his mate .
Once she was satiated , he would then fly off to visit other , single females .
After copping a fish from some unsuspecting tern , he ’d offer the stolen fish — the tern equivalent of a box of chocolates — to female after female , until he won what biologists call “ extra pair copulation . ”
Spendelow says he “ would n’t be surprised if Supertern fathered half of the chicks ” of single females on the island .
Klepto terns also make good parents .
Honest terns bring their chicks only two young three - inch - long sand lance fish per hour .
But Supertern , for example , can bring his mate ’s offspring up to 20 per hour .
Consequently , Supertern and the nine other thieving parents have healthier chicks , which are far more likely to survive and have chicks of their own .
This , says Shealer , makes the outlaws the big winners in the game of life , where success is measured by the ability of individuals to pass their genes along to the following generation .
But do the birds also pass along their thieving ways ?
Apparently not .
Shealer and Spendelow have yet to see the offspring of a klepto tern resort to stealing .
Many questions about kleptoparasitism remain :
Why , for example , do terns steal rather than fish for themselves ?
What are the effects on honest roseates in the population ?
Sitting in the blind , watching over the terns , Shealer offers a few speculations .
Just as no two humans are alike , he says , neither are two birds .
A bird that sees its neighbor fly in with a fish might be tempted to steal it , he says , “ but I believe that kleptoparasitism is not just a matter of opportunism . ”
Nor , he says , is it laziness — a way to avoid the up to an hour - long , 25 - mile round - trip flight out to sea to search for sand lances .
Perhaps ,
Shealer speculates , some birds simply discover that they are good at stealing .
It does , after all , require exquisite skill , speed and timing .
Others might lack the ability and give up after trying once or twice .
Whatever motivates terns to steal , it ’s clear that “ kleptoparasitism is not a loser ’s strategy , ” says Shealer .
UPDATE ( 10/18/2010 ) :
For an updated and much better version , check out how to turn your iPod touch into an iPhone : 4G edition .
The iPhone and iPod touch are almost indistinguishable devices except for one major difference — you can make calls from your iPhone , and you can't from your iPod touch .
For the privilege of making phone calls with your iPhone , you have to pay $ 100 more upfront to Apple for the device itself , plus a minimum of $ 60 / month to AT&T for the next two years .
Let 's say you did n't need that kind of firepower from your iPod touch , but that you would like to use it make a phone call every now and then .
You can , and today I 'm going to show you how to make VoIP phone calls from your iPod touch or iPhone using a freeware application called SIP - VoIP .

What You 'll Need
Advertisement
1. ) A jailbroken iPod touch or iPhone .
If you have n't already jailbroken your device , do n't worry — it'll just take 45 seconds .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
2. ) iPhone headphones with mics do n't work with the iPod touch , so if you 're using an iPod touch you 'll need a Touchmod mic .
The Touchmod mics come in a variety of flavors , from the simple dongle that plugs into the syncing port to the headphone - and - mic combo that works much like the iPhone headphones .
The hardware will set you back somewhere between $ 50 and $ 60 .
3. ) The freeware SIP - VoIP application .
Read on for details for installing SIP - VoIP below .
Advertisement
UPDATE : Just today ( 4/15 ) it looks like another VoIP app for the iPhone has emerged called Fring .
Fring promises to work with both Skype and SIP accounts , but like SIP - VoIP it 's still young and not entirely perfect .
I have n't tried it yet , but it might be a viable alternative to SIP - VoIP , and can be installed just as easily .
Install SIP-VoIP
Assuming you 've got the hardware you need and you 've prepared your device , now it 's time to install the VoIP application .
If you do n't yet have a mic , you can test that SIP - VoIP is successfully making calls before you purchase it .
Advertisement
I 'm going to cover two different ways of installing SIP - VoIP .
The first and easiest method is with Installer.app , the program that is automatically installed when you jailbreak your iPod .
The second method is more difficult , but it 's good to have around in case you run into errors ( which I did ) .
Advertisement
Method 1 - Install SIP -VoIP with Installer.app : First , since SIP - VoIP is n't found in Installer .app by default , you need to add the Touchmods repository to Installer .
To do so , launch Installer and head to the Sources tab .
Now tap Edit ->
Add , and type http://touchmods.net/rep.xml into the Add Source dialog .
Hit OK , and Installer will refresh your sources , this time including your new Touchmods repository .
Advertisement
Now go to the Install tab and find the entry labeled Touchmods .
Inside you 'll see an app called Touchmods SIP - VoIP .
Go ahead and install SIP - VoIP by tapping the entry , tapping the install button , and then verifying that you want to install this application from an " untrusted " source .
This is by far the easiest method for installing SIP - VoIP , but I had trouble with the latest version of SIP - VoIP ( version 1.2 ) on my iPod touch , so I had to install a previous version ( 1.1 ) .
Since you can only install the latest with Installer , I 'll also demonstrate how to install older versions of SIP - VoIP .
I 'd recommend trying it the easy way first , then moving to the following method if you have trouble .
If you 're taking the easy route the first time around , skip to the Set Up an SIP Account section below .
Advertisement
Method 2 - Install SIP - VoIP over SSH :
To install previous versions of SIP - VoIP , you 'll need to first install OpenSSH through Installer.app ( you can find it under Install -> System ) .
Now you 'll need to connect to your iPod using a desktop FTP client that supports SFTP connections ( like FileZilla for Windows or Cyberduck for OS X ) .
This will allow you to browse and copy files to your iPod like you would if you could access the disk as an external hard drive on your computer .
Advertisement
To connect to your device from your computer , you 'll need to know your iPod touch 's or iPhone 's IP address .
You can find this by opening the Settings app , tapping Wi-Fi , and then tapping the blue arrow next to the network you 're connected to .
Advertisement
Now that you 've got that , start up your FTP client of choice , enter the IP address as you server , and use root for your username and alpine as your password .
Once connected , navigate to the Applications folder ( just above the root folder ) .
That 's where your iPhone and iPod touch keep all of their applications .
From here it's a simple matter of dragging and dropping the appropriate SIP - VoIP app to the applications folder .
For this article , I 'm using the 1.1 version of SIP - VoIP , which you can download here .
Once downloaded , unzip the file and then drag and drop the SIP - VoIP.app file to your Applications folder .
Finally , restart your iPod or iPhone and the new app should show up on your home screen .
Advertisement
Set Up an SIP Account
Advertisement
Unfortunately the SIP - VoIP app does n't work with the most popular VoIP app Skype ( it uses the SIP protocol ) , which means you 'll have to set up an account with another service to use the app .
Luckily there are tons of options out there that can work with SIP - VoIP .
I used a service called FreeCall , so that 's what I 'll highlight in my examples , but the Touchmods blog lists a handful of alternatives .
If you want to follow along exactly with my settings , head to the FreeCall signup page and register for an account .
After you register , you 'll need to buy some minutes for your call time .
FreeCall is an international service , so when it asks for your cell phone ( to which it sends an SMS confirmation ) , you 'll need to include your country code ; for example , it would look something like 0015555551234 if you 're in the US .
The minimum purchase with FreeCall is 10 euros , which amounts to around $ 16 .
Once you 've purchased some calling time with FreeCall , it 's time to enter your setup configuration in SIP - VoIP and start making calls .

NOTE : If you do n't want to spend money off the bat , you might want to try signing up with a service like Gizmo5 ( formerly Gizmo Project ) , which offers a small amount of trial credit .

Set Up SIP - VoIP to Make Calls
Advertisement
Finally , we 're ready to set up SIP - VoIP with the SIP provider you registered with above .
Launch the app from your iPod touch or iPhone 's home screen , then tap on Settings in the bottom right corner .
You 'll see a very rudimentary form where you 'll enter the settings for the SIP account you set up above .
Advertisement
If you used FreeCall like I did , enter your FreeCall username and password in the first two fields ( other services will use the number they 've assigned you as the username ) , then sip.voiparound.com in the field labeled SIP - Server ( see screenshot ) .
There are more fields , but for FreeCall that should be all you need .
Hit Save to save your settings — you may have to hit return on the iPod 's keyboard to dismiss it and see the Save button — and then tap the dial tab to head to the dialpad .
Before you make your first call , you have to connect the application to the SIP server , so click the button labeled " connect to sip server " in the lower left .
If all goes well , it 'll connect without a hitch .
( This is where I ran into some problems with version 1.2 on the iPod touch .
1.2 connected without issue from my iPhone , but I kept getting connection error messages with 1.2 on my iPod touch .
If you 're having similar problems , installing version 1.1 may help . )
If it connected successfully , all you 've got to do is dial your number ( country code included , depending on which service you go with ) and hit the call button .

I actually stumbled onto a video on YouTube of a precocious kid using a Touchmods mic with SIP - VoIP and FreeCall .
There are several of these videos on YouTube — I particularly like this speaker phone setup .
Check out his video below to get a better look at what the final result is .
Set up Inbound number
Your FreeCall account only handles outbound calls , but you 're not out of luck if you want to add inbound functionality to your iPod touch .
You can register your FreeCall SIP account with other services , like IPKall , to get a free phone number that will ring your iPod touch .
( The only catch is that you 're limited to a state of Washington area code ) .
I wo n't go into details on setting up an inbound number , but you can find more details from this post at the Touchmods blog .

The SIP - VoIP app has been in development for a while , and though it 's still not much to look at , it seems to be improving over time .
The iPhone and iPod touch 2.0 firmware will officially hit the streets sometime in June with support for third party apps through Apple , so who knows what kind of VoIP apps we 'll see when that time comes .
Advertisement
Whether or not we 'll ever see Skype or another VoIP app officially supported for the iPhone ( Apple says they 'll allow VoIP over Wi - Fi ) , SIP - VoIP is already there .
My experience with it has been hit - or - miss , and it 's got miles to go before it 's the friendliest app around , but whether you 'd like to make international calls for cheap or you just want to want to reach out and touch someone from your iPod touch , the folks at Touchmods and SIP - VoIP are already providing the tools to do just that .

The torch is due to visit five continents before the Games
The flame , which is due to pass through 22 cities in the four months before the Games , is expected to reach North Korean capital Pyongyang on 28 April .
Chinese and North Korean officials made the agreement in Pyongyang , said the official Korean Central News Agency .
A day earlier the torch is scheduled to pass through the South Korean capital of Seoul on its way north , say reports .
The torch , which will be lit at Olympia in Greece on 25 March , is due to cover five continents before the event begins on 8 August .
The planned 137,000 - km ( 85,000 - mile ) relay route will include a trip to the top of Mount Everest .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A cargo ship hired by the U.S. military fired warning shots at approaching boats in the Gulf , the U.S. Navy said on Friday , underscoring tension in the region as the Pentagon sharpened its warnings to Iran .
A cargo ship contracted by the U.S Military Sealift Command has fired at least one shot toward an Iranian boat , a U.S. defense official said on Friday .
REUTERS / Graphics
According to American defense officials , the Westward Venture cargo ship chartered by the U.S. Defense Department was traveling in international waters when two unidentified small boats approached on Thursday .
After the boats failed to respond to radio queries and a warning flare , the cargo ship ’s security team fired “ a few bursts ” of machine gun and rifle warning shots , according to Cmdr. Lydia Robertson , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy ’s Bahrain - based Fifth Fleet .
“ The small boats left the area a short time later , ” she said by telephone .
“ They were able to avoid a serious incident by following the procedures that we use . ”
The news helped push oil prices up more than $ 3 to $ 119.50 a barrel -- within striking distance of the record $ 119.90 hit earlier this week -- as traders worried escalating tensions in the region could eventually disrupt crude shipments .
U.S. defense officials , speaking only on condition of anonymity , first said they suspected the boats were Iranian .
But a Fifth Fleet spokeswoman quickly backed away from that charge .
“ We can not speculate on who they are .
We just do n’t know .
We have no proof of who they were , ” said Lt. Stephanie Murdoch , another spokeswoman for the Fifth Fleet .
In Tehran , an Iranian navy source denied that any confrontation had occurred with a U.S. ship in the Gulf .
But the source , quoted by a journalist for Iran ’s state - owned Arabic Al - Alam TV channel , said any shooting that may have occurred could have targeted a non-Iranian vessel .
SIMMERING TENSION
Relations between Washington and Tehran are tense over Iran ’s nuclear program and who is to blame for ongoing violence in Iraq .
Hostile rhetoric and close encounters in the Gulf have fueled speculation that the United States may be planning some sort of military action against Tehran .
U.S. charges of Iranian involvement in threats against its ships have also contributed to the tension .
In January , for example , the United States said five small Iranian speed boats aggressively approached three U.S. Navy ships in the Strait of Hormuz , a critical crude oil shipping route .
During the confrontation , a radio message was received warning the U.S. ships they could explode within minutes .
But Iran said its boats were simply trying to identify the U.S. vessels and maritime experts said the threatening message may have come not from the Iranian boats but from a radio heckler known as “ the Filipino monkey . ”
In March , another U.S. military - chartered ship preparing to cross the Suez Canal fired warning shots at a small boat , killing an Egyptian on board .
The latest incident came as America ’s top military officer charged Iran with increasing support for Iraqi militias and warned that the United States had military options to force Tehran to stop .
“ When I say I do n’t want to take any military options off the table , that certainly more than implies that we have military options , ” said Adm.
Michael Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff .
“ That kind of planning activity has been going on for a long time .
I think it will go on for some time into the future , ” he told reporters
While U.S. officials repeatedly deny plans to strike Iran , they have not closed the door completely on military action .
“ Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need and , in fact , I believe it would be disastrous on a number of levels , ” Defense Secretary Robert Gates said this week .
“ But the military option must be kept on the table given the destabilizing policies of the regime and the risks inherent in a future Iranian nuclear threat -- either directly or through proliferation . ”
While some British newspaper columnists argued that the affair was strictly a family matter for Mr. Mosley , who has been married for 48 years , much of the news media coverage has cast it as a family tragedy in another sense .
Stories have recalled how he was 11 weeks old when his mother was taken to prison , and have detailed how the shadow of his parents  his father died in 1980 , his mother in 2003  has long fallen across his life .
Mr. Mosley has said that he had hoped for a career in politics , but that his family name made that impossible .
Explaining his turn to motor racing , where he had an undistinguished record in the sport ’s lower echelons , he has said that he chose it as a career after drivers at a British track in the 1960s speculated that he was related to an Alf Mosley , a prominent builder of British buses .
“ I thought to myself , ‘ I ’ve found a world where they do n’t know about Oswald Mosley , ’ ” he said .
“ And it has always been a bit like that in motor racing : nobody gives a damn . ”
In the wake of the present scandal , that assumption may have to be re-examined .
His explanations of the Chelsea session have run into a barrage of condemnation , some from Jewish organizations .
Stephen D. Smith , director of Britain ’s Holocaust center , noted that Mr. Mosley had recently proclaimed an “ anti-racism ” drive in Formula
One after spectators in Spain directed racial taunts at Lewis Hamilton , the 23 - year - old black driver for the McLaren team who is racing ’s latest sensation , and said that Mr. Mosley should abide by his own standard .
“ This is an insult to millions of victims , survivors and their families , ” Mr. Smith said .
“ He should resign from the sport . ”
A similar rebuke came from a former grand prix driver , Jody Scheckter of South Africa , who won the Formula One world driver ’s championship for Ferrari in 1979 and is still the only Jewish driver to have won the crown .
“ I do n’t believe he can represent anything after this , ” Mr. Scheckter said Sunday .
“ If it did n’t have a Nazi connotation it would be a completely different matter , but for a person in his position , and with his background , it ’s unbelievable . ”
Similar statements have been made by Sir Stirling Moss , a grand prix legend in the 1950s , and Jackie Stewart , a three - time world champion in the 1970s .
Mr. Stewart , a childhood dyslexic whose criticism of Mr. Mosley ’s role in the spying scandal last year caused the F.I.A. chief to mock him as a “ certified half wit , ” told a television interviewer in Bahrain that allowing Mr. Mosley to stay in his post would be an affront to the multicultural nature of Formula One : “ He ’s president of a global federation that serves many religions , cultures and sensitivities , ” he said .
“ And Formula One goes to many of these parts of the world . ”
Discover the Boost Filesystem Library
Creating platform - independent code
One of the most common issues with the C++ language — and indeed , the C++ standard — is the lack of a well - defined library that helps deal with file system queries and manipulation .
This absence leads programmers to use the native operating system - provided application program interfaces ( APIs ) , which makes for code that is n't portable across platforms .
Consider a simple situation :
You need to figure out whether a file is of type Directory .
In the Microsoft ® Windows ® platform , you could do this by calling the GetAttributes library function , defined in the windows.h header file :
DWORD GetFileAttributes ( LPCTSTR lpFileName ) ;
For directories , the result should be FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY , and your code must check for the same .
On UNIX ® and Linux® platforms , the same functionality could be achieved by using the stat or fstat routines and the S_ISDIR macro defined in sys / stat .h .
You must also understand the stat structure .
Here 's the corresponding code :
#include < sys / stat.h > # include < stdio.h > int main ( ) { struct stat s1 ; int status = stat ( < const char * denoting pathname > , &s1 ) ; printf ( “ Path is a directory : %d
” , S_ISDIR ( s1.st_mode ) ) ; return 0 ; }
For programs with heavy - duty I/O , such inconsistencies imply a significant engineering effort for porting the code across platforms .
It is in this light that you introduce the Boost Filesystem Library .
This widely used library provides a safe , portable , and easy - to - use C++ interface for performing file system operations .
It 's available as a free download from the Boost site .
Your first program using boost : : filesystem
Before delving into the finer nuances of the Boost Filesystem Library , Listing 1 shows the code to figure out whether a file is of type Directory using Boost APIs .
Listing 1 .
Code to determine whether a file is of type Directory
#include < stdio.h > # include “ boost/filesystem.hpp ” int main ( ) { boost :: filesystem :: path path ( " /usr/local/include " ) ; // random pathname bool result = boost :: filesystem ::is_directory ( path ) ; printf ( “ Path is a directory : %d
” , result ) ; return 0 ; }
The code is self - explanatory , and you do n't need to know any system - specific routines .
The code is verified to compile on both gcc - 3.4.4 and cl- 13.10.3077 without modification .
Understanding the Boost path object
The key to understanding the Boost Filesystem Library is the path object , as several routines defined in the Filesystem Library are only meant to work with a proper path object .
Often , file system paths are operating system dependant .
For example , it 's well known that UNIX and Linux systems use the virgule ( / ) character as a directory separator , while Windows uses a backslash ( \ ) for similar purpose .
The boost : : filesystem :: path is meant to precisely abstract this feature .
A path object could be initialized in several ways , the most common being an initialization with a char * or std:: string , as shown in Listing 2 .
Listing 2 .
Ways to create a Boost path object
path ( ) ; // empty path path ( const char* pathname ) ; path ( const std::string& pathname ) ; path ( const char * pathname , boost : : filesystem : : path ::name_check checker ) ; path ( const std:: string& pathname , boost : : filesystem :: path ::name_check checker ) ;
While initializing the path object , the PATHNAME variable could be provided in either the native format or in the portable format defined by the Portable Operating System Interface ( POSIX ) committee .
Both approaches have their relative trade - offs in practice .
Consider a situation in which you want to manipulate a directory that your software created and locate the directory in / tmp / mywork on UNIX and Linux systems and in C:\tmp\mywork on Windows .
There are several approaches to this problem .
Listing 3 shows the native format - oriented approach .
Listing 3 . Initialize the path using the native format
#ifdef UNIX boost : : filesystem :: path path ( " / tmp/mywork " ) ; #else boost : : filesystem :: path path ( " C:\\tmp\\mywork " ) ; #endif
A single #ifdef is needed to initialize the path on a per-operating system basis .
However , if you prefer using the portable format , take a look at Listing 4 .
Listing 4 . Initialize the path using a portable format
boost : : filesystem :: path path ( " / tmp/mywork " ) ;
Note that path : : name_check refers to a name - checking function prototype .
The name - check function returns " True " if its argument input PATHNAME is valid for a particular operating system or file system .
Several name - checking functions come with the Boost Filesystem Library , and you 're welcome to provide your own variants , as well .
Some of the more commonly used name - check functions are the Boost - provided portable_posix_name and windows_name .
Overview of the path member functions
The path object comes with several member methods .
These member routines do n't modify the file system but do provide useful information based on the path name .
This section provides an overview of several of these routines :
const std::string& string ( ) :
This routine returns a copy of the string with which the path was initialized , with formatting per the path grammar rules .
This routine returns a copy of the string with which the path was initialized , with formatting per the path grammar rules .
std::string root_directory ( ) :
Given a path , this API would return the root directory ; otherwise , it would return an empty string .
For example , if the path consists of / tmp / var1 , then this routine would return / , which is the root of the UNIX file system .
However , if the path is a relative path such as ../ mywork / bin , this routine would return an empty string .
Given a path , this API would return the root directory ; otherwise , it would return an empty string .
For example , if the path consists of / tmp / var1 , then this routine would return , which is the root of the UNIX file system .
However , if the path is a relative path such as ../ mywork / bin , this routine would return an empty string .
std::string root_name( ) :
Given a path that begins from the root of the file system , this routine returns a string that contains the first character of the PATHNAME .
Given a path that begins from the root of the file system , this routine returns a string that contains the first character of the PATHNAME .
std::string leaf ( ) :
Given an absolute path name ( for example , / home / user1 / file2 ) , this routine provides only the string corresponding to the file name ( that is , file2 ) .
Given an absolute path name ( for example , / home / user1 / file2 ) , this routine provides only the string corresponding to the file name ( that is , file2 ) .
std::string branch_path ( ) :
This is the complementary routine to leaf .
Given a path , it returns all the elements used to construct it except the last .
For example , for a path initialized with /a/b/ c , path.branch_path ( ) returns / a/b .
For paths with a single element such as c , this routine returns an empty string .
This is the complementary routine to .
Given a path , it returns all the elements used to construct it except the last .
For example , for a path initialized with / a/b/ c , returns .
For paths with a single element such as c , this routine returns an empty string .
bool empty ( ) :
If the path object contains an empty string ( for example , path path1 ( " " ) , then this routine returns True or False .
If the path object contains an empty string ( for example , path path1 ( " " ) , then this routine returns True or False .
boost :: filesystem :: path::iterator :
This routine is used to traverse the individual elements of the path .
Consider Listing 5 . Listing 5 . Using the path : : iterator ( begin and end interface ) # include < iostream > # include “ boost/filesystem.hpp ” int main ( ) { boost :: filesystem :: path path1(" /usr/local /include " ) ; // random pathname boost :: filesystem ::path::iterator pathI = path1.begin( ) ; while ( pathI != path1.end ( ) ) { std::cout << * pathI << std::endl ; ++ pathI ; } return 0 ; } // result : 1
The output of the above program is / , usr , local , include , in that order , signifying the directory hierarchy .
This routine is used to traverse the individual elements of the path .
Consider Listing 5 . path operator / ( char * lhs , const path& rhs ) :
This routine is a non-member function of path .
It returns a concatenation of the path formed using lhs and rhs .
It automatically inserts / as the path separator , as Listing 6 shows .
Listing 6 . Concatenation of path strings # include < iostream > # include " boost/filesystem.hpp " int main ( ) { boost : : filesystem :: path path1 ( " local / include " ) ; boost : : filesystem :: path path2 = operator / ( " /usr " , path1 ) ; std::cout << " Path : " << path2 << std::endl ; return 0 ; } // result : /usr/local / include
Error handling
File system operations often encounter unexpected issues , and the Boost Filesystem Library reports run time errors using C++ exceptions .
The boost : : filesystem_error class is derived from the std:: runtime_error class .
Functions in the library use filesystem_error exceptions to report operational errors .
Corresponding to the different possible error types , there are error codes that are defined in the Boost headers .
The user code typically resides within try ... catch blocks that use the filesystem_error exceptions for reporting relevant error messages .
Listing 7 provides a small example of a file is being renamed , except that the file in the from path does n't exist .
Listing 7 . Error handling in Boost
#include < iostream > # include “ boost/filesystem.hpp ” int main ( ) { try { boost : : filesystem :: path path ( " C:\\src\\hdbase\\j1 " ) ; boost : : filesystem :: path path2( " C:\\src\\hdbase\ \j2 " ) ; boost : : filesystem ::rename ( path , path2 ) ; } catch ( boost::filesystem::filesystem_error e ) { // do the needful } return 0 ; }
Categories of function in the Boost Filesystem Library
The boost : : filesystem provides for different categories of function : Some , like is_directory , are meant to query the file system , while others , like create_directory , actively modify it .
Based on their functionality , the functions are broadly classified in the following categories :
Attribute functions : Provide for miscellaneous information such as file size and disk usage .
Provide for miscellaneous information such as file size and disk usage .
File system - manipulation functions :
Meant to create regular files , directories , and symbolic links ; copy and rename files ; and provide for deletion .

Utility / predicate functions :
Test for the existence of a file , and so on .
Test for the existence of a file , and so on .
Miscellaneous convenience functions :
Change file name extensions programmatically , and so on .
Attribute functions
The Boost Filesystem Library consists of the following attribute functions :
uintmax_t file_size ( const path& ) :
Returns the size of a regular file in bytes
Returns the size of a regular file in bytes boost : : filesystem :: space_info space ( const path& ) :
Takes in a path and returns a space_info structure defined as : struct space_info { uintmax_t capacity ; uintmax_t free ; uintmax_t available ; } ; Based on the disk partition to which the file system belongs , this routine returns the same disk usage statistics in bytes for all directories in that partition .
For example , both C:\src\dir1 and C:\src\dir2 would return the same disk use data .
Takes in a path and returns a structure defined as : std: : time_t last_write_time ( const path& ) :
Returns the last modification time of a file .
Returns the last modification time of a file .
void last_write_time ( const path& , std : : time_t new_time ) : Modifies the last modification time of a file .
Modifies the last modification time of a file .
const path& current_path ( ) :
Returns the full path for the current working directory of the program ( Note that this path may not be the same directory from which the program was originally run , because it is programmatically possible to change directories . ) .
File system - manipulation functions
This set of functions is responsible for creating new files and directories , removing files , and so on :
bool create_directory ( const path& ) :
This function creates a directory with the given path name .
( Note that if the PATHNAME itself consists of invalid characters , the result is often platform defined .
For example , in both UNIX and Windows systems , the asterisk ( * ) , the question mark ( ? ) , and other such characters are considered invalid and cannot be in a directory name . )
This function creates a directory with the given path name .
( Note that if the PATHNAME itself consists of invalid characters , the result is often platform defined .
For example , in both UNIX and Windows systems , the asterisk ( ) , the question mark ( ) , and other such characters are considered invalid and cannot be in a directory name . ) bool create_directories ( const path& ) :
You can create a directory tree as opposed to a single directory using this API .
For example , consider the directory tree / a/b/ c , which must be created inside the /tmp folder .
Calling this API accomplishes the task , while create_directory , with the same argument , will throw an exception .
You can create a directory tree as opposed to a single directory using this API .
For example , consider the directory tree / a/b/ c , which must be created inside the /tmp folder .
Calling this API accomplishes the task , while , with the same argument , will throw an exception .
bool create_hard_link ( const path& frompath , const path& topath ) :
This function creates a hard link between frompath and topath .
This function creates a hard link between and .
bool create_symlink ( const path& frompath , const path& topath ) :
This function creates a symbolic ( soft ) link between frompath and topath .
This function creates a symbolic ( soft ) link between and .
void copy_file ( const path& frompath , const path& topath ) :
The contents and attributes of the file referred to by frompath is copied to the file referred to by topath .
This routine expects a destination file to be absent ; if the destination file is present , it throws an exception .
This , therefore , is not equivalent to the system specified cp command in UNIX .
It is also expected that the frompath variable would refer to a proper regular file .
Consider this example : frompath refers to a symbolic link / tmp / file1 , which in turn refers to a file / tmp / file2 ; topath is , say , /tmp/ file3 .
In this situation , copy_file will fail .
This is yet another difference that this API sports compared to the cp command .
The contents and attributes of the file referred to by is copied to the file referred to by .
This routine ; if the destination file is present , it throws an exception .
This , therefore , is not equivalent to the system specified command in UNIX .
It is also expected that the variable would refer to a proper regular file .
Consider this example : refers to a symbolic link / tmp / file1 , which in turn refers to a file / tmp / file2 ; is , say , /tmp/ file3 .
In this situation , will fail .
This is yet another difference that this API sports compared to the command .
void rename ( const path& frompath , const path& topath ) :
This function is the API for renaming a file .
It is also possible to simultaneously rename and change the location of the file by specifying the full path name in the topath argument , as Listing 8 shows .
Listing 8 .
The rename functionality in Boost #include < stdio.h > # include “ boost/filesystem.hpp ” int main ( ) { boost :: filesystem ::path path ( " /home/user1/abc " ) ; boost : : filesystem : : rename ( path , " / tmp / def " ) ; return 0 ; } // abc is renamed def and moved to /tmp folder
This function is the API for renaming a file .
It is also possible to simultaneously rename and change the location of the file by specifying the full path name in the argument , as Listing 8 shows .
bool remove ( const path& p ) :
This routine attempts to remove the file or directory being referred to by the path p .
In the case of a directory , if the contents of the directory are not already empty , this routine throws an exception .
A word of caution :
This routine does not care what it 's deleting , even if the same file is being simultaneously accessed by other programs !
This routine attempts to remove the file or directory being referred to by the path p .
In the case of a directory , if the contents of the directory are not already empty , this routine throws an exception .
A word of caution :
This routine does not care what it 's deleting , even if the same file is being simultaneously accessed by other programs !
unsigned long remove_all ( const path& p ) :
This API attempts to remove a file or directory referred by path p. Unlike remove , it makes no special consideration for directories that are not empty .
This function is the Boost equivalent of the UNIX rm –rf command .
Utility and predicate functions
The Boost Filesystem Library contains the following utility and predicate functions :
bool exists ( const path& ) :
This function checks for the existence of a file .
The file could be anything : a regular file , a directory , a symbolic link , and so on .
This function checks for the existence of a file .
The file could be anything : a regular file , a directory , a symbolic link , and so on .
bool is_directory ( const path& ) :
This function checks whether a path corresponds to a directory .
This function checks whether a path corresponds to a directory .
bool is_regular ( const path& ) :
This function checks for a normal file ( that is , not a directory , a symbolic link , a socket , or a device file ) .
This function checks for a normal file ( that is , not a directory , a symbolic link , a socket , or a device file ) .
bool is_other ( const path& ) :
Typically , this function checks for device files such as / dev /tty0 or socket files .
Typically , this function checks for device files such as / dev /tty0 or socket files .
bool is_empty ( const path& ) :
If the path corresponds to a folder , this function checks whether the folder is empty and returns True accordingly .
If the path corresponds to a file , this function checks whether file size equals 0 .
In case of hard or symbolic links to a file , this API checks whether the original file is empty .
If the path corresponds to a folder , this function checks whether the folder is empty and returns True accordingly .
If the path corresponds to a file , this function checks whether file size equals 0 .
In case of hard or symbolic links to a file , this API checks whether the original file is empty .
bool equivalent ( const path1& p1 , const path2& p2 ) :
This extremely useful API compares relative - and absolute - style path names .
Consider Listing 9 : Listing 9 .
Testing for the equivalence of two paths # include < stdio.h > # include “ boost/filesystem.hpp ” int main ( ) { boost :: filesystem :: path path1(" /usr/local /include " ) ; // random pathname boost :: filesystem :: path path2( " /tmp/../usr/local/include " ) ; bool result = boost :: filesystem ::is_equivalent ( path1 , path2 ) ; printf ( “ Paths are equivalent : %d
” , result ) ; return 0 ; } // result : 1
This extremely useful API compares relative - and absolute - style path names .
Consider Listing 9 : path system_complete ( const path& ) :
This function is another API along the same lines as bool equivalent ( const path1& p1 , const path2& p2 ) .
Given an arbitrary file path from the current working directory , this API returns the absolute path name of the file .
For example , if the user is in the directory / home / user1 and queries for a file ../ user2/file2 , this function returns / home / user2 / file2 , which is the complete PATHNAME of the file , file2 .
Miscellaneous functions
The Boost Filesystem Library consists of the following miscellaneous functions :
std ::string extension ( const path& ) :
This function returns the extension of a given file name prefixed with a period ( . ) .
For example , for a file with name test.cpp , extension returns .cpp .
In case a file does not have an extension , the function returns an empty string .
In the case of hidden files ( that is , files whose names begin with a . in UNIX systems ) , the function appropriately calculates the extension type or returns empty string ( so , for . test .
profile , this routine returns . profile ) .
This function returns the extension of a given file name prefixed with a period ( ) .
For example , for a file with name test.cpp , returns .
In case a file does not have an extension , the function returns an empty string .
In the case of hidden files ( that is , files whose names begin with a in UNIX systems ) , the function appropriately calculates the extension type or returns empty string ( so , for . test .
profile , this routine returns ) . std::string basename ( const path& ) :
This is the complementary routine to extension :
It returns the string before . in the file name .
Note that even in cases where a absolute file name is provided , this API still returns only that string that directly forms part of the file name , as shown in Listing 10 .
Listing 10 .
Using boost :: basename #include < stdio.h > # include < cstring > # include “ boost/filesystem.hpp ” use namespace std ; int main ( ) { boost : : filesystem :: path path1( " /tmp/dir1/test1.c " ) ; boost : : filesystem :: path path2( " /tmp/dir1/.test1.profile " ) ; string result1 = boost : : filesystem :: basename ( path1 ) ; string result2 = boost : : filesystem :: basename ( path2 ) ; printf ( “ Basename 1 : %s Basename2 : %s
” , result1.c_str ( ) , result2.c_str ( ) ) ; return 0 ; } // result : Basename1 : test1 Basename2 : .test1
This is the complementary routine to :
It returns the string before in the file name .
Note that even in cases where a absolute file name is provided , this API still returns only that string that directly forms part of the file name , as shown in Listing 10 .
std::string change_extension ( const path& oldpath , const std:: string new_extension ) :
This API returns a new string that reflects the changed name .
Note that the file corresponding to oldpath remains unchanged .
This is just a convenience function .
Also note that you must explicitly specify the dot in the extension .
For example , change_extension ( " test.c " , " so " ) results in testso as opposed to test .
so .
Conclusion
This article provided a brief overview of the Boost Filesystem Library .
It 's not to be treated as a comprehensive document of the entire file system interface in Boost .
The internals of the API set are not discussed , nor are the subtleties of these APIs in a non-UNIX or Windows platform such as VMS .

This exclusive new preview clip for Battlestar Galactica season 4 reminds us why the science fiction series ' violent moral ambiguity has made it the most compelling political drama on TV .
Sure the show is about humans fleeing for their lives from cyborgs in space , but it has a realistic , ripped - from - the - headlines urgency that 24 could only dream of .
Even the basic BSG premise sounds familiar : Separatists with a burning desire for religious purity have launched a coordinated nuclear attack on our heroes , who are themselves struggling in a mire of corrupt political leadership and a military gone mad with power .
It just so happens that the separatists are cyborgs called Cylon and the heroes are from a star system halfway across the galaxy from us .
What pleases about BSG , for a mainstream audience not necessarily inclined to freak out over spaceships , is the careful way the show 's creators David Eick and Ronald Moore have created an entire political system for the characters to inhabit .
We are n't just motoring from battle to battle .
Instead , we watch as the human president fights with political pretenders and the military for power over the few thousand people left after the Cylon attack .
There are press conferences and elections , worker strikes and Cylon sympathizers .
The humans even become suicide bombers at one point .
Advertisement
This is n't a show that gives us a simple , Star Wars - style good vs. evil fairy tale .
Everyone , even the steely Cylon , are ambivalent and ethically fungible .
With next season concluding the epic tale of the human and Cylon battle to reach Earth and colonize it first , the action is sure to be intense .
But do n't expect the meaty political allegory to fall by the wayside .
Things are just starting to get interesting .
We 'll be watching characters dealing with a legal battle over who is to blame for last season 's witchhunts , where accused Cylon collaborators were summarily executed without trial .
And the Cylons have started having children with humans , raising the question of whether the us vs. them , human vs. machine binary really makes sense at all .
Advertisement
It 's possible that what allows BSG to be so overtly political , complete with subplots about suicide bombing , is precisely the fact that it 's set in a science fictional world .
There is a narrative comfort zone for audiences :
We do n't have to worry that what we 're watching is about ourselves because it takes place in a fantasy world .
And yet there 's no mistaking the fact that the characters in BSG are us .
And I do n't just mean the humans .
We are the Cylon too .
The new season of BSG starts airing Friday , April 4 on the Sci Fi Channel .

The release of OpenBSD 4.3 is right around the corner .
A group of Undeadly editors was overheard in IRC discussing their favorite new features .
We 've compiled their list here for you to review .
Which are your preferred features , and do you have any unique uses for them ?
Jason Dixon ( jason ) , on snmpd ( 8 ) and simplified carp ( 4 ) load balancing ...
The new snmpd in base is a blessing for those of us managing networks with OpenBSD .
We currently have a dozen or so firewalls and VPN servers in production , and they all use net - snmp 's snmpd .
Net - snmp 's configuration is usable , but unwieldy .
I really appreciate the simplicity of this new snmpd implementation ( along with snmpctl ( 8 ) ) , and am grateful for Reyk Floeter 's ( reyk@ ) hard work on this new feature .
I 've been using carp ( 4 ) for years .
It 's an immensely useful feature and has saved my cookies numerous times .
But one thing that 's always been a minor inconvenience is setting up CARP load balancing .
You 'd have to create multiple interfaces with the same address , manage those hostname .
carp * files , and make sure to get the advskew just right .
While much of the underlying design has n't changed , Marco Pfatschbacher ( mpf@ ) recognized the complexity and made numerous changes to simplify usage .
Rather than creating multiple interfaces with the same address , we can now just create a single carp interface and assign it multiple carpnodes with their respective advskews .
This is a time - saver and should ease troubleshooting across CARP members .
Peter Hessler ( phessler ) is looking forward to the new Intel 2.2.0 Xorg drivers ...
New laptop means new quirks and bugs to deal with .
This time around , the biggie was the screen .
Intel 965 with 4.2 defaulted to 1024x768 , which defeated the purpose of me upgrading to the really nice screen .
Poked around and I found a tool in ports that let me use the native resolution .
Inelegant , because I could n't dynamically resize my screen , use accelerated 2d , or other nifty features of X .
But then the 2.2 Intel drivers were imported , and all of that melted away .
No need for 915 resolution , the screen was natively supported .
Changing resolutions is now as easy as changing my pants .
Watching movies in mplayer is snappier , and uses less CPU .
Connecting to a projector is as simple as running xrandr ( 1 ) .
Fitter , Happier , More Productive .
Paul Greidanus ( paul ) likes the new includes directive for pf.conf ( 5 ) ...
The ability to include multiple files into pf.conf will aid greatly in complex PF rulesets .
For example , an administrator can now have a single ruleset per network , rather then hundreds of lines in their primary pf.conf .
Personally , I have a 550 line pf.conf in front of six interfaces filtering three class - C networks worth of IP addresses .
Being able to distribute filtering logic and policies to dedicated ruleset files will ease administration and increase efficiency .
From pf.conf : Additional configuration files can be included with the include keyword , for example : include " /etc/pf/sub.filter.conf "
The include feature is useful for administrators who might otherwise use anchors , but wish to also store macros and tables in there as well .
There 's probably a lot of interesting uses for this that will be revealed as users adopt OpenBSD 4.3 in production .
Michael Erdely ( merdely ) talks about support for sshd ( 8 ) chroot and how svnd ( 4 ) devices now work on block devices ...
I host a small mail / web server for family and friends .
I 've always wanted to provide a means for my users to manage their websites without giving them access to the whole system .
Along with Match , AllowTcpForwarding , X11 Forwarding , ForceCommand and ChrootDirectory ( previously reported ) , I can provide the access I want without relying on FTP + chroot , FTP +ssl+chroot ( w/ pure - ftpd ) , scponly , some systrace hack or some third party ssh hack .
Here 's a quick list of steps I used to make ChrootDirectory work : mkdir -p /var/www/sites/user1/home/user1/www
Add user1 to wwwusers in /etc/ group
Add to /etc/ssh/ sshd_config : Match Group wwwusers X11 Forwarding no AllowTcpForwarding no ForceCommand internal - sftp ChrootDirectory
/ var/www/ sites /%u
: If using public - key authentication , copy authorized_keys file to /var/www/sites/user1/home/user1/.ssh and create a symlink to / var/www/sites/user1/home/user1 in /home .
and create a symlink to in .
Configure web server to point to / var/www/ sites/user1/home/user1/www for user1's website .
Using / var / www / sites / %u ensures that user1 can only see user1 's home directory .
The lines in sshd_config also prevent ssh tunneling and X11 forwarding .
To add more users , add them to wwwusers and create , for example , / var/www/sites/user2/home/user2/www .
For backing up my systems , I chose to use an external USB disk with Bacula to store the monthly full backups .
I 'll take that disk off - site during the month while incremental backups are stored on a local disk .
Because I 'll be storing my USB disk offsite where others may have access to the drive , I want to encrypt the disk : sd0a already exists , is empty and takes up the entire disk
Create the encrypted " disk " : vnconfig - ck svnd1 / dev/sd0a
Partition the encrypted " disk " : fdisk - i svnd1
Create a disklabel on svnd1 ( I used the whole disk for a )
Format the disk : newfs - O2 / dev/rsvnd1a Lastly , I mount / dev/rsvnd1a as /usb and configure Bacula to use File Media Type storage in /usb .
Janne Johansson ( jj ) , on large filesystem ( > 2TB ) support and spinlock improvements for SMP arches ...
I like the incremental way support has been added in order to support large ( 2TB ) file systems .
The way is has been done at other places seems to me to have included far too much bridge - burning decisions and handling the inevitable fallout , whereas the OpenBSD devs in this case made neat step - by - step evolution even when the results were n't visible in order to finally reach a point where all parts simultaneously support really large file systems and small file systems beyond the 2 + TB boundary .
OpenBSD 4.3 will have spinlock improvements for SMP arches .
This one , even though it might not be the shocker of the century , is one of my favourites .
Sometimes , someone decides not to go for the sexy stuff but rather dig into one particular hot spot and comes out with a performance improvement no one knew was to be found .
So for this point , looking at how the SMP system behaves while spinning ( which of course is a major point for kernels that do n't have fine - grained locking yet ) gives us a neat boost while waiting for non-biglocked kernels .
The fact that the improvements are good and usable for all the current SMP platforms also adds bonus points in my book .

John McCain ’s been getting kid - glove treatment from the press for years , ever since he wriggled free of the Keating scandal and his profitable association – another collaboration , you might say — with the nation ’s top bank swindler in the 1980s .
But nothing equals the astounding tact with which his claque on the press bus avoids the topic of McCain ’s collaborating with his Vietnamese captors after he ’d been shot down .
How McCain behaved when he was a prisoner is key .
McCain is probably the most unstable man ever to have got this close to the White House .
He ’s one election away from it .
Republican senator Thad Cochrane has openly said he trembles at the thought of an unstable McCain in the Oval Office with his finger on the nuclear trigger .
What if a private memory of years of collaboration in his prison camp gnaws at McCain , and bursts out in his paroxysms of uncontrollable fury , his rantings about “ gooks ” and his terrifying commitment to a hundred years of war in Iraq .
What if “ the hero ” knows he ’s a phony ?
Doug Valentine has written the definitive history of the Phoenix Program in Vietnam .
He knows about the POW experience .
His dad , an Army man , was captured by the Japanese and sent to a POW camp in the Philippines for forced labor .
Many of his mates died .
Doug wrote a marvelous book about it , The Hotel Tacloban .
Now Valentine has picked up the unexploded bomb lying on McCain ’s campaign trail this year .
As he points out , he ’s not the first .
Rumors and charges have long swirled around McCain ’s conduct as a prisoner .
Fellow prisoners have given the lie to McCain ’s claims .
But Valentine has assembled the dossier .
It ’s devastating .
We ’re running it in our current CounterPunch newsletter and we strongly urge you to subscribe .
Some excerpts from Valentine ’s indictment .
“ War is one thing , collaborating with the enemy is another ; it is a legitimate campaign issue that strikes at the heart of McCain ’s character .
. . or lack thereof .
In occupied countries like Iraq , or France in World War II , collaboration to that extent spells an automatic death sentence .. . . The question is : What kind of collaborator was John McCain , the admitted war criminal who will hate the Vietnamese for the rest of his life ?
“ Put it another way : how psychologically twisted is McCain ?
And what actually happened to him in his POW camp that twisted him ?
Was it abuse , as he claims , or was it the fact that he collaborated and has to cover up ?
Covering - up can take a lot of energy .
The truth is lurking there in his subconscious , waiting to explode .
” “ McCain had a unique POW experience .
Initially , he was taken to the infamous Hanoi Hilton prison camp , where he was interrogated .
By McCain ’s own account , after three or four days he cracked .
He promised his Vietnamese captors , “ I ’ll give you military information if you will take me to the hospital … “ His Vietnamese captors soon realized their POW , John Sidney McCain III , came from a well - bred line in the American military elite . . . The Vietnamese realized , this poor stooge has propaganda value .
The admiral ’s boy was used to special treatment , and his captors knew that .
They were working him . ” “. . . two weeks into his stay at the Vietnamese hospital , the Hanoi press began quoting him .
It was not ‘ name rank and serial number , or kill me ’. as specified by the military code of conduct .
McCain divulged specific military information : he gave the name of the aircraft carrier on which he was based , the number of U.S. pilots that had been lost , the number of aircraft in his flight formation , as well as information about the location of rescue ships . ”
“ … McCain was held for five and half years .
The first two weeks ’ behavior might have been pragmatism , but McCain soon became North Vietnam ’s go - to collaborator …..
McCain cooperated with the North Vietnamese for a period of three years .
His situation is n’t as innocuous as that of the French barber who cuts the hair of the German occupier .
McCain was repaying his captors for their kindness and mercy .
“ This is the lesson of McCain ’s experience as a POW : a true politician , a hollow man , his only allegiance is to power .
The Vietnamese , like McCain ’s campaign contributors today , protected and promoted him , and , in return , he danced to their tune . . . ”

Top 10 Things I Most Dread About the Travel Process
Every trip has its phases – the idea moment and getting excited about it ( unless it ’s a business trip , of course ) , planning out the details , the logistics of getting there , the reality ( and sometimes disappointments ) of being there , and finally , the filtered memories you keep with you afterwards .
I always manage to filter out the minor annoyances of the logistics of the Getting
There phase in my memories but in a recent trip to New York I found myself noticing the little unnecessary steps one takes that end up piling up to disdain for authorities that regulate our vacation time .
As if they did n’t want us to have a terribly good time , just a good time , or as if they wanted us to appreciate just how great we have it once we ’ve paid our respects to the travel authorities .
Yet another factor beyond our control is the choice of our flight companions which can also have an impact on our enjoyment of getting to our destinations .
Below is my list of ‘ Top 10 Things I Most Dread About the Travel Process ’ .
1. Security –
My biggest pet peeve about the travel process has to do with the security dance .
Everyone dreads going through security not because they are hiding something from authorities but , rather , because the procedures and attitudes of the guards make you feel like they must know something you do n’t know and you must have something to hide if they ’re so upset to see you .
I mean , how many times do they really need to see our boarding pass in the span of two metres , before you reach the security belt and then again just before your stuff goes into the X -ray , as you ’re maneuvering coat and shoes in a separate bin ( ‘ do I need to remove my shoes or are these ok ? ’ ) , laptop in another bin , bags lying down flat , no coins in your pocket , take off your belt , did I wear a plastic hairclip or a metal one ?
Then , just when you think you ’re ready , ‘ Boarding pass , please !’.
‘ But , it ’s inside my bag under the X - ray … ( and I just showed it to someone else not five seconds ago ! ) ’.
‘ Ma’am , we need to see your boarding pass before your bags go through .
Get her bag out of there so she can get her boarding pass . ’
Is this all really necessary ?
Would n’t lines go faster and people be happier if we all agreed to cooperate a little ?
2. Early check in – Receiving your boarding pass at the check in desk to realize you ’re sitting in row 34A – that ’s the window seat on the last row by the bathroom , of course – and that ’s not next to your travel partner , even though you both pre-selected a seat upon purchase and showed up 2 hours early for your flight is a little disappointing .
Most keen travelers had already checked in 48 hours before departure !
How far ahead do we really need to think about where we ’re going to be sitting on our trip ?
It seems to be way earlier than I tend to .
3. B.O. –
These days we have some control over where on the plane we sit , window , aisle , front , back , if we ’re organized enough .
What we have absolutely no control over is who we sit next to .
There is nothing more disappointing than getting a whiff of some unknown smells as you sit down and realizing they are emanating from the person with whom fate has chosen you share the next few hours , almost as a rite of passage to begin your well - deserved vacation .
How high can I turn up that vent on top of me ?
4 . Sitting next to a chatter or snorer –
You finally are about to take off , the rocking of the plane is lulling you to sleep , you ’re so looking forward to dozing off and digging into that novel you ca n’t wait to get started on after waking up … except , the guy next to you ca n’t wait to strike a conversation and wants to hear all about where you ’re going and why .
You subtly scan the plane for any empty seats .
Nothing .
Right , oversold flight …
The other , slightly less annoying case , is the snorer who interrupts your sleep and reading ambitions with his noises .
Afraid all we can do here is avoid eye contact ( how anti-social , I know ) and always carry earphones .
5 . No blankets / pillows on a transcontinental flight – I find it almost irresponsible that some airlines do not provide enough blankets for all their passengers on long , specially over - night flights .
I ’ve caught a few colds on flights that are too cold or the blankets too small or non-existent so now I always carry an extra sweater or scarf to make sure I ’m prepared for airlines that are not equipped for a full flight or inconsiderate passengers who hoard blankets .
Better than arriving at your destination with a sore throat .
6 . Your seat does n’t recline and you ’re embarking on a 7 hour flight where you were hoping to catch up on sleep .
Most airlines have taken care of this annoyance but keep in mind that sometimes emergency exit rows or last rows have seats that do n’t recline .
7 . Finally getting your food and drinks when the plane starts going through serious turbulence .
We ’ve all been there .
I once ended up with a full cup of hot coffee all over me on my way to a business meeting and had no change of clothes so had sit through a whole day smelling like coffee .
Luckily I was wearing dark brown pants that morning .
I always wore dark pants when traveling to business meetings first thing in the morning after that , just in case .
8. Impatient boarders -
There is a reason planes have a system for boarding planes starting from back to front .
Most people these days respect the system but you will still get those impatient travelers who think there is an advantage to boarding before everyone else , even if they ’re sitting in the front few rows .
Not only do they look silly as other travelers pass them on their way back , knowing that they broke the cardinal rule of boarding a plane , but they do cause disruptions that slow down boarding and , in some cases , even departure .
9. Bathroom smokers -
Do they really think we ca n’t smell them ?
It just amazes me that people still risk getting a few puffs in during a flight when smoking has been banned for years .
10 . Crying babies - I put this as the last on my list because babies are lovely creatures not to be blamed for being in a plane in the first place .
Also , being a future mom , I have to sympathize with all the parents out there that are courageous enough to lug their small babies to visit families or to continue exploring the world with them .
But one cannot help but be a bit disappointed when spotting a baby as approaching your row .
In my experience , the initial worry is much greater than the annoyance turns out to be , as most babies eventually do cave in to sleep , but it is part of the experience of travel in any case .
We would love to hear any of your personal ' Top 10 ' that we have not included on our list .
The important thing as I mention in the beginning is that in spite of all these things we still choose to go out and explore the world and leave it to selective memory to erase the minor annoyances in between .

Travel Advice & Recommendations From Local Experts
To let you in on what this is about , you have to know that according to a study conducted by some very important and serios medical researchers , 33 % of popular songs contain explicit content and 42 % of songs hint at substance abuse .
Aw man , this was obvious for everybody !
If even Kylie hints at drug abuse , where ’s this world going to ?
( From her song called Red blooded woman : “ You ’ll never get to Heaven , if your scared of getting high ” ) .
As the study goes to show , rap had the highest offense ratio with 77 % of songs making reference to drugs or sex .
This should n’t surprise nobody ; but what should surprise you , is the runner up .
Take a guess !
If you guessed country , well , you ’re right !
Country music has a 36 % explicit content rate .
Another surprise is the fact that only 14 % of rock songs contain offending lyrics .
Where ’d “ Sex , drugs and rock ’n’ roll ” go ?
Those were the days .
These conclusions are nothing new ( except for country music ! ) , but how exactly did they get to these precise numbers ?
Well , they analyzed the lyrics of a total of 287 songs from 2005 that encompassed all musical genres .
Can you imagine the incredible amount of tracks that come out every year ?
Can you imagine how many country songs there are ?
I seriously doubt that by looking at just 287 tunes you can draw the line .
But wait , there ’s more .
To add to the further uselessness of this study , the researchers say that they have absolutely no idea how these lyrics affect the public .
This reminds us of the study led by the russian scientist who does n’t know what irony is which tried to say that heavy metal was about satan .
Looking forward to a study about emo .
The results far exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts .
They had expected $ 1.07 cents a share and revenue of $ 6.96 billion , according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg .
Image Steven P. Jobs , Apples chief executive , said increased traffic at the companys retail stores led to stronger sales .

The company , based in Cupertino , Calif. , also forecast strong sales in the coming months .
Peter Oppenheimer , Apple ’s chief financial officer , said the company expected third - quarter revenue of about $ 7.2 billion and earnings of about $ 1 a share .
Apple ’s stock has declined 17.9 percent since the beginning of January when it peaked near $ 200 a share .
After drifting below $ 120 a share , the stock has begun to recover since March .
Shares on Wednesday closed up , rising $ 2.69 to $ 162.89 , but then declined 26 cents , to $ 162.63 in after - hours trading over concerns that Apple ’s profit margins were weaker than analysts expected .
If there is a weak spot in the company ’s battle plan , it may be the iPhone smartphone , which has had stellar sales in the United States , but has showed weakness in Europe .
Apple said it sold 1.7 million iPhones for the quarter .
“ In my mind iPhone sales were soft , ” said Charles Wolf , a financial analyst at Needham & Company .
“ It ’s a question of the distribution model and of the price .
The price clearly has to come down . ”
Apple ’s executives said the sales of iPhones exceeded internal company projections during the quarter .
Analysts and the industry are expecting Apple to introduce a higher performing version of the iPhone within the next two months , made for faster 3G data - oriented cellular networks .
Mr. Jobs is under pressure to meet his 10 million iPhone sales forecast by the end of 2008 .
To meet that goal the company needs a second - generation iPhone , and it may also need to push the price of the existing $ 399 iPhone down significantly or introduce a stripped - down model .
Analysts have said that as the second quarter progressed , demand for Apple ’s iPhone increased and that the computer maker was unable to keep up with demand .
The supply issue could have been affected by the limited availability of 16 - gigabyte flash memory chips , Mr. Wolf speculated .
Dem group : ' McSame as Bush '
Greg Sargent gets a copy of the first ad from the Campaign to defend America , which he reports is running in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
It 's an early foray to by a group that has access to the money from major players -- from SEIU to Soros to a range of other wealthy donors -- and is likely to be a major player in the general election .
( Updates with police )
BAGHDAD , March 31 ( Reuters ) - A mortar barrage hit Baghdad 's heavily fortified Green Zone , which houses Iraq 's government and the U.S. embassy , police said , a day after Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr ordered his fighters to stand down .
The Green Zone has come under intense mortar and rocket attack over the past week as Mehdi Army fighters loyal to Sadr have battled Iraqi and U.S. security forces in the capital and in southern Iraq .
On Sunday Sadr ordered the Mehdi Army to stop fighting Iraqi security forces and to withdraw from the streets .
But the cleric has previously acknowledged there are rogue elements within the militia that have disobeyed a truce he first called last year .
A siren wailed inside the U.S. - protected compound in central Baghdad and a recorded voice warned people to take cover amid the sound of explosions , Reuters witnesses said .
A dust storm enveloping the city made it difficult to see where the missiles were landing , but police said a volley of at least six mortars had hit the Green Zone .
They had no details of any casualties .
A U.S. embassy spokesman was not immediately available for comment .
The embassy has ordered staff in the zone to stay under cover where possible and wear body armour and helmets when in the open .

States quietly buy , mine personal data -- including names of your associates and relatives John Byrne

The government is rounding up your cell phone numbers , insurance claims , credit reports , financial records , and the names of your associates and relatives and sharing them with law enforcement officials nationwide .
They may even have your unlisted iPhone number .
But it 's not President George W. Bush , who 's taken fire over his warrantless wiretapping program , or the National Security Agency , which oversaw the interception of Americans ' calls overseas .
It 's your state .
So - called " fusion centers " set up after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks collect , store and analyze commercial and public data on unknown millions of Americans .
Little is known about the centers , though they received $ 254 million from the Department of Homeland Security between 2004 and 2007 .
Documents obtained by the Washington Post 's Robert O'Harrow Jr. for Wednesday 's papers reveal that the centers -- which have flown beneath the public 's radar -- have information that now includes unlisted cell phone numbers , insurance claims , driver 's license photographs , credit reports and even top - secret data systems at the CIA .
" Dozens of the organizations known as fusion centers were created after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks to identify potential threats and improve the way information is shared , " O'Harrow says .
" The centers use law enforcement analysts and sophisticated computer systems to compile , or fuse , disparate tips and clues and pass along the refined information to other agencies .
They are expected to play important roles in national information - sharing networks that link local , state and federal authorities and enable them to automatically sift their storehouses of records for patterns and clues . "
A document obtained by the paper lists " resources " used by fusion centers in the Northeastern United States .
The paper notes that " details have come to light at a time of debate about domestic intelligence efforts ... and whether the government has enough protections to prevent abuses , " suggesting they were leaked to influence the debate .
Congress has refused to pass legislation granting telecommunications companies retroactive immunity for participating in what many critics believe was illegal wiretapping .
The fusion centers also have subscriptions to information systems that provide information on Americans ' locations , fiancial holdings , associates , relatives and firearms licenses .
" Pennsylvania buys credit reports and uses face - recognition software to examine driver 's license photos , while analysts in Rhode Island have access to car - rental databases , " O'Harrow writes .
" In Maryland , authorities rely on a little - known data broker called Entersect , which claims it maintains 12 billion records about 98 percent of Americans . "
Entersect boasts that it holds records for the private cellphone numbers of Americans .
" There is never ever enough information when it comes to terrorism " remarked Maj .
Steven G. O'Donnell , deputy superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police , in a comment to O'Harrow .
" That 's what post - 9/11 is about . "
Massachusetts taps an information broker to get access to unlisted cell and landline phone numbers and another to get access to information on insurance claims , casualty claims and property claims .
Ohio has access to an FBI ' secret level repository , ' O'Harrow said .
Rhode Island , meanwhile , can query CIA databases .
" Officials at the Rhode Island State Police , FBI and CIA declined to discuss the system and the kinds of information it contains , " Harrow wrote .
Eights months ago , I said that this was the best Daily Show clip I 've seen in a while .
Well , Thursday night Jon Stewart and Jon Oliver out - did themselves .
I present to you ... The Rise and Fall of FOX News .

If there was ever a six minute video clip that could encapsulated what FOX has done to this country in the past 10 + years , this it it .
Update : John Amato :
Stewart : What Jon is the purpose of the documentary ?
Oliver : Simply to judge the president before history gets it 's chance .
FOX Host : From the beginning George W. Bush has been frequently ridiculed for his speaking style , now seven years later he 's credited with some of the most eloquent and visionary speeches ever delivered by an American President .
Stewart :
Who has credited him with that ?
Oliver :
That guy , just , just now , the guy on TV .
You just saw him .
You see , FOX News understands that a man 's legacy is not defined not by what the man does , but by what people on television say he does about him .
There is no truer statement , " my friends . "
Then we get to see the treatment of Obama , Clinton and McCain through their warped eyes .
The Special Bond Between Catholics and Jews
Before he was murdered by Islamic terrorists , journalist Daniel Pearl said , " My father is Jewish ; my mother is Jewish ; I am Jewish . "
After he spoke those words , his captors decapitated him .
I believe Pearl 's words should become part of the Jewish prayer book and recited every day by Jews .
I am not an observant Jew .
But I love God and I believe God loves me .
I attend synagogue on special occasions and always on the high holidays of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur .
I have had Pearl 's last words carved into the tombstone which will adorn my grave upon my death , which I hope wo n't be for another eight to ten years .
My tombstone will also have etched upon it the most important prayer in the Jewish religion , " Hear O Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is One . "
For good measure , my tombstone will carry that brief prayer in Hebrew and in English , as well as in transliteration , so that those unable to read Hebrew will be able to chant along with those who do .
I have always believed that there is a special bond between Jews and Catholics , and have made it a personal and professional priority to strengthen that bond .
In the modern era , the relationship between Jews and Catholics became solidified with Vatican II under Pope John XXIII .
More recently , the bond was further strengthened during the reign of Pope John Paul II who made clear his love and respect for the Jewish people by referring to us as the " elder brothers . "
Pope John Paul II extended Vatican diplomatic recognition to Israel , rejecting the threats of those who he called " Koranic " opponents .
His closeness to the Jewish people was demonstrated by his recognition that the special bond that existed between God and the children of Israel is an enduring one .
I am not a religious scholar , nor observant in the rites of my religion , but I am moved by two practices that occur , one in the synagogue and the other in the Catholic Church .
I attend Park East Synagogue , which is led by Rabbi Arthur Schneier .
I am most emotionally affected by that moment in the High Holiday service when the Rabbi with others - me among them - walk from the altar through the synagogue with two Torahs - the five books of Moses written on scrolls -- carried on the shoulders of two congregants .
The other congregants move forward to touch those scrolls with their tallises ( prayer shawls ) , which they first kiss .
On many occasions , I have carried the Torah on my shoulders and feel my eyes well up with tears as the hands move out to touch the scrolls .
The delight and emotions of the faithful who touch the Torahs is palpable .
Catholics must feel similarly moved when they receive communion .
Some receive the consecrated wafer from the priest into their own hands , while others receive it on their tongues .
When that happens , the communicants generally make the sign of the cross , hold their hands together and walk off with an aura of purity and in a state of grace for those few moments of the Mass .
Their eyes convey the same rapture that I see in the eyes of Jews kissing the Torah .
I see that state of exaltation when I attend Christmas Midnight Mass and St. Patrick 's Day Mass every year at the request of the presiding Cardinal .
My special relationship with Cardinal O' Connor is well known in this city .
I treasured his friendship and loved him as a brother .
His funeral Mass Card bearing his picture has remained on my desk since his death , almost eight years ago .
I believe that he saved my life .
During the corruption crisis I was contemplating suicide and his telephone call one Sunday morning to tell me not to despair , that he knew I was in a state of depression and that he wanted me to know that , as he put it , " Everybody knows you are an honest man , " and not involved with those who had engaged in corruption .
When I thanked him and told him how important his call was to me , he said , " No , not at all important , " and I replied , " Oh , yes , it is , Your Eminence , the Lubavitcher Rebbe did not call me , you did . "
This past week , at the invitation of my Rabbi , Arthur Schneier , I attended the first event of its kind : the visit by the current Pope , Benedict XVI , a close friend and ally of John Paul II , to an American synagogue .
Historically , only three papal visits to synagogues have ever occurred .
John Paul II visited a synagogue in Rome .
Benedict XVI visited one in Germany and made the visit on Friday to Park East Synagogue .
The Pope was warmly received by those in attendance , a small group of about 100 congregants and about 20 Cardinals , Archbishops and Bishops who were part of the Pope 's contingent .
The Pope wore his traditional white garments , including a white skull cap .
The Bishops wore their black cassocks and red skull caps .
The rabbi wore his traditional black robes and black skull cap .
The rabbi spoke lovingly and appreciatively of the Pope 's visit .
The children 's choir sang .
The Pope responded eloquently , saying , " Shalom !
It is with joy that I come here , just a few hours before the celebration of your Pesach , to express my respect and esteem for the Jewish community in New York City .... I find it moving to recall that Jesus , as a young boy , heard the words of Scripture and prayed in a place such as this . "
Pictures were taken with the Pope and gifts were exchanged by the rabbi and the Pope .
Earlier in the week , I was asked by a reporter how I felt about the Pope 's approving a prayer asking for the conversion of the Jewish people to Catholicism .
The reporter said that many Jews were upset with the prayer .
I said I was not and considered the Catholic desire that we join them in conversion as a compliment .
" They love us and they want us even closer " were my words .
I also said , " I hope they convert to Judaism .
Then , instead of there being only 13 million Jews worldwide , there would be 1 billion 13 million Jews , and that would be very comforting . "
There is little chance of either happening .
Nevertheless , until the Messiah arrives and leads us all into heaven , we should unite , if not in liturgy and dogma , then in our common goals of love of God , charity and good deeds , as well as standing up to Islamic terrorists who make no bones about their desire to kill the Jews , whom they refer to as the sons of apes and pigs , and the Christians , whom they derisively call Crusaders .
Together we can defend ourselves and win in the war against the terrorists who threaten us daily .

Sacramento , California ( March 31 , 2008 ) – A federal judge has ordered California State Employees Association ( CSEA ) union officials to offer rebates to up to 28,000 state employees who are not union members .
Imposing a “ special assessment ” in addition to mandatory dues , union officials seized an additional 25 % of forced union dues to wage their campaign against Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s modest reform measures on the 2005 ballot .
The ruling stems from a class - action civil rights complaint , filed by nine state government employees ( union members and nonmembers ) with free legal assistance from the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation .
The complaint sought a ruling that would require union officials to give employees due process , including proper financial disclosure , a formal notice that they may reclaim the special assessment spent for electioneering , and rebates , plus interest , to all who request them .
CSEA union officials had imposed on government employees a so - called “ Emergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Political Fight - Back Fund ” for a broad range of political activities .
Union officials openly admitted that the “ Fund will not be used for regular costs of the union , ” but for political advertising , direct mail , and get - out - the - vote activities .
By levying this mid-year “ special assessment , ” CSEA officials illegally jacked up and spent employees ’ mandatory payments by between 25 - 36 % without even allowing those employees who were not union members to opt out of paying for such activities .
Union officials raised over $ 12 million through the special assessment and spent many millions more using regular dues .
Approximately $ 3 million of this was taken from nonmembers .
Morrison C. England Jr. , a U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of California , noted that “ a contrary decision from the one reached today would allow unions to run roughshod over dissenting nonmembers … ”
CSEA union officials must now provide the nonunion state employees with a financial disclosure , notice that they may object to the use of these forced union dues for political activities , and refunds to all who object in response to the new disclosure .
“ Although this is an encouraging victory for these employees , this ruling underscores the gross injustice of forced unionism that exists in California , ” stated National Right to Work Foundation Vice President Stefan Gleason .
“ Only a Right to Work law banning forced union dues altogether will give Golden State employees meaningful protection from similar abuses of their constitutional rights . ”
In the Foundation - won U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson , the High Court ruled that public employees have due process rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to be notified of how their forced union dues are spent , and how to prevent the spending of their dues for union political activities .
However , CSEA union officials did not give public employees any opportunity to object to the special assessment .

Ice cores are essential for climate research , because they represent the only archive which allows direct measurements of atmospheric composition and greenhouse gas concentrations in the past .
Using novel isotopic studies , scientists from the European Project for Ice Coring In Antarctica ( EPICA ) were now able to identify the most important processes responsible for changes in natural methane concentrations over the transition from the last ice age into our warm period .
The study , published in Nature , shows that wetland regions emitted significantly less methane during glacial times .
In contrast methane emissions by forest fire activity remained surprisingly constant from glacial to interglacial times .
Members of the EPICA team publish new insights into natural changes in the atmospheric concentrations of the second most important greenhouse gas methane ( CH 4 ) .
The scientist present the first glacial / interglacial record of the carbon isotopic composition of methane ( ´ 13CH 4 ) providing essential information on the sources being responsible for the observed CH 4 concentration changes .
The well known glacial / interglacial changes in atmospheric methane concentrations are quite drastic .
Glacial concentration were on average 350 ppbv ( part per billion by volume ) and increased to approximately 700 ppbv during the last glacial / interglacial transition superimposed by rapid shifts of about 200 ppbv connected to rapid climate changes .
During the last centuries human methane emissions artificially increased CH 4 concentrations to approximately 1750 ppbv .
But what caused these substantial changes in natural atmospheric CH 4 concentrations prior to the human impact ?
To answer this question , the scientists developed a new analytical method that now allows to quantify changes in the isotopic ratio of 12CH 4 and 13CH 4 in ice core samples .
This ratio provides insight into the responsible methane sources .
" These studies bring us much closer to a quantitative understanding of what happened with wetlands and methane in the past " , says Dr. Hubertus Fischer from the Alfred - Wegener - Institute for Polar and Marine Research , who is the lead author of the publication and coordinator of the gas studies on the EPICA ice cores .
" This is essential to also improve our predictions of how the methane cycle will respond to an increased warming in the future " , he adds .
The study shows , that tropical wetlands emitted substantially less CH 4 during glacials ; most likely caused by changes in monsoonal precipitation patterns .
Together with a reduced atmospheric lifetime , this explains major parts of the glacial CH 4 reduction .
In addition , boreal methane sources located in wetlands in higher northern latitudes were essentially switched off during the glacial due to the expansion of the northern ice sheets and the very cold temperatures in high northern latitude .
However , these high latitude wetlands were quickly reactivated when rapid climate warming events occurred .
Also forest fires emit a considerable amount of CH 4 , which , however , remained surprisingly constant over time .
The isotopic measurements show no signs of CH 4 emissions by a destabilization of marine gas hydrate reservoirs when climate was warming .
The current results were published by a team of scientist from Germany , France and Switzerland .
As the German partner within EPICA , the Alfred - Wegener - Institute was responsible for the drilling operation of the ice core used for this study .
In addition , it specialized on the development of new analytical techniques to measure isotopes in greenhouse gases and the interpretation of changes in biogeochemical cycles in the past .
Coordinated by the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) , EPICA is funded by the participating countries and the European Union .
EPICA is one of the core projects of the AWI Research Program " Maritime , Coastal and Polar Systems " in the " Earth and Environment " research section of the Helmholtz - Gemeinschaft .
For its outstanding effort and large impact on climate research , EPICA has recently received the Descartes Prize for Transnational , Collaborative Research awarded by the European Commission .
The manuscript " Changing boreal methane sources and constant biomass burning during the last termination " by Fischer et al. will be published in Nature on April 17 , 2008 .
Collecting rainwater for use during dry months in rain barrels or other depositories is an ancient and traditional practice .
Historical records show that rainwater was collected in simple clay containers as far back as 2,000 years ago in Thailand , and throughout other areas of the world after that .
With the rising price of municipal water and drought restrictions now facing much of the United States during the summer months , more and more homeowners in our own modern society are turning to the harvesting of rainwater to save money and protect this precious natural resource .
It is a common belief in many parts of the world that water is an infinite resource to exploit as needed , but as the saying goes , “ you do n’t know the value of water until the well is running dry . ”
This is especially true in arid parts of the U.S. where most of the municipal water comes from overstressed underground aquifers .
Whereas rainwater is considered a renewable natural resource , many aquifers are being “ mined , ” that is , communities are drawing out more water than the aquifer naturally receives to recharge it .
As drought and aquifer mining begin to call attention to an increasing water crisis , people are seeking ways minimize impact on their municipal water supplies .
Rain barrels can be part of the solution .
Just look outside your window the next time it rains and imagine all the water that ’s running down your driveway being put to beneficial use in your home and garden !
PRINCETON , NJ -- While 61 % of Americans say the effects of global warming have already begun , just a little more than a third say they worry about it a great deal , a percentage that is roughly the same as the one Gallup measured 19 years ago .
Despite the enormous attention paid to global warming over the past several years , the average American is in some ways no more worried about it than in years past .
Americans do appear to have become more likely to believe global warming 's effects are already taking place and that it could represent a threat to their way of life during their lifetimes .
But the American public is more worried about a series of other environmental concerns than about global warming , and there has been no consistent upward trend on worry about global warming going back for two decades .
Additionally , only a little more than a third of Americans say that immediate , drastic action is needed in order to maintain life as we know it on the planet .
These results are from Gallup 's annual Environment poll , conducted March 6 - 9 , 2008 .
Understanding Global Warming
Eighty percent of Americans say they understand the issue of global warming , a percentage that is up significantly from 16 years ago , when only 53 % said they understood the issue .
Self - reported understanding of global warming has increased slightly throughout this decade , as measured in Gallup 's annual Environment study , from 69 % who said they understood global warming very or fairly well in March 2001 to today 's 80 % .
The percentage of Americans who understand global warming " very well " has been steady at a relatively low 21 % to 22 % for the last three years .
Effects of Global Warming Already Beginning ?
Slightly less than half of Americans in 1997 said the effects of global warming had already begun to happen .
That number has risen , particularly in the past two years , to the point where today 61 % say the effects have already begun to happen at this point in time .
About one out of four Americans , however , continue to say the effects of global warming will not happen in their lifetimes , if ever .
Threat ?
There has also been an uptick in the percentage of Americans who say global warming will pose a serious threat to them in their lifetimes , from 25 % in 1997 to 40 % today .
Even with this increase over the last 11 years , the fact remains that still less than a majority of Americans , at this point , believe global warming will pose a serious threat to them in their lifetimes .
Worry ?
The fact that a majority of Americans do n't believe global warming will pose a threat to them in their lifetimes makes it perhaps less surprising to find that significantly less than a majority of Americans say they worry a great deal about it .
In fact , worry about global warming is low on a list of 12 environmental problems that Gallup asks about in the Environment surveys .
There is , in fact , little more evidence of worry about global warming now than there was when this question was first asked in 1989 .
Since that time , there has been change , with the worry a " great deal " percentage rising to 40 % in 2000 , before dropping back from 2002 to 2004 , and now increasing some over the last three years .
This year 's " great deal " worry number is slightly lower than last year 's high to date of 41 % .
This is not to say that Americans totally dismiss global warming .
About two - thirds say they worry a great deal or a fair amount about it , and only 17 % say they do n't worry at all about it .
Still , the trend data suggest that despite the growing attention to and emphasis on global warming in recent years , there has been no consistent increase in worry about it since Gallup began asking the question way back in 1989 .
Drastic Action Needed for Environment ?
A Gallup Poll question asks Americans whether " additional , immediate , and drastic action " is necessary concerning the environment , and in this year 's update , about a third answer " yes . "
That number is down slightly from last year and , stretching back in time , is roughly the same as was measured in a 1995 poll .
The only other three years in which Gallup has measured this variable were from 2001 to 2003 , when a slightly lower percentage of Americans advocated drastic action .
Implications
From a broad perspective , Gallup 's data tracking Americans ' perceptions of the environment are somewhat mixed .
On some dimensions , Americans clearly demonstrate a reaction to the growing discussion and emphasis on global warming in the media and indeed as part of the popular culture .
Americans now are more likely than they have been in the past to claim understanding of global warming , to recognize that global warming could be a threat in their lifetimes , and to say the effects of global warming have already begun .
At the same time , however , Gallup 's broad measure of worry about environmental issues does not show a concomitant increase in concern .
Although there have been fluctuations on this measure of worry over the years , the percentage of Americans who worry a great deal about global warming is no higher now than it was 19 years ago .
And the percentage who do worry a great deal -- 37 % -- is still well less than a majority , and in fact lower than the percentage who worry a great deal about such environmental issues as pollution of drinking water , pollution of lakes and reservoirs , and toxic waste in the soil .

Making a commitment to love myself ,
Trying to understand my value as a single Jewish woman ,
Nobody with a functioning memory should be too quick to condemn Jimmy Carter for daring to speak with the leadership of Hamas , as nearly everyone along the American political spectrum suddenly has felt obliged to do .
From Condoleezza Rice and John McCain to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , along with every congressional backbencher in both parties , expressions of disapproval have rained down upon the former president , who is old enough and tough enough to pursue his own beliefs to their logical conclusion .
“ The United States is not going to deal with Hamas , ” said the secretary of state , “ and we had certainly told President Carter that we did not think meeting with Hamas was going to help . ”
The justification for that policy was explained helpfully by Obama , whose willingness to meet with foreign adversaries does not extend to Hamas , at least not during the primary season .
The Illinois senator “ does not support negotiations with Hamas until they renounce terrorism , recognize Israel ’s right to exist , and abide by past agreements , ” according to a spokesman for his presidential campaign .
As for McCain , he reacted reflexively and demagogically , which should come as no surprise .
He denounced any engagement with Hamas as a “ grave and dangerous mistake ” and scorched Carter for meeting with “ a terrorist group that has also killed innocent Americans . ”
A moronic congresswoman from North Carolina — who will have to live a very long time before she achieves a tiny fraction of what Carter has — proposed to revoke his passport .
Certainly Carter understands the nature of Hamas , an Islamist group not so different in its orientation from the radical students whose takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran ultimately ended his presidency .
What he also understands these many years later is that those once shunned as terrorists and criminals , forever beyond redemption , may eventually be recognized as the only possible partners in negotiation .
For that , of course , is the very transformation he has observed in the Palestine Liberation Organization during the past three decades .
When Carter hosted the historic Camp David meetings that established peace between Israel and Egypt , the Jewish state ’s prime minister was the late Menachem Begin , a former terrorist who firmly declared that he would never talk with Yasser Arafat and the PLO .
Even as the Palestinians quietly began to consider the notion of a two - state peace settlement , American and Israeli policymakers could hardly contemplate any engagement with Arafat , whose responsibility for atrocious attacks on civilians was as clear as his commitment to driving the Jews into the sea .
Indeed , Israel ’s leaders regularly proclaimed that they would never talk with Arafat under any circumstances because of the Jewish blood on his hands .
Then things changed , slowly but irrevocably .
Today the PLO leadership , legatee of the unmourned Arafat , is not only welcomed but also financially supported by the United States , with its shaky authority on the West Bank bolstered by the Israel Defense Forces .
The government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority remain far from the final agreement that would achieve a just peace , but each acknowledges the legitimacy of the other .
This short history lesson is not meant to minimize the obstacles to a real peace .
Most prominent among those obstacles is Hamas , which will continue to undermine and embarrass Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas so long as it is excluded from any and all diplomacy .
Despite the repugnant ideology and brutality of the Hamas leaders , there is no doubt that the Islamist organization enjoys substantial popular support , even among Palestinians who do not share its religious worldview .
So there can be no sustainable deal between Israel and the Palestinians that is not accepted by Hamas .
Yet our current policy not only rejects any direct discussion with the Islamist party , but condemns any effort to learn what might bring them into the diplomatic process — or induce them to accept a negotiated settlement between the Palestinian Authority and Israel .
Instead , we would require them to effectively surrender every point before we will even talk to them .
It is the same mindless policy once directed by the White House toward our adversaries in Iran and North Korea until its uselessness became too obvious to ignore .
With ongoing violence in Gaza , Carter ’s critics have already pronounced his mission a failure .
But he elicited an official pledge that Hamas would honor a semi- permanent truce under certain conditions and accept a Palestinian referendum to ratify a peace settlement .
That hint of moderation , halting and reversible , suggests that he may yet be vindicated .
Joe Conason writes for the New York Observer .
British beekeepers are viewing the forthcoming opening of their hives with a certain amount of anxiety ; unsure if their colonies have survived the winter .
The cause of their concern is a mystery ailment which has wiped out " thousands " of honeybee colonies across the northern hemisphere .
Beekeepers across 24 US states are already reporting " heavy losses " to " Colony Collapse Disorder " , which has in recent years hit hard in Greece , Italy , Poland , Portugal , and Spain .
No one knows the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder , which has been attributed to various possible causes .
Dr Max Watkins , technical director of honeybee health specialist Vita , explained : " The situation is very serious , but no one yet understands the cause of these widespread honeybee colony deaths .
Alleged causes range from harmful pesticides and increased solar radiation through ozone thinning , to falling queen fertility and use of unauthorised bee treatments .
" We really do n't know the answer - several causes may be at work and the only common factor known so far is that many honeybee colonies are dying .
The phenomenon is alarming especially because agricultural pollination and therefore crop production levels are threatened . "
Symptoms of Colony Collapse Disorder are normally evident between late summer and early spring .
In the US , colonies have been hit as older bees pop their clogs , " leaving behind the queen and young workers not yet ready to forage for pollen and nectar and insufficient in number to maintain the colony " , as Vita explains .
In the UK , meanwhile , there have been " a few but significant examples " of what experts call the " Marie Celeste phenomenon " - colonies abandoning hives altogether leaving no evidence of what caused their disappearance .
Watkins continued : " It 's a real mystery .
We need beekeepers to report their losses and examine and analyse their colonies thoroughly .
In the USA it has been difficult to obtain adequate samples and sufficient detailed reports .
From records that are available , however , it is noticeable that many beekeepers have been using unauthorised treatments for varroa mites , a honeybee parasite .
I 'm sure that this is not the complete explanation , but it may be a significant contributory factor . "
Whatever the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder , European honeybees face a concrete threat from hordes of killer Asian Hornets , which can wipe out a nest of 30,000 bees " in a couple of hours " in search of larvae on which to feed their young .
The forests of Aquitaine , in south - west France , already boast swarms of the insect assassins which have " spread like lightning " across France and will inevitably , experts say , find their way to the UK at some point . ®

The US military attacked the Mahdi Army militia in Sadr City on Sunday , alongside Iraqi Army troops .
The fighting left 22 dead and 78 wounded , at least .
It was not clear what the purpose of the attack was , since the US clearly cannot intensively occupy the labyrinthine Shiite slum and therefore cannot actually disarm the Mahdi Army .
Were they attempting to impress on the Sadrists that rocket attacks on the Green Zone ( see below ) would bring retaliation ?
In the course of the fighting , al - Zaman reports in Arabic , a rocket hit Jamila wholesalers ’ market , where large food depots are located , setting it ablaze in a huge conflagration .
It is not as if there was enough food to begin with , according to The Arab Times :
‘ US and Iraqi forces have imposed a blockade on vehicle traffic in and out of Sadr City for two weeks .
Residents of the besieged district describe skyrocketing food prices , rubbish piling up and claustrophobia from being trapped indoors .
“ We have n’t been able to sleep since this fighting started two weeks ago , ” said Wardan Ali , a student from Sadr City forced to walk 10 km ( 6 miles ) on foot each way to university because of the blockade .
Sadr ’s bloc in parliament denounced the raids .
“ The intervention of US forces is horrible and unjustified .
Some people in Sadr city believe these forces will hunt and kill them , ” said Hassan Hashem , a Sadrist member of parliament ’s security committee . ‘
Al - Zaman says that Salah al - Ubaidi of Kadhimiya warned that the three Shiite districts of Baghdad now under American siege faced a humanitarian catastrophe and called for international organizations to intervene .
Rocket attacks on the Green Zone killed 2 US troops on Sunday .
Guerrillas killed another with rockets aimed at the Rustamiya base , where Iraqi cadets are trained .
Another was killed in a roadside bombing .
The fifth died in what the Pentagon characterized as a non -combat accident .
But we ’d have to know the exact circumstances to decide if combat was really no consideration in the death .
If you drive off the road because you hear machine gun fire , it is n’t technically combat , but you would not have been spooked if there were no firing in the area .
Shiite guerrillas with at least some relationship to the Mahdi Army have been regularly sending mortar and rocket fire on the so - called Green Zone for some time , but they seldom used to hit anything .
One question I hear asked in informed military circles is whether the special groups , which Muqtada al - Sadr considers Iranian puppets and rogues , have been given more accurate rockets by Iran , and maybe some better training in how to use them .
But the Mahdi Army is siphoning off a good $ 2 bn .
a year in embezzled gasoline and kerosene , and it seems to me that with that sort of money you could pretty much buy anything you needed on the international arms black market .
If Iran did not exist , would the situation in Iraq really be much different ?
It is all too convenient for the US to blame continued turmoil in Iraq on Iran , rather than to face up to the real divisions inside Iraq and the Bush administration ’s role in exacerbating them .
AP reports that Iraq ’s national security council , including the major Kurdish , Shiite and Sunni parties , on Sunday said that parties maintaining militias would not be allowed to contest the provincial elections in October .
This move is a way of putting pressure on the Sadr Movement to disarm the Mahdi Army .
But it may well backfire , since most Shiites in the south now appear to support the Sadrists .
Excluding that party from the elections will more or less disenfranchise a majority of Iraqis .
Liwa ’ al - Sumaysim , of the Sadr Movement , told al - Zaman that the Sadrists did not accept the authority of the National Security Council to issue such an ultimatum .
He said that although the Sadrists do not believe in deploying militias for political purposes , the Mahdi Army was created because the Iraqi government is not providing security to neighborhoods , and that has not changed .
When al - Zaman asked Sumaysim what would happen if the Sadrists were excluded from the elections , he replied that the Sadr Movement reserved the right to take up arms against the Occupier .
Sumaysim said that all the parties making this demand have their own militias , and he is more or less correct .
The Kurds are not going to disband their Peshmerga paramilitary , which they have gotten recognized as the national guard of Kurdistan .
ISCI is not going to disarm the Badr Corps , which has been infiltrated into the army and provincial police .
Etc. , etc .
The Sadrists are a little unlikely to volunteer to be the only ones to disarm .
But apparently they are being threatened with a US military campaign if they decline .
Up in Mosul , over 200 miles to the north of Baghdad , guerrillas kidnapped , then released , a bus load of 42 college students on Sunday .
If guerrillas can do such a thing with impunity in broad daylight , there ca n’t be much security in the Mosul area .
The Times of London reports that US Gen .
David Petraeus will report to the US Congress that Iranian fighters fought alongside Mahdi Army militiamen in Basra .
This fixation on Iran just does n’t make any sense to me .
The poor slum kids and Marsh Arabs in Basra who follow Muqtada al - Sadr do n’t even like Iranians .
The primary Iran - linked force in Basra is the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq with its Badr Corps militia , which most Basrans code as Iranian puppets .
One of my Iraqi correspondents told me that when the Badr Corps was fighting Marsh Arabs , local Basrans characterized it as ‘ Iranians fighting Iraqis . ’
The Badr Corps , according to the Iraqi press , fought alongside al - Maliki ’s 14th Division against the Mahdi Army .
The Badr Corps was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and it is alleged that many Badr Corps fighters are still on the Iranian payroll .
Iranians come through Basra on their way up to Karbala and Najaf on pilgrimage to sacred Shiite shrines , and a handful may have gotten caught up in the fighting .
This sort of thing has happened before .
[ 8,000 Iranian pilgrims caught in Iraq because of the fighting have just been recalled home , and a temporary halt on the pilgrimages has been called . )
But that Supreme Jurisprudent Ali Khamenei of Iran deliberately sent Iranian troops or agents into Basra to undermine ISCI , Badr , and al - Maliki ’s Da’wa ( Islamic Missionary ) Party on behalf of the Sadr Movement just strikes me as daft .
It flies in the face of everything else we know about the relationship of these groups with Iran .
In fact , the Iranian leadership benefits from a united Iraqi Shiite community and the head of the Expediency Council , Akbar Rafsanajani , expressed concern about the faction - fighting among Iraqi Shiites .
Iran brokered the cease - fire .
If it wanted Shiite on Shiite fighting , why would it do that ?
Neither the US nor Britain any longer has good intelligence on what is happening in the slums of Basra .
If Petraeus is getting his information from al - Maliki on all this , he should be careful .
The Da’wa and ISCI are perfectly capable of doing propaganda to embroil the US in their fights .
In fact , their lies helped draw the US in , in the first place .
The US Institute of Peace concluded in a just - released report that there has been little political progress in Iraq , and that the US risks , as a result , being bogged down there for 5 to 10 years .
If critics of the US presence are correct , Having so many US troops in Iraq may actually be delaying the compromises that Iraqis desperately need to make with one another .
As it is , Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki knows that he can just have the US Air Force bomb his enemies ; he does n’t need to come to an agreement with them .
Mohammad Bazzi of the CSM comments on the power vacuum in Iraqi Shiism , with Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani having played no visible role in resolving the recent fighting in Basra .
In fact , it was the commander of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps that mediated a ceasefire .
The shift of authority in such matters from Najaf to Qom , from Iraq to Iran , was important if it pointed to the future .
Bazzi says that Sistani , 77 , appears to be in declining health .
He had angioplasty in London in summer of 2004 .
Iraq ’s nearly 1 million widows and vast numbers of orphans are not getting much attention or help .
McClatchy reports more political violence on Sunday here .
I was heartened when George Stephanopoulos -- for all the heat he has taken over the ABC debate -- asked John McCain a question on This Week this past Sunday that I have been waiting to hear the media ask the " straight - talker " for a long time now .
To paraphrase , Stephanopoulos wondered why if government health care has been good enough for McCain to receive his entire life , it is not good enough for the rest of us ?
That 's right , John McCain , the son of an Admiral , has had his healthcare taken care of by the government for the last seven decades at taxpayer expense .
Yet , when asked this question , he was only able to muster a lame joke in response recounting the years he was being taken care of in a different country ( where else but the Hanoi Hilton -- which McCain wields like Giuliani did 9/11 ) .
In fact , McCain does n't even feel compelled to explain why he voted against the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) , so that countless children would lose the very government health care on which he has relied upon long enough that diapers have become bookends .
This was n't the first time I heard this question .
It was brought up to me when I was speaking to a real straight - talking vet , Paul Hackett , for my book The Real McCain .
But it was the first time the media brought it up , that I am aware of .
And it should n't be the last .
As for the rest of us , just remember this the next time McCain throws out some bogus charge about elitism at any Democrat , while lounging at one of his wife 's 8 homes .
Or goes on a Barneys bender .
Cliff Schecter is the author of The Real McCain : Why Conservatives Don't Trust Him And Why Independent 's Should n't .
It is only $ 10 , and for that low - low price you can help defeat McCain and keep Cliff 's kid in diapers -- a pretty good deal for all .

Michael Chertoff appealed to security experts to work for the common good
The US homeland security chief has made a heartfelt plea to Silicon Valley workers to stand up and be counted in the fight to secure the cyber highway .
Michael Chertoff invoked the attacks of 9/11 as he sought to galvanise IT professionals and security experts .
He told the world 's biggest IT security conference that serious threats to cyberspace are on " a par this country tragically experienced on 9/11 " .
Such attacks can hit financial bodies and a government 's powers , he said .
" We take threats to the cyber world as seriously as we take threats to the material world , " Mr Chertoff added .
' Desire to serve ' Speaking to a packed auditorium at the RSA Conference in San Francisco , Mr Chertoff pointed out that securing the nation 's internet highways and byways was a job the federal government could not do alone .
Appealing to the private sector , the homeland security boss reached out and simply said : " Please send some of your brightest and best to do service in the government . "
It was , he said , " the best thing you can do for your country " .
And , if the crowd was somewhat sceptical about getting into bed with the government on this issue , Mr Chertoff talked of the first big - name Silicon Valley recruit to the cause .
Rod Beckstrom is best known for starting Twiki.net , a company that provides collaboration software for browser .
Having rallied to the cause , he will now head a new inter-agency group tasked with co-ordinating the federal government 's efforts to protect its computer networks from organised cyber attacks .
Speaking at a news conference afterwards , Mr Chertoff admitted to BBC News that he needed the private sector to get involved and that he was unashamed in trying to tug at the heart strings rather than the wallets of Silicon Valley workers .
" We do n't compete with the private sector with money .
I can tell you what can motivate people is the desire to serve , " he said .
" But , yeah , it is ultimately an appeal for doing something [ more ] for the common good than for your own enrichment . "

Groups that fought San Francisco 's lawsuit seeking marriage for same - sex couples have asked the California Supreme Court to delay its decision to allow the marriages .
The organizations , including the Proposition 22 Legal Defense Fund and the Alliance Defense Fund , filed a request with the court Thursday afternoon seeking the delay until after the November election .
That 's when the state 's voters will likely decide a proposed constitutional amendment to limit marriage to opposite - sex couples .
" Permitting this decision to take effect immediately - in the light of the realistic possibility that the people of California might amend their constitution to reaffirm marriage as the union of one man and one woman - risks legal havoc and uncertainty of immeasurable magnitude , " the filing states .
A spokesman for San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said they would fight any delay in issuing the marriage certificates to gay couples .
Lawyers for the city are expected to file a legal response next week .
Many county clerks believe the gay unions could begin as early as June 16 .
And although the proposed gay - marriage ban has not officials been put on the November ballot yet , supporters have obtained the necessary signatures .
It is unclear what would happen to gay couples who marry between June and November if the initiative passes .
" It is to no one 's benefit to redefine marriage for four or five months , " said Andrew Pugno , legal counsel for the Proposition 22 Legal Defense Fund .
Also Thursday , state Sen. Carole Migden , D - San Francisco , announced she had received an oral opinion from the California Legislative Council , the attorney for the state Legislature , stating that same - sex couples do not need to dissolve their domestic partnerships in order to marry .

Nouriel is right : this is the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , and the Fed , with the best will in the world , probably lacks the tools to deal with it .
Broader action is necessary .
But then comes the question : who ya gonna call ?
The Gang That Could n’t think Straight still holds the White House ; no good ideas will come from that quarter .
Worse , Incurious George would probably veto any sensible plan from Congress , even if said plan could get past a filibuster .
Hey , here ’s an idea !
Let ’s create a nonpartisan expert commission , headed by Alan Gr …. oh , wait .
He ’s part of the problem .
In fact , is there any way we can repossess his book royalties ?
Seriously , it ’s very hard to see who can take charge .
Things fall apart , and the center does n’t exist .
Everyone knows veggies are a must in any healthy diet — the phrase “ eat your greens ” has been drilled into us since childhood .
But fewer than 10 percent of Americans eat the recommended amount of fruits and veggies , a 2009 study found , and fewer still choose the dark green vegetables that boast a myriad of disease - fighting health perks .
Even if you ’re not a fan of dark green produce ( we recommend you give it a second chance ) , you can still reap tons of health benefits from a variety of green veggies , fruits , and other foods you should be eating — but probably are n’t .
Read on and see why the rest of your pantry will go green with envy .
Let ’s take a little test , shall we ?
Do n’t worry , you ’ll like it .
Do you enjoy waking up in the morning ?
Are you a discerning gentleman who enjoys the good things in life ?
When you go into work , do you look like you ’ve shaved with …
… a chainsaw ?
… a wet badger ?
… nothing ? ( au naturale )
Ok , that last one was a trick question .
Badger is correct .
The truth is , 99 % of guys today do n’t know what a good shave is .
You ’ll go and buy a Gillette Warp9 and expect to come out of it and still have a face .
Let me tell you something .
They keep adding blades because they need to keep stuffing their pockets .
It does n’t give you a better shave .
I heard Gillette is introducing a 5 - blade razor to combat Shick ’s 4 - blade .
That ’s ridiculous .
They wo n’t stop until they have enough blades to cover your entire face , giving you a shave with a flick of the wrist .
A good shave starts with good tools .
Old - fashioned tools .
All the tools you ’ll need have been around for over a hundred years .
They ’re still around , and still enjoyed , because they just work .
( And you might even enjoy it . )
Here ’s what you ’ll need :
A good razor
A shaving brush
Shaving soap
And , optional but recommended :
A brush / razor stand
Aftershave
First things first .
By good razor , I mean at an absolute minimum one that ’s not disposable .
The worst razor I can actually recommend is the Gillette Sensor3 .
It ’s essentially a Mach3 with adjustable blades that move with your face .
The downside , aside from low quality parts , is that the adjustability results in a shave that ’s not as close .
You should really try a double - edge safety razor .
Here ’s the razor hierarchy , upon which you can balance your own concerns for speed , safety , and cost :
Disposable Electric Cartridge - based , such as Sensor3 Double - edge safety razor Straight razor
Disposables should be avoided at all costs .
Electric razors just ca n’t do the job .
They ’re designed for speed and speed only , and your face will suffer .
Cartridge razors will serve you well if you ’re in an absolute hurry in the mornings and ca n’t be bothered .
( I promise you this is n’t the case .
You ’ll see why soon . )
Double - edge razors have been basically the same for a hundred years , and that ’s for a reason .
It ’s a simple premise and they work .
You get a good , sharp blade in a somewhat protective shell , and you ’ve got a clean , safe shave .
Trust me – even after just a day ’s worth of practice , you ’ll cut yourself far less than with cartridge razors and it ’ll do an even better job .
If you ’re insane , here ’s an article from 1972 on how to use a straight razor .
Yes , a true throat - cutter .
The kind your barber shaved you with as a kid .
It ’s the best shave you can possibly get , it ’s the cheapest , and if you can get used to having a deadly instrument dragged along your most vital and exposed of regions , it can actually be somewhat soothing .
That ’s all I can say about it , though , as I ’m not a nutter .
Having a good razor is not even the most important tip for a good shave .
Far more important is a quality shaving brush .
A shaving brush is vital in lifting the short hairs of your face and neck and softening them before they ’re attacked by the razor .
Without this , the razor ca n’t reach most of the short stubble that modern shave gels and electric razors ignore .
Plus , it feels damn good .
With a good shaving soap such as Proraso with eucalyptus or Taylor of Old Bond Street ‘s scented soaps , your face will be in heaven .
I love waking up just to use my Proraso .
It ’s like a breath mint for your face – supremely refreshing .
There are many types of shaving brushes .
Here ’s a general rundown , from lowest to highest quality ( and price ) :
Synthetic ( generic brushes usually fall here )
Boar bristle ( some generics fall here , or are called “ pure bristle ” ) Synthetic / natural blends “ Pure ” badger hair “ Best ” badger hair “ Super ” badger hair , also known as Silvertip
I would avoid synthetic and boar , though you can go with boar bristle or a synthetic / boar blend if you really need to save money .
The jump to a badger hair brush is large and , with brushes lasting over a decade , is worth the money .
Badger hair is nature ’s water absorber and could n’t be better suited for the job of a shaving brush .
“ Pure badger ” brushes come from the hair on most of the badger ’s body .
“ Best badger ” hair is a more select choice , is a bit softer , and holds more water .
“ Super badger ” , or silvertip , comes only from the area around the badger ’s neck , and is the softest and most absorbent hair anywhere on the badger ’s body – and is therefore the most expensive .
Pure badger brushes start around $ 20 , best badger around $ 30 , and silvertip around $ 40 .
I have a small silvertip model , a Savile Row SR - 204 , which was only $ 40 and works amazingly well for the price .
For the true enthusiast , there are brushes ranging to almost $ 1000 .
All good brushes are made in England , as are most shaving soaps .
Honestly , $ 40 is n’t much for something so nice that ’ll last you at least 10 years .
I ’d highly recommend getting a silvertip brush , with the size ( and therefore price ) being up to your budget .
So , we have a razor , brush , and soap .
What on earth do we do with it ?
Well …
It ’s a good idea to shave right after a hot shower .
Hot water opens your pores and gives a closer , more comfortable shave .
As an alternative , you can use hot water to heat up your face – use nice , hot water for at least 30 seconds to a minute to get your face ready .
Soak your brush in hot water , then drain it ( without shaking ) until the dripping slows down .
It wo n’t take long , as badger hair is designed to hold water .
Swirl the tips of the brush around in the soap .
This should get the soap to a nice lather for the brush to absorb .
Do not push the brush into the soap , there ’s no need .
If your soap did n’t come in a tub , put a bit of it ( about the size of an almond ) into a mug .
In an up - and - down or circular motion ( depends on who you ask ) , brush the soap onto your face .
Do n’t be afraid of it ; if you ’re a little more vigorous the soap will get a better lather on your face .
All you need is an opaque layer of lather .
For the first pass , shave downwards ( possibly at a slight angle ) .
This will remove a majority of facial hair .
With a good double - edge razor , you should apply no pressure .
The weight of the razor itself is enough to do the job .
Always pull the razor at a 90 degree angle to the blade to avoid cuts .
Re-soak the brush in hot water , re-lather the soap in the tub , and re-lather your face .
Do a second pass with your razor sideways , where possible , to get the remaining stubble .
Try not to shave upwards ( against the grain ) as it can cause ingrown hairs and razor burn .
Good razors do n’t need to shave against the grain to get all the hair – and raising the hair is your brush ’s job .
Do a quick test with your hand , and if you missed any spots , your brush should have enough soap for touch - ups .
Rinse your face with cold water .
Cold water re-closes your pores , which helps stop the bleeding from any nicks or cuts .
Plus , if you use Proraso soap , cold water activates the eucalyptus which is very refreshing .
Pat your face dry , do n’t rub .
Rubbing can irritate razor burn .
Optional steps :
If you have a brush stand , hang the brush bristles - down .
You do n’t want water to seep into the handle and loosen the bristles .
If you do n’t have a stand , you can keep the brush in a mug to dry .
If you have any cuts , use either a styptic pencil ( $ 1 - 2 at the grocery store ) or an alum block ( $ 5 - 10 ) to stop the bleeding .
If you have a good aftershave like Proraso ’s pre-post shave cream , apply it now – it will leave your face feeling soft and moisturized .
This also helps negate any razor burn you may have gotten .
And that ’s all there is to it .
It ’s not much more complicated than regular shaving cream and razor , wo n’t take too much more time , and you ’ll feel much better afterwards .
Where to get all these neat goodies ?
Chances are , your grocery store wo n’t have them .
One place I ’d highly recommend is QED , which seems to have the lowest prices on all the things I recommended , and has good service .
Note : if you want to buy a razor or accessory from them , it ’s in the “ other ” section located here .
As for specifics , here ’s what I have and would recommend :
Razor : Merkur model 1904 Classic .
I really like it , and I prefer the 1904 - style handle to the other Classic handles .
The only thing I might consider if I bought again was the long - handled model , as the Classics are fairly short – only slightly over 3 inches .
Brush : Savile Row SR - 204 , a silvertip badger brush , 3.8 inches high .
It ’s about the smallest silvertip brush you can buy that ’s not travel - sized .
I like the size , as it ’s easier to do around the ears and nose .
Larger brushes are also a lot more expensive , and this was only $ 40 .
Savile Row is custom - made for QED , and is essentially a rebranded Vulfix brush .
Vulfix makes high quality brushes and are quite reasonably priced .
Soap : Proraso , with eucalyptus .
I recommend the tub rather than the tube for a beginner , as you can lather the soap inside the tub itself for convenience .
The tube is still great , though , and I use it often .
Another great option is any of the soaps from Taylor of Old Bond Street .
They ’re a bit more expensive ( though more dense ) , and come in a number of interesting scents .
Good soaps are glycerin - based , and unlike modern shave gels / creams , they do n’t create huge mountains of lather – you only need a thin , opaque layer to shave well .
Any more is just wasted .

Keep the sharp edges !
" Great software is n't created by committee . "
That quote came from James Gosling , at the developer " fireside chat " at the last JavaOne .
And from Applied Minds tech wizard Bran Ferren , " Art is n't the product of a team . "
Is this true ?
First , I do n't believe James was necessarily talking about the functionality and code when he said " great software " .
Clearly , teams of great programmers can produce great code .
I think he means the kind of breakthrough apps that people can become passionate about , and I also think it 's less about the programming and more about the design and spec .
And we can all have our own interpretation of the word " team " -- at what point does a reasonably small , synergistic group building and adding to one another 's strengths turn into an idea- crushing , groupthink team ?
That depends ... very few good novels are written by more than one person .
Perhaps for novels , two is the maximum , and even that 's pretty rare .
And we all recognize that indie films today tend to be of much higher storytelling quality than the watered - down major studio films where there 's often a huge gap between " the director 's cut " and the final release edit .
But what about software or other products ?
What about the team responsible for decisions that affect the context in which users interact with your product , service , or company ?
How big can those teams be before they become completely dysfunctional ?
Obviously there 's no absolute number ... two people can cancel out each other 's good ideas just as effectively as a dozen .
If it 's not simply about the absolute number , then what is it about ?
It 's about how hard the team / group works to exploit the smartest aspects of the team while maintaining the distance and diversity so artfully ( and scientifically ) suggested in James Surowiecki's Wisdom of Crowds book .
It 's about aggregating the intelligence of the individuals rather than having the group make decisions as a whole .
And those are two profoundly different things .
If you have n't read the book , I made an earlier summary of one of the key premises here .
Most importantly , it 's about working to keep the sharp edges instead of smoothing them all over .
It 's about avoiding the dreaded " morph " .
You 've seen the morph phenomenon , where products end up looking like a morph of all competing products until there 's virtually no major distinction .
Nothing remarkable .
Nothing we love .
Think of all the new cars you see today that look soooooo much like every other car .
With a few exceptions ( like the Honda Element , the MINI ) , most look like they 've been run through a morphing program that found the perfect average .
I was about to add the ScionxB to my list of examples , but then I realized that it 's looking dangerously close to the Element ... and if the car designers are n't careful , we 'll just be exchanging a road full of lookalike rounded cards for a road full of box - like cars with very little difference between them .
This is the car I 've wanted all my life :
The ' 64 Mustang .
My dream car .
And though some of the newer Mustangs over the years have been nice - looking cars , the designs today now look like they 've been morphed with that of many other cars :
Metaphorically speaking , where are the sharp edges ?
Where are the strong ideas that come from either an individual or the product of true brainstorming ?
( Not the kind of meetings that pretend to be brainstorming , but where someone always plays " devil 's advocate " and kills innovation at the roots , or where we all know that if we do n't go along with " the group " , we 'll be in trouble . )
When people are n't brave enough for one reason or another , ideas are morphed and the sharp edges are worn away until there 's little left but a completely palatable , utterly unlovable lump .
( Again , I do n't mean " sharp edges " literally - - I happen to love my iPod precisely because it has no sharp edges ... very sexy indeed . )
But then what do you do when the sharp - edged ideas of individuals are all different ?
You pick one .
Or , applying the wisdom - of - crowds model , you take the best of several .
But rather than morphing , you aggregate the ideas in whatever way is meaningful to this kind of product , service , process , idea .
And you read Surweicki's book to find out why forcing out anyone who does n't " fit " with the group can be not just unproductive , but in some cases deadly ( read his discussion about the Space Shuttle ) .
And I 'm going to keep posting this picture , way past the point when you 're sick of seeing it :
If we allow groupthink / consensus to win , smoothing over all the pointed edges , we 'll indeed have something that nobody hates .
How many of us can afford to be there today ?

Mark Twain 's eruptum quote comes to my mind
" Sane and intelligent human beings are like all other human beings , and carefully and cautiously and diligently conceal their private real opinions from the world and give out fictitious ones in their stead for general consumption . "
The blogging is narrowing the gap and helping us voice our * real opinions *.
I almost wrote off the whole blogging even before starting to work on it , but I was so wrong , see my very first posts , http://tarrysingh.blogspot.com/2005_04_01_tarrysingh_archive.html
The deal is that even the one 's who reach a consensus know damn well ( in their minds ) that " it 's oh - so - very - dullyfying ( is it a word ? ) crap that we 're selling ! "
We need to be able to communicate across the wall , break it open and make it ONE BIG SPICY UNGREY CONSENSUS !

I remember being at a staff session on ' the power of the team ' - the age - old mantra of " there 's no ' I ' in team " was thrown at us to contemplate ... I shouted out - " you 're right but there 's a 'me ' " ... always a fun one to use that !

You 're singing my song or I am drinking your Koolaid or both .
I ask clients " what do you want to create ? "
And they sit in stunned silence .
They want to know what others are doing or how some initiative has worked some place else .
They resist owning the opportunity to be creatiively different - the opportunity to be loved or hated .
But I have to admit , I love ripping the bandages off their eyes .
I think you do too .
Have you read Peter Block 's book , " The Asnwer to How is Yes " ?
You might like it .
Thanks for making public your thoughts ; your blog is a great contribution .

I agree with you about the idea that ideas with sharp edges are good , but I disagree with your use of the term " consensus " to describe the process behind the production of " morphed " ideas .
Consensus , as it's used to describe a group decision - making process , does n't involve a group of people who know an idea is crap but agree to it anyways .
It does n't involve taking bits and pieces of various ideas and making a boring , homogenous proposal .
In true consensus models , each person in the group can veto a proposal .
Every single person in the room can nix a crap idea , and every single person in the room can propose a great one .
Actual consensus is an extremely rare thing in the business world ; it 's egalitarian and non-hierarchical , and it requires that you convince someone of an idea 's merit rather than simply order them to implement it .
" Consensus " gets bandied around a lot these days , to provide the usual managerial power plays with a modicum of respectability , but as you 've said , that almost always involves someone in a role of authority shooting down ideas which they did n't come up with , and we know what that ends up producing .
It 's not a lack of bravery , really , but rather an acknowledgement of the truth of the situation : if you were to propose something more interesting that your boss , he or she would probably just shoot it down .
Yay hierarchy .
In contrast , real consensus meetings are like brainstorming sessions without the idea - crapper in the corner ( or at the head of the table , usually ) .
I 've been working with a group which uses a strict consensus model ( each person has to be enthusiastic about a proposal ) for about two years now , and while it takes more time than just marginalizing the people who disagree , we have the opportunity to transcend the dichotomy you 've voiced .
We do n't have to choose between a brown blob and one person 's proposal ; we get to have an idea which actually works for everyone , and we have this opportunity because every person brings their different analytical powers together .
We get to come up with sharp - edged ideas as a group .
Any decision - making process which involves " forcing out anyone who does n't ' fit ' with the group " is n't consensus .
It 's the usual corporate primate dynamics nonsense .
Being creative is not a zero sum game .

My Scion xB is on order .
When reading reviews online I came across a quote that I loved ( paraphrased ) " Honda Element owners will love the Scion xB because they will no longer own the ugliest car on the road . "
The Element is certainly unique - but it is still an SUV .
My favorite SUV , but an SUV none the less .
Now , try to classify the Scion xB ...
Some call it a wagon , but this does n't really fit .
It 's not an SUV - low ground clearance , no 4WD option , it 's an urban vehicle .
Some have suggested a new category " micro- mini-van " .
THat 's lame too .
The Scion xB is truely unique .
Sure it might looke a little like the Element , but the Element is an evolutionary step from the SUV .
The xB is discontinuous innovation .
Nothing against the Element , I really like them too .
But I object to the xB is a Element wanna - be thing .
Just wait unitl I get it and post pictures - you will see what I mean .

Coda : that 's a pretty inspiring and thought - provoking comment , I have to say .
Thanks for giving me more to think about ...
Matt : Passionate users 101-- When users are passionate about your product or idea , they ''ll defend it ...
* especially * against the typical koolaid point accusation of " nothing new here . "
You 're seriously getting an xB ?
My next door neighbor has one and I must admit I 've been lusting .
But Eric and Beth have an Element , so , you know , I had to throw that in .
I have a Subaru like , well , like virtually everyone else in Boulder .
It 's the requirement when you move here .
( Unless you have a pickup , then you 're exempt . )
But I 'm from southern California , and everyone * knows * that we can't drive for s*** in rain , let alone SNOW ... so having an all - wheel drive car is nice .
I can't wait to see your pictures .
Michael : I have n't read that book ; I 'll check it out !
Thanks Tarry : )

Design by consensus always ends up being a watered - down version of what it should be .
That middle zone of mediocrity is also a middle zone of safety for many execs who either lack vision or insight or courage ... or all of the above .
This post is so dead - on .

Kathy ,
Well done !
The " Sharp Edge " message cannot be told enough times , because it is basically counter - intuitive .
People will say , " Oh yes , right ! " and proceed to pull all of the sharp edges out of the offering and the messages to conform to " conventional wisdom " .
Sharp edges make things remarkable and Seth Godin has written extensively about the necessity of creating remarkable ideas .
Sharp edges are vital for the success of any creative effort , and that includes weblogs as well .
Blogs with sharp edges are fun to read and generate traffic almost without trying .
Screw the SEO campaigns , just write memorable content with sharp edges and all will be well .
