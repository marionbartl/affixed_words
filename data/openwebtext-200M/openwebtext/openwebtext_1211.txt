Profits in the Name of Allah Sharia Banking Comes to Germany
Germany 's Muslims are finally getting a bank offering financial products that comply with Sharia law .
It is a market worth billions , and one that many major banks around the world have long discovered .
Pleas for rain during spells of drought were the most common reason for fasting .
But Puritans also fasted whenever a comet , an evil portent , appeared in the sky ; at the start of the Salem witch trials ; and throughout the various colonial Indian wars ( Mather preached that the horrors in King Philip ’s War , against the Wampanoag Indians , had been sent by God to chastise colonists for the sin of wig wearing ) .

Thanksgivings were celebrated at the end of these and other hardships and in honor of such auspicious events as the “ dissipation of the pirates , ” the succession of English kings and safe ocean crossings of ships bearing colonists and much needed supplies .
Yet these feasts all began with fasts and hours of prayer , during which ministers praised God ’s goodness and railed against the sin of gluttony .
( Once , after eating too much , John Winthrop , the governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony , fretted that his flesh had “ waxed wanton ” and begged God to “ revive ” him . )
Intemperance was believed to go against the very idea of gratitude .
Of course , people did often overindulge at these thanksgivings .
But then additional fast days often immediately followed .
Puritans believed that expressions of thanks to God for their good fortune helped keep his future punishments at bay  a point that does not detract from the genuine appreciation they felt at privations ’ end .
Nonetheless , participation was mandatory .
In 1696 , William Veazie of Boston was pilloried for plowing on Thanksgiving Day .
It was in the late 1660s that the New England colonies began holding an “ Annual Provincial Thanksgiving . ”
The holiday we celebrate today is a remnant of this harvest feast , which was theologically counterbalanced by an annual spring fast around the time of planting to ask God ’s good favor for the year .
Yet fasting and praying also immediately preceded the harvest Thanksgiving .
In 1690 , in Massachusetts the feast itself was postponed , though not the fasting , out of extraordinary concern that the meal would inspire too much “ carnal confidence . ”
As life in the New World wilderness got easier , the New England colonies gradually began holding only their annual spring fast and fall harvest feast .
Even after Abraham Lincoln established Thanksgiving as a national holiday in 1863 , Massachusetts continued to celebrate its spring day of abstention for 31 more years .
On health care , Democrats are growing more optimistic that they can find a compromise approach to creating a government - run insurer to compete with the private sector  an issue that as much as any other has split the party ’s liberals and moderates  even as progressive voices outside of Congress insist that there be no compromise .
“ The fact is that Earl Blumenauer could stop a bill going through that does not have a public option in it , ” said Jane Hamsher , founder of the progressive blog firedoglake.com .
“ Is it his loyalty to the party , partisan politics over principle ?
We are going to get to see that . ”
Mr. Blumenauer strongly favors a public option and in late July was one of more than 60 Democrats who signed a letter to the leadership saying that , essentially , they would not back a final bill without an acceptable public plan .
But on health care  as on other domestic issues , global warming and foreign policy  he must weigh whether it makes more sense to take what he can get as opposed to standing firm and perhaps seeing the overall effort collapse .
“ It would be very hard for me to do , ” Mr. Blumenauer said of voting for a final health care overhaul without a public plan .
“ But if it gets to the point where the choice is doing some things that will make a significant difference without a public option or letting the whole thing die , that too would be hard . ”

Mr. Blumenauer got on board early with Mr. Obama after concluding that he offered the chance for a more decisive change in course than Hillary Rodham Clinton could provide .
He first met Mr. Obama at the 2004 Democratic convention in Boston and endorsed him in late January 2008 .
“ There was something going on here , this guy has got some real capacity being able to , I think , connect , communicate , ” remembered Mr. Blumenauer .
The nuclear industry funds the special armed police force which guards its installations across the UK , and secret documents , seen by the Guardian , show the 750 - strong force is authorised to carry out covert intelligence operations against anti-nuclear protesters , one of its main targets .
The nuclear industry will pay £ 57 m this year to finance the Civil Nuclear Constabulary ( CNC ) .
The funding comes from the companies which run 17 nuclear plants , including Dounreay in Caithness , Sellafield in Cumbria and Dungeness in Kent .
Around a third is paid by the private consortium managing Sellafield , which is largely owned by American and French firms .
Nearly a fifth of the funding is provided by British Energy , the privatised company owned by French firm EDF .
Private correspondence shows that in June , the EDF 's head of security complained that the force had overspent its budget " without timely and satisfactory explanations to us " .
The industry acknowledges it is in regular contact with the CNC and the security services .
Most of the nuclear force 's officers are armed with high - powered guns and Tasers .
The CNC has spent £ 1.4 m on weapons and ammunition in the past three years .
They patrol outside nuclear plants , with their jurisdiction stretching to three miles beyond the perimeter of the installations .
They have the same powers as any other British police officer and can , for instance , arrest and stop and search people .
The body that regulates the CNC is also funded by the nuclear industry .
Four of the eight members of the Civil Nuclear Police Authority are nominated by the nuclear industry as its representatives .
Those four are employed in the industry .
The others – mainly former police officers – are deemed to be independent .
The force is expected to expand as the government presses ahead with plans for a new generation of nuclear plants , which are likely to attract protests .
Ben Ayliffe , head of Greenpeace 's anti-nuclear campaign , said : " There are very obvious worries about an armed police force that is accountable to an industry desperate to build nuclear reactors in the UK .
This industry will probably be very keen for their police force to use all the powers available to them to prevent peaceful protests against nuclear power . "
John Sampson , the CNC 's deputy chief constable , said the force was by law operationally independent from the industry and safeguarded by its regulatory police authority .
Its surveillance operations were only conducted if they had legal approval and were proportionate to the crime under investigation , he added .
Sampson said it would be " ill - advised " of any nuclear company to put pressure on the force and surveillance was not conducted at the instigation of the companies .
The government has provided a small amount of capital funding but does not pay any of the running costs .
The job of the force is to protect civil nuclear plants and guard radioactive nuclear material when it is being transported by land , rail or sea to ensure it is not stolen or sabotaged .
The industry also receives advice from the security services on how to protect itself from attack .
The force is authorised to send informers to infiltrate organisations and to conduct undercover surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ( RIPA ) .
It is also permitted to obtain communications data such as phone numbers and email addresses .
Reports by Sir Christopher Rose , the watchdog responsible for inspecting the use of these surveillance powers , have been obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information legislation .
Rose , the chief surveillance commissioner , noted last year : " The strategic aims of the constabulary remain on the threat from terrorism and public disquiet over nuclear matters , including demonstrations / protests and criminal offences towards nuclear movements / installations . "
The force keeps secret the extent of its clandestine surveillance operations on protesters and others .
It has been collecting more intelligence in recent years .
Sampson said its surveillance was " relatively modest " and mainly concerned with stopping terrorism .
In July , Rose said the CNC's " approach to covert activity is conspicuously professional " .
He found that the system for storing the intelligence gained from informers was " working well " .
He says he has been told during inspections that " senior officers regard covert surveillance as a long - term requirement " .
Since 2007 , the CNC has also been headed by an ex-intelligence official , rather than a police officer .
Richard Thompson is reported to have been a senior officer in MI6 .
Rose noted Thompson " has extensive experience in the intelligence world , but has no previous police background " .
Five years ago today , Mozilla announced the official release of Firefox 1.0 .
The open source Web browser has come a very long way since then and has achieved a level of popularity that few would have imagined possible .
The success of Firefox and Mozilla 's unwavering commitment to open Web standards has helped to usher in a new era of vibrance and diversity in the browser market .
To commemorate Firefox 's fifth anniversary , we are going to take you back in time for a look at some of our classic coverage of the popular browser .
Firefox emerged as an effort to replace the Mozilla Suite 's browser with a lighter alternative based on the same underlying technology .
The developers originally called their creation Phoenix , an allusion to their mission of bringing about a Mozilla rebirth .
The earliest Phoenix binaries were released to the public in 2002 and began to attract serious attention over the course of the following year .
The first Phoenix coverage on Ars Technica appears in Diary of a Geek from April 2003 .
Although author Ben Rota had previously been skeptical about tabbed browsing based on his experiences with Opera , his first test of Phoenix convinced him that the feature could be valuable .
He also cites popup blocking and autocompletion based on frequency of use as other favorite features of Phoenix .
" When I heard people saying good things about Phoenix , I decided to give it a shot .
And , indeed , I was impressed .
I also found a use for tabbed browsing .
It 's a good way to combine all of the pages on a particular topic , " he wrote .
" Maybe someday I 'll be able to switch to [ Phoenix ] permanently .
I 'll be watching the new releases of Phoenix carefully . "
It 's strange to think back to that time when the mainstream browser features that we take for granted today were first being introduced .
Do you remember your first exposure to tabbed browsing and intelligent autocompletion ?
Many of the things that made Phoenix great in its early days have been reimagined in recent releases and continue to be an important part of the browsing experience .
For example , the autocompletion feature that impressed Ben Rota in 2003 has become the aptly - named AwesomeBar in Firefox 3 .
Due to trademark conflicts , Phoenix became Firebird and then Firefox .
Shortly before the official launch of Firefox 1.0 in 2004 , Linux .
Ars columnist Jorge Castro sat down with Mozilla 's Scott Collins to capture some of his thoughts about the approaching 1.0 release .
Collins talked about Mozilla 's transition to Firefox and shared his hopes for the browser 's future .
" I 've never been good at predicting the future , I 'm happy to be where we are now , but I think we have a long way to go and I have hope that we 'll get there .
I have hope that we will be a mainstream browser and that people will use Mozilla , " he told Ars .
" That 's the thing I learned to lust after as a programmer .
It 's not my ability to solve one problem , to plow this field , but the ability to build a plow that every farmer uses .
The ability to make something that touches not ten people , not a hundred people , not a thousand people but a hundred million people .
I want Mozilla to be there again .
IE is a browser with no soul .
I want it to be Mozilla because I think that people who care deserve a browser with a soul . "
The plow analogy reflects the soulful reverence for user empowerment that has shaped Mozilla 's mission .
As Collins hoped , that philosophy helped to propel the open source browser into the mainstream .
Firefox now has over 300 million daily users and has been downloaded over 1 billion times , a critical milestone that was reached earlier this year .
We covered the official Firefox 1.0 launch on November 9 , 2004 .
" Today 's the day : open source browser Firefox finally sees its 1.0 release .
Getting there took 19 months , two name changes , and several hundred nightly builds , but the wait has been worth it , " wrote Ars managing editor Eric Bangeman .
" The future looks bright for Firefox as well as the rest of the applications in the Mozilla family . "
Indeed , Firefox has become a bright symbol of technological freedom and the poster child of open source success .
Mozilla 's efforts have helped to raise awareness about the importance of vendor - neutral Web standards and the power of collaboration and community - driven development .
Mozilla 's philosophical values became the cement with which the architects of the open Web built our brave new Internet .
With HTML 5 and a new generation of compelling Web standards beginning to emerge , the Internet is poised on the brink of another rebirth .
This time , Mozilla does not stand alone with its vision of open source browsing for an open Web .
The venerable organization is joined by industry leaders like Apple and Google who also offer innovative open source browser implementations .
The next five years will hopefully bring about changes that are even more substantive and profound than we would dare imagine .
We hope freedom will be the future of the Web and that Mozilla will continue leading the way .
From Rachel Maddow :
The worse part of this is Senator Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) was the middle man attempting to pay off Ensign 's mistress and knew the implications .
The full article is here .
The problem with Ensign is that he KNEW that paying his mistress ' husband and family off was ILLEGAL .
Right now the issue is can he survive and will he be re-elected .
And Republican Leadership in D.C. have distanced themselves from Ensign .
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell passed on several opportunities to defend two embattled GOP senators Friday as a new report raised questions about Sen.
John Ensign 's efforts to cover up his affair with a campaign aide .
McConnell refused to answer several questions about the report , which provided new details of the aftermath of the nine - month affair that Ensign had with campaign aide Cynthia Hampton , the wife of the senator 's chief of staff at the time .
Ensign eventually dismissed them both .
The Republican leader also refused to comment on new details that Sen. Tom Coburn , R - Okla . , tried to broker a payment of restitution from Ensign to the Hamptons .
McConnell , R - Ky. , had been asked about a report in The New York Times that said Ensign tried to get Doug Hampton , his lover 's husband , a lobbying job to try to contain the damage .
The Hamptons later went through Coburn to seek an $ 8.5 million settlement from the Nevada Republican before the affair became public , the paper said .
Other Senate Republicans took McConnell 's lead : none immediately came to the defense of their embattled colleagues .
It was not immediately clear what Ensign 's political future held .
The Senate Ethics Committee automatically opened a preliminary investigation into his conduct after receiving a complaint from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in June .
The panel , which conducts business in strict confidentiality , can launch investigations on lawmakers on its own without receiving a complaint from an outside party .
The Times report raised questions about whether Doug Hampton lobbied Ensign and whether the senator facilitated the arrangement .
Federal criminal law imposes a one - year ban on former congressional aides lobbying their ex-bosses or office colleagues .
read more here ...
And this is what will nail Ensign to the wall :
Now , Ensign is making himself scarce again , after The New York Times reported that he helped Hampton find work as a lobbyist and that Hampton lobbied Ensign on behalf of his clients .
Hampton told the newspaper that he and Ensign were aware of a ban on Hampton 's lobbying his former boss or Ensign 's staff , but chose to ignore it .
Neither Hampton nor his attorney , Daniel J. Albregts , returned telephone calls to The Associated Press for comment .
Ensign 's office responded to the Times story with an e-mail noting that it had previously been publicized that the senator helped Hampton get two jobs .
Ensign 's office did not reply to further questions .
From Hardball :
Robert E. Bartholomew is a social scientist who specializes in mass delusions .
He describes them here , in an article he wrote for the NESS , but also in a longer article here for the Skeptical Inquirer and in his several books .
About mass delusions he writes :
A collective delusion is the term most commonly used by social scientists to describe the relatively spontaneous spread of false beliefs that do not occur in an organized , institutionalized or ritualistic fashion .
Today , we live in a connected virtual community , and YouTube , Twitter , Facebook , and blogs , in addition to traditional media , are the medium through which community panic and delusions spread .
At this time there are two slow panics spreading through the community – fear of the H1N1 “ swine ” flu pandemic , and fear of the vaccine to prevent H1N1 flu .
Regarding the pandemic itself – this is a real threat , it is just not known at this time how severe it will turn out to be .
So far it is looking like another seasonal flu in severity , but with some different features , such as a greater tendency to severely affect otherwise healthy individuals .
The panic over the vaccine , however , is entirely manufactured , primarily by dedicated conspiracy theorists and anti-vaccinationists , and then aided by irresponsible media .
There have been two stories in particular about alleged severe reactions following vaccines recently , one dealing with the HPV vaccine and the recent cased of what is being called dystonia following the seasonal flu vaccine .
The young girl who died within hours of getting the HPV vaccine was found to have a heart defect , and her death had nothing to do with the vaccine , so that story was rather short - lived .
The new case making the rounds , however , appears to have some legs .
It is getting international news attention , and I am being flooded with e-mail requests to analyze the case .
This is the story of Desiree Jennings , who is a 28 year old cheerleader who was apparently healthy until August when she received the seasonal flu vaccine .
Ten days later she developed a severe respiratory illness , probably the flu , requiring hospitalization .
She then developed an apparent neurological reaction in which she has difficulty speaking and walking , with involuntary muscle contractions and contortions .
Her symptoms ( including speech ) are relieved , however , by walking backwards or by running .
She also seems to have attacks of muscle contortions .
News reports are presenting her story as a rare vaccine reaction .
Take a look at the video of her movements on this news report also .
This case , of course , has been immediately picked up by the anti-vaccine crowd .
Generation Rescue , Jenny McCarthy ’s anti-vaccine organization , wasted no time in exploiting this poor girl for their own agenda .
She is now the latest poster child in the war against vaccines .
The media is largely covered in fail over their reporting of this case .
They failed to ask basic journalistic questions – was the illness Jennings suffered from due to the vaccine , was it confirmed as the flu , and was it the strain from the vaccine , was the incubation period compatible with a vaccine - induced flu , did she get the live - virus version of the vaccine , does she really have dystonia , has that diagnosis been verified , are their other possibilities , and what is the plausibility that it was caused by the vaccine ?
None of these basic questions are addressed in the news reports – instead we are given an emotional report of a “ one in a million ” ( a figure apparently pulled out of someone ’s butt ) vaccine reaction .
Her episodes are called “ seizures ” when they are almost certainly not seizures .
Her condition has also been called permanent and irreversible – without any justification .
Normally I try to refrain from making medical diagnoses in public cases – but Jennings has now inserted herself in to the anti-vaccine movement , and is using her own case to “ warn about the dangers of vaccines . ”
To mitigate the damage to public health brought about by misinformation in this case , I think it is necessary to provide some expert opinion .
The movements and symptoms that Ms. Jennings displays on the public videos I have seen ( linked to above ) are not compatible with the diagnosis of dystonia , or any other movement disorder .
Dystonia is one type of involuntary contraction of muscles .
It can be reduced or exacerbated by certain movements or positions , and there are “ task specific ” dystonia , such as writer ’s cramp , that come out only with certain activity .
Jennings does not display the type of movements that are consistent with dystonia .
Her speech and movement are , however , very suggestive of a psychogenic disorder .
This also seems to be the consensus opinion of experts who have viewed this case .
The Dystonia Medical Research Foundation had this to say about the case :
Because of the concern of individuals with dystonia as to whether or not to get a flu shot because of this reported case , we have sought the opinion of dystonia experts on this case .
Based on the footage that has been shared with the public , it is their unanimous consensus that this case does not appear to be dystonia .
The one news report that I saw that actually consulted an expert for their opinion was Fox News .
Leigh Vinocur , and emergency room physician , was interviewed and relayed the opinion that the neurologists she consulted were of the opinion that Jennings ’ symptoms were consistent with a psychogenic disorder .
In other words – her symptoms are not neurological , they are psychological .
This does not mean she has any insight or voluntary control over her symptoms – they are involuntary and “ real ” – just not neurological in origin .
Symptoms such as this are not uncommon reactions to emotional stress in some individuals .
Given the evidence presented , I think this is a reasonable opinion .
Dr. Vinocur also points out that there are no reported cases of true dystonia resulting from the flu vaccine – this is not a known or established vaccine reaction .
Here is another interview on Fox with a movement disorder specialist , Dr. Stephen Grill , who concurs that ( based upon the video , and not personal examination ) Ms. Jennings does not have true dystonia but psychogenic dystonia .
It is therefore highly unlikely that whatever Jennings is suffering from now had anything to do with the flu vaccine she received in August .
Unfortunately , this is not stopping irresponsible news coverage or exploitation by anti-vaccinationists .
Further , Jennings is now in the hands of the Generation Rescue anti-vaccine quacks .
I predict that they will be able to “ cure ” her , because psychogenic disorders can and do spontaneously resolve .
They will then claim victory for their quackery in curing a ( non-existent ) vaccine injury .
In addition to the public harm , Ms. Jennings herself is likely to be harmed by the media attention her case is garnering .
She likely could benefit from proper medical attention of her condition .
But now she is publicly invested in her disorder , and is likely to accept care from those with their own anti-vaccine agenda .
It is difficult enough dealing with psychogenic disorders without international public attention and controversy .
The medical community is always careful to point out that there are very rare reactions to vaccines .
No one is claiming that they are 100 % safe – no medical intervention is .
But severe reactions are very rare .
Meanwhile , about 36,000 people die each year in the US alone from the seasonal flu .
That figure is likely to be higher this year , as seasonal strains are combined with the H1N1 strain to form a particularly bad flu season .
We are fortunate that there are vaccines both for the seasonal flu and the H1N1 flu , which is particularly well targeted because we know the strain .
Other measures for minimizing spread of the flu are , as always , also important – wash your hands , stay home if you are ill , and avoid contact with those with respiratory symptoms .
But the vaccines are likely to significantly reduce the spread and severity of the flu .
And yet , fear - mongering and misinformation , such as with the Jennings case , are scaring people away from the vaccines , without good cause .
Windows 7 is a valuable upgrade delivering an awesome new user interface , but do n't expect any major improvements in security .
Anti-virus software vendor Sophos tested Windows 7's built - in anti-virus capabilities by feeding a clean system 10 pieces of the newest malware .
Eight out of the 10 samples ran successfully , claims Sophos .
" Unfortunately , despite Microsoft 's claims , Windows 7 disappointed just like earlier versions of Windows , " says Chester Wisniewski , a senior security advisor at Sophos , in a blog post .
" The good news is that , of the freshest 10 samples that arrived , 2 would not operate correctly under Windows 7 . "
Sophos ' findings are n't surprising : Windows 7 promises backward compatibility with most software that works on older operating systems , such as Windows XP .
It would be reasonable to infer most malware compatible with Windows XP or Windows Vista is likely going to harm Windows 7 .
Also , prior to the release of Windows 7 , Microsoft did not promise that the OS would be safer against viruses .
Security enhancements that Microsoft highlighted were automatic data encryption for thumb drives , a feature for IT administrators to control which applications can run on a corporate network , and a malware filter in Internet Explorer 8 – nothing promising to prevent malware from working at all .
In fact , Microsoft has steadfastly insisted that Windows 7 users continue to run anti-virus software and regular system updates to stay safe .
" Security in Windows 7 is very multi-faceted and we have never advised customers to rely on just one specific feature in the OS , " a Microsoft spokeswoman said in a statement .
" We recommend that customers configure their computer to download and install updates automatically , and install all security updates and service packs when available to ensure the highest level of protection against malware and other vulnerabilities . "
Many security researchers agree that Windows operating systems will always be more vulnerable to malware .
That 's because the vast majority of PC owners are Windows users , and that gives " the bad guys " greater economic incentive to attack Windows systems .
Thus , even though Windows 7 ships with more built - in security features than Apple 's Mac OS X , the Mac is still safer because fewer malicious hackers are targeting the less - popular platform .
" If you 're a bad guy and you 're doing this to make money … you do n't want to spend 90 percent of your time on Windows and 10 percent on Mac , " said Charlie Miller , a security researcher and author of the The Mac Hacker ’s Handbook , in a September interview with Wired.com .
" You 're going to want to spend 100 percent of your time on Windows . "
Sophos says the " lesson learned " from its malware test is you still need to run anti-virus on Windows 7 .
That hardly seems to be a new lesson , since Microsoft never told anyone to stop running anti-virus in the first place .
So why is Sophos so " disappointed " with Windows 7 ?
Clearly , the company is sensationalizing its findings in order to sell more anti-virus software .
All of this should have already been obvious , though numbers do help confirm previous assumptions .
All you should gain from the Sophos report is reaffirmation of something you already knew :
So long as you 're running Windows , you need anti-virus software .
So keep running it .

Pinning down the identity of Britain ’s most notorious serial killer , Jack the Ripper , has occupied the minds of historians and conspiracy theorists alike for decades .
Over the years , enthusiasts have pored over the evidence to draw up a list of potential killers that range from the plausible to the preposterous .
A Russian con-artist , a Polish barber , an Irish - American quack and even the eldest son of Edward VII have all been accused of being the man who , for one summer in 1888 , brought terror to the heart of London ’s East End before disappearing without a trace .
Now , historian Mei Trow claims to have uncovered another potential suspect , one who fits a modern forensic profile of the killer but has , until now , been overlooked by his fellow “ Ripperologists ” .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Trow believes mortuary attendant Robert Mann , who lived in the area where the killings took place and had a good knowledge of anatomy , would have been regarded as a prime suspect had the modern profiling techniques of today been available to the Metropolitan Police ’s baffled officers at the time .
Using a profile of the Ripper drawn up by the FBI in 1988 to mark the centenary of his killings , Trow began looking for a local suspect who hailed from Whitechapel ’s lower social classes , was the victim of a broken home , and was someone who had worked as either a butcher , a mortuary worker or a medical examiner ’s assistant .
He also used modern geographical profiling techniques that can pinpoint where a suspect might live depending on the nature and location of their killings .
It was while trawling through newspaper cuttings of the inquests into the first two Ripper slayings that Trow stumbled across the testimony of Mann , a former workhouse child who by the time of the slayings was in his fifties and working in a mortuary .
When Polly Nichols , the Ripper ’s first confirmed kill , was found dead , her body was taken to a nearby mortuary on what was then Eagle Place .
Mann opened the mortuary up and , according to the inquest , undressed the body despite being under strict instructions not touch Nichols .
The Ripper ’s second victim , Annie Chapman , was also taken to Mann ’s morgue , which lay within walking distance of all the murders and had taught him how to wield knives in a surgical manner .
Trow believes Mann was ignored by police because the inquest judge described him as an unreliable witness , stating : “ It appears the mortuary - keeper is subject to fits , and neither his memory nor statements are reliable . ”
But this seemingly inept man , Trow believes , may have in fact been deliberately seeking to murder people locally so that he could later admire his handiwork .
“ The most chilling prospect is that Robert Mann is selecting the people he does , in the places he does , because he knows that they will come back to his mortuary , ” says Trow .
Although definitively pinning down the real Ripper is next to impossible , Trow ’s methods of using modern techniques to highlight likely suspects has drawn some academic support .
Professor Laurence Alison , a forensic psychologist at Liverpool University , believes a working class local suspect like Mann is the closest psychological fit , rather than the traditional image of an upper class killer stalking the streets of London in a cape and top hat .
“ In terms of psychological profiling , Robert Mann is the one of the most credible suspects from recent years and the closest we may ever get to a plausible psychological explanation for these most infamous of Victorian murders , ” he said .

Unity wrote an article recently questioning whether , as we approach an era of fiscal restraint and pressure on public spending , it was appropriate to give public money to a rich organisation like the Catholic Church .
And this got me thinking .
Are there other areas where we are currently spending public money that it would be appropriate to axe before we have to get to the nurses and teachers ?
I came up with quite a few but perhaps the most obvious is funding for the Arts Council .
In September 2008 , a £ 150,000 managed funds grant enabled 40 artists and scientists to set sail on Cape Farewell ’s 12 - day Disko Bay expedition .
The trip aimed to put artistic responses to climate change in the spotlight , and the crew featured 10 musicians ( including KT Tunstall , Martha Wainwright , Jarvis Cocker and Ryuichi Sakamoto ) , two architects , two oceanographers , a ceramicist and a comedian .
This was the organisation ’s seventh expedition .
To put this in perspective , spending by the Arts Council from 2008 to 2011 will be in excess of £ 1.6 billion .
They will spend £ 570 million in the current year and this spending is a combination of one off grants to individuals and groups plus regular funding to selected supported organisations .
The administrative cost of the Council in the current year is £ 49 million and seven of its seventeen executive directors earned in excess of £ 100,000 with the CE being paid £ 175,000 .
I am not a philistine .
At its best , literary , visual or dramatic art is uplifting to the human spirit and challenging to the intellect .
But if it is of high quality it will stand on its own merits - people will want to read the book , own the painting or experience the performance and there will be no need for public subsidy .
So , by definition , the Arts Council is funding art that is not good enough to pay for itself .
And of course responses to art are highly subjective .
I might like ballet whilst you might like sculpture or even rock music .
So presumably the critetia under which grants are provided will be clearly set out and the processes under which funding is granted will be rigorous and open to public scrutiny .
The Arts Council “ investment strategy ” , as described on their website , is as follows -
On receipt of our funding settlement from government , we undertake an exercise to determine the nature of our investments for the coming period .
That ’s it .
The whole “ strategy ” is expressed in a single line .
There is no rationale other than - we will decide what is art , what is not , and where the money goes .
Over three years £ 1.3 billion will be given to regularly funded organisations like the Royal Opera House and the Birmingham Royal Ballet .
Still , this is public money so at least other artistic ventures have the opportunity to apply for it .
Well , no .
We currently do not accept applications for new regularly funded organisations .
We identify organisations to invite to join the regularly funded organisation portfolio .
That translates as “ do n’t call us , we ’ll call you ” .
So , in summary , in a financial climate where front line public sector jobs are under threat and hundreds of thousands are being taken off invalidity benefit , the Arts Council are expensively subsidising the cost of George Osbourne ’s seat at the opera and squandering over a million pounds sending celebrities to Lapland .
Is that really an appropriate use of resources .
I just hope the comedian got some good polar bear jokes .
Cytomegalovirus , which lives in human saliva , is generally innocuous , but when introduced during a pregnancy it can be extremely dangerous , killing unborn babies or causing birth defects like deafness or cerebral palsy .
However , if cytomegalovirus is introduced to a woman in small doses before she conceives , she will build an immune resistance to it .
Optimally , kissing the same male for six months prior to pregnancy gives the woman 's immune system the practice it needs to render cytomegalovirus impotent .
" GM confirmed that Koenigsegg of Sweden pulled out of the deal to buy Saab , whose sales have plunged 61.5 percent this year , with only 7,400 being sold in the US . "
Yes ...
Lets see here ...
MY2009 rolls around ...
OH !
Suprise !
- NO LEASES AVAILABLE ON SAABS !!
( 75 % of our sales were lease customers ) .
- Price increase about $ 2500 from MY2008 with NO significant model changes .
- POOR POOR incentives ALL year .
- NO GM Employee Pricing ( major in our area . )
It 's really no wonder why it dropped 62 % .
We used to be able to lease these cars out between 330-400 a month , and this year , we had to try and upsell 330- 400 dollar a month payment customers up to $ 650 dollar a month purchase customers ...
HA .. yeah right .
A base Saab 9 - 3 Arc is not worth $ 33 k .
It 's a $ 26 k car at best , and GM bled the brand for all it was worth and tossed it to the wolves ...
And now we 're fucked .
Thank you GM , thank you for fucking us .
Protesta por autorizaciones para sembrar transgénicos
[ email protected ]
La organización ambientalista Greenpeace colocó un pendón negro en la columna del Ángel de la Independencia , en protesta por las dos primeras autorizaciones que dio el gobierno para sembrar , de manera experimental , maíz transgénico en territorio mexicano .
“ Hoy el Ángel de la Independencia está de duelo ” , dijo Aleira Lara , una de las dirigentes de Greenpace , quien advirtió que los genes modificados del maíz transgénico pueden propagarse y contaminar variedades naturales y valiosas de maíz .
Las autorizaciones que otorgó el gobierno , afirmó , violan la Ley de Bioseguridad de Organismos Genéticamente Modificados y ponen en riesgo las 55 razas de maíz criollo .
Como parte de su protesta , además de desplegar un pendón negro en la columna del Ángel de la Independencia , Greenpeace también colocó moños negros en las estatuas de Hidalgo , Vicente Guerrero y José María Morelos y Pavón , porque , dijeron , la nueva medida atenta contra la independencia que lograron ellos .
En entrevista , las dirigentes del grupo ecologista , María Patricia Arendar Lerner y Aleira Lara , indicaron que con el cultivo del maíz transgénico el país será más dependiente del exterior .
Porque — argumentaron los dirigentes — con la introducción de maíz transgénico al campo mexicano se da el tiro de gracia a la independencia alimentaria , ya que hará a los productores de maíz ser dependientes de cuatro empresas transnacionales .
“ Los trabajadores del campo serán demandados por esas empresas cuando sus campos sean contaminados y ningún productor podrá volver a sembrar su semilla , como lo hacen hasta ahora , pues tendrá que pagar regalías a las corporaciones para volver a sembrar ” , señalaron .
Por ello , “ esto es una irresponsabilidad por parte de las autoridades ; es muy peligroso y no podemos dejar de preguntarnos ¿a qué intereses está respondiendo el gobierno de México ?
Evidentemente , que a los del pueblo y a los de la nación , no ” .
Proteger variedades
Los representantes de Greenpeace exigieron la revocación de las autorizaciones de siembra , el establecimiento de la moratoria definitiva e inmediata al maíz transgénico y la aplicación de medidas estrictas para proteger las variedades nativas y determinar el grado de contaminación transgénica de los cultivos de maíz en México .
Aleira Lara dijo que realizaron “ esta manifestación pacífica ante la violación de la ley por parte del gobierno federal para permitir la siembra de maíz transgénico en México , centro de origen y diversidad genética del maíz .
Éste es un fuerte llamado de atención que tiene como fin evitar un gran delito : la contaminación del centro de origen del maíz , uno de los más importantes del planeta ” .
The Fed is tasked with the dual goals of price stability and restraining inflation .
Folks like myself would suggest it has n’t done a very good job of either , but that ’s not crucial to the question of whether we should be able to determine how they ’re attempting to fulfill their mission .
Particularly irksome when we ’re talking about an audit is the fact that they ’ve just admitted to engaging in gold swaps , influencing the gold price , in opposition to past denials and with the assertion that they should be able to continue hiding the specifics :
The Federal Reserve System has disclosed to the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee Inc. that it has gold swap arrangements with foreign banks that it does not want the public to know about .
The disclosure , GATA says , contradicts denials provided by the Fed to GATA in 2001 and suggests that the Fed is indeed very much involved in the surreptitious international central bank manipulation of the gold price particularly and the currency markets generally .
The Fed ’s disclosure came this week in a letter to GATA ’s Washington - area lawyer , William J. Olson of Vienna , Virginia ( http://www.lawandfreedom.com/), denying GATA ’s administrative appeal of a freedom - of - information request to the Fed for information about gold swaps , transactions in which monetary gold is temporarily exchanged between central banks or between central banks and bullion banks .
( See the International Monetary Fund ’s treatise on gold swaps here : http://www.imf.org/external/bopage/pdf/99-10.pdf.)
Gold has been flirting with the $ 1000 / oz level for several weeks ( topping it a few times ) .
Those in the gold market have long believed that central banks are suppressing the price to keep fears of inflation from hitting the roof .
How much longer do we have to allow the fed to lie to us , and then when we catch them red - handed , assert that they know well enough that we have to let them hide details on top of their lies ?
I say we audit the fed .
Then End The Fed .
The Mexico Vacation Awareness Organization is a recognized public charity and is exempt under Section 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) of the IRS Code .
The organization was formed with the hope of achieving two main objectives .
The first objective is to create awareness about the many unknown dangers that await you when traveling to Mexico .
How many times have you heard “ you will be safe as long as you stay inside the resort ? ”
On this site you will read stories that show staying inside the resort does not ensure your safety .
At many resorts in Mexico the levels of health and safety standards are far below those in the U.S. Hundreds of tourists have been negatively impacted by tainted alcohol and low balcony railing heights , as well as lack of lifeguards and non-existent first aid emergency plans .
What you read on this website will shock you .
The second objective of our organization is to have a place for victims and their families to tell their stories .
Whether you are a victim of crime , or if a family member or loved one has died while vacationing in Mexico , we want you to share your story .
By sharing your stories on this website , we can all come together in one central place .
By coming together , we will get strong enough to demand that changes be made .
By following the link on this page to the U.S. State Department ’s , Death of U.S. citizen ’s abroad from non-natural causes you will see that there are hundreds of victims .
Appallingly , thirty - two percent of all “ non-natural ” deaths of U.S. citizens outside this country occur in Mexico .
The travel industry and the United States Government have got to make it clear to the Mexico Department of Tourism that Mexico needs to make improving their safety standards a priority .
And that failure to do so will create a serious decline in their tourist industry .
Please use the information on this website to assist you in making an educated decision about whether Mexico , in its current state , is a good vacation choice .
A picture is worth a thousand Krugman essays , which is why we present a chart comparing the US Monetary Base ( and by subtracting Reserve Balances with Fed Reserve Banks , Currency in Circulation ) , and the Fed 's holdings of MBS and Agency paper ( worthless GSE / FHA garbage ) .
In summary : Currency in Circulation : $ 920 billion ; MBS / Agency Holdings : $ 997 billion .
The dollar in your pocket is now entirely backed only by worthless , rapidly devaluing and subsidized housing .

40 Linux Server Hardening Security Tips [ 2019 edition ]
Securing your Linux server is important to protect your data , intellectual property , and time , from the hands of crackers ( hackers ) .
The system administrator is responsible for security of the Linux box .
In this first part of a Linux server security series , I will provide 40 Linux server hardening tips for default installation of Linux system .
ADVERTISEMENTS
Linux Server Hardening Security Tips and Checklist
The following instructions assume that you are using CentOS / RHEL or Ubuntu / Debian based Linux distribution .
1. Encrypt Data Communication For Linux Server
All data transmitted over a network is open to monitoring .
Encrypt transmitted data whenever possible with password or using keys / certificates .
2. Avoid Using FTP , Telnet , And Rlogin / Rsh Services on Linux
Under most network configurations , user names , passwords , FTP / telnet / rsh commands and transferred files can be captured by anyone on the same network using a packet sniffer .
The common solution to this problem is to use either OpenSSH , SFTP , or FTPS ( FTP over SSL ) , which adds SSL or TLS encryption to FTP .
Type the following yum command to delete NIS , rsh and other outdated service :
# yum erase xinetd ypserv tftp - server telnet - server rsh-server
If you are using a Debian / Ubuntu Linux based server , try apt - get command / apt command to remove insecure services :
$ sudo apt - get -- purge remove xinetd nis yp- tools tftpd atftpd tftpd - hpa telnetd rsh- server rsh-redone - server
3. Minimize Software to Minimize Vulnerability in Linux
Do you really need all sort of web services installed ?
Avoid installing unnecessary software to avoid vulnerabilities in software .
Use the RPM package manager such as yum or apt - get and / or dpkg to review all installed set of software packages on a system .
Delete all unwanted packages .
# yum list installed
# yum list packageName
# yum remove packageName
OR
# dpkg -- list
# dpkg -- info packageName
# apt - get remove packageName
4. One Network Service Per System or VM Instance
Run different network services on separate servers or VM instance .
This limits the number of other services that can be compromised .
For example , if an attacker able to successfully exploit a software such as Apache flow , he or she will get an access to entire server including other services such as MySQL / MariaDB / PGSql , e-mail server and so on .
See how to install Virtualization software for more info :
5. Keep Linux Kernel and Software Up to Date
Applying security patches is an important part of maintaining Linux server .
Linux provides all necessary tools to keep your system updated , and also allows for easy upgrades between versions .
All security update should be reviewed and applied as soon as possible .
Again , use the RPM package manager such as yum and / or apt - get and / or dpkg to apply all security updates .
# yum update
OR
# apt - get update && apt - get upgrade
You can configure Red hat / CentOS / Fedora Linux to send yum package update notification via email .
Another option is to apply all security updates via a cron job .
Under Debian / Ubuntu Linux you can use apticron to send security notifications .
It is also possible to configure unattended upgrades for your Debian / Ubuntu Linux server using apt - get command / apt command :
$ sudo apt - get install unattended - upgrades apt - listchanges bsd-mailx
6. Use Linux Security Extensions
Linux comes with various security patches which can be used to guard against misconfigured or compromised programs .
If possible use SELinux and other Linux security extensions to enforce limitations on network and other programs .
For example , SELinux provides a variety of security policies for Linux kernel .
7. SELinux
I strongly recommend using SELinux which provides a flexible Mandatory Access Control ( MAC ) .
Under standard Linux Discretionary Access Control ( DAC ) , an application or process running as a user ( UID or SUID ) has the user ’s permissions to objects such as files , sockets , and other processes .
Running a MAC kernel protects the system from malicious or flawed applications that can damage or destroy the system .
See the official Redhat documentation which explains SELinux configuration .
8. Linux User Accounts and Strong Password Policy
Use the useradd / usermod commands to create and maintain user accounts .
Make sure you have a good and strong password policy .
For example , a good password includes at least 8 characters long and mixture of alphabets , number , special character , upper & lower alphabets etc .
Most important pick a password you can remember .
Use tools such as “ John the ripper ” to find out weak users passwords on your server .
Configure pam_cracklib.so to enforce the password policy .
9. Set Up Password Aging For Linux Users For Better Security
The chage command changes the number of days between password changes and the date of the last password change .
This information is used by the system to determine when a user must change his / her password .
The /etc / login.defs file defines the site - specific configuration for the shadow password suite including password aging configuration .
To disable password aging , enter :
# chage -M 99999 userName
To get password expiration information , enter :
# chage -l userName
Finally , you can also edit the /etc / shadow file in the following fields :
{userName} :{password}:{lastpasswdchanged}:{Minimum_days}:{Maximum_days} : { Warn} : {Inactive} : {Expire} :
Where ,
Minimum_days :
The minimum number of days required between password changes i.e. the number of days left before the user is allowed to change his / her password .
Maximum_days :
The maximum number of days the password is valid ( after that user is forced to change his / her password ) .
Warn :
The number of days before password is to expire that user is warned that his / her password must be changed .
Expire : Days since Jan 1 , 1970 that account is disabled i.e. an absolute date specifying when the login may no longer be used .
I recommend chage command instead of editing the /etc / shadow file by hand :
# chage -M 60 -m 7 - W 7 userName
Recommend readings :
10 . Restricting Use of Previous Passwords on Linux
You can prevent all users from using or reuse same old passwords under Linux .
The pam_unix module parameter remember can be used to configure the number of previous passwords that can not be reused .
11 . Locking User Accounts After Login Failures
Under Linux you can use the faillog command to display faillog records or to set login failure limits .
faillog formats the contents of the failure log from / var / log / faillog database / log file .
It also can be used for maintains failure counters and limits .
To see failed login attempts , enter :
faillog
To unlock an account after login failures , run :
faillog -r -u userName
Note you can use passwd command to lock and unlock accounts :
# lock Linux account
passwd -l userName
# unlock Linux account
passwd -u userName
12 . How Do I Verify No Accounts Have Empty Passwords ?
Type the following command
# awk - F : '( $ 2 == " " ) { print} '
/etc/shadow
Lock all empty password accounts :
# passwd -l accountName
13 . Make Sure No Non-Root Accounts Have UID Set To 0
Only root account have UID 0 with full permissions to access the system .
Type the following command to display all accounts with UID set to 0 :
# awk - F : '( $ 3 == " 0 " ) { print} '
/etc / passwd
You should only see one line as follows :
root : x:0:0: root:/root:/bin/bash
If you see other lines , delete them or make sure other accounts are authorized by you to use UID 0 .
14 . Disable root Login
Never ever login as root user .
You should use sudo to execute root level commands as and when required .
sudo does greatly enhances the security of the system without sharing root password with other users and admins .
sudo provides simple auditing and tracking features too .
15 . Physical Server Security
You must protect Linux servers physical console access .
Configure the BIOS and disable the booting from external devices such as DVDs / CDs / USB pen .
Set BIOS and grub boot loader password to protect these settings .
All production boxes must be locked in IDCs ( Internet Data Centers ) and all persons must pass some sort of security checks before accessing your server .
See also :
16 . Disable Unwanted Linux Services
Disable all unnecessary services and daemons ( services that runs in the background ) .
You need to remove all unwanted services from the system start - up .
Type the following command to list all services which are started at boot time in run level # 3 :
# chkconfig -- list | grep ' 3:on '
To disable service , enter :
# service serviceName stop
# chkconfig serviceName off
A note about systemd based Linux distro and services
Modern Linux distros with systemd use the systemctl command for the same purpose .
Print a list of services that lists which runlevels each is configured on or off
# systemctl list - unit - files -- type=service
# systemctl list - dependencies graphical .
target
Turn off service at boot time
# systemctl disable service
# systemctl disable httpd.
service
Start / stop / restart service
# systemctl disable service
# systemctl disable httpd.
service
Get status of service
# systemctl status service
# systemctl status httpd.
service
Viewing log messages
# journalctl
# journalctl -u network.
service
# journalctl -u ssh.service
# journalctl -f
# journalctl -k
17 . Find Listening Network Ports
Use the following command to list all open ports and associated programs :
netstat - tulpn
OR use the ss command as follows :
$ ss - tulpn
OR
nmap -sT - O localhost
nmap -sT - O server.example.com
18 . Delete X Window Systems ( X11 )
X Window systems on server is not required .
There is no reason to run X11 on your dedicated Linux based mail and Apache / Nginx web server .
You can disable and remove X Windows to improve server security and performance .
Edit /etc / inittab and set run level to 3 .
Finally , remove X Windows system , enter :
# yum groupremove " X Window System "
On CentOS 7 / RHEL 7 server use the following commands :
# yum group remove " GNOME Desktop "
# yum group remove " KDE Plasma Workspaces "
# yum group remove " Server with GUI "
# yum group remove " MATE Desktop "
19 . Configure Iptables and TCPWrappers based Firewall on Linux
Iptables is a user space application program that allows you to configure the firewall ( Netfilter ) provided by the Linux kernel .
Use firewall to filter out traffic and allow only necessary traffic .
Also use the TCPWrappers a host - based networking ACL system to filter network access to Internet .
You can prevent many denial of service attacks with the help of Iptables :
20 : Linux Kernel /etc/sysctl.conf
Hardening
/etc/sysctl.conf file is used to configure kernel parameters at runtime .
Linux reads and applies settings from /etc/sysctl.conf at boot time .
Sample /etc/sysctl.conf :
# Turn on execshield kernel.exec - shield=1 kernel.randomize_va_space=1 # Enable IP spoofing protection net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1 # Disable IP source routing net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route=0 # Ignoring broadcasts request net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=1 net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_messages=1 #
Make sure spoofed packets get logged net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
21 . Separate Disk Partitions For Linux System
Separation of the operating system files from user files may result into a better and secure system .
Make sure the following filesystems are mounted on separate partitions :
/usr
/home
/var and / var/ tmp
/tmp
Create separate partitions for Apache and FTP server roots .
Edit /etc / fstab file and make sure you add the following configuration options :
noexec –
Do not set execution of any binaries on this partition ( prevents execution of binaries but allows scripts ) .
nodev –
Do not allow character or special devices on this partition ( prevents use of device files such as zero , sda etc ) .
nosuid –
Do not set SUID / SGID access on this partition ( prevent the setuid bit ) .
Sample /etc / fstab entry to to limit user access on / dev/sda5 ( ftp server root directory ) :
/ dev/sda5 / ftpdata ext3 defaults , nosuid , nodev , noexec 1 2
22 . Disk Quotas
Make sure disk quota is enabled for all users .
To implement disk quotas , use the following steps :
Enable quotas per file system by modifying the /etc / fstab file .
Remount the file system (s ) .
Create the quota database files and generate the disk usage table .
Assign quota policies .
See implementing disk quotas tutorial for further details .
23 . Turn Off IP v6 only if you are NOT using it on Linux
Internet Protocol version 6 ( IPv6 ) provides a new Internet layer of the TCP / IP protocol suite that replaces Internet Protocol version 4 ( IPv4 ) and provides many benefits .
If you are NOT using IP v6 disable it :
24 . Disable Unwanted SUID and SGID Binaries
All SUID / SGID bits enabled file can be misused when the SUID / SGID executable has a security problem or bug .
All local or remote user can use such file .
It is a good idea to find all such files .
Use the find command as follows :
# See all set user id files :
find / - perm +4000
# See all group id files
find / - perm + 2000
# Or combine both in a single command
find / \( - perm - 4000 -o - perm - 2000 \ ) - print
find / - path - prune -o - type f - perm +6000 -ls
You need to investigate each reported file .
See reported file man page for further details .
25 : World - Writable Files on Linux Server
Anyone can modify world - writable file resulting into a security issue .
Use the following command to find all world writable and sticky bits set files :
find / dir - xdev - type d \( - perm - 0002 - a ! - perm - 1000 \ ) - print
You need to investigate each reported file and either set correct user and group permission or remove it .
26 . Noowner Files
Files not owned by any user or group can pose a security problem .
Just find them with the following command which do not belong to a valid user and a valid group
find / dir - xdev \( - nouser -o - nogroup \) - print
You need to investigate each reported file and either assign it to an appropriate user and group or remove it .
27 . Use A Centralized Authentication Service
Without a centralized authentication system , user auth data becomes inconsistent , which may lead into out - of - date credentials and forgotten accounts which should have been deleted in first place .
A centralized authentication service allows you maintaining central control over Linux / UNIX account and authentication data .
You can keep auth data synchronized between servers .
Do not use the NIS service for centralized authentication .
Use OpenLDAP for clients and servers .
28 . Kerberos
Kerberos performs authentication as a trusted third party authentication service by using cryptographic shared secret under the assumption that packets traveling along the insecure network can be read , modified , and inserted .
Kerberos builds on symmetric - key cryptography and requires a key distribution center .
You can make remote login , remote copy , secure inter-system file copying and other high - risk tasks safer and more controllable using Kerberos .
So , when users authenticate to network services using Kerberos , unauthorized users attempting to gather passwords by monitoring network traffic are effectively thwarted .
See how to setup and use Kerberos .
29 . Logging and Auditing
You need to configure logging and auditing to collect all hacking and cracking attempts .
By default syslog stores data in / var / log/ directory .
This is also useful to find out software misconfiguration which may open your system to various attacks .
See the following logging related articles :
30 . Monitor Suspicious Log Messages With Logwatch / Logcheck
Read your logs using logwatch command ( logcheck ) .
These tools make your log reading life easier .
You get detailed reporting on unusual items in syslog via email .
A sample syslog report :

See Common Linux log files names and usage for more info .
31 . System Accounting with auditd
The auditd is provided for system auditing .
It is responsible for writing audit records to the disk .
During startup , the rules in /etc / audit.rules are read by this daemon .
You can open /etc / audit.rules file and make changes such as setup audit file log location and other option .
With auditd you can answers the following questions :
System startup and shutdown events ( reboot / halt ) .
Date and time of the event .
User respoisble for the event ( such as trying to access / path / to/ topsecret.dat file ) .
Type of event ( edit , access , delete , write , update file & commands ) .
Success or failure of the event .
Records events that Modify date and time .
Find out who made changes to modify the system ’s network settings .
Record events that modify user / group information .
See who made changes to a file etc .
See our quick tutorial which explains enabling and using the auditd service .
32 . Secure OpenSSH Server
The SSH protocol is recommended for remote login and remote file transfer .
However , ssh is open to many attacks .
See how to secure OpenSSH server :
33 . Install And Use Intrusion Detection System
A network intrusion detection system ( NIDS ) is an intrusion detection system that tries to detect malicious activity such as denial of service attacks , port scans or even attempts to crack into computers by monitoring network traffic .
It is a good practice to deploy any integrity checking software before system goes online in a production environment .
If possible install AIDE software before the system is connected to any network .
AIDE is a host - based intrusion detection system ( HIDS ) it can monitor and analyses the internals of a computing system .
I recommended that you install and use rkhunter root kit detection software too .
34 . Disable USB / firewire / thunderbolt devices
Type the following command to disable USB devices on Linux system :
# echo ' install usb - storage / bin / true ' >>
/etc/modprobe.d/disable-usb-storage.conf
You can use same method to disable firewire and thunderbolt modules :
# echo " blacklist firewire - core " >>
/etc/modprobe.d/firewire.conf
# echo " blacklist thunderbolt " >>
/etc/modprobe.d/thunderbolt.conf
Once done , users can not quickly copy sensitive data to USB devices or install malware / viruses or backdoor on your Linux based system .
35 . Disable unused services
You can disable unused services using the service command / systemctl command :
$ sudo systemctl stop service
$ sudo systemctl disable service
For example , if you are not going to use Nginx service for some time disable it :
$ sudo systemctl stop nginx
$ sudo systemctl disable nginx
36 . Use fail2 ban / denyhost as IDS ( Install an Intrusion Detection System )
Fail2ban or denyhost scans the log files for too many failed login attempts and blocks the IP address which is showing malicious signs .
See how to install and use denyhost for Linux .
One can install fail2 ban easily :
$ sudo apt - get install fail2ban
OR
$ sudo yum install fail2ban
Edit the config file as per your needs :
$ sudo vi /etc / fail2ban/jail.conf
Restart the service :
$ sudo systemctl restart fail2ban.service
37 . Secure Apache / PHP / Nginx server
Edit httpd.conf file and add the following :
ServerTokens Prod ServerSignature Off TraceEnable Off Options all - Indexes Header always unset X - Powered -By
Restart the httpd / apache2 server on Linux , run :
$ sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
OR
$ sudo systemctl restart httpd.
service
You must install and enable mod_security on RHEL / CentOS server .
It is recommended that you edit php.ini and secure it too .
38 . Protecting Files , Directories and Email
Linux offers excellent protections against unauthorized data access .
File permissions and MAC prevent unauthorized access from accessing data .
However , permissions set by the Linux are irrelevant if an attacker has physical access to a computer and can simply move the computer ’s hard drive to another system to copy and analyze the sensitive data .
You can easily protect files , and partitons under Linux using the following tools :
39 . Backups
It can not be stressed enough how important it is to make a backup of your Linux system .
A proper offsite backup allows you to recover from cracked server i.e. an intrusion .
The traditional UNIX backup programs are dump and restore are also recommended .
You must set up encrypted backups to external storage such as NAS server or FreeNAS server or use cloud computing service such as AWS :
40 . Other Recommendation and conlcusion

Iceland is to lose its three McDonalds outlets after the country 's financial crisis made operating there too expensive .
The restaurants import almost all of their ingredients , but the collapse of the Icelandic krona has almost doubled import costs .
Melanie Wray reports .
Québec - Montréal : 250 km of asphalt , nine thirty - something travelers , four cars , one destination .
The journey becomes an opportunity to share points of view about life and discuss troubling questions about existence .
Highway 20 forms the backdrops for the sometimes hilarious , sometimes complicated situations between three south - bound friends who discuss ideal love , the quest of romance between two ambiguous office colleagues , the appearance of passion from a pictures perfect couple versus the daily - grind suffered by another young couple and their pending break up .
The two hours in transit along the winding thoroughfare of love set a collision course of grating simultaneous reality - checks and deep reflections about where life has taken you and the roads that it will take you on in the future .

Flexible dye - sensitized solar panels incorporated into this bag make it capable of recharging electronic gadgets .
The first commercial product to incorporate dye - sensitized thin - film solar cells will soon be on the market .
Backpacks coated with the cheap , lightweight , and flexible solar cell , for on - the - go recharging of portable gadgets , were unveiled at the Hong Kong Electronics Fair last week .
The solar cells , made by Cardiff , U.K. - based G24 Innovations , are based on technology invented by Michael Grätzel , a chemistry professor at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland .
In this type of solar cell , dye - coated semiconductor nanocrystals are sandwiched between glass panels or embedded in plastic along with an electrolyte .
The dye absorbs light and creates electrons , which are transferred to the semiconductor and then out into a circuit .
Dye - sensitized cells have lower light - to - electricity conversion efficiencies than the best thin - film solar cells , but they are considerably cheaper to manufacture and can also be printed on flexible surfaces .
Grätzel says that dye - sensitized solar cells have further practical advantages over other thin - film solar technologies .
Amorphous silicon thin - film cells degrade in sunlight over time , and their efficiency also goes down if sunlight hits them at an angle .
Dye - based cells work well at wide angles and are longer lasting .
Plus , they work more efficiently in indoor light , because the dye absorbs diffuse sunlight and fluorescent lighting well .
G24 Innovations says that it uses a low - cost , roll - to - roll process to make its flexible solar modules , which produce 0.5 watts of power under direct sunlight .
Last week , the company shipped its first solar - module shipment to Hong Kong - based company Mascotte Industrial Associates , which makes the new bags .
G24 uses ruthenium dyes coated on titanium dioxide nanocrystals and an iodide - containing nonvolatile electrolyte .
The company ’s cells are over 12 percent efficient at converting light into electricity .
G24 plans to market modules that could be patched on clothing , tents , and awnings .
The modules could also be cheaply incorporated into power - generating windows and billboards .
“ It ’s definitely a great moment for us , ” Grätzel says .
“ There has been talk of when the first commercial product will be coming out , and this has happened now . ”
Only one other company , Dyesol , is close to making commercial dye - sensitized solar - cell products .
In October 2008 , Dyesol opened a factory in Queanbeyan , Australia , to make tiles that can be integrated into building facades .
Electronics giant
Sony is also conducting research on dye - sensitized solar cells and announced last year that it had reached efficiencies of 10 percent–a level necessary for commercial products .
The electronics maker showcased conceptual lamps based on these cells , but it does n’t have commercial products in the pipeline yet .
The solar cells may have a small niche in the market right now .
But , says Michael McGehee , materials science and engineering professor at Stanford University , “ in the future we may see this technology compete with the more traditional thin - film solar technologies based on amorphous silicon , cadmium telluride , and cadmium indium gallium arsenide if the combination of efficiency , cost , and durability improves . ”
“ It ’s an exciting time for dye - sensitized solar cells , ” Grätzel says , adding that he expects to see many more products on the market soon .
Other researchers , meanwhile , are working on advanced versions of the cells using nonvolatile electrolytes and organic dyes , which could make them even cheaper and more robust .

Recently by Andrew Gavin Marshall : An Imperial Strategy for a New World Order : The Origins of World War III
This is Part 2 of the Series , " The Origins of World War III " Part 1 : An Imperial Strategy for a New World Order : The Origins of World War III
Introduction
Following US geo-strategy in what Brzezinski termed the u201Cglobal Balkans , u201D the US government has worked closely with major NGOs to u201 Cpromote democracyu201D and u201Cfreedomu201D in former Soviet republics , playing a role behind the scenes in fomenting what are termed u201 Ccolour revolutions , u201D which install US and Western - friendly puppet leaders to advance the interests of the West , both economically and strategically .
Part 2 of this essay on u201CThe Origins of World War IIIu201D analyzes the colour revolutions as being a key stratagem in imposing the US - led New World Order .
The u201 Ccolour revolutionu201D or u201Csoftu201D revolution strategy is a covert political tactic of expanding NATO and US influence to the borders of Russia and even China ; following in line with one of the primary aims of US strategy in the New World Order : to contain China and Russia and prevent the rise of any challenge to US power in the region .
These revolutions are portrayed in the western media as popular democratic revolutions , in which the people of these respective nations demand democratic accountability and governance from their despotic leaders and archaic political systems .
However , the reality is far from what this utopian imagery suggests .
Western NGOs and media heavily finance and organize opposition groups and protest movements , and in the midst of an election , create a public perception of vote fraud in order to mobilize the mass protest movements to demand u201 Ctheiru201D candidate be put into power .
It just so happens that u201 Ctheiru201D candidate is always the Western US - favoured candidate , whose campaign is often heavily financed by Washington ; and who proposes US - friendly policies and neoliberal economic conditions .
In the end , it is the people who lose out , as their genuine hope for change and accountability is denied by the influence the US wields over their political leaders .
The soft revolutions also have the effect of antagonizing China and Russia , specifically , as it places US protectorates on their borders , and drives many of the former Warsaw Pact nations to seek closer political , economic and military cooperation .
This then exacerbates tensions between the west and China and Russia ; which ultimately leads the world closer to a potential conflict between the two blocs .
Serbia
Serbia experienced its u201 Ccolour revolutionu201D in October of 2000 , which led to the overthrow of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic .
As the Washington Post reported in December of 2000 , from 1999 on , the US undertook a major u201 Celectoral strategy u201D to oust Milosevic , as u201CU.S. - funded consultants played a crucial role behind the scenes in virtually every facet of the anti-Milosevic drive , running tracking polls , training thousands of opposition activists and helping to organize a vitally important parallel vote count .
U.S. taxpayers paid for 5,000 cans of spray paint used by student activists to scrawl anti-Milosevic graffiti on walls across Serbia , and 2.5 million stickers with the slogan “ He ’s Finished , ” which became the revolution ’s catchphrase .
u201D
Further , according to Michael Dobbs , writing in the Washington Post , some u201C20 opposition leaders accepted an invitation from the Washington - based National Democratic Institute ( NDI ) in October 1999 to a seminar at the Marriott Hotel in Budapest.u201D
Interestingly , u201CSome Americans involved in the anti-Milosevic effort said they were aware of CIA activity at the fringes of the campaign , but had trouble finding out what the agency was up to .
Whatever it was , they concluded it was not particularly effective .
The lead role was taken by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development , the government ’s foreign assistance agency , which channeled the funds through commercial contractors and nonprofit groups such as NDI and its Republican counterpart , the International Republican Institute ( IRI ) .u201D
The NDI ( National Democratic Institute ) , u201 Cworked closely with Serbian opposition parties , IRI focused its attention on Otpor , which served as the revolution ’s ideological and organizational backbone .
In March , IRI paid for two dozen Otpor leaders to attend a seminar on nonviolent resistance at the Hilton Hotel in Budapest.u201D
At the seminar , u201 Cthe Serbian students received training in such matters as how to organize a strike , how to communicate with symbols , how to overcome fear and how to undermine the authority of a dictatorial regime .
u201D [ 1 ]
As the New York Times revealed , Otpor , the major student opposition group , had a steady flow of money coming from the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , a Congress - funded u201 Cdemocracy promoting u201D organization .
The United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) gave money to Otpor , as did the International Republican Institute , u201 Canother nongovernmental Washington group financed partly by A.I.D.u201D [ 2 ]
Georgia
In 2003 , Georgia went through its u201CRose Revolution , u201D which led to the overthrow of president Eduard Shevardnadze , replacing him with Mikhail Saakashvili after the 2004 elections .
In a November 2003 article in The Globe and Mail , it was reported that a US - based foundation u201 Cbegan laying the brickwork for the toppling of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze , u201D as funds from his non-profit organization u201 Csent a 31 - year - old Tbilisi activist named Giga Bokeria to Serbia to meet with members of the Otpor ( Resistance ) movement and learn how they used street demonstrations to topple dictator Slobodan Milosevic .
Then , in the summer , u201D the u201Cfoundation paid for a return trip to Georgia by Otpor activists , who ran three - day courses teaching more than 1,000 students how to stage a peaceful revolution .
u201D
This US - based foundation u201 Calso funded a popular opposition television station that was crucial in mobilizing support for [ the ] u2018 velvet revolution , ' and [ it ] reportedly gave financial support to a youth group that led the street protests .
u201D
The owner of the foundation u201 Chas a warm relationship with Mr. Shevardnadze ’s chief opponent , Mikhail Saakashvili , a New York - educated lawyer who is expected to win the presidency in an election scheduled for Jan.
4.u201D
During a press conference a week before his resignation , Mr. Shevardnadze said that the US foundation u201 Cis set against the President of Georgia .
u201D Moreover , u201CMr .
Bokeria , whose Liberty Institute received money from both [ the financier 's foundation ] and the U.S. government - backed Eurasia Institute , says three other organizations played key roles in Mr. Shevardnadze ’s downfall : Mr. Saakashvili ’s National Movement party , the Rustavi - 2 television station and Kmara ! ( Georgian for Enough ! ) , a youth group that declared war on Mr. Shevardnadze [ in ]
April and began a poster and graffiti campaign attacking government corruption .u201D [ 3 ]
The day following the publication of the previously quoted article , the author published another article in the Globe and Mail explaining that the u201 Cbloodless revolutionu201D in Georgia u201 Csmells more like another victory for the United States over Russia in the post - Cold War international chess game .
u201D
The author , Mark MacKinnon , explained that Eduard Shevardnadze 's downfall lied u201 Cin the oil under the Caspian Sea , one of the world ’s few great remaining , relatively unexploited , sources of oil , u201D as u201CGeorgia and neighbouring Azerbaijan , which borders the Caspian , quickly came to be seen not just as newly independent countries , but as part of an u2018energy corridor '.u201D
Plans were drawn up for a massive u201 Cpipeline that would run through Georgia to Turkey and the Mediterranean .
u201D
It is worth quoting MacKinnon at length :
When these plans were made , Mr. Shevardnadze was seen as an asset by both Western investors and the U.S. government .
His reputation as the man who helped end the Cold War gave investors a sense of confidence in the country , and his stated intention to move Georgia out of Russia ’s orbit and into Western institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union played well at the U.S. State Department .
The United States quickly moved to embrace Georgia , opening a military base in the country [ in 2001 ] to give Georgian soldiers “ anti- terrorist ” training .
They were the first U.S. troops to set up in a former Soviet republic .
But somewhere along the line , Mr. Shevardnadze reversed course and decided to once more embrace Russia .
This summer , Georgia signed a secret 25 - year deal to make the Russian energy giant Gazprom its sole supplier of gas .
Then it effectively sold the electricity grid to another Russian firm , cutting out AES , the company that the U.S. administration had backed to win the deal .
Mr. Shevardnadze attacked AES as “ liars and cheats . ”
Both deals dramatically increased Russian influence in Tbilisi .
Following the elections in Georgia , the US - backed and educated Mikhail Saakashvili ascended to the Presidency and u201 Cwon the day .
u201D [ 4 ]
This is again an example of the intimate relationship between oil geopolitics and US foreign policy .
The colour revolution was vital in pressing US and NATO interests forward in the region ; gaining control over Central Asia 's gas reserves and keeping Russia from expanding its influence .
This follows directly in line with the US - NATO imperial strategy for the new world order , following the collapse of the USSR .
[ This strategy is outlined in detail in Part 1 of this essay : An Imperial Strategy for a New World Order : The Origins of World War III ] .
Ukraine
In 2004 , Ukraine went through its u201COrange Revolution , u201D in which opposition and pro-Western leader Viktor Yushchenko became President , defeating Viktor Yanukovych .
As the Guardian revealed in 2004 , that following the disputed elections ( as happens in every u201 Ccolour revolutionu201D ) , u201 Cthe democracy guerrillas of the Ukrainian Pora youth movement have already notched up a famous victory  whatever the outcome of the dangerous stand - off in Kiev , u201D however , u201 Cthe campaign is an American creation , a sophisticated and brilliantly conceived exercise in western branding and mass marketing that , in four countries in four years , has been used to try to salvage rigged elections and topple unsavoury regimes .
u201D
The author , Ian Traynor , explained that , u201CFunded and organised by the US government , deploying US consultancies , pollsters , diplomats , the two big American parties and US non-government organisations , the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 to beat Slobodan Milosevic at the ballot box .
u201D
Further , u201CThe Democratic party ’s National Democratic Institute , the Republican party ’s International Republican Institute , the US state department and USAid are the main agencies involved in these grassroots campaigns as well as the Freedom House NGOu201D and the same billionaire financier involved in Georgia 's Rose Revolution .
In implementing the regime - change strategy , u201CThe usually fractious oppositions have to be united behind a single candidate if there is to be any chance of unseating the regime .
That leader is selected on pragmatic and objective grounds , even if he or she is anti-American .
u201D
Traynor continues :
Freedom House and the Democratic party ’s NDI helped fund and organise the “ largest civil regional election monitoring effort ” in Ukraine , involving more than 1,000 trained observers .
They also organised exit polls .
On Sunday night those polls gave Mr Yushchenko an 11 - point lead and set the agenda for much of what has followed .
The exit polls are seen as critical because they seize the initiative in the propaganda battle with the regime , invariably appearing first , receiving wide media coverage and putting the onus on the authorities to respond .
The final stage in the US template concerns how to react when the incumbent tries to steal a lost election .
[. . . ]
In Belgrade , Tbilisi , and now Kiev , where the authorities initially tried to cling to power , the advice was to stay cool but determined and to organise mass displays of civil disobedience , which must remain peaceful but risk provoking the regime into violent suppression . [ 5 ]
As an article in the Guardian by Jonathan Steele explained , the opposition leader , Viktor Yushchenko , who disputed the election results , u201 Cserved as prime minister under the outgoing president , Leonid Kuchma , and some of his backers are also linked to the brutal industrial clans who manipulated Ukraine ’s post -Soviet privatization .
u201D
He further explained that election rigging is mainly irrelevant , as u201CThe decision to protest appears to depend mainly on realpolitik and whether the challengers or the incumbent are considered more u2018 pro- western ' or u2018 pro- market'.u201D
In other words , those who support a neoliberal economic agenda will have the support of the US - NATO , as neoliberalism is their established international economic order and advances their interests in the region .
Moreover , u201CIn Ukraine , Yushchenko got the western nod , and floods of money poured in to groups which support him , ranging from the youth organisation , Pora , to various opposition websites .
More provocatively , the US and other western embassies paid for exit polls .
u201D
This is emblematic of the strategic importance of the Ukraine to the United States , u201 Cwhich refuses to abandon its cold war policy of encircling Russia and seeking to pull every former Soviet republic to its side .u201D [ 6 ]
One Guardian commentator pointed out the hypocrisy of western media coverage : u201CTwo million anti-war demonstrators can stream though the streets of London and be politically ignored , but a few tens of thousands in central Kiev are proclaimed to be u2018 the people ' , while the Ukrainian police , courts and governmental institutions are discounted as instruments of oppression .
u201D
It was also explained that , u201CEnormous rallies have been held in Kiev in support of the prime minister , Viktor Yanukovich , but they are not shown on our TV screens : if their existence is admitted , Yanukovich supporters are denigrated as having been u2018 bussed in ' .
The demonstrations in favour of Viktor Yushchenko have laser lights , plasma screens , sophisticated sound systems , rock concerts , tents to camp in and huge quantities of orange clothing ; yet we happily dupe ourselves that they are spontaneous . u201D [ 7 ]
In 2004 , the Associated Press reported that , u201CThe Bush administration has spent more than $ 65 million in the past two years to aid political organizations in Ukraine , paying to bring opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko to meet U.S. leaders and helping to underwrite an exit poll indicating he won last month ’s disputed runoff election .
u201D
The money , they state , u201 Cwas funneled through organizations such as the Eurasia Foundation or through groups aligned with Republicans and Democrats that organized election training , with human rights forums or with independent news outlets .
u201D
However , even government officials u201 Cacknowledge that some of the money helped train groups and individuals opposed to the Russian - backed government candidate.u201D
The report stated that some major international foundations funded the exit polls , which according to the incumbent leader were u201Cskewed.u201D
These foundations included u201CThe National Endowment for Democracy , which receives its money directly from Congress ; the Eurasia Foundation , which receives money from the State Department , and the Renaissance Foundation , u201D which receives money from the same billionaire financier as well as the US State Department .
Since the State Department is involved , that implies that this funding is quite directly enmeshed in US foreign policy strategy .
u201COther countries involved included Great Britain , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Canada , Norway , Sweden and Denmark.u201D
Also involved in funding certain groups and activities in the Ukraine was the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute , which was chaired by former Secretary of States Madeline Albright at the time . [ 8 ]
Mark Almond wrote for the Guardian in 2004 of the advent of u201CPeople Power , u201D describing it in relation to the situation that was then breaking in the Ukraine , and stated that , u201CThe upheaval in Ukraine is presented as a battle between the people and Soviet - era power structures .
The role of Western Cold Warera agencies is taboo .
Poke your nose into the funding of the lavish carnival in Kiev , and the shrieks of rage show that you have touched a neuralgic point of the New World Order.u201D
Almond elaborated :
“ Throughout the 1980s , in the build - up to 1989 ’s velvet revolutions , a small army of volunteers  and , let ’s be frank , spies  co-operated to promote what became People Power .
A network of interlocking foundations and charities mushroomed to organise the logistics of transferring millions of dollars to dissidents .
The money came overwhelmingly from Nato states and covert allies such as “ neutral ” Sweden .
[ …]
The hangover from People Power is shock therapy .
Each successive crowd is sold a multimedia vision of Euro - Atlantic prosperity by western - funded “ independent ” media to get them on the streets .
No one dwells on the mass unemployment , rampant insider dealing , growth of organised crime , prostitution and soaring death rates in successful People Power states .
As Almond delicately put it , u201CPeople Power is , it turns out , more about closing things than creating an open society .
It shuts factories but , worse still , minds .
Its advocates demand a free market in everything  except opinion .
The current ideology of New World Order ideologues , many of whom are renegade communists , is Market - Leninism  that combination of a dogmatic economic model with Machiavellian methods to grasp the levers of power . u201D [ 9 ]
As Mark MacKinnon reported for the Globe and Mail , Canada , too , supported the efforts of the youth activist group , Pora , in the Ukraine , providing funding for the u201 Cpeople power democracy u201D movement .
As MacKinnon noted , u201CThe Bush administration was particularly keen to see a pro-Western figure as president to ensure control over a key pipeline running from Odessa on the Black Sea to Brody on the Polish border .
u201D However , u201CThe outgoing president , Leonid Kuchma , had recently reversed the flow so the pipeline carried Russian crude south instead of helping U.S. producers in the Caspian Sea region ship their product to Europe .
u201D
As MacKinnon analyzes , the initial funding from western nations came from Canada , although this was eventually far surpassed in amount by the United States .
Andrew Robinson , Canada 's ambassador to Ukraine at the time , in 2004 , u201 Cbegan to organize secret monthly meetings of Western ambassadors , presiding over what he called “ donor co-ordination ” sessions among 28 countries interested in seeing Mr. Yushchenko succeed .
Eventually , he acted as the group ’s spokesman and became a prominent critic of the Kuchma government ’s heavy - handed media control .
u201D
Canada further u201 Cinvested in a controversial exit poll , carried out on election day by Ukraine ’s Razumkov Centre and other groups , that contradicted the official results showing Mr. Yanukovich had won.u201D
Once the new , pro-Western government was in , it u201 Cannounced its intention to reverse the flow of the Odessa - Brody pipeline .u201D [ 10 ]
Again , this follows the example of Georgia , where several US and NATO interests are met through the success of the u201 Ccolour revolutionu201D ; simultaneously preventing Russian expansion and influence from spreading in the region as well as advancing US and NATO control and influence over the major resources and transport corridors of the region .
Daniel Wolf wrote for the Guardian that , u201CFor most of the people gathered in Kiev ’s Independence Square , the demonstration felt spontaneous .
They had every reason to want to stop the government candidate , Viktor Yanukovich , from coming to power , and they took the chance that was offered to them .
But walking through the encampment last December , it was hard to ignore the evidence of meticulous preparation  the soup kitchens and tents for the demonstrators , the slickness of the concert , the professionalism of the TV coverage , the proliferation of the sickly orange logo wherever you looked .
u201D
He elaborated , writing , u201 Cthe events in the square were the result of careful , secret planning by Yushchenko ’s inner circle over a period of years .
The true story of the orange revolution is far more interesting than the fable that has been widely accepted .
u201D
Roman Bessmertny , Yushchenko’s campaign manager , two years prior to the 2004 elections , u201C put as many as 150,000 people through training courses , seminars , practical tuition conducted by legal and media specialists .
Some attending these courses were members of election committees at local , regional and national level ; others were election monitors , who were not only taught what to watch out for but given camcorders to record it on video .
More than 10,000 cameras were distributed , with the aim of recording events at every third polling station .
u201D
Ultimately , it was an intricately well - planned public relations media - savvy campaign , orchestrated through heavy financing .
Hardly the sporadic u201 Cpeople poweru201D notion applied to the u201 Cpeaceful coupu201D in the western media . [ 11 ]
The u201CTulip Revolutionu201D in Kyrgyzstan
In 2005 , Kyrgyzstan underwent its u201CTulip Revolutionu201D in which the incumbent was replaced by the pro-Western candidate through another u201 Cpopular revolution .
u201D
As the New York Times reported in March of 2005 , shortly before the March elections , u201 Can opposition newspaper ran photographs of a palatial home under construction for the country ’s deeply unpopular president , Askar Akayev , helping set off widespread outrage and a popular revolt .
u201D
However , this u201 Cnewspaper was the recipient of United States government grants and was printed on an American government - financed printing press operated by Freedom House , an American organization that describes itself as u2018a clear voice for democracy and freedom around the world ' .u201D
Moreover , other countries that have u201 Chelped underwrite programs to develop democracy and civil society u201D in Kyrgyzstan were Britain , the Netherlands and Norway .
These countries collectively u201 Cplayed a crucial role in preparing the ground for the popular uprising that swept opposition politicians to power .
u201D
Money mostly flowed from the United States , in particular , through the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , as well as through u201 Cthe Freedom House printing press or Kyrgyz - language service of Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty , a pro-democracy broadcaster .
u201D
The National Democratic Institute also played a major financing role , for which one of the chief beneficiaries of their financial aid said , u201CIt would have been absolutely impossible for this to have happened without that help.
u201D
The Times further reported that :
“ American money helps finance civil society centers around the country where activists and citizens can meet , receive training , read independent newspapers and even watch CNN or surf the Internet in some .
The N.D.I. [ National Democratic Institute ] alone operates 20 centers that provide news summaries in Russian , Kyrgyz and Uzbek .
The United States sponsors the American University in Kyrgyzstan , whose stated mission is , in part , to promote the development of civil society , and pays for exchange programs that send students and non-governmental organization leaders to the United States .
Kyrgyzstan ’s new prime minister , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , was one .
All of that money and manpower gave the coalescing Kyrgyz opposition financing and moral support in recent years , as well as the infrastructure that allowed it to communicate its ideas to the Kyrgyz people . ”
As for those u201 Cwho did not read Russian or have access to the newspaper listened to summaries of its articles on Kyrgyz - language Radio Azattyk , the local United States - government financed franchise of Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty.u201D
Other u201 Cindependentu201D media was paid for courtesy of the US State Department . [ 12 ]
As the Wall Street Journal revealed prior to the elections , opposition groups , NGOs and u201 Cindependentu201D media in Kyrgyzstan were getting financial assistance from Freedom House in the US , as well as the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) .
The Journal reported that , u201CTo avoid provoking Russia and violating diplomatic norms , the U.S. ca n’t directly back opposition political parties .
But it underwrites a web of influential NGOs whose support of press freedom , the rule of law and clean elections almost inevitably pits them against the entrenched interests of the old autocratic regimes .
u201D
As the Journal further reported , Kyrgyzstan u201 Coccupies a strategic location .
The U.S. and Russia both have military bases here .
The country ’s five million citizens , mostly Muslim , are sandwiched in a tumultuous neighborhood among oil - rich Kazakhstan , whose regime tolerates little political dissent ; dictatorial Uzbekistan , which has clamped down on foreign aid groups and destitute Tajikistan .
u201D
In the country , a main opposition NGO , the Coalition for Democracy and Civil Rights , gets its funding u201 Cfrom the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs , a Washington - based nonprofit funded by the U.S. government , and from USAID.u201D
Other agencies reported to be involved , either through funding or ideological - technical promotion ( see : propaganda ) , are the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , the Albert Einstein Institute , Freedom House , and the US State Department . [ 13 ]
President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan had referred to a u201 Cthird forceu201D gaining power in his country .
The term was borrowed from one of the most prominent US think tanks , as u201 Cthird forceu201D is :
“ … which details how western - backed non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) can promote regime and policy change all over the world .
The formulaic repetition of a third “ people power ” revolution in the former Soviet Union in just over one year  after the similar events in Georgia in November 2003 and in Ukraine last Christmas  means that the post - Soviet space now resembles Central America in the 1970s and 1980s , when a series of US - backed coups consolidated that country ’s control over the western hemisphere . ”
As the Guardian reported :
“ Many of the same US government operatives in Latin America have plied their trade in eastern Europe under George Bush , most notably Michael Kozak , former US ambassador to Belarus , who boasted in these pages in 2001 that he was doing in Belarus exactly what he had been doing in Nicaragua : “ supporting democracy ” .
Further :
“ The case of Freedom House is particularly arresting .
Chaired by the former CIA director James Woolsey , Freedom House was a major sponsor of the orange revolution in Ukraine .
It set up a printing press in Bishkek in November 2003 , which prints 60 opposition journals .
Although it is described as an “ independent ” press , the body that officially owns it is chaired by the bellicose Republican senator John McCain , while the former national security adviser Anthony Lake sits on the board .
The US also supports opposition radio and TV . ” [ 14 ]
So again , the same formula was followed in the Central Asian Republics of the former Soviet Union .
This US foreign - policy strategy of promoting u201Csoft revolutionu201D is managed through a network of American and international NGOs and think tanks .
It advances NATO and , in particular , US interests in the region .
Conclusion
The soft revolutions or u201 Ccolour revolutionsu201D are a key stratagem in the New World Order ; advancing , through deceptions and manipulation , the key strategy of containing Russia and controlling key resources .
This strategy is critical to understanding the imperialistic nature of the New World Order , especially when it comes to identifying when this strategy is repeated ; specifically in relation to the Iranian elections of 2009 .
Part 1 of this essay outlined the US - NATO imperial strategy for entering the New World Order , following the break - up of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
The primary aim was focused on encircling Russia and China and preventing the rise of a new superpower .
The US was to act as the imperial hegemon , serving international financial interests in imposing the New World Order .
Part 2 outlined the US imperial strategy of using u201 Ccolour revolutionsu201D to advance its interests in Central Asia and Eastern Europe , following along the overall policy outlined in Part 1 , of containing Russia and China from expanding influence and gaining access to key natural resources .

The Best of Andrew Gavin Marshall
Caspian Makan has been run over by the blind , careering juggernaut of history .
Just five months ago his girlfriend was killed on the streets of Tehran , one of some 80 deaths reliably reported during the tumultuous demonstrations that followed the disputed presidential elections .
Most victims ' relatives and friends have grieved in private – but Neda Agha Soltan , Caspian 's girlfriend , died live on phone camera , an almost unbearable 90 - second sequence that turned her into an icon .
Uploaded on to the internet , within hours her face became the face of protest .
But symbols destroy lives .
In the days and weeks that followed , Caspian has lost not only the woman he was planning to marry , but also his country , his family , his friends and his career .
Anyone and everyone who had anything to do with Neda 's death are now toxic to the Iranian government .
Members of her family have been bullied , threatened and even detained .
The doctor who is caught on camera trying to save her life is now exiled in Britain .
The music teacher who was with her when she died has been rolled out on Iranian television , patently required to deny what he saw : that Neda was shot by a member of the religious militia .
And Caspian disappeared .
In the days after her killing , he spoke out on foreign satellite stations and then vanished .
Finally it was confirmed he was in the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran – the frightening symbol of the Shah 's oppressive regime smoothly transferred into the hands of the Islamic Republic 's secret police .
He was held for more than two months , some of that time in solitary confinement .
In September he was released on bail pending trial – perhaps being prepared for one of the extraordinary show trials that have been broadcast on Iranian TV over the past months , in which leading supporters of the opposition have been obliged to recant their actions .
Urged on by family and friends , Caspian decided he had to escape .
We meet just days after he got out .
He is in hiding and for now does not want people to know where .
There is a tangible fear of the reach of the secret police in the Iranian exile community .
His temporary home is an empty flat in an anonymous block in the suburbs of a Middle Eastern city he does not know .
He does not look like someone who has just spent five traumatic days escaping his homeland , eight hours of it on foot across remote mountains .
Trim and elegant , he greets us with a gentle smile .
Tea is offered , though not a chair because there is n't one in the flat .
His attempts at pleasantries do not last long .
The deep dark circles etched under his eyes betray him .
Neda and Caspian in Turkey .
The whirlwind has consumed everything except the few belongings he could smuggle out of the country – not least a small computer drive .
He fires it up and there are his photos of Neda – the beautiful smile that has circled the globe suddenly becomes his private image of love again .
Here is the man she was smiling for .
He touches her face on the screen .
Their story begins as a classic holiday romance : they were on the same tour group to Turkey in April this year .
He talks of Neda as a bright woman , frustrated with life .
Turkey is a tantalising place for young Iranians ; one of the few places Iranians can visit without a visa .
It is a Muslim country but a secular state .
There are no headscarves in Caspian 's photos of Neda on the holiday .
His voice drops to a whisper as he remembers their first holiday conversations .
She was religious and had studied theology and Islamic philosophy at university in Tehran .
She 'd only been there for three terms when she realised she did not recognise her God in what was being taught .
She had married quite young and divorced , which now made getting a job difficult .
She loved travelling , and was trying to get a job as a guide in Turkey .
Caspian told her of his life as a professional photographer , that he was also divorced , but they agreed not to talk about previous relationships .
They were starting again .
She was n't interested in a casual relationship , and he at 38 , 12 years her senior , knew he was serious about her .
But both were nervous – a holiday romance , after all .
" For 10 or 12 days [ afterwards ] we did n't see each other and we had no contact because we wanted to work out how we really felt about each other .
We chose a day to meet and agreed that , on that day , we would decide if we really wanted to be together .
I knew I wanted to be with her and when she arrived , I knew she felt the same way .
I was so happy . "
They were not formally engaged , but that was the plan .
They even had tickets for a trip back to Turkey together – Istanbul , for the last week in June .
The private plans of a private couple .
But by then Neda was dead , and Caspian in prison .
What came in between were the presidential elections in June .
Neither Caspian nor Neda was very political .
All their adult lives the elections had been between a carefully approved range of candidates .
Previous dreams of reform had curdled on the realities of a political system dominated by a religious elite .
Now it was a face - off between President Ahmadinejad and a former hardline prime minister , Mir Hussein Mousavi .
Neither Caspian nor Neda intended to vote .
Then – about a fortnight before the election – something changed .
Perhaps it was the televised debates between the candidates that were broadcast in the 10 days leading up to election day .
Ahmadinejad , a far more charismatic speaker in public , came across as both aggressive and defensive on the small screen .
Unlike the soporific staged affairs of US elections , this was clearly deeply personal .
Ahmadinejad attacked Mousavi for allowing his wife to be seen with him in public .
Highlights were uploaded to YouTube .
Iranians gleefully replayed Mousavi 's retort : " This man looks straight into the camera and lies . "
Whatever the reasons , Mousavi , no liberal , suddenly acquired a broad appeal .
As a friend of Caspian's , who has also had to escape into exile , told us : " I used to think that not voting was a ' no ' to the system .
This time , I felt , was different .
I was encouraging everyone to vote .
We just mus n't let Ahmadinejad 's administration back in with its repression .
It was n't a vote in support of any candidate – it was a protest vote . "
The " green movement " was born in those days before the election , and the streets took on a carnival atmosphere .
Neda was infected by the excitement .
Caspian was not .
" I used to tell her ' You are no fan of Mousavi . '
She said ' You 're right , I am not , but I like his followers .
They are asking for their rights .
It 's not just about one man . ' "
It is impossible to say what the election result really was .
Certainly the Ahmadinejad victory was announced with unusual haste .
Also certain is that hundreds of thousands of Iranians felt they had been cheated .
And when they took to the streets they were met by a force assembled from Iran 's various security services – uniformed " robocops " with batons , riot police , Revolutionary Guards , and most dangerous of all , the religious militia , Basiji , sometimes in plain clothes .
The result , for a few deadly days , was street war .
It was pretty one - sided .
The protesters were unarmed , except for stones they picked up off the streets .
And camera phones .
As we have tried to piece together what happened over those days for our documentary , we have assembled an astonishing mosaic of images – controversial events are covered not by one camera but by 10 .
Plainclothes police shooting from rooftops are seen from multiple angles – often accompanied by a commentary of shock and outrage .
This is citizen journalism , then uploaded on to the web for all to view .
The images are impossible to source but as raw data of record they make the task of silent repression almost impossible .
Never again will the events of a Tiananmen Square go virtually unrecorded on film .
Neda 's death was just one of these sequences .
Caspian 's voice is strong when he talks about the elections or the politics .
Now it drops to a whisper .
" She joined the protesters from the beginning .
She was very brave and strong .
That worried me , to be honest .
I did n't want her to get hurt .
I asked her to stop going to the protests .
I thought she might get arrested or something else might happen to her .
But she was only thinking of her goal – democracy and freedom for Iranians . "
Neda attended virtually every demonstration – some with her mother , some even with Caspian .
Protesters struggle to save Neda after she has been shot .

He is deep within himself as he remembers how beautifully she used to explain that everyone should be there .
They quarrelled about it .
" She said , ' You support me in everything I do , why not this ? '
I said , ' You do n't understand these people .
What happens if they catch you ? '
She said , ' It 's not important , Caspian .
It 's my duty . '
She said : ' Caspian , let me tell you the truth .
I think that under the circumstances we now have , we 're all responsible .
Even if we'd had a child , I 'd carry my child to these demos on my back . '
That 's when I realised I could n't prevent her from going . "
On the day of her death , Caspian was out with his camera in another part of the city .
" I was taking pictures of the protests and the protesters that day .
It was hard to take pictures as the security guards were beating up protesters .
I used my mobile 's camera when I could n't use my big camera .
It was six to seven in the evening when I started seeing people get shot and injured .
I thought of Neda a lot .
I was very worried for her .
I wanted to call her but the mobile phone system had been disconnected and I could n't contact her at all .
I did n't sleep that night .
The terrible scenes were going through my head .
I was sitting in front of my computer , looking at the photos I had taken .
Around six in the morning my mobile rang .
It was Neda 's number .
But it was n't her .
It was her sister .
She said , ' Caspian , Neda is gone ! '
I did n't understand what she meant .
I could n't believe what she was telling me . "
By then the world was beginning to take in the images of her collapsing to the ground , blood coming out of her chest , supported by two men .
The last shot most can bear to watch shows her face , beautiful and pale , before blood spills across it , with desperate voices pleading with her .
" My child !
Neda !
Stay with us ! "
Elsewhere on the web we found further evidence : after the shooting , the crowd confronted the apparent assassin – a member of the religious militia – half naked in front of the phone cameras .
A citizens ' arrest was pointless but his ID card was taken as evidence and put online .
Shia religion is steeped in the mythology of martyrdom – Iran 's Muslim identity has always been defined by sacrifice .
The authorities understand this .
When the images of Neda led the news across the globe , they moved fast to kill the story .
From contact with her mother and sister and from Caspian 's account , we have put together what followed .
The family were allowed to bury her but only in a part of the cemetery set aside for the bodies of protesters .
They were forbidden to hold any kind of wake – none of the local restaurants , halls or mosques were allowed to accept them .
Meanwhile , on television , senior police officers were blaming the violence on terrorist elements , saying that government forces had not been issued with firearms .
Distraught , furious at what he was hearing and racked by nightmares , Caspian Makan felt he could not stay silent .
He gave interviews over the phone to BBC Persia , Al Jazeera and the Persian - language stations based abroad , in which he described , in brief , what had happened .
His friends begged him to leave the country , but Caspian refused .
" I did not want to do this .
I was not able to .
I could not leave Neda 's home .
I could not be far away from this movement .
I was past caring . "
On 26 June , six days after her death , the police surrounded his house with snipers on nearby rooftops .
" I was at home when they rang the doorbell .
They took the whole archive of my work , my editing tools , my documents , all the 10,000 photos I had collected to publish one day .
Most of this work is of historical sites in Iran and nature photography .
" They told me they were taking me to Evin prison .
They took me to a prison cell .
Neda 's grave number was 32 .
The grave next to that was number 34 , my cell 's number .
I did n't want to come back after they took me .
I wanted them to kill me as well . "
He spent almost two weeks in solitary confinement .
He was blindfolded whenever he was moved around .
But he could hear .
" There were the sounds of beatings , the screams .
Sometimes the cries and screams of those kids could be heard .
I believe they were mostly young voices .
Sometimes I got a glimpse of them through the cell door .
" It was like an examination hall .
They seated the youngsters on these chairs .
They wanted them to write down everything they did during the demonstrations .
I can't say precisely but I think they brought in about 400 - 500 people there a day .
It was so crowded they even had people seated in the showers . "
For interrogation , he was transferred to another cell .
They sat me down on the ground facing the wall .
" There were two or three of them .
I never saw them .
Only once I saw the shoe of one of them .
It was very pointy and shiny .
Their line was that Neda was a member of a group opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran .
They insisted on saying that Neda and I were members of a group with plans to cause these events . "
Next they suggested that Neda was on a suicide mission – that she had knowingly gone to her death to undermine the state .
Caspian could see it was all a formality .
" They were n't serious .
It was pretty clear that they themselves did n't believe the accusations they were making . "
What was clear was the damage they felt Neda 's death had dealt the Islamic Republic and that he had made it much worse by speaking out .
Then they changed tack .
" They said ' The Iranian government is proud of you . '
They brought me ice cream and biscuits .
Then they wanted me to return to my cell .
I went back feeling a little relieved .
I thought , OK , let me turn off my light .
It was like a searchlight shining straight on my face .
Then I realised there was no switch to turn it off . "
And so it went on .
" They had me on a chair by the wall .
They hit me .
They told me I was certain to be executed . "
Over the weeks different versions of what happened were proposed to him but he rejected them all .
After a number of interrogations it went quiet for a week .
He was transferred to a new cell for about 40 days but not interrogated again .
In one final session the guards admitted neither he nor Neda was part of any political group – " but that I had broken the law by talking " .
As pressure built – Neda 's family was demanding his release , as was Amnesty and other international organisations – they finally let him out on bail .
He remains charged with " conspiracy to overthrow the Islamic Republic of Iran " .
The families had to come up with $ 100,000 and the deeds to his father 's house .
On his release , he spent every morning at Neda 's grave .
He went early to avoid the security police that hung around the site .
" Neda loved sunrise , so I went early to be alone with her then .
When the sun came up , people started arriving .
It has become like a pilgrimage site . "
Everyone was telling him to get out , that he would be arrested again .
But it was difficult .
" I did n't want to leave .
For one , I believe this movement has not died out , and will never die out .
But when I saw the constraints I was under , that they had me under constant surveillance , and that I had to keep silent , I really could n't stand it . "
The journey out was traumatic – organised by professional smugglers .
He was ill and alone .
At one stage he had to cross a mountain pass on his own .
It took eight hours of steep climbing .
Caspian looks up .
He is relieved to have come to the end .
" As I left Tehran , I was looking around at the good people of Iran , who are kind and patient .
They looked so weighed down .
I am 38 years old .
I always will love Iran .
It was so hard – I was leaving Neda 's resting place .
I still cannot believe it .
I think I will see her again . "
Meanwhile he has a mission .
He wants to stage an exhibition in her memory .
This quiet dignified man will not let go .
" Now I have left Iran , I can cry out .
To break the silence . "
' An Iranian Martyr ' , directed by Monica Garnsey , will be broadcast on BBC2 on Tuesday , 24 November , at 9 pm .

This is less of a detailed tutorial and more of a tips & tricks to help you with your technique and speed .
Photoshop & a pen tablet required .
I hope you gain something out of it !
1 : The sketch I still do all of my preliminary sketches by hand and scan them in ; I seem to be able to work faster that way .
Your sketches , whether by hand or on the computer , do n't have to be neat or accurate - after all , nobody is going to see them when you 're all done :)
As long as you 've got enough to work with when doing your clean lineart , then that 's all you need to worry about .
2 : Lineart I use a hard - edged 4px brush for lineart , with size controlled by tablet pen pressure .
Try and get some variation in line thickness , as it helps to make it a little more dimensional .
With my tablet size , I also find it easiest to work at 200 % - the lines come out a lot smoother .
Finally , to make the colouring in stage a lot easier , make sure all your shapes are closed - do n't leave holes everywhere .
3 : Filling
This is why I keep all the shapes closed - it makes colouring in a lot faster .
I use the fill bucket tool on a new layer , set to ' all layers ' with a tolerance of 32 .
Sometimes the paint spills out over the outlines if they 're very thin ; I just set the tolerance a little lower for that section , and click multiple times with the fill .
4 : Details
The fill bucket can't do everything ; there will be tiny little dots left over in corners with no colour .
Setting your brush mode to ' behind ' will allow you to scribble over the holes like crazy without painting over any of your existing colour .
I also start filling in the details , like lips & eyes at this stage .
5 : Shine I add a bit of shine to the hair in two stages .
First , I use the lasso tool to make quick jaggy selections for the highlights , then fill in these areas with a lighter colour .
Then a soft edge airbrush with a 20 % flow setting is used to soften the harsh edges .
6 : Shadows I hide the colour layer for now , and use a hard - edged brush with size controlled by pen pressure to paint in the shadows on a new layer .
There 's no real reason why I use blue , other than the fact that it's a nice colour :)
7 : Duplicate Make a selection of the shadow layer by CTRL - clicking its icon in the layer palette , then select the colours layer and hit CTRL - J .
This will duplicate the colours layer based on the selection .
Disclosure of decision to review operation of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs follows home secretary 's sacking of David Nutt as the body 's chairman
The home secretary , Alan Johnson , has placed the future of the expert body at the centre of the row over drugs policy in doubt by ordering a swift review of how it operates , the Guardian has learned .
The disclosure follows his decision to sack Professor David Nutt as chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) on Friday after the scientist renewed his criticism of the government 's decision to toughen the law on cannabis .
Today , in response to an emergency Commons question , Johnson said that he had agreed to the request from the ACMD for an urgent meeting and insisted that his decision to sack Nutt was taken because of the way he had conducted himself as chairman and not because of the council 's policy advice on drugs .
Over the weekend , two other experts on the 40 - strong body resigned in protest and members wrote to Johnson today warning more could follow and calling for urgent talks .
It is thought that members could use a meeting next Monday to announce a mass resignation .
The purpose of the review of the ACMD , ordered in secret last month , is to " satisfy ministers " that the body is " discharging the functions " that it was set up to deliver and that it still represents value for money to the public .
It will also ensure that the drug experts are operating in line with their terms of reference .
It is being carried out by Sir David Omand , a former permanent secretary at the Home Office .
The review is being rushed by Whitehall standards with the closing date for submissions at the end of this month .
Omand has been asked to report back to ministers by early 2010 .
Today in the Commons , Johnson said that the former home secretary Jacqui Smith had made clear her dissatisfaction when Nutt publicly disagreed with her decision not to downgrade ecstasy by comparing its dangers with those from horse - riding .
She told him that she did not want it to happen again .
" Well , it has happened again , " said Johnson .
" On Thursday October 29 Professor Nutt chose , without prior notification to my department , to initiate a debate on drugs policy in the national media , returning to the February decisions , and accusing my predecessor or distorting and devaluing scientific research .
" As a result , I have lost confidence in Professor Nutt 's ability to be my principal adviser on drugs . "
He also downplayed the significance of the official review the ACMD is now facing .
The home secretary said it had being undertaken in line with Cabinet Office guidelines as part of the round of quinquennial reviews of non-departmental bodies .
Johnson also insisted that he was not criticising science or scientists but acting in a particular case .
He said the advice of independent scientific advisers was essential to the government .
" The role of such advisers is to provide independent advice to government based on their professional scientific expertise .
" The role of government is to consider that advice carefully , along with all other relevant factors , and for this house to endorse or reject those decisions , where appropriate . "
A letter from the ACMD to Johnson says the removal of Nutt raises for some members " matters of such seriousness as to raise the question whether they can , in good conscience , continue on the council " .
It adds : " There is a consensus amongst members that a face - to - face discussion is the correct and proper forum to take these matters further .
We will therefore continue as per the last two days and avoid discussion with the media , insofar as we can persuade members to comply .
Earlier Gordon Brown backed Johnson 's decision to sack Nutt , who had accused ministers of " devaluing and distorting " the scientific evidence over illicit drugs by their decision last year to reclassify cannabis from class C to class B against the advice of the ACMD .
The prime minister 's official spokesman insisted that Johnson 's decision was based on an " important principle " that advisers should present advice to ministers but should not campaign against their policy decisions .
While ministers were expected to take expert advice into account when considering an issue in the round , they were not bound to follow it .
" It would be regrettable if there were other resignations , but this is an important point of principle , " he added .
" The government is absolutely committed to the importance of having independent advice and evidence presented by advisory bodies . "
Asked about the decision to sack Nutt , the spokesman said Downing Street was informed by Johnson of his decision but the prime minister took no part in it .
Johnson 's decision follows the publication of a paper by the Centre for Crime and Justice at King 's College London , based on a lecture Nutt delivered in July .
He repeated his familiar view that illicit drugs should be classified according to the actual evidence of the harm they cause and pointed out that alcohol and tobacco caused more harm than LSD , ecstasy and cannabis .
He also argued that smoking cannabis created only a " relatively small risk " of psychotic illness .
Last week Johnson wrote to Nutt saying he no longer had confidence in him as chairman and asking him to consider his position ; a Home Office spokesman said on Friday that Johnson was surprised and disappointed by Nutt 's comments , which " damage efforts to give the public clear messages about the dangers of drugs " .
Two members of the ACMD resigned yesterday in protest at Nutt 's treatment .
Another member told the Guardian that the experts were " planning collective action " against Johnson , adding : " Everybody is devastated .
We 're all considering our positions . "
Nutt said there was " no future " for the council in its present form , and it is thought the group 's members may use a meeting next Monday to announce a mass resignation .
In a letter in the Guardian , Johnson today accused Nutt of " campaigning against government policy " but insisted he was not forced out because of his opinions .
" Professor Nutt was not sacked for his views , which I respect but disagree with , " he wrote .
" He was asked to go because he cannot be both a government adviser and a campaigner against government policy . "
The iPhone is one of the most wildly popular phones the world has ever seen , while Windows 7 is well on its way to becoming the globe 's most ubiquitous OS .
So compatibility between the two would be kinda sorta important , right ?
Tell that to Intel 's quality control team who seem to have somehow missed an issue between Apple 's app carrier deluxe and the P55 Express chipset 's USB controller .
Consistent ( and persistent ) syncing issues have been reported on Apple 's support forums , wherein iTunes on Windows 7 machines recognizes the iPhone , but spits out an " error 0xE8000065 " message whenever the user attempts to sync .
While some have found limited success with using PCI - based USB cards ( and bypassing the chipset ) , this is clearly a major issue and something Apple would expect to be fixed before shipping its Core i5 / i7 iMacs , which are likely to sport the chipset .

The war on Fox does n’t stop at the fence of the White House anymore , nor does it stop at the gates of liberal - heavy television networks like MSNBC .
Now it includes Lou Dobbs , the most conservative nighttime voice on CNN .
On his radio program Thursday , the 64 - year - old libertarian pundit rebuked a Fox Business correspondent for what he considered as mischaracterizing his comments on immigration .

“ Fox Business News — their new hire John Stossel — weighing in with his own brand of myopic idiocy and by the way no information whatsoever , he sat down with self - described rodeo clown Glenn Beck and listen to what he had to say , ” Dobbs begins .
“ If it means the Lou Dobbs kind of rants about immigrants wrecking America , I do n’t subscribe to that .
I think immigrants , by and large , do good things , ” Stossel says .
“ What a self - important ass , ” Dobbs quipped .
“ He does n’t understand basic economics .
He does n’t understand my point of view , nor does he care to .
He ’s just a silly little trick waiting to do some sort of Libertarian flip .
He ’s just unbelievable . ”
“ Immigrants wrecking America — I ’ve never said anything close to that , ” Dobbs said .
“ I welcome them .
I want more . ”
“ As a matter of public policy , we need them , ” he continued .
“ In no way am I restrictionist , and to hear this ass continue his act over at Fox News .
I just ca n’t wait until he starts blowing bubbles in the air — that ’s about all he ’s equipped to do . ”

Dobbs — and his network , CNN — have recently taken fire over their “ Latinos in America ” program , conducted by CNN ’s Soledad O’Brien .
Critics say the program fails to take into account Dobbs ’ vehement anti-illegal immigrant jeremiads .
Dobbs ’ characterization of his record does n’t include the fact he once accused immigrants of carrying leprosy to the United States , or conspiracy theory about Mexicans trying to take over part of the country .
In fact , a New York Times columnist noted that Dobbs once said there were 7,000 cases of leprosy in the United States , a statistic that appears to have been purely fictional .
Questioned about the claim by 60 Minutes , Dobbs said : “ Well , I can tell you this .
If we reported it , it ’s a fact . ”

In the hunt for alternatives to polluting and climate - warming fossil fuels , attention has turned to where rivers meet the sea .
Here , freshwater and saltwater naturally settle their salinity difference , a phenomenon that two pioneering projects in Europe will try to harness to generate clean energy .
This concept of " salt power " — also known as osmotic , or salinity - gradient , power — has been kicked around for decades , and now , proponents hope , technology has advanced enough to make it economically competitive .
On November 24 , the world 's first large - scale prototype facility for developing a form of salt power called pressure - retarded osmosis is expected to begin fully operating in Norway .
" The big reason to build this thing is to answer important questions [ about osmotic power ] , and while we 've done a lot of theoretical studies , we need live experience , " says Stein Erik Skilhagen , vice president of osmotic power at Statkraft , Norway 's state - owned power utility that built the plant .
The prototype will have no customers , although the very small amount of electricity it generates will technically be directed into the power grid .
Statkraft 's approximately $ 5 - million prototype plant is a converted paper mill in the seaside village of Tofte , about 60 kilometers south of Oslo .
The plant 's pressure - retarded osmosis setup will place freshwater and brine on either side of a semipermeable membrane that prevents the passage of salt particles but allows water through .
Water from the fresh side naturally flows into the salty side , generating pressure equivalent to a column of water 120 meters high .
This pressurized water can be used to turn a turbine to make electricity .
Statkraft 's goal is to yield five watts per square meter of membrane , although current capacity is about three watts .
If successful , the utility hopes to build a commercial salt power plant for paying customers around 2015 with a targeted cost ranging from seven to 14 cents per kilowatt - hour ( pdf ) ( at current euro–dollar conversion rates ) , which at the low end would be competitive with coal and natural gas prices .
To the south in the Netherlands , a Dutch research firm called Wetsus has fired up its own salt power experiment to evaluate what is essentially a saltwater –freshwater battery .
Wetsus , with the collaboration of a spin - off company called Redstack , is pursuing a version of salt power dubbed " blue energy " .
A pilot - scale installation that is about two times the size of a big American refrigerator is up and running in Harlingen , by the Wadden Sea , says Gert Jan Euverink , Wetsus 's deputy scientific director .
The technology relies on reverse electrodialysis , wherein a series of fresh and saltwater streams are diverted via underground pipes to opposite sides of two kinds of membranes .
These let sodium or chlorine ions — the constituent elements of salt — dissolved in the water to pass into separated freshwater streams .
This builds an electrical potential across the membranes , like a battery , and this charge reacts with iron to form an electric current .
Joost Veerman , a researcher at Wetsus , says the company aims to get five watts per square meter of membrane , the same result as Statkraft 's process .
Neither Statkraft nor Wetsus expects to crank out more than just a few kilowatts — enough to boil water — with their initial experiments .
Instead , they plan to demonstrate what could be scalable , commercially viable energy production as well as determine if salt power endangers the health of source - water estuaries .
Statkraft estimates salt power 's worldwide electricity - generating potential at up to 1,700 terawatt - hours , or about 10 percent of global demand .
Salt power is attractive for several reasons :
For one , unlike renewable energy technologies for harvesting solar or wind power , salt systems are not dependent on the weather and could provide baseload ( constant , predictable ) electricity like that supplied by coal , natural gas and nuclear energy .
" The river water is flowing into the sea 24/ 7 , so you have a constantly available source of energy , " Skilhagen says .
He also points out there are no emissions besides brackish water , which swirls in the river 's mouth anyway .
Unlike conventional hydropower , a saline power plant does not require damming off a waterway , and it may require less infrastructure than , say , riverbed - mounted turbines or floating fleets of generators for equivalent tidal and wave power .
A salt power plant , including its membrane stacks , turbines , cleaning facilities and offices , could actually be located in a riverside industrial complex 's basement , for example , or constructed underground within a riverbank with pipes extending into the waterway , Statkraft 's Skilhagen says — a big advantage for incorporating such facilities into already - developed , populated coastal areas .
Membrane design and performance remain the biggest hurdles for both Statkraft 's and Wetsus 's approaches .
The membranes must be made more efficient , durable and resistant to microbial buildup , or so - called biofouling .
Pretreating the pumped - in water by filtering out organic matter and river - borne debris helps , but this critical step consumes energy and is expected to be expensive , Skilhagen says , adding that it is too early to know just how expensive .
Accordingly , experts remain cautious about salt power 's prospects .
" Both these methods are promising and certainly worth researching , " says Ari Seppala , a mechanical engineer and thermodynamicist at the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland , " but both may still need a breakthrough innovation before commercialization . "
Seppala sees no physical or chemical showstoppers standing in the way of producing much - improved membranes , although he also points out that a better , membrane - free method could yet be found for exploiting salinity differences to yield electricity .
Another key uncertainty : a salt - power plant 's effect on the local aquatic environment .
" This is a completely new process that has not been tested on this scale , " says Menachem Elimelech , a professor of chemical and environmental engineering at Yale University .
" I doubt there will be no [ environmental ] impact at all . "
If the ecological footprint is minimal and the membrane technology advances , however , he adds that salt power could be a " significant renewable energy option . "
An all - sky map made by the IBEX spacecraft shows a surprising bright ribbon of emission coming from the edge of the solar system .
This story was updated at 3:06 p.m. EDT .
In the murky boundary between our solar system and the restof the galaxy , scientists have spotted a bright band of surprising high - energyemissions .
The results come from the first all - sky map created byNASA 's new InterstellarBoundary Explorer ( IBEX ) spacecraft , which launched in October 2008 .
Whileorbiting Earth , IBEX monitors incoming neutral atoms that originate billions ofmiles away at the solar system 's edge to learn about the interaction betweenthe sun and the cold expanse of space .
" The IBEX results are truly remarkable , with emissionsnot resembling any of the current theories or models of this never - before - seenregion , " said David McComas , IBEX principal investigator at the SouthwestResearch Institute in Texas .
" We expected to see small , gradual spatialvariations at the interstellar boundary , some 10 billion miles away .
However , IBEX is showing us a very narrow ribbon that is two to three times brighterthan anything else in the sky . "
This ribbon of energy lies at the very edge of the solarsystem , where the bubble of charged particles streaming from the sun finally petersout .
This bubble is called the heliosphere , and it encompasses the region ofspace dominated by the sun 's influence .
The edge of the solar system
At the boundary of the heliosphere , the sun'spositively - charged particles interact with neutral atoms drifting in frominterstellar space .
When these particles meet , an electron may hop over from a neutralatom to a charged one , called an ion .
The result : the charged particle becomesneutral .
IBEX detects these fast - moving neutral particles and traces their pathsback to the solarsystem 's edge to create a picture of this chaotic frontier .
" We 're just now getting a handle on the interaction ofthe surrounding interstellar medium with the heliosphere , and that 's providingus with the big picture , " said mission co-investigator Eberhard M?bius ofthe University of New Hampshire .
The mission scientists said they were surprised to discoverthe striking band in IBEX 's sky maps , because no models had predicted such apattern beforehand .
McComas said when he first saw the IBEX results he thought , " ' Something 's wrong , ' It was quite a long time before we convinced ourselvesthat we were right , " he said .
The bright ribbon appears to be shaped by the direction ofthe interstellar magnetic field outside the heliosphere .
Scientists think thissuggests that the galactic environment just outside the solar system has farmore influence on the structure of the heliosphere than previously believed .
" [ The ribbon is ] aligned by and dominated by theexternal magnetic field , " McComas said in a briefing Thursday .
" That 'sa huge clue as to what 's going on .
But still we 're missing some really fundamentalaspect of the interaction - some fundamental physics is missing from our understanding . "
The boundary of the solar system was first explored by the Voyager1 spacecraft in 2004 when it encountered an invisible shock created as thecharged particles streamingoff the sun hit the neutral gas from interstellar space .
Its sister craft Voyager2 followed into the solar system 's edge in 2007 .
While these spacecraft beganthe exploration of this wild frontier , IBEX is now revealing a whole newpicture .
" The most astounding feature in the IBEX sky maps ?
thebright narrow ribbon ?
snakes through the sky between the Voyager spacecraft , where it remained completely undetected until now , " McComas said .
The new IBEX results will be published in the Oct. 16 issueof the journal Science .

The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to the point where it becomes stronger than the democratic state itself .
That in its essence is fascism — ownership of government by an individual , by a group or any controlling private power .
Franklin D. Roosevelt ( 1882-1945 ) , 32nd and longest - serving US president
This great and powerful force — the accumulated wealth of the United States — has taken over all the functions of Government , Congress , the issue of money , and banking and the army and navy in order to have a band of mercenaries to do their bidding and protect their stolen property .
Senator Richard Pettigrew , Triumphant Plutocracy , 1922
I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies .
If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation , then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake - up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered .
Thomas Jefferson , ( 1743-1826 ) , 3rd US President , 1802
The U.S. national debt clock is clicking and it is fast approaching the $ 12 trillion mark , all the while the Fed ( less a central bank than the banks ’ Bank ) is printing new money like crazy and lending it to its client banks at close to zero interest rates ( i.e. at negative interest rates ) .
What is wrong with this picture ?
It simply means that most Americans are losing big at this game , but a handful of mega - banks and their affiliates are raking in tremendous amounts of money in easily made profits .
Indeed , the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet has more than doubled since August 2007 , going from $ 870 billion to more than $ 2 trillion .
It is expected to keep growing as banks avail themselves of the cheap funds the Fed made available to them .
The Fed , indeed , has the unique ability to create new dollars ( paper currency ) for the accounts of assets ( good or bad ) that it buys from banks , the Treasury , or other entities .
This increases the monetary base ( the sum of currency plus total banking reserves ) , and banks through their lending can expand this money supply even further .
And the Fed has been extraordinarily generous to the banks , the largest of them are in fact owners of the twelve regional Fed banks .
In fact , the Fed has broken practically every central banking rule in order to provide cheap funds to the banks .
First , it has pushed the fed funds rate to close to zero so banks could have credit at close to zero cost to them .
Second , it has expanded the range and quality of assets it stood ready to accept as collateral for its loans to the banks , so much so that it can be said that the U.S.
Fed is presently creating new money backed by the shakiest of assets , some being called “ toxic waste . ”
This is reminiscent of the eighteenth century ( beginning in 1789 ) practice of the French revolutionary government of creating new money ( the assignats ) backed by the seized properties of the Catholic Church .
Let ’s summarize quickly the numerous ways the Fed ( and to a certain extent , the U.S. Treasury ) have found to channel cheap funds to the banks and to brokers .
In September 2008 , some investment banks , such as Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan , officially became commercial banks in order to profit from the Fed ’s new generosity .
The Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) ;
The Primary Dealer Credit Facility ( PDCF ) ;
The Foreign Exchange Swap programs ( the currency swap lines ) ;
The Commercial Paper Funding Facility ( CPFF ) ;
The Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) ;
The Agency debt , Agency mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) and Treasury purchase programs ;
The Treasury ’s $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) ;
The payment of interest on the banks ’ excess reserves at the Fed .
The last disposition is worthy of attention .
Because of the easy and cheap lending to the banks , the latter piled up tremendous amounts of excess reserves at the Fed , reaching more than $ 700 billion .
Normally , banks would quickly lend these non-interest paying excess reserves to the economy .
But , in October 2008 , the Fed got imaginative and obtained the authority to pay interest on the banks ’ reserves , including excess reserves , at a risk - free rate ( the IOER rate ) .
Since then , the banks have been earning interest on their excess reserve holdings , and therefore had little inclination to lend those reserves out to creditworthy but nevertheless risky borrowers in the rest of the economy .
With this practice , the circle has been closed , and the Fed was able to provide needed funds to the banks , at close to zero cost , and enable them to rid themselves of their bad investments , without risking creating inflation .
That ’s quite a banking salvage operation that will be studied by economists in detail in the future .
Indeed , it was well understood after the onset of the financial crisis in August 2007 , that public capital would be needed to refinance the American banking system .
Private capital was too risk adverse to do that .
What was less understood was the fact that the Bush administration , and now the Obama administration that continues this policy , intended to provide this capital at close to no cost to the banks and with very scant conditions .
But who really paid and has continued to pay for this imaginative recapitalization of American banks , and who profits the most ?
First of all , of course , bank profits , specially those profits by big international banks , have exploded .
Bank stocks have followed suit with tremendous gains .
That ’s why I say the stock market rally since March 5 ( 2009 ) has been a liquidity - driven rally , engineered by the Fed .
And it is easy to see why banks raked in so much money :
They have been borrowing funds at close to zero cost to themselves and either were paid by the Fed to leave these funds unused or they have used them , with leverage through their hedge fund like activities , to buy interest - paying assets in the U.S. or abroad .
In essence , the large “ too big to fail ” have been allowed to make various trading bets with the cheap public capital provided by the Fed .
They gorged themselves with near free public money and used it to enrich themselves , and very little to finance the real economy .
One profitable trade , among others , that large international banks and other operators are found to embrace is a form of arbitrage :
They borrow and sell the currency of the country that has the lowest possible short - term funding costs and invest the proceeds in countries whose currency and asset markets yield the most .
This has the consequence of depreciating further the currency with low interest rates and of appreciating the other currencies .
During the 1990s , the Japanese economy was in the doldrums .
Its short - term interest rates , just as in the U.S. today , were close to zero .
International banks and hedge funds would then borrow yens in Japan , sell them for dollars or euros and invest the proceeds in high - yielding financial assets in the U.S. or in Europe .
Provided the interest rate environment does not change suddenly , this sort of “ carry trade ” is an easy way to make money .
The result , however , is a more depressed currency than necessary for the low interest rate country and more imported inflation as the price of imported goods ( oil , food , commodities … ) increases .
The U.S. is presently in that predicament .
The U.S. Fed and Treasury have abandoned the U.S. dollar and the large international banks have depressed it further at the same time they fill their coffers .
That is why we can say that , besides the profitable carry currency trade that banks and other operators employ to dump the U.S. dollar on foreign exchange markets , this currency will remain under pressure for as long as the spread of short - term interest rates favors other currencies and as long as the spread of expected inflation rates and of expected economic growth remain stable .
Paradoxically , longer - term interest rates have only increased marginally .
This is because banks and other Fed borrowers , when they do not leave their low interest - paying excess reserves dormant at the Fed , can buy risk - free Treasury bonds .
This has the consequence of depressing longer - term interest rates and of boosting stock market prices , even as inflation expectations are on the rise .
What is to be understood is that the weak dollar is the direct consequence of the Fed ’s extraordinary cheap money policy .
To summarize , the average American household is being hit from all sides with this policy .
First , if it is a net creditor ( as most retirees are ) , its savings are earning paltry returns ( most likely negative after inflation and taxes ) .
Second , the U.S. dollar keeps falling in value , raising the cost of traveling abroad and of everything that is imported .
Third , real incomes fall with rising prices as the purchasing power of stable or declining money incomes contracts .
Fourth , the exploding public debt will translate sooner or later into higher taxes , thus reducing private disposable incomes .
All in all , the standard of living of most people falls .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I do not question the need to inject liquidity into the banking system after the onset of the financial crisis in August 2007 .
What I question is the way this was done and how the public interest was sacrificed in favor of narrow private interests .
Indeed it was done in the worst possible social way , with private gains and social costs .
They ( the Bush and Obama administrations ) recapitalized the banks to the benefit of a small class of bankers , while taxing the entire population in a multitude of ways to finance the public subsidy .
There were other ways to attain the same end without taxing the many for the benefit of a few .
The U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Fed , both under the Bush administration and the Obama administration discarded these solutions .
That ’s where the scandal lies .
But since it is likely that only a handful of senators and congressmen understand what has happened , I would not be too confident in expecting that there would ever be a public investigation of the scandal , beginning with Congress auditing the Federal Reserve ’s subsidized banking loans to large banks and its lack of needed regulatory activities .
Kudos , however , to the Manhattan Chief U.S. District Court Judge who has ordered the Fed to make public its lending records .
Similarly , at least , some timid steps are being taken in the U.S. and in Europe to impose some limits or restrictions on the discretionary and exorbitant bankers ’ bonuses .
This comes a bit late , and we shall see if this is merely some political window - dressing to deflect criticism or if it is a structural step to curb oligopolistic and abusive banking practices .
Despite month - end required dollar dumping , US data is also starting to leave a sour taste .
Yesterday , the Chicago PMI and ADP print has a few dealers nervous for tomorrows NFP number .
The Bond market has piled into Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœflattenersÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ by buying the long - end of the curve ( the spread between 2 - yrs and longer maturities narrows ) , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s there way to express uneasiness of recent data .
The buck is tentatively receiving support , but not with everlasting conviction .
Perhaps , things are about to change .
Trichet wants a Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœstrong dollarÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , and now his side - kick Mr. Almunia has come out and stated that they will discuss the EUR appreciation and prepare their position for the upcoming G7 meeting next week .
It has not had the immediate impact , unlike the SNB intervention yesterday , but will surely have a few trigger happy dealers wanting to buy dollars soon enough .
Quick profit is fine , but , will the USD direction be somewhat sustainable ?
We are ready , bring on NFP !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 13 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœvolatileÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
There was disappointing data all - round yesterday from the USÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s perspective .
ADP was the early loser .
Over the past few months the correlation between ADP and NFP has been somewhat disjointed .
Yesterdays headline ( - 254 k ) still increases the risks of a larger hit to FridayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s expectations ( - 180 k ) .
Sept .’s decline was an improvement from the previous month and was the smallest drop in 14 - months .
Perhaps we can declare that the worst of the job slashing is now behind us ?
Digging deeper , one notices that employment in both the goods and the service - providing sectors continue to decline .
In fact , the goods sector accounted for most of the hit to employment , coming in at - 151 k , while the services fell by - 103 k jobs .
It was not surprising to see that small sized firms continue to slash jobs at the fastest pace ( - 100 k ) , while medium - sized firms came in at - 93 k and large business , fell by a more modest - 61 k .
We need the private sector to take the slack if we want to get out of this recession quicker !
Less bad is good in this environment .
Market consensus expected a deeper downward revision to 2nd Q Real GDP .
Pleasantly surprised , the market got - 0.7 % vs. - 1.2 % .
Digging deeper , smaller declines to personal consumption , gross private investment and net - exports accounted for most of the improvement .
Mind you , the government lent a hand increased its consumption .
Analysts expect to see a 3rd Q with positives , which in fact would technically mark the end of the recession in the US !
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that investment in inventories showed a greater decline than previous reports .
Down the road , will this support future production ?
What took US equities on a month end joy ride yesterday ?
An unexpected Chicago PMI was willing !
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœbusiness barometerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ unexpectedly fell to 46.1 vs. 52.2 last month ( anything sub - 50 implies contraction ) .
However , month and quarter end buying of equities has disguised the sour headline somewhat .
In the real world , the data captures the action from the auto - sector and shows that since the ending of ‘ cash for clunkers ’ , we should be worried again .
With auto - production having such a large influence does not bode well for a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsmoothÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ V - shape recovery .
The USD $ is currently higher against the EUR - 0.28 % , GBP - 0.03 % , CHF - 0.33 % and JPY - 0.23 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.06 % and AUD - 0.07 % .
Analysts are two for two in missing recent Canadian fundamental expectations .
Last week , no - one was in the same ball park when trying to predict Canadian retail sales ( - 0.8 % vs. +1.1 % ) .
Yesterday we had July Real GDP .
Consensus was expecting a positive headline of +0.8 % , instead we were fed a flat reading of +0.0 % , m / m .
With higher auto- production ( +17 % ) , it provided some support , but was not enough to offset the weakness in utilities , agriculture , mining , oil and gas extraction .
A number like this does not warrant the BOC to rush and hike rates anytime soon .
Depending on what the last 2 - months bring us , we could be setting up for a tepid 3Q GDP print .
Other data showed that Canadian producer prices ( RMPI +3.7 % ) got a boost from rising petroleum prices , with industrial product price gains ( IPPI +0.5 % ) affected by the recent appreciation in the loonie ( +3.1 % ) .
If we excluded the exchange rate , then IPPI would have gained by + 1.3 % .
Despite all this , the loonie managed to advance the most in 3 - weeks after the IMF cut its projection for global write - downs and the continued pressure on a sickly USD managed to drag the loonie begrudgingly higher .
On deeper USD pull - backs , speculators are happy to sell the domestic currency .
No big surprises here , the AUD managed to retreat from its 13 - month highs on the back of global bourses seeing red .
Technically , the relative value of the currency may have overshot its mark in the short term .
With equities expected to open the North American session under pressure has persuaded investors to temporarily shy away from the higher yielding asset classes ( 0.8818 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 70.01 down - 60 c ) .
Oil prices ended the month on a high yesterday after the weekly EIA report recorded a large gas drawdown .
The weak dollar certainly contributed to its advance .
LetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s start with the surprise .
The EIA report revealed - 1.6 m barrel drop in gas inventories , inline with the API print , but against analysts ’ expectations of an increase .
Over the past month , US gas demand is up +5 % and this after the end of the holiday driving season !
On the flip side , crude inventories happened to increase by +2.8 m barrels , w/w , vs. expectations of a +600 k rise .
Demand destruction remains , as the increase in distillate inventories was smaller than expected and posted monthly demand down - 9 % from this time last year .
In fact , a closer look tells us that the report remains mixed with a bias towards oil products , like heating oil and diesel , to remain weak .
Then why are we once again experiencing elevated prices ?
Given that overall demand remains weak , the sickly dollar and equities continue to influence price direction .
With energy fundamentals remaining unconvincing , it would be a safe bet that the black stuff should be confined to its $ 10 range of $ 65 - $ 75 .
We can never rule out the political influence .
The threat of imposing greater sanction on Iran because of its nuclear program has heightened geo-political issues .
Technically oil prices are inflated , they are not supported by market fundamentals , but geo-politics will always keep the black - stuffs prices artificially high .
All asset classes are ending the month and Q - end higher .
This also includes Gold .
Yesterday , with the USD under month end selling pressure , had investors coveting the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as al alternative investment .
Mind you , geo-political tensions in the Middle East will always boost the demand for the hard - stuff ( $ 1,008 ) .
The Nikkei closed at 9,978 down - 154 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,674 down - 1 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 5,126 down - 7 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year bonds eased 1 bp yesterday ( 3.30 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasury prices continue to maintain their bid as investors speculate that the Fed will signal that interest rates will remain at record - low levels for the ‘ foreseeable future ’ as inflation remains subdued .
Dealers will tell you that mid to long - bonds are ending the largest 3 - month gain since the 4th Q of 2008 .
Data this week continues to point to a sluggish growth path .
This has even Bill Gross from PIMCO favoring government debt amid deflation concerns .
With global bourses under pressure , uncertain NFP data this Friday has risk aversion investors seeking yield .

One day after assuming power , the Socialists launched a massive invasion of Exarcheia , the Athens anarchist enclave , with mass detentions and brutal intimidation of locals .
On the early hours of Friday 9 of October , four days after the landslide victory of the Socialists in the greek national elections , and only a day after assuming power , the Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( Pasok ) proved its intentions towards the social antagonistic movement that has swept the country since the December Uprising : brutal repression .
Almost one thousand cops of all corpses , riot police , motorised police , secret police and usual uniformed officers swept Exarcheia , the anarchist enclave of the greek capital , at 01.30 am .
The mass invasion of the police - free area was orchestrated by the new Minister of Public Order ( or as the Socialist newspeak has it Minister of Citizens ' Protection )
Mr Chrisohoidis , infamous for his unorthodox methods in capturing and interrogating members of the November 17 urban guerrilla group in the summer of 2002 - i.e. torture .
On his side the genius of repression has as of yesterday Mr Vougias , a well - known ex extreme - leftist eager to share his knowledge of things revolutionary with the State .
During the invasion , which came only a day after the new PM , Mr Papandreou the 3rd , announced that his government is " antiauthoritarians in power " , hundreds of people were stopped and harassed by cops who broke into 26 bars , camped in the liberated park of Navarinou street and generally portrayed a most avenging and brutal attitude towards anyone who just happens to be within the invisible boundaries of the radical area .
Reports claim that several young people were seriously beaten during the operations .
According to the press more than 60 people were detained during the pogrom .
Mr Vougias announced that " anomy will be abolished " and connected the invasion with an attack launched the previous morning by more than a dozen activists against banks and a fascist bookshop in the centre of the city as an act of solidarity to the 3 boys arrested under the anti-terrorist law .
A couple of years ago , John Bulloch watched an alarming report on an Atlanta TV station about an exotic - sounding drug called Salvia divinorum .
Bulloch had never heard of the plant , a psychoactive relative of sage that the Mazatec Indians of Oaxaca , Mexico , have used for centuries in healing and divination rituals .
But according to the news report , salvia was becoming increasingly popular among American college students , who sometimes called it " Sally D " or " magic mint " ( since salvia , like sage , is a member of the mint family ) .
The most horrifying fact of all : Salvia was perfectly legal .
In their far - reaching crackdowns on drugs that people enjoy , state and federal legislators somehow had missed a plant that contains the most powerful naturally occurring psychedelic known to man .
Bulloch — a Republican state senator who represents the area around Ochlocknee , Georgia , a tiny town near the Florida border — was astounded .
" I thought , ' Why has n't somebody already jumped on this ? ' ? " he told the Florida Times - Union in March 2007 .
" I hurriedly got legislative counsel to draft the bill " — legislation making it a misdemeanor to grow , sell , or possess salvia .
" Since then , " the Times - Union reported , " Bulloch has been scouring the Internet to find information about salvia .
None of what he has learned has dissuaded him from trying to make it illegal . "
Bulloch 's approach to salvia — ban first , ask questions later — epitomizes how drug policy is made in America .
Although his bill has not yet passed , 15 states have banned salvia since 2005 , and many others are considering similar legislation .
Their precipitous action makes the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , which has been monitoring salvia as " a drug of concern " since 2003 but still has no definite plans to classify it as a prohibited substance , look rational and reticent by comparison .
The penalties for violating state salvia laws vary from modest fines to decades in prison .
Kenneth Rau , a North Dakota bottling plant employee who has the dubious distinction of being the first American arrested for salvia possession , bought eight ounces of leaves on eBay for $ 32 in December 2007 .
He says he did not realize a state ban on the plant had taken effect the previous August — a plausible claim , especially since the plant matter that police discovered in his home was clearly labeled " salvia . "
Last spring
Rau received three years of probation for simple possession .
But he originally was charged as a dealer and could have received a prison sentence of up to 20 years , all for a bag of leaves that was legal in North Dakota four months before he bought it and remains legal in most of the country .
To drug policy historians , the reasons for the rush to ban salvia are familiar .
Sensationalistic press coverage , in this case supplemented by salvia users ' documentation of their own trips on YouTube , has attracted the attention of legislators eager to grandstand as guardians of vulnerable and impressionable " young people . "
Few politicians can resist the allure of a drug described as " cheaper than marijuana , stronger than LSD , as fast - acting as crack cocaine , and legally available to minors " ( as The Ithaca Journal put it in 2004 ) .
The endless repetition of a few anecdotes that supposedly demonstrate salvia 's dangers — most conspicuously , the story of a Delaware teenager 's 2006 suicide — has found a receptive audience among politicians who automatically assume that an unfamiliar psychoactive substance must be a menace .
And since these lawmakers bridle at the notion that anything good could possibly come from altering your consciousness , they see no downside to banning salvia before it becomes a problem .
The idea that salvia " could become the next marijuana " ( as the Associated Press warned last year ) is mostly misbegotten .
The salvia experience is so unpredictable , so incompatible with social interaction , and so frequently boring or unpleasant that it 's safe to assume the herb will never be as popular as pot .
But the comparison rings true in several other respects :
Both salvia and marijuana are psychoactive plants linked in the public mind to Mexico , both appear to be nontoxic for all practical purposes , and both have intriguing medical potential .
Salvia 's detractors , like marijuana's in the 1920s and ' 30s , claim it causes insanity and violence .
In both cases prohibition occurred at the state level first .
If salvia continues to follow the pattern set by marijuana , it will ultimately be banned throughout the country , despite a dearth of evidence that it poses a serious threat to individual health or to public safety .
Something About Mary
Salvia 's ritual use in Mexico goes back hundreds of years , but outsiders paid little attention to it until the mid-20th century .
Starting in 1938 , anthropologists and naturalists visiting Oaxaca mentioned a visionary tea made from a plant variously called hierba Maria ( herb of Mary ) , hoja de adivinación ( leaf of prophecy ) , or ska Maria Pastora ( leaves of Mary the Shepherdess ) .
They reported that the local healers known as curanderos used the potion , traditionally linked to the Virgin Mary , to diagnose illness and locate lost objects , finding clues in what their patients / clients said under its influence .
The self - taught American mycologist and ethnobotanist R. Gordon Wasson , best known for his research on hallucinogenic mushrooms , was the first visitor to describe his own experiences with ska Maria Pastora .
In a 1962 leaflet published by Harvard University 's Botanical Museum , Wasson announced " a new Mexican psychotropic drug from the mint family " that he and his colleagues dubbed Salvia divinorum ( diviner 's sage ) .
He said it was " a psychotropic plant that the Mazatecs consume when mushrooms are not available , " a " less desirable substitute " for psilocybin - containing fungi .
In a 1961 salvia ceremony , Wasson drank a foul - tasting mixture of leaf juice and water under the guidance of a curandera .
" The effect of the leaves came sooner than would have been the case with the mushrooms , was less sweeping , and lasted a shorter time , " he reported .
" There was not the slightest doubt about the effect , but it did not go beyond the initial effect of the mushrooms — dancing colors in elaborate , three - dimensional designs . "
The second time around , about a year later , Wasson was joined by his friend Albert Hofmann , the Swiss chemist who first synthesized LSD .
They experienced similar effects .
Given Wasson 's lack of enthusiasm for salvia , it 's not surprising that the plant remained obscure for decades , with nothing like the fame or following attracted by LSD , psilocybin , or peyote .
That began to change in the 1990s , thanks largely to the efforts of another amateur ethnobotanist .
Daniel Siebert first came across salvia in the late 1970s while researching medicinal plants .
Later someone gave him a cutting , which he used to grow a plant that he added to his collection of interesting herbs .
About a year later he accidentally broke off part of the plant and decided to try it , chewing up a wad of 26 large leaves .
" It was that initial experience that really piqued my interest , " he says .
" I found the effects really intriguing , and it was very comfortable and easy to handle — much more manageable than most other psychedelic drugs I had tried . "
Today Siebert , who lives in Malibu , runs the Salvia Divinorum Research and Information Center ( sagewisdom.org ) , the most comprehensive online repository of information about the plant .
The website , which also sells the herb , includes a link to a 1994 article Siebert published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology that helped explain why ska Maria had disappointed so many psychonauts .
Siebert 's research confirmed that salvinorin A , first isolated a decade before , was the plant 's main psychoactive ingredient .
It turned out to be highly potent , producing noticeable effects at a dose of half a milligram , compared to about 10 milligrams for psilocybin and 250 milligrams for mescaline .
( Contrary to some overheated press reports about salvia , LSD , a synthetic psychedelic , is far more powerful than any of these , effective at doses as low as 50 micrograms , or five - hundredths of a milligram . )
Siebert 's experiments with volunteers who tried different routes of administration revealed that swallowing salvia was the worst way to absorb salvinorin A , which is " deactivated by the gastrointestinal system . "
Two other routes were much more successful : through the oral mucous membrane ( by holding masticated leaves or leaf juice in the mouth ) and through the lungs ( by inhaling the vapor ) .
This information , combined with the realization that salvinorin A is highly stable and remains in salvia leaves even when they 're dried , set the stage for the plant 's commercialization .
Soon it was available from head shops and online vendors in the form of liquid extracts and smokable dried leaves , often fortified with extract .
Holding the liquid in the mouth more closely resembles the traditional method of consuming salvia , with the effects felt in five to 10 minutes and lasting an hour or two .
But the alcohol - based extract tastes terrible and produces relatively subtle effects .
( See " Salvia and Salivation , " page 42 . )
The smoked form produces faster , more intense , and shorter effects , appearing within 30 seconds and subsiding after five to 10 minutes .
It sells much better .
According to the latest data from the federal government 's National Survey on Drug Use and Health , 1 million Americans used salvia in 2007 , up from 750,000 in 2006 , the first year the survey asked about the drug .
Those numbers make salvia currently more popular than LSD , used by 620,000 Americans in 2007 .
( In terms of lifetime use , however , acid droppers outnumber salvia smokers by nearly 10 to 1 . )
Salvia , like other psychedelics , is most popular among 18 - to - 25 - year - olds , 2 percent of whom report past - year use .
As is often the case with drug fads , interest in salvia has been driven partly by the same press coverage that has encouraged legislators to crack down on it .
Salvia distributors say they see spikes in sales after anti-salvia articles appear .
" Every time there 's a news story on it , " says John Boyd , CEO of Arena Ethnobotanicals in Encinitas , California , " it brings it to people 's attention . "
Still , salvia is much less popular than marijuana , used by 25 million Americans in 2007 .
It is also less likely to be used more than once .
Tiffin University psychologist Jonathan Appel , who co-authored a 2007 article on the rising popularity of salvia in the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction , says , " We 're talking about a small percentage of people who are using it and an even smaller percentage of people who go back and use it again . "
' The Worst Substance of This Earth '
Siebert says the prevalence of smoking , which produces quick , intense effects , helps explain why many users report overwhelming experiences they are not eager to repeat .
High doses are another factor , since vendors compete based on the potency of their fortified leaves , bragging that they are anywhere from five to 100 times as powerful as the untreated plant .
" When you smoke , " Siebert says , " the effects come on almost instantly , and it 's disorienting .
Suddenly you have this dramatic shift of consciousness , especially if you 're taking a high dose , and it can be frightening and uncomfortable .
That starts everything off on the wrong foot . "
Last year a commenter on reason 's blog , Hit & Run , called salvia " THE WORST substance of this Earth , " adding , " If you want kids to stay off of drugs , give them some Salvia and tell them this is what cannabis , hash , and LSD are all like . "
Erowid.org , a website that provides information on a wide variety of psychoactive substances for an audience that is more Leary than leery , is less vehement , but it notes that salvia 's effects " are considered unpleasant by many people . "
Bryan Roth , a psychiatrist and pharmacologist at the University of North Carolina , led the research that showed how salvinorin A binds to the brain .
" Most people will say they do n't like it , " he says .
" It 's just too intense .
If it has any effect at all , I would say it would be to diminish the tendency for drug abuse . "
Users are apt to be especially disappointed if they are expecting a fun party drug similar to marijuana .
" I smoked with a friend last week who became the leg of a table , " says Rick Doblin , president of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies .
In his 1994 paper , Siebert listed commonly reported themes of salvia experiences , including " becoming objects , " " visions of various two - dimensional surfaces , " " revisiting places from the past , " " loss of the body and / or identity , " " various sensations of motion , " " uncontrollable hysterical laughter , " and " overlapping realities . "
Such experiences might be interesting , rewarding , or revealing , but they are not exactly conducive to social activities .
" Salvia is not a recreational substance , " says Jeffrey Bottoms , who works at Mazatec Garden , a salvia importer and distributor in Houston .
" It is n't pleasant .
It does n't make you feel good .
It 's not a mood elevator .
If you 're depressed , it 's not going to make you feel a little better .
In fact , it will make you feel a lot worse . "
Ready to try it yet ?
First you may want to check out the videos .
Search for " salvia " on YouTube , and you 'll find hundreds of videos of teenagers and young adults staring into space , laughing hysterically , falling over , crawling on the floor , and speaking in tongues while their friends alternately giggle and reassure them that it will all be over soon .
These videos , widely credited with helping to popularize salvia , do not make it seem very appealing .
Nor are they all that alarming , except perhaps as a sign that a disturbingly large number of people want the world to see their displays of drug - induced idiocy .
In some of the videos , the salvia smoker freaks out a little , but these " bad trips " ( breathlessly advertised as such ) look pretty mild , consisting mainly of restlessness and a repeatedly expressed wish for an end to the ride , which arrives soon enough .
Yet the YouTube videos come up frequently in newspaper stories about salvia and in the comments of politicians who want to ban it .
In January , explaining his motive for sponsoring a prohibition bill , Maryland state Sen. Richard Colburn ( R- Dorchester County ) told the Baltimore Examiner that the YouTube footage is " pretty disturbing , " adding , " Just imagine if that was your child . "
Colburn 's YouTube - inspired bill would classify salvia as a Schedule I substance , making people who sell it subject to prison terms of up to 20 years .
According to the Santa Fe Reporter , New Mexico state Rep. Keith Gardner ( R - Chavez ) , sponsor of a similar bill , " says all the evidence he needs of the drug 's dangerous potential is available on YouTube . "
He told the paper the videos are " dramatic as hell — you gotta watch 'em .
At first I thought , ' This is just somebody pretending . '
It 's amazing how powerful this drug is . "
Texas state Rep. Armando Martinez ( D- Weslaco ) says he introduced a bill that would ban salvia sales to minors based on " what we 've seen on YouTube and what a friend of mine 's nephew had mentioned about all this . "
He settled on age restrictions , as opposed to a complete ban , because it seemed easier to accomplish .
" Any way we could stop this from getting into the hands of our children or adolescents , " he says , " I think that it 's something we need to do .
If that means a complete ban , then I would support a complete ban . "
Texas state Rep. Charles " Doc " Anderson ( R - Waco ) already does , arguing that age restrictions could " do more harm than good , " making salvia use a mark of adulthood .
The New York Times reports that Anderson has tried to stir up support for a ban among his colleagues by citing a YouTube video that shows a salvia smoker behind the wheel of a car .
The video in question , " Driving on Salvia , " is part of a humorous series called " Being Productive on Salvia " featuring a Los Angeles production assistant named Erik Hoffstad .
Other episodes include " Gardening on Salvia " and " Writing a Letter to Congress on Salvia . "
The running gag is that Hoffstad can't manage to do much of anything after taking a salvia hit .
In " Driving on Salvia , " he never actually tries to start the car , and the scariest moment occurs when a cat unexpectedly jumps on the hood .
' Beyond Anything We Have Seen Before '
Martinez and Anderson both raise the specter of salvia - impaired driving , but neither can cite any real - life examples of it , in Texas or elsewhere .
That 's not surprising , since ( as Hoffstad 's video illustrates ) someone tripping on salvia , unlike someone who has had a few drinks , is in no condition to get into a car , start it up , and drive away .
It seems the only way this hazard could materialize is if someone brought a bongful of salvia with him on a drive and lit it up while stopped at a light .
Although the driving scenario seems implausible , salvia prohibitionists are right that there is a potential for accidents under the drug 's influence , which is why vendors warn their customers to put away hazardous objects and enlist a " sober sitter " to keep an eye on them during their trip .
When I press Martinez and Anderson for examples of actual harm caused by salvia use , as opposed to hypothetical risks , the best they can do is cite bad but brief trips .
Anderson also claims " we are seeing the flashback scenario . "
But as Siebert notes , " Any kind of intense or traumatic experience , " including war , car crashes , and near - death experiences , " can produce flashbacks .
…
Intense psychedelic experiences can be extremely frightening , and it may be that there 's some internal psychological mechanism of revisiting that kind of material later .
But it does n't appear that there 's any organic , direct reason for this .
It 's not like the drug hangs around the system and suddenly pops up in your brain one day .
It seems to be more like the way the brain deals with very intense or confusing experiences . "
Last fall Anderson told the Waco Tribune - Herald that " with a single use [ salvia smokers ] can cause some serious , serious damage to their brain . "
Roth , the salvia researcher , says " there 's no evidence for that statement . "
In fact , says Siebert , animal studies of salvia give " no indication of it having any significant toxic effects , even at doses that are hundreds of times more than what humans would ordinarily use . "
Even salvia 's detractors concede that addiction does not seem to be an issue , since few people who try the drug want to use it on a regular basis .
Despite a dramatic increase in use during the last few years , emergency rooms are not seeing a flood , or even a trickle , of salvia users , probably because a hospital trip usually takes longer than a salvia trip .
The lack of alarming statistics helps explain why the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) , which has the power to ban psychoactive substances without new legislation , is still waiting and watching six years after declaring salvia a " drug of concern . "
DEA spokesman Rusty Payne says , " I do n't think we have enough information yet . "
And there 's no telling when they will .
" It 's going to take a while , " Payne says .
" If we decide to schedule [ salvia ] , we 'll publish a notice [ in the Federal Register ] .
If we do n't , we wo n't . "
Although Payne says the delay should not be read as a judgment on salvia 's dangers , the DEA can act much more quickly when it wants to , as when it banned MDMA on an emergency basis in 1985 .
" When they say they 've been looking at it for years , " says Rick Doblin , " it means it 's not much of a problem . "
Nor is salvia a high priority at the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
Officially , the FDA says herbal products like salvia are " unapproved new drugs " and " misbranded drugs " if they are " marketed with claims implying that these products mimic the effects of controlled substances . "
Products are deemed to be " illegal street drug alternatives " when they are " intended to be used for recreational purposes to effect psychological states ( e.g. , to get high , to promote euphoria , or to induce hallucinations ) . "
" I am aware of that law , " says Arena Ethnobotanicals CEO John Boyd , " and that 's why if you check our website there are no references to anything like that . "
Many salvia vendors do tout the psychoactive effects of their products , promising " psychedelic , " " visionary , " " enlightening , " and " enjoyable " experiences .
Yet except for two warning letters it sent in 2002 , the FDA does not seem to have taken any enforcement actions against companies that sell salvia .
While FDA spokesman Christopher Kelly says " we do not discuss potential , pending , or ongoing actions , " none of the distributors I interviewed was aware of any recent warnings or seizures .
As for Congress , Rep. Joe Baca ( D - Calif . ) introduced a bill to ban salvia in 2002 , declaring , " We know very little about the drug , but what we do know is frightening .
This drug 's power is beyond anything we have seen before . "
But the bill died in committee , and Baca never reintroduced it .
I contacted his office a couple of times to find out why but did not get an answer .
' Our Existence in General Is Pointless '
By contrast , there 's been a flurry of anti-salvia activity at the state level in the last few years .
With so little evidence that salvia is hazardous , prohibitionists lean heavily on anecdotes .
Ohio state Rep. Thom Collier ( R - Mount Vernon ) , who introduced a salvia ban that took effect in April , said he was motivated by the death of a Loudonville boy who was shot by a friend .
But according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer , " it is n't clear whether the friend was on the drug when he shot and killed the 12 - year - old . "
The Columbus Dispatch notes " there was no direct evidence … that the shooting was drug- related . "
Similarly , when Rep. Baca proposed a federal salvia ban in 2002 , he cited the case of Daniel Moffa , a 15 - year - old Rhode Island boy who smoked salvia one morning and stabbed his pot dealer on the way to school .
Moffa later told WPRI , the Fox affiliate in Providence , that he was " paranoid " and " hallucinating , " thinking the dealer looked " evil " and " horrible . "
The story sounded fishy to Daniel Siebert , since he did n't think a salvia user on a trip that intense would be able to coordinate his movements well enough to meet someone and repeatedly stab him .
Still , Moffa 's parents initially blamed salvia for the assault because " we had no other plausible explanation , " the boy 's father explained in a 2007 email message to Siebert .
Since then , the father said , " we have found out that Dan suffers from bipolar affective disorder with psychosis . "
While " the salvia may have contributed to an episode , " he added , it " was not the real cause . "
The most influential salvia horror story involves Brett Chidester , a Wilmington , Delaware , 17 - year - old who in January 2006 pitched a tent in his parents ' garage , went inside it with a burning charcoal grill , and stayed there until he was dead from carbon monoxide poisoning .
Brett had been experimenting with salvia and claimed it had given him profound insights .
" Salvia allows us to give up our senses and wander in the interdimensional time and space , " he wrote in an essay discovered after his death .
" Also , and this is probably hard for most to accept , our existence in general is pointless .
Final point :
Us earthly humans are nothing . "
A month after Brett 's death , his mother , Kathy Chidester , told the Wilmington News - Journal : " We just wo n't have any answers , and we have to learn to accept that .
But my gut feeling is it was the salvia .
It 's the only thing that can explain it . "
A month later , the state legislature had approved Brett 's Law , which made salvia a Schedule I drug .
The same week the ban took effect , Delaware 's deputy chief medical examiner , Adrienne Sekula - Perlman , changed Brett 's death certificate , adding " salvia divinorum use " as a contributing cause .
Since then Kathy Chidester has campaigned for similar laws across the country , and 15 more states have either banned salvia or ( in the case of California and Maine ) prohibited sales to minors .
The laws all passed by overwhelming margins , in some cases unanimously .
Anti-salvia bills have been introduced in at least 22 other states .
" My hope and goal is to have salvia regulated across the U.S. , " Chidester wrote in testimony supporting the proposed salvia ban in Maryland last January .
" It 's my son 's legacy and I will not end my fight until this happens . "
Appel , the Tiffin University psychologist , does not think salvia should be legal for general use , but he is reluctant to draw any firm conclusions about Brett Chidester 's death .
" I would n't feel comfortable saying it caused him to commit suicide , " he says .
Such explanations , he adds , are " a way to try to make sense of something that 's pretty senseless .
We 're always looking for rationalizations and reasons , particularly when there are n't any . "
Roth , the University of North Carolina psychiatrist , is also opposed to using salvia recreationally , partly because of the psychological risks .
But he says it 's difficult to say what role the drug might have played in Brett Chidester 's suicide .
Although " it 's tragic that this young guy killed himself , " he says , " there 's no way of knowing if salvia had anything to do with it .
… There have been a couple of reports of people having long - term psychotic episodes after smoking it that have appeared in the literature .
It would seem , given the apparent widespread use of salvia , that if these are side effects , they do n't occur at very high prevalence .
Otherwise , the ERs would be filled with people having bad salvia reactions . "
Siebert concedes that salvia " might have influenced [ Brett Chidester 's ] thinking in some way " but adds : " He must have already had some thoughts about suicide .
I do n't think salvia 's just going to put thoughts into peoples ' heads .
Mentally healthy people do n't decide to take such a drastic action based on [ an idea ] they had during a drug state .
Psychedelics basically amplify a lot of your own internal stuff .
If you 're already having some kind of dark thoughts , a psychedelic experience could amplify that , and it could lead to a problem for some people . "
Notably , there is no indication that Brett Chidester was under the influence of salvia when he killed himself .
The idea seems to be that using the drug encouraged him to reach conclusions about the nature of life that were conducive to suicide .
That theory , notes Richard Glen Boire , a senior fellow at the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics , " could apply to some of the greatest pieces of art in the history of the world .
It would make Nietzsche a controlled substance .
There is a lot of cultural production out there that shows a way of looking at the world that is n't all sunny and rosy . "
' One Life Lost Is One Too Many '
If Brett Chidester 's suicide looms large in the thinking of anti-salvia legislators in other states , that 's partly because they rarely have evidence of harm caused by the drug closer to home .
According to local press coverage in one state after another , police are not reporting salvia - related problems .
Neither are schools , hospitals , or drug treatment centers .
Legislators want to ban it anyway .
Their reasoning is simple :
Why wait for a problem ?
Martinez , the Texas legislator , says he favors " a proactive approach . "
Over the course of my 10 - minute interview with him , he says " one life lost is one too many " four times and " you ca n't put a price on life " three times .
To his colleague Anderson , who utters the phrase " it 's a hallucinogen " eight times during a 30 - minute conversation , it 's self - evident that any drug falling into that category should be banned .
Georgia state Sen. Don Thomas ( R - Dalton ) has a similar attitude .
In 2007 he candidly told the Florida Times - Union he knew nothing about the benefits of salvia use .
" I just know about the publicity of the dangers of it , " he said , " so my first impression is to ban anything of that nature . "
That same year , defending legislation that would ban the sale of salvia to adults , Wisconsin state Rep. Sheldon Wasserman ( D - Milwaukee ) told the Wisconsin State Journal , " This bill is all about protecting our children . "
Salvia prohibitionists say a complete ban is necessary to protect children because , as Wisconsin state Sen. Julie Lassa ( D - Stevens Point ) told the Wausau Daily Herald in 2007 , " many people believe that because it is legal there are no risks associated with using salvia . "
Last year Massachusetts state Rep. Vinny deMacedo ( R - Plymouth ) told the Plymouth News , " I believe by not making this drug illegal we are sending a message to our youth that it is OK . "
Appel , the psychologist , agrees that salvia users " make the assumption that because it 's legal it 'll be safe . "
But people do not assume that tobacco and alcohol are safe simply because they are legal .
Furthermore , anyone researching salvia online would come across myriad warnings from vendors and users about the drug 's risks , along with the YouTube videos , which highlight the potential for bad trips .
" I do n't buy this idea that people think because it 's legal it must be good , " says Doblin , " because the corollary is not true . "
Especially when it comes to marijuana , he says , " People do n't think , ' It 's illegal , so it must be bad . ' ? "
People inclined to experiment with salvia , he says , generally do n't believe that " the drug laws make sense . "
To the extent that people do believe that , says Richard Glen Boire of the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics , it 's a dangerous misconception .
" In a mature society , " he says , " you would laugh at the idea that if something is available it is therefore stamped ' approved ' and ' safe . '
I do n't think we should be creating a society that 's safety proofed in a way that [ ignores ] the reality of living . "
Yet the war on drugs has conditioned people to expect that , with a few grandfathered exceptions , psychoactive substances that are not classified as pharmaceuticals will be banned .
You hear it from salvia smokers on YouTube as well as salvia scaremongers in state legislatures : I can't believe this stuff is legal .
Ultimately , that is the crux of the prohibitionist argument .
Salvia must be banned because it 's legal .
Once a few legislatures act on that premise , public officials in other states start to worry they will look irresponsible if they do n't follow suit .
Last year Van Ingram , compliance branch manager with the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy , told the Owensboro Messenger - Inquirer , " Our neighbors in Tennessee and Missouri felt it was important enough , so it is important for us to look at it as well . "
A month later , after the Florida legislature approved a salvia ban , state Sen. Evelyn Lynn ( R - Daytona Beach ) told the Associated Press , " I 'd rather be at the front edge of preventing the dangers of the drug than waiting until we are the 40th or more . "
' A Philosopher 's Tool '
Since there is no political upside to resisting prohibitionism , it 's surprising when legislators decline to panic .
Two states — Maine and California — have prohibited salvia sales to minors instead of banning the drug completely .
This year Maryland 's House of Delegates likewise ended up rejecting a ban and endorsing age restrictions , but the state Senate did not act on the bill before the end of the legislative session .
The Drug Policy Alliance , which testified against the Maryland ban , also helped change a New Mexico prohibition bill into a ban on sales to minors , although the legislation has not passed yet .
One respectable antiprohibitionist argument is that banning salvia could impede valuable medical research .
Salvinorin has intriguing properties that have made its derivatives the focus of research aimed at finding better treatments for pain , drug addiction , depression , and various neurological conditions .
" For those of us who study this sort of thing , " says Bryan Roth , " the fact that salvinorin binds to just one [ brain receptor ] is pretty amazing .
It opens up the possibility that if we can find drugs that block the effects of salvinorin at that receptor , they might be effective in treating a number of diseases . "
Roth worries that placing salvinorin on Schedule I of the federal Controlled Substances
Act , the most restrictive category , will " make it more difficult to do research on it and investigate the potential therapeutic utility of derivatives .
By definition , a Schedule I drug is devoid of any medical benefit .
That makes it next to impossible to demonstrate any medical benefit .
They made LSD Schedule I in the '60s , and they 're only now getting around to looking at potential medical benefits .
It really slows things down . "
While some salvia prohibitionists say they do n't want to interfere with scientific research , they do not recognize any legitimate nonmedical use for the plant .
They see teenagers getting wasted on YouTube , and they see medical applications that might one day be approved by the FDA , but nothing in between .
Siebert , who thinks thrill - seeking salvia smokers do not understand what the plant is all about , recently told the German magazine Hanfblatt , " Salvia is not an escapist drug .
Quite the contrary :
It is a philosopher 's tool . "
He says , " It produces a very internal state where you go into yourself .
You 're more aware of your subconscious feelings , and often you gain insight into problems in your life that you 're trying to tackle . "
Last year he told Newsweek , " I realized I wanted to marry my wife as a result of the salvia experience . "
In a 2003 Erowid survey of 500 salvia users who filled out an online questionnaire , 47 percent reported " increased insight , " while 40 percent said they felt an " increased sense of connection with the universe or nature . "
Other commonly reported effects were improved mood ( 45 percent ) , calmness ( 42 percent ) , weird thoughts ( 36 percent ) , a feeling of unreality ( 32 percent ) , and a feeling of floating ( 32 percent ) .
About 26 percent reported " persisting positive effects , " compared to 4 percent who reported " persisting negative effects " ( typically anxiety ) .
The sample was self - selected , so the responses are not necessarily representative , but they give a better sense than the YouTube videos do of why some people might find value in the salvia experience .
" It makes things that are bothering you become clear , " says Mazatec Garden 's Jeffrey Bottoms .
Some users report that salvia relieved their depression or helped them break bad habits .
A 2001 case report in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology described a 26 - year - old woman whose chronic depression disappeared after she started taking small doses of salvia three times a week .
Arena Ethnobotanicals CEO
John
Boyd says he tried to give up cigarettes many times over the years and finally quit the week after his first salvia experience .
Doblin notes that Canadian Quakers who have used salvia during meetings " felt that it deepened the silence and made people speak more from the heart . "
Although Siebert does not put much stock in spiritualism , he recognizes that other salvia users see their experiences in religious terms .
" It seems so real that people often interpret it at face value and think they have actually had some kind of spiritual journey , " he says .
" I do n't personally believe that 's what is really going on .
But that does n't mean it 's not meaningful for people . "
By contrast , Worcester County , Maryland , Commissioner Linda Busick is sure a salvia experience cannot possibly be meaningful , at least not in a good way .
" It 's supposed to be inducing spiritual growth , " Busick scoffed in a 2008 interview with the Salisbury Daily Times .
" It 's certainly detrimental to anyone who uses it .
I do n't know of any beneficial effects that it has . "
Van Ingram , the Kentucky drug control official , is on the same page .
" Anything that makes you see visions or things that are not there , " he told the Owensboro Messenger - Inquirer last year , " is hardly harmless . "
Anything ?
As Boire notes , " The visionary state goes back millennia , and it can not be prohibited .
Every night we enter into a visionary state .
Every book you read , everything that goes through your sensory apparatus , creates a type of vision . "
Doblin adds : " Seeing visions is the core of a lot of different religions , and whether that 's harmful or not depends on the context , the support , how people interpret the visions .
Seeing things that are not there is not necessarily harmful .
This whole idea that different is bad , that a change in consciousness is in itself harmful , is really one of the fundamental problems inherent in the drug war . "

During the peak ratings years of The Jerry Springer Show – an alleged reality show – a fight would break out among the guests during almost every episode .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerry_Springer_Show
It seemed obvious to me that these fights were orchestrated by the producers .
What are the odds that a fight would break out during every episode and yet no one would ever get hurt or arrested ?
The surprising thing is that everyone I talked to about the show during its glory years believed the fighting was genuine and spontaneous .
I found that level of gullibility to be mind boggling .
Likewise , when big name TV magicians perform spectacular tricks on TV , such as making a jet disappear , and the witnesses on the scene act amazed , it ’s obvious to me that those people are in on the trick , and / or their comments of amazement are taken out of context .
The magician ’s only obligation is to entertain the gullible viewers at home .
Paying actors to claim they do n’t know how the jet disappeared , and filming reactions out of context , is the easiest way to do it .
All of this gets me to Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck .
Both of them have been in the news a lot for their outspoken and controversial views .
And once again , people do n’t seem to understand that their jobs are entertainment , nothing more .
I enjoy sampling the content from the far left as well as the far right .
When I listen to Limbaugh , I generally have two reactions :
I do n’t agree with the viewpoint expressed .
This man is an entertainment genius .
Talk show hosts have no legal or ethical obligation to do anything but entertain .
And judging by their successes , Limbaugh and Beck are brilliant at their jobs .
I find it mind boggling that anyone believes a TV talk host is expressing his own true views .
You could make a case that the things Limbaugh and Beck say influences the gullible masses in ways that are not helpful to society .
But that ’s probably true of every pundit , left or right .
It ’s a price of free speech .
Do you think that Limbaugh and Beck have the same views in private as they spray into the entertainmentsphere ?
Did the Egyptians actually start the 1967 war , as Israel originally claimed ?
" The former Commander of the Air Force , General Ezer Weitzman , regarded as a hawk , stated that there was ' no threat of destruction ' but that the attack on Egypt , Jordan and Syria was nevertheless justified so that Israel could ' exist according the scale , spirit , and quality she now embodies .'... Menahem Begin had the following remarks to make : ' In June 1967 , we again had a choice .
The Egyptian Army concentrations in the Sinai approaches do not prove that Nasser was really about to attack us .
We must be honest with ourselves .
We decided to attack him . '

" I do not think Nasser wanted war .
The two divisions he sent to The Sinai would not have been sufficient to launch an offensive war .

Moshe Dayan posthumously speaks out on the Golan Heights
" Moshe Dayan , the celebrated commander who , as Defense Minister in 1967 , gave the order to conquer the Golan ...[ said ] many of the firefights with the Syrians were deliberately provoked by Israel , and the kibbutz residents who pressed the Government to take the Golan Heights did so less for security than for the farmland ... [ Dayan stated ]
' They did n't even try to hide their greed for the land ... We would send a tractor to plow some area where it was n't possible to do anything , in the demilitarized area , and knew in advance that the Syrians would start to shoot .
If they did n't shoot , we would tell the tractor to advance further , until in the end the Syrians would get annoyed and shoot .
And then we would use artillery and later the air force also , and that 's how it was ... The Syrians , on the fourth day of the war , were not a threat to us . ' "
The New York Times , May 11 , 1997
The history of Israeli expansionism
" The acceptance of partition does not commit us to renounce Transjordan ; one does not demand from anybody to give up his vision .
We shall accept a state in the boundaries fixed today .
But the boundaries of Zionist aspirations are the concern of the Jewish people and no external factor will be able to limit them . "
David Ben-Gurion , in 1936 , quoted in Noam Chomsky , " The Fateful Triangle . "
Expansionism - continued
" The main danger which Israel , as a ' Jewish state ' , poses to its own people , to other Jews and to its neighbors , is its ideologically motivated pursuit of territorial expansion and the inevitable series of wars resulting from this aim ... No zionist politician has ever repudiated Ben-Gurion 's idea that Israeli policies must be based ( within the limits of practical considerations ) on the restoration of Biblical borders as the borders of the Jewish state . "
Israeli professor , Israel Shahak , " Jewish History , Jewish Religion : The Weight of 3000 Years . "
Expansionism - continued
In Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharatt 's personal diaries , there is an excerpt from May of 1955 in which he quotes Moshe Dayan as follows : " [ Israel ] must see the sword as the main , if not the only , instrument with which to keep its morale high and to retain its moral tension .
Toward this end it may , no - it must - invent dangers , and to do this it must adopt the method of provocation - and - revenge ...
And above all - let us hope for a new war with the Arab countries , so that we may finally get rid of our troubles and acquire our space . "
Quoted in Livia Rokach , " Israel 's Sacred Terrorism . "
But was n't the occupation of Arab lands necessary to protect Israel 's security ?
" Senator [ J. William Fulbright ] proposed in 1970 that America should guarantee Israel 's security in a formal treaty , protecting her with armed forces if necessary .
In return , Israel would retire to the borders of 1967 .
The UN Security Council would guarantee this arrangement , and thereby bring the Soviet Union - then a supplier of arms and political aid to the Arabs - into compliance .
As Israeli troops were withdrawn from the Golan Heights , the Gaza Strip and the West Bank they would be replaced by a UN peacekeeping force .
Israel would agree to accept a certain number of Palestinians and the rest would be settled in a Palestinian state outside Israel .
" The plan drew favorable editorial support in the United States .
The proposal , however , was flatly rejected by Israel .
' The whole affair disgusted Fulbright , ' writes [ his biographer Randall ]
Woods .
' The Israelis were not even willing to act in their own self - interest . ' "
Allan Brownfield in " Issues of the American Council for Judaism . "

What happened after the 1967 war ended ?
" In violation of international law , Israel has confiscated over 52 percent of the land in the West Bank and 30 percent of the Gaza Strip for military use or for settlement by Jewish civilians ... From 1967 to 1982 , Israel 's military government demolished 1,338 Palestinian homes on the West Bank .
Over this period , more than 300,000 Palestinians were detained without trial for various periods by Israeli security forces . "
Intifada : The Palestinian Uprising Against Israeli Occupation , " ed. Lockman and Beinin .
World opinion on the legality of Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza .
" Under the UN Charter there can lawfully be no territorial gains from war , even by a state acting in self - defense .
The response of other states to Israel 's occupation shows a virtually unanimous opinion that even if Israel 's action was defensive , its retention of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was not ... The [ UN ] General Assembly characterized Israel 's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza as a denial of self determination and hence a ' serious and increasing threat to international peace and security . ' " John Quigley , " Palestine and Israel : A Challenge to Justice . "
Examples of the effects of Israeli occupation
" A study of students at Bethlehem University reported by the Coordinating Committee of International NGOs in Jerusalem showed that many families frequently go five days a week without running water ...
The study goes further to report that , ' water quotas restrict usage by Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza , while Israeli settlers have almost unlimited amounts . '
" A summer trip to a Jewish settlement on the edge of the Judean desert less than five miles from Bethlehem confirmed this water inequity for us .
While Bethlehemites were buying water from tank trucks at highly inflated rates , the lawns were green in the settlement .
Sprinklers were going at mid day in the hot August sunshine .
Sounds of children swimming in the outdoor pool added to the unreality . "
Betty Jane Bailey , in " The Link " , December 1996 .
Israeli occupation - continued
" You have to remember that 90 percent of children two years old or more have experienced - some many , many times - the [ Israeli ] army breaking into the home , beating relatives , destroying things .
Many were beaten themselves , had bones broken , were shot , tear gassed , or had these things happen to siblings and neighbors ... The emotional aspect of the child is affected by the [ lack of ] security .
He needs to feel safe .
We see the consequences later if he does not .
In our research , we have found that children who are exposed to trauma tend to be more extreme in their behaviors and , later , in their political beliefs . "
Dr Samir Quota , director of research for the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme , quoted in " The Journal of Palestine Studies , " Summer 1996 , p.84
Israeli occupation - continued
" There is nothing quite like the misery one feels listening to a 35 - year - old [ Palestinian ] man who worked fifteen years as an illegal day laborer in Israel in order to save up money to build a house for his family only to be shocked one day upon returning from work to find that the house and all that was in it had been flattened by an Israeli bulldozer .
When I asked why this was done - the land , after all , was his - I was told that a paper given to him the next day by an Israeli soldier stated that he had built the structure without a license .
Where else in the world are people required to have a license ( always denied them ) to build on their own property ?
Jews can build , but never Palestinians .
This is apartheid . "
Edward Said , in " The Nation " , May 4 , 1998 .
All Jewish settlements in territories occupied in the 1967 war are a direct violation of the Geneva Conventions , which Israel has signed .
" The Geneva Convention requires an occupying power to change the existing order as little as possible during its tenure .
One aspect of this obligation is that it must leave the territory to the people it finds there .
It may not bring its own people to populate the territory .
This prohibition is found in the convention 's Article 49 , which states , ' The occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies . ' "

Excerpts from the U.S. State Department 's reports during the Intifada
" Following are some excerpts from the U.S. State Department 's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices from 1988 to 1991 :
1988 : ' Many avoidable deaths and injuries ' were caused because Israeli soldiers frequently used gunfire in situations that did not present mortal danger to troops ... IDF troops used clubs to break limbs and beat Palestinians who were not directly involved in disturbances or resisting arrest ..
At least thirteen Palestinians have been reported to have died from beatings ...'
1989 : Human rights groups charged that the plainclothes security personnel acted as death squads who killed Palestinian activists without warning , after they had surrendered , or after they had been subdued ...
1991 : [ The report ] added that the human rights groups had published ' detailed credible reports of torture , abuse and mistreatment of Palestinian detainees in prisons and detention centers . "

Responsibility for drawing those lines fell to Central Command Chief Rehavan Ze'evi .
The line he drew ' took in not only the five square kilometers of Arab East Jerusalem - but also 65 square kilometers of surrounding open country and villages , most of which never had any municipal link to Jerusalem .

Hey folks ,
As some of you heard , yesterday I collapsed while carrying a computer uspstairs .
Lost complete consciousness and was transported to the nearest hospital where I was admitted for tests .
Diagonis was extreme exhaustion and dehydration .
I am home now with orders to stay either in bed or in my home as quietly as possible .
I am still very weak ... who knew ...?
I do have a problem though .
My copay for the stay is 300 dollars and I just do n't have it .
That 's not counting the ambulance ride , which is outrageous I hear .
I have never come to the community and asked for personal donations , but being a non profit I cannot stand for any delinquent payments or bills .
If you can see your way clear to give me a hand , I would sure consider it at 180 day loan .
Your help is greatly appreciated .

WASHINGTON  Given hardening Republican opposition to Congressional health care proposals , Democrats now say they see little chance of the minority ’s cooperation in approving any overhaul , and are increasingly focused on drawing support for a final plan from within their own ranks .
Top Democrats said Tuesday that their go - it - alone view was being shaped by what they saw as Republicans ’ purposely strident tone against health care legislation during this month ’s Congressional recess , as well as remarks by leading Republicans that current proposals were flawed beyond repair .
Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , said the heated opposition was evidence that Republicans had made a political calculation to draw a line against any health care changes , the latest in a string of major administration proposals that Republicans have opposed .
“ The Republican leadership , ” Mr. Emanuel said , “ has made a strategic decision that defeating President Obama ’s health care proposal is more important for their political goals than solving the health insurance problems that Americans face every day . ”

Legal news for Pennsylvania Personal Injury attorneys –Nuclear Regulatory Commission probes nuclear plant workers at Three Mile Island exposed to radioactive dust .
LondonderryTownship , PA( NewYorkInjuryNews.com ) – The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NCR ) www.ncr.gov investigates Exelon Nuclear Company ’s nuclear plant , Three Mile Island ( TMI ) , where at least 12 workers were exposed to radiation dust Saturday afternoon , November 21 , 2009 , according to WGAL .
Saturday afternoon , a few workers were cutting through one their stream generators pipes so that the generator could be removed through a large opening to be placed in the reactor building .
The company was replacing the old generators with two new 510 ton generators .
While the workers were cutting the pipes , radioactive dust was released .
The dust was discovered through a shutdown reactor , reported a TMI spokesman .
A reported 150 workers were in the building at the time of the leak .
At the time the radioactive dust entered the air ; fans turned on and blew it around inside the building .
Sources reported that there was not a threat to the public , and there was no emergency declared .
One worker was reportedly found to have been exposed to enough radiation as an X -ray .
NRC authorities and the Department of Environmental Protection ( EPA ) www.epa.gov continued to investigate to determine that the leak had stayed inside the building and had not entered into the public .

New UK nuclear stations unlikely to be on time

BBC Newsnight
A Newsnight investigation suggests that UK government plans to build a new generation of nuclear power stations to fill the energy gap by 2020 are wildly optimistic .
The British nuclear regulator has told Newsnight that he would not hesitate to halt construction if problems emerged and that no British nuclear power station had ever been built on time .
The first of the new generation of reactors in Britain will be at Hinkley Point in Somerset , and will be a replica of the new Evolutionary Power Reactor ( EPR ) reactor currently being built in Finland by the French company , Areva .
The Finnish EPR at Olkiluoto was supposed to be the first " third generation " reactor - safe , affordable , and designed for mass production .
The reactor is three years behind schedule and billions of pounds over budget after more than 3,000 mistakes were made by the builders .
The Finnish nuclear regulator has also halted construction on at least a dozen occasions due to safety concerns .
British regulator , Kevin Allars of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate ( NII ) , told Newsnight that he will be every bit as tough as his Finnish equivalent .
Energy promises Earlier this year , EDF announced that by 2017 Britons would be cooking their Christmas dinners with electricity generated by a new EPR nuclear power station at Hinkley Point , and that come 2020 four reactors would be operating in time to fill any energy gap .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
The Energy Secretary Ed Miliband this month issued a provisional go - ahead for ten new nuclear power stations , including Hinkley Point .
EDF and Areva have until June 2011 to produce a design which will satisfy the British regulators .
But Finland 's regulator , Petteri Tiippana says that the current design for the reactor at Olkiluoto is not safe because emergency circuits are not independent of normal control systems :
" If they are n't independent then the failure in the normal systems can cause a failure in the safety systems , " he said .
Areva have promised to submit an improved design to the British and Finnish authorities , after which planning permission to build at each of the British sites must be applied for which is likely to take at least another year - taking us to the middle of 2012 .
EDF will then have just five years to build the Hinkley Point reactor if we are to be able use its power to cook Christmas dinners in 2017 .
Precedents
The last reactor built in Britain , Sizewell B in Suffolk , was completed in 1995 and took some eight years to build .
Five years have passed since Areva began work on the Finnish reactor and it will take at least another three years to finish the job - eight years in total .
Ed Miliband wants new power stations in place by 2017 - 18 Newsnight asked the man in charge of regulating new nuclear stations here , Kevin Allars of the NII , if any nuclear power station had every been delivered on time in the UK .
" No , " was his response .
The Finnish regulator , Mr Tiippana , says it is difficult to deliver these projects on schedule because builders are not used to working to the exacting standards required on nuclear construction sites since so few new reactors have been built in recent years .
Mr Tiippana says that if construction workers do not have the right concrete to build the foundations they will use whatever is to hand , if it is awkward to put a radiation sensor where it should be they will be tempted to put it somewhere else , if it is easier to drill holes in the radiation containment vessel they will do it .
All these mistakes occurred in the construction of the Finnish reactor , just a few of the 3,000 errors detected so far .
Correcting them has caused months of delays .
" When they encounter a problem on site they usually follow their previous experience " says Mr Tiippana , " this is how we did it on a coal power plant and that just does n't work on a nuclear construction project " .
Areva was so confident about the EPR that they agreed to build the reactor in Finland with a fixed delivery date of May 2009 , and for a fixed price .
The earliest the reactor is now expected to come on line is 2012 and it is 3 bn euros ( £ 2.71 bn ) over budget .
Areva have threatened to abandon the reactor partially built unless they are given more cash .
Building nuclear power stations to order may not prove to be as easy as Ed Miliband might think .

CIA secret prisons organized from Germany
By Jan Peters
1 September 2009
A report in the New York Times on August 13 confirms that the CIA planned and organized secret prisons from the German city of Frankfurt / Main .
At least three secret prisons were administered by the CIA branch office in Frankfurt beginning in 2003 .
These illegal prisons belonged to the worldwide network of " black sites " to which the CIA transferred many of its prisoners in its " war against terror . "
There were at least eight such secret prisons maintained by the CIA outside the US .
The prisons run from Frankfurt included two that were located respectively in the Romanian capital of Bucharest and a remote part of Morocco .
A third is alleged to have been in the Polish town of Kiejkuty , near the Szymany airport .
A fourth prison was located in Lithuania .
The secret prisons were used to extort information from prisoners using methods of torture that would not have been possible in the US .
The director of the Frankfurt CIA branch office at that time , Kyle D. Foggo , told the Times that these measures were organized from Frankfurt because " it was too sensitive to be handled by headquarters . "
In September 2006 , then US president George W. Bush admitted the existence of secret prisons for the first time .
These torture prisons were used to systematically subject those deemed to be terrorist suspects to sleep deprivation , waterboarding and beatings in order to obtain information or extort confessions .
The CIA arrested " potential mass murderers " on the " battlegrounds of the world " and imprisoned them in secret locations where the suspects were subjected to " hard , necessary and effective methods of interrogation , " as Bush claimed .
The secret prisons had to be set up outside of the US , because they contravened existing US law .
The fact that the methods of torture employed by the CIA also violated international law was obviously a matter of indifference for the US government as well as for the German and European authorities .
Each of these prisons was designed to accommodate six prisoners and was constructed in identical fashion in order to confuse prisoners as to their exact location .
The prisons were completely isolated and designed in such a way as to prevent life threatening injuries during interrogations .
The floors were covered in skid - proof material , with plywood walls to cushion the impact when prisoners collided with the walls .
According to the New York Times , after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the " sleepy supply center " of the CIA in Frankfurt moved into action .
The budget of this branch office was awarded an extra seven million dollars by the Bush government .
At a later point this expanded budget was then trebled .
Frankfurt became the most important supply base of the US secret service in Europe .
In addition , the city developed into an important logistics base for US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , organizing supply flights for CIA deployments on virtually a daily basis .
Foggo , who was director of the Frankfurt CIA branch office , was well known for his organizational expertise .
He worked for the CIA for over 20 years before pleading guilty to corruption charges in 2008 and receiving a sentence of three years in prison .
Previously , in late 2004 , he was appointed third - highest official of the CIA , following his deployment in Frankfurt .
In the 1980s he was active in Honduras for the CIA .
At the time , the US was conducting a dirty proxy war against Nicaragua , which was organized by the CIA in Honduras on behalf of the American government under president Ronald Reagan .
The role of the German government
Neither the office of the German chancellor , nor the interior ministry , the foreign office or the German Federal Intelligence Service ( BND ) , have commented on the New York Times article .
This silence must be taken as an admission that the German government agencies were aware of what the CIA was doing .
When questioned by the media individual police officers have declared that they knew nothing about the activities of CIA agents in Germany .
This was the business of the Americans , they claimed .
" Even if we got wind of anything , " a high - ranking official told the Süddeutsche Zeitung , " nothing would have changed anyway . "
As long ago as November 2005 , the Washington Post and Human Rights Watch had uncovered the illegal prisons run by the CIA , and its criminal practice of kidnapping terror suspects .
After these first exposures the secretary - general of the Council of Europe opened a preliminary investigation .
It was led by former Swiss public prosecutor Dick Marty , president of the Commission for Human Rights of the Council of Europe .
As special prosecutor Marty carried out investigations into the secret CIA prisons from 2005 to 2007 .
In June 2006 Marty submitted an initial report .
It stated that it could not definitively prove the existence of the secret prisons , but presented substantial evidence to indicate the use of such facilities by the US secret services .
Marty continued his investigations and prepared a second report .
He discovered close cooperation between European secret services and the CIA , but met with a wall of silence and denial on the part of the European governments .
The second Marty report of 2007 criticized the German and the Italian governments in particular for systematically suppressing the truth about the prisons .
In Milan , leading political agencies closed down the investigation in the same year against 26 CIA agents who had openly kidnapped the Egyptian Imam Abu Omar in Italy in February 2003 and transported him to an Egyptian torture prison .
Marty recently told the Frankfurter Rundschau that it was difficult to uncover the whole truth about all of the alleged terrorist suspects kidnapped during this period .
In the main , European governments had " made little effort " to clarify what had taken place , he said .
Between 2005 and June 2009 a German parliamentary committee of inquiry investigated the methods used by the CIA and its collaboration with the BND .
The list of the topics to be examined was long .
It included , in addition to the secret prison system and secret CIA flights over Germany , the participation of BND agents in the Iraq war , the knowledge by German intelligence sources of CIA kidnappings of German terrorist suspects , and the monitoring of journalists by the BND .
In the event , the committee of inquiry served as a whitewash for the intelligence services and the German government .
In its final report of June 19 the committee concluded that the Social Democratic Party - Green government at that time had no knowledge of either the secret transportation of suspects or the existence of secret prisons .
The committee of inquiry expressed no interest in the fact that an inquiry set up by the European parliament had already uncovered some time before that between 2001 and 2005 CIA transport planes had landed on no less than 336 occasions at German airports .
It is completely unrealistic to expect that the government and its intelligence services had no knowledge of such flights .
The final report of the Bundestag committee served above all to cover the tracks of the current German foreign minister and SPD chancellor candidate , Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
During the period in office of the SPD - Green government ( 1998 - 2005 )
Steinmeier was head of the German chancellery and personally responsible for the secret services .
At the end of 2002 it was Steinmeier who prevented the Turkish citizen Murat Kurnaz , who lived in the German city of Bremen , from entering the federal republic .
Accused of being a terrorist , Kurnaz was detained in the US Guantánamo detention centre .
The US authorities had offered to free Kurnaz in 2002 due to lack of evidence .
Because of Steinmeier 's refusal to readmit Kurnaz to Germany , however , he was forced to remain a further four years in Guantánamo .
Steinmeier denied any responsibility for Kurnaz 's fate at the committee of inquiry .
He was also acquitted of any responsibility in the case of Khaled el - Masri .
El - Masri is a Lebanese citizen resident in Germany who was kidnapped in 2004 by the US secret service in Macedonia and transported to Afghanistan — allegedly without the knowledge of the German government .
The record shows clearly that no account of their real role will be forthcoming from the official authorities .
The extent of the complicity of the German government in the criminal activities and torture methods of the CIA will only be revealed by an independent inquiry and investigation conducted by and on behalf of the working class .

* New Jackson song previously covered by obscure singer
* Songwriter Paul Anka quickly given half the copyright
( recasts lead , story with new info , Anka and estate quotes )
LOS ANGELES , Oct 12 ( Reuters ) - Michael Jackson did n’t do it his way after all .
Hours after the pop singer ’s first posthumous single “ This Is It ” was released amid great hype on Monday , it emerged that the tune had been recorded 18 years ago by an obscure Puerto Rican singer .
Moreover the co-author of that tune , “ My Way ” songwriter Paul Anka , threatened to sue Jackson ’s estate for proper credit and his share of royalties .
The administrators of the estate quickly acknowledged Anka ’s claims and granted him 50 percent of the copyright , a potentially massive payday for the 68 - year - old Canadian crooner .
And an equally massive loss for the estate .
“ They realize it ’s a mistake , they realize it ’s my song , they realize it ’s my production of his vocal in my studio and I am getting 50 percent of the whole project , actually , which is fair , ” Anka said in a video posted on the TMZ gossip Web site .
The song dates back to 1983 , when it was known as “ I Never Heard ” -- a co-write between Jackson and Anka -- and intended for inclusion on an Anka album .
But the pair fell out , Jackson took the master tapes and Anka got them back .
The song was eventually released in 1991 after Anka placed it with an unknown Latin singer named Sa - Fire .
Both “ I Never Heard ” and “ This Is It ” share the same vocal and piano line , although the latter track boasts new overdubs from Jackson ’s brothers .
But “ This Is It ” had been promoted as a new Jackson recording , one of a multitude of unreleased recordings likely to come out in the next few years .
It was released online around the world nearly four months after the singer died in Los Angeles of a prescription drug overdose at the age of 50 .
Fans will be able to buy it when a two - disc album hits the shelves in two weeks to coincide with the Oct. 28 worldwide release of the Jackson rehearsal - footage movie “ This is It . ”
LYRICS FIT THE BILL
“ The song was picked because the lyrics were appropriate because of the name Michael gave his tour , ” said a spokesman for Jackson ’s estate .
“ We are thrilled to present this song in Michael ’s voice for the first time , and that Michael ’s fans have responded in unprecedented numbers .
The song was co-written by the legendary Paul Anka . ”
A spokeswoman for Sony Music declined to comment .
One of the estate ’s two administrators , John McClain , worked with Jackson at the Sony Corp unit .
The other executor is music attorney John Branca .
McClain , who is also a co-producer of the “ This is It ” album , had said in a statement earlier on Monday that the song “ only defines , once again , what the world already knows -- that Michael is one of God ’s greatest gifts . ”
Some critics begged to differ .
Jon Pareles , the chief pop critic of The New York Times , said in a blog it “ wo n’t be on anyone ’s list of best Michael Jackson songs , even if it ’s a long list ” and hoped there was something better in the Michael Jackson vaults of album outtakes .
The “ This Is It ” movie is based on rehearsal video shot in Los Angeles in the weeks before Jackson ’s planned 50 comeback concerts in London .
It was the subject of a $ 60 million deal between Jackson ’s estate and closely held concert promoter AEG Live and Sony ’s Sony Pictures unit .
Sales of Jackson ’s records spiked after his death and the release of the movie and album will add to the value of the “ Thriller ” singer ’s estate , estimated at around $ 400 million .
Sony Music said the first disc of the album will feature some of Jackson ’s greatest hits plus two versions of the “ new ” single .
The second disc will include unreleased versions of some of the singer ’s classic tracks and a spoken word poem entitled “ Planet Earth ” performed by Jackson and never heard before .

Afghanistan 's election commission proclaimed President Hamid Karzai the victor of the country 's tumultuous ballot today , cancelling a planned runoff and ending a political crisis that began with a fraud - marred first round two and a half months ago .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Obama administration — which has been waiting for a government deemed legitimate to emerge in Kabul before announcing whether to deploy tens of thousands more troops — quickly welcomed the result .
" We congratulate President Karzai on his victory in this historic election and look forward to working with him " to support reform and improve security , the US Embassy said in a statement .
Britain and the United Nations also issued statements of congratulations .
The cancellation of Saturday 's vote came one day after former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah announced he was pulling out less than a week before the 7 November vote .
Abdullah said the ballot would not have been fair and accused the Karzai - appointed Independent Election Commission of bias .
The annulment is a huge relief to organisers who were scrambling to hold the election before the onset of Afghanistan 's harsh winter , as well as authorities who feared a wave of bloody violence on polling day after a Taliban spokesman threatened attacks against anyone who took part .
Independent Election Commission chairman Azizullah Lodin announced Karzai the winner during a news conference in Kabul .
" His excellency Hamid Karzai , who has won the majority of votes in the first round and is the only candidate for the second round , is declared by the Independent Election Commission as the elected president of Afghanistan , " Lodin said .
Lodin said that the commission had the authority to make the decision because the Afghan constitution only allows for a runoff between two candidates .
There is a chance that the decision could be contested , but the international community appears to be lining up behind the ruling .
The US statement said the commission 's decision was " according to its mandate under Afghan law . "
Karzai has led Afghanistan since US forces invaded to oust the Taliban in 2001 .
He won elections in 2004 and his latest victory will give him another five - year mandate .
The US will have to find a way to work with the Afghan leader , who has fallen out of favor in Washington after openly criticizing US military tactics , including the heavy use of air power that has killed many civilians .
The mass ballot - box stuffing that characterized the Aug. 20 vote further sullied Karzai 's reputation .
Fraud investigators threw out nearly a third of Karzai 's votes , dropping him below the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright .

Worried that Karzai 's government would not be seen as legitimate , a bevy of international figures , including US Sen .
John Kerry , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , pressed Karzai to consent to a runoff .
But on Monday , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , who was in Kabul on a surprise visit , welcomed the decision to forego the runoff .
" This has been a difficult election process for Afghanistan , and lessons must be learned , " said Ban .
" Afghanistan now faces significant challenges and the new president must move swiftly to form a government that is able to command the support of both the Afghan people and the international community . "
Last week , insurgents in suicide vests stormed a guest house in the heart of Kabul filled with UN election workers , killing five UN staffers and three Afghans .
The attack raised questions about whether the world body might scale back its operations in the war - ravaged country .
But Ban promised Monday that the UN work would continue in Afghanistan despite the slayings .
He also said Karzai had assured him Afghan security forces would work to protect his staff .
Ban told reporters that " we can not be deterred , we must not be deterred .
...
The work of the United Nations will continue . "
The same day , however , the world body announced it would pull some expatriate staff out of Pakistan and suspend long - term development work in areas along the Afghan border because of violence .
The UN kept operating after an August 2003 truck bombing at its headquarters in Baghdad , which killed 22 people , including mission chief Sergio Vieira de Mello , but after a second bombing it shut down operations in Iraq in late October 2003 for years .
Meanwhile , Afghan authorities ordered all schools and universities closed for three weeks amid swine flu fears that were heightened Wednesday after the country registered its first death from the virus .
The Health Ministry said large gatherings at public baths and wedding halls will be forbidden for the same period .
Many pedestrians and drivers making their way to work in the capital were wearing medical masks , which were being sold in markets and by street children .
Elsewhere , Nato - led forces said one Afghan girl was accidentally killed during an operation against militants in the southern province of Kandahar on Sunday .
A joint Afghan - international force fired on two motorcycles carrying militants south of the city , killing a girl who was on one of the motorbikes , Nato said in a statement .
From Oct. 9 to 12 , 14 stores in Manhattan and Brooklyn will sponsor an event called the Yarn Crawl to promote yarn - related crafts .
The self - guided tour of yarn retailers will include demonstrations , exhibitions and sales , as well as a scavenger hunt and raffle .
Participating stores include Habu Textiles , 135 West 29th Street , and Knitty City , 208 West 79th Street , in Manhattan , and Brooklyn General Store , 128 Union Street , and Stitch Therapy , 176 Lincoln Place , in Brooklyn .

LOS ANGELES --
It has become fashionable on both the left and the right to compare the United States to ancient Rome .
Decline and fall :
We are a militaristic power trying to make everyone else in the known world submit to our way , or we are an irreligious , hedonistic bunch going the way of all flesh .
Or maybe both .
Not true , according to two interesting recent books .
Thomas F. Madden , a professor of ancient history at St. Louis University , begins his book , " Empires of Trust , " by denouncing " political screeds that yank bloody bits of Roman history out of context in order to make hackneyed partisan points . "
Then he adds : " The Rome that fell , it should be remembered , was over two thousand years old .
We should be so lucky .
No , the young United States has nothing at all in common with the aged imperial Rome , but it has important things in common with the youthful Roman Republic . "
Rome actually fell three times , argues Madden .
In 27 B.C. , the Roman Republic , the regime he compares with the United States , evolved into the one - man rule of an emperor in Italy and beyond .
That Roman Empire was overrun by barbarians in A.D. 476 .
But the eastern empire with its capital in Constantinople , continued to thrive into the Middle Ages , finally falling to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 .
It is that Eastern Roman Empire , also called Byzantium , that is the focus of " The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire , " by the often controversial national security intellectual Edward Luttwak .
While Madden sees the Roman Republic and the United States as empires of trust -- nations with allies , some once conquered , who trust them as military and economic powers -- Luttwak advocates that the " American Empire " would do well to emulate the strategies of Byzantium .
" Economic crisis , mounting national debt , excessive foreign commitments , " says Luttwak , speaking of the middle period of Roman emperors , " this is no way to run an empire .
America ... has never been Rome , and to adopt its strategies now -- in ruthless expansion of empire by domination of foreign peoples , and a bone - crushing brand of total war -- would only hasten America 's decline . "
Luttwak , who says he has studied Byzantine documents and other writings for two decades , advises Americans to learn seven lessons from Byzantium .
They are :
" 1. Avoid war by every possible means ... but always act as if war might start at anytime .
...
Train intensively and be ready for battle at all times .
" 2 . Gather intelligence on the enemy and his mentality , and monitor his actions continuously .
" 3. Campaign vigorously , both offensively and defensively , but avoid battles , especially large - scale battles .
" 4 . Replace the battle of attrition and occupation of countries with maneuver warfare -- lightning strikes and offensive raids to disrupt enemies .
" 5 . Strive to end wars successfully by recruiting allies to change the balance of power .
Diplomacy is even more important during war than peace .
" 6 . Subversion is the cheapest path to victory .
So cheap , in fact , as compared with the risks and costs of battle that it must always be attempted .
...
Remember : Even religious fanatics can be bribed .
" 7 . When diplomacy and subversion are not enough and fighting is unavoidable , use methods and tactics that exploit enemy weaknesses , avoid consuming combat forces , and patiently whittle down the enemy 's strength . "
As for Madden , he concludes with a rush of optimism :
" America is a young country and an even younger empire .
...
Americans remain optimistic about the future and confident in their abilities .
They have reason to be .
... Americans have almost secured their horizon .
That is what an Empire of Trust is driven to do .
We may not be able to see the end of America 's road , but its direction seems clear enough .
And , for both Americans and the world , it is a good road to follow . "
Thanks , we needed that .
There is some confusion and contradiction in what Madden and Luttwak have to say , but clearly they believe the sky is not falling yet .
Thoughts and reflections like theirs might even cause a president to take his time in making decisions about trying to exercise great and lethal power beyond the horizon .
President Barack Obama speaks at a fundraiser .
Reid leaning toward public option
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is leaning toward putting a public insurance option in the Senate health reform bill — a signal that Reid increasingly believes he can get the votes needed for a plan that would allow states to opt out of the program , senators said Thursday .
But President Barack Obama stopped short of endorsing the approach during a hastily called meeting Thursday with the Senate Democratic leadership at the White House , according to an administration official .

Instead , one Democratic source said Obama appeared to prefer a “ trigger ” option put forth by Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , who has proposed allowing states to join a national insurance plan if affordable coverage was not widely available .
This would suggest the president has not abandoned his goal of striking a bipartisan deal .
Reid ’s newfound confidence in passing a Senate bill with a public option — the top priority of his party ’s liberal base — has grown recently after months when the idea seemed all but dead .
That ’s because in recent weeks , some Democratic moderates have signaled an openness to variations on the public option .
Reid has told fellow Democrats that he ’s leaning toward a version that would create a national health insurance program but give individual states the chance to decline participation , or “ opt out . ”
Senate leaders are signaling confidence that they can muster all 60 Democrats to support bringing a bill to the floor because the party recognizes its political fate rests in large part on delivering health care reform , and it would be difficult for senators — even if they disagree with aspects of the bill — to stop the debate before it started , several senators said .
But these senators and others also cautioned that the discussions were evolving , the final proposal has yet to be determined and any determination of a vote count is premature .
A handful of key moderates voiced concern about the inclusion of the public option in the merged bill .
Snowe ( R - Maine ) , one of the last hopes of giving the bill a blush of bipartisanship , said it would be “ difficult ” for her to support bringing a bill with a government insurance plan to the Senate floor .
Reid ’s decision will determine which side gets the strategic advantage .
If a public plan is included in the Senate bill at the outset , opponents would have to muster 60 votes to remove it from the bill , which would be almost impossible to do .
Reid ( D - Nev. ) and other Senate leaders huddled with Obama at the White House late Thursday , but left without speaking to reporters .
Reid was joined in the Oval Office meeting by Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois , Chuck Schumer of New York and Patty Murray of Washington .
The leaders presented the national insurance plan with a state opt - out " as one way to get 60 and pledged to keep working on it as one compromise , " the administration official said , adding that Obama did not state a preference .
But the Democratic source recounted the meeting differently saying Obama expressed a preference for the Snowe trigger .
If Reid included a public option in the Senate bill , it would signal a remarkable shift from where Democrats and Republicans thought the debate was headed after the tumultuous August recess .
And combined with efforts in the House , where Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) is closing in on the votes for the most liberal version of the public option , it appeared more likely than ever this week that the full Congress will be given the chance to offer Americans a health insurance option run by the government as a competitor to private insurance companies .
Pelosi ’s lieutenants have been polling House Democrats on whether they support the most robust public option — and say they are closing in on the 218 votes needed to pass a public option .
“ Getting from 200 to 218 can sometimes take a little time , ” Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen said as he emerged from a leadership meeting in Pelosi ’s office Thursday evening .
Also , a group of 36 moderate House Democrats have written to Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland , saying they would vote down a House bill that “ does nothing to rein in the cost of health care and therefore may not be sustainable outside the 10 - year budget window . ”
In the Senate , there are still some who question whether Reid can get the public option through .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) briefed centrist Democrats on the bill Thursday morning .
But Baucus , who has said repeatedly that a public option could not pass the Senate , did not entirely embrace the emerging public option proposal when asked about it .
“ Whatever it takes to get national health care passed , I am for , ” Baucus told reporters .
“ The most robust bill that gets 60 votes — that is what I am for . ”
It was long believed that a public insurance option could not receive 60 votes in the Senate because a bloc of moderate members would not go for it .
They opposed creating a robust government plan that would tie reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals to Medicare , saying private insurers could not compete .
But during the past month , the energy has shifted .
More variations of the public option were put on the table , providing leeway for the Senate Democratic leadership to find a compromise that would please both moderates and liberals .
The insurance industry angered Democrats in the past two weeks with what they viewed as an attempt to scuttle health care reform by releasing critical studies of the Senate bills .
And more public polls were released showing the public option remains popular with voters .
A person familiar with the Senate talks said the negotiations are becoming a race of sorts between the two competing camps to lock in moderates .
The exact proposal remains far from decided , aides said .
Sen . Tom Carper ( D - Del. ) said senators are still considering a range of questions — any of which could tip the vote count significantly .
Liberals want a national plan on Day One , but some moderates would prefer that it would go into effect only if certain measures on affordability and competition were met .
It appears likely that states would be given the chance to drop out of a government plan , but some senators , such as Carper and Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) , want states to then have the option to create their own competitor to private insurers .
Carper said he could support some version of a national plan with options left up to the states .
But the public option would have to play on a level field with private insurers , he said .
“ We ’ve got to make sure this is not the government running this thing , ” Carper said , adding that he envisions a nonprofit board operating it .
And in the Senate , Democratic moderates were huddling to determine the best course to take .
Snowe and Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) met with Baucus and Reid several times this week .
“ I keep hearing there is a lot of leaning toward some sort of national public option , unfortunately , from my standpoint , ” said Nelson , a key swing vote on health reform .
“ I still believe a state - based approach is the way in which to go .
So I ’m not being shy about making that point . ”
Nelson said he prefers allowing states to decide individually whether to create a public option or some other sort of competitor to private insurance .
“ A state public option I can support , ” said Nelson , although he added that he has n’t made any threats to oppose the bill based on the public option .
Reid and White House officials are working to merge two competing Senate bills for floor action in early November .
The pace of the negotiations is picking up .
Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , who is representing the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , said the merger group hopes to send a package to the Congressional Budget Office soon .
“ We have to make a decision fairly quickly , ” Dodd said .
To reassure potential investors , Ambergene 's board of directors decided to confirm Cano 's claims of reanimation .
He was n't the first to attempt to bring tiny beings back to life in this manner .
But every previous reported success turned out to be a case of modern bacteria contaminating the amber during the extraction process .
Creating a life - saving drug was appealing .
Fabulous riches would be a nice side effect .
" Altruism 's great , but it's not that great , " Cano says .
He possessed the only known samples of these strains , and he patented his revivification process to further cement his control over them .
As the cofounder , part - owner , and chief scientific officer of Ambergene , Cano stood to earn a hefty chunk of any windfall that might result .
Over the course of the next year , Cano would crack open several more pieces of amber and bring hundreds of strains of ancient bacteria back to life in his lab .
In the process , he began to think there might be a practical use for these creatures .
He launched a company , Ambergene , to explore potential biomedical applications .
The premise for the venture was that ancient organisms might have antibiotic potential — they 'd been out of the ecosystem for so long that nothing today would have a resistance to them .
At the time , the approach — dubbed natural product discovery — was very much in vogue .
Major players like Merck and Eli Lilly were making serious investments .
Cano 's discovery changed science 's understanding of just how extraordinarily resilient microorganisms are .
" They 're the quintessential survivors , " he says .
" They started when the planet was born , they 're going to stay around until the planet is dead , and then they 'll just go somewhere else . "
After publishing the results of his experiment in Science , Cano found himself the center of national attention from scientists and eventually the media .
This was the closest humanity had come to the discovery imagined in Jurassic Park .
Cano wanted to find out .
He took the contents of the ancient bee 's stomach , suspended it in saline , and spread it on a growth medium .
Amazingly , something woke up and began propagating in the petri dish .
Cano identified it as a bacterial spore related to the modern Bacillus sphaericus , which is used to kill mosquito larvae .
Two years later , however , Cano actually did manage to pull off an astonishing first — he brought back to life something that had been trapped in amber for more than 25 million years .
It started with a chunk of fossilized resin from the Dominican Republic .
Trapped inside was an extinct breed of stingless bee .
It was dead , of course , but Cano theorized that microorganisms in the resin might simply be dormant .
After all , he reasoned , some single - celled creatures are known to enter a hibernation - like state and survive for years with no air or food .
Still , few believed that anything could survive after lying dormant for so long .
In 1993 , Cano worked with Poinar and others to remove DNA from a 125 million - year - old Lebanese weevil entombed in amber .
They were able to sequence segments of the bug 's genome .
But even if they had the full genome , science could n't — and still can 't — clone it back into existence .
( Just as well — it 's hard to imagine Steven Spielberg creating a blockbuster f/x extravaganza about reanimated weevils .
Unless he made them 30 feet tall .
With a taste for human blood . )
More than a century later , amber became sexy again with the advent of gene sequencing and cloning .
A 1982 paper by entomologist George Poinar explored the potential for extracting DNA from preserved creatures .
The paper caused a stir in the scientific community and inspired Michael Crichton to write his best - selling dinosaur - cloning novel , Jurassic Park , which came out in 1990 .
Scientists have been cracking open the translucent caramel - colored rock for nearly two centuries in an attempt to unlock the history of the earth .
All manner of flora and fauna got trapped in the dribbling sap , and once it solidified and fossilized , the contents were preserved for aeons .
" It 's a time capsule , " Cano says .
" Like a Kodak moment from when the amber was formed . "
The first study of the contents of amber , made public in 1856 , yielded 163 species of ancient plant life .
In 1974 , Cano went to work at Cal Poly , starting out as a fungus specialist .
But by the early '90s , he was making a name for himself by examining the contents of fossilized prehistoric tree resin— more commonly known as amber .
His scientific aptitude was not immediately apparent .
" I was n't a remarkably good student , " Cano says .
" I went to community college . "
He eventually transferred to Eastern Washington University , and there he discovered his calling in a microbiology class .
" It was taught by a fungal geneticist , " he says .
" He was terrific .
He became my mentor . "
Cano got his master 's and went on to earn a PhD in microbiology at the University of Montana .
Born and raised in pre-Castro Havana , Cano still has a noticeable Cuban accent .
After the revolution , his parents were unable to escape the country , but they managed to secure him a visa and a plane ticket to Miami in early 1962 .
His parents would eventually follow him to the US , but for a few years Cano was on his own in a strange new country .
" I was 16 at the time , " he says .
" I went from foster home to foster home . "
This reanimation of an ancient life form was a breakthrough , a discovery so shocking that the scientific community initially refused to believe it .
It changed our understanding of what microorganisms are capable of .
It also gave the Cal Poly researcher a brief taste of fame .
For a while , he thought it might make him rich .
It did n't .
Now , just when it seemed his babies would be forgotten , Cano has found a way to share them with the world .
The dish contains a variant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , known in culinary circles as baker 's or brewer 's yeast .
But Cano did n't get this from Whole Foods .
Back in 1995 , he extracted it from a 45 million - year - old fossil .
The microorganisms had lain dormant since the Eocene epoch , a time when Australia split off from Antarctica and modern mammals first appeared .
Then Cano brought the yeast back to life .

An aroma like bread dough permeates Raul Cano 's lab .
He has just removed the cover from a petri dish , and the odor wafts up from several gooey yellow clumps of microorganisms that have been feeding and reproducing in a dark cabinet for the past few days .
Cano , a 63 - year - old microbiologist at California Polytechnic State University , San Luis Obispo , inspects the smelly little mounds lovingly .
" These are my babies , " he says , beaming .
" My yeasty beasties . "
How to Reanimate Prehistoric Microorganisms Raul Cano proved that single - celled creatures like yeast and bacteria can be revived after lying dormant in amber — fossilized tree resin — for tens of millions of years .
Here 's how it 's done .
STEP 1 Procure Amber is found all over the world and can be bought from brokers ( or even on eBay ) .
Prices can reach into the thousands of dollars , depending on size and biological matter trapped inside .
( Chunks with insects are most likely to yield microorganisms . )
STEP 2 Sterilize
To avoid contamination by modern microbes , sterilize the lab environment and clean the amber thoroughly by soaking it in disinfectants , giving it an ultrasonic wash , then dousing it in ethanol and lighting it on fire .
STEP 3 Shatter
To open the amber , place the sample in liquid nitrogen , where it will freeze and become brittle .
At this point , the specimen can be shattered by dousing it with sterilized warm saline .
It can also be smashed , ground up , or drilled .
STEP 4 Grow Spread the contents of the amber onto a petri dish containing a microorganism food like starch or soy .
Not every piece of amber harbors dormant microorganisms — if the petri dish yields nothing , go back to step 1 and try again .

" I was very skeptical , " says Chip Lambert , a microbiologist tapped by Ambergene to try to duplicate Cano 's results .
The company provided him with amber and all of Cano 's sterilization and extraction protocols .
Lambert doubled all of the cleaning processes and added some of his own .
He was still able to duplicate Cano 's discovery .
Cano did n't mind the company checking his work if it helped Ambergene win financing .
He ended up being impressed with Lambert 's efforts .
" We became friends , " Cano says .
" I enjoy his company .
Besides working with him on some of his projects , we 'd socialize , get dinner , maybe grab a beer . "
( Another team of researchers working with Cano has also been able to duplicate the results . )
In April 1995 , during his amber - cracking spree , Cano made another important discovery .
A piece of fossilized resin from Burma yielded something that looked very similar to Saccharomyces , brewer 's or baker 's yeast .
This single - celled fungus feeds on sugars and reproduces frequently — if it has enough to eat , a culture can double in population in 90 minutes .
" Yeasts are found in all kinds of vegetable matter — plants , fruits , stuff like that , " Cano says .
" It was fortunate for that yeast to be there at the time so it could become part of history . "
Cano was fascinated by his find .
Unfortunately , this ancient strain of yeast did n't have commercial applications that Ambergene could exploit .
And none of Cano's other discoveries were yielding biomedical breakthroughs , either .
" We did find two or three microorganisms that produced some new chemical compounds , " Cano says .
" But they were never pursued , because the company was broke .
I was really disappointed . "
Ambergene folded in 1997 .
Cano went back to his lab and pursued other research , like testing petroleum - degrading bacteria in sand dunes .
That project scored enormous grants for Cal Poly , as did many of Cano 's other research efforts .
But he could n't forget his brush with fame and fortune .
" It was a scientific wild ride , like an E ticket at Disneyland , " he says .
" As you grow older , the thrill of the hunt becomes more and more acute , at least for me . "
Meanwhile , his ancient yeast — suspended in glycerol and nutrients — lay dormant in a deep freeze .
In March 2006 , chip Lambert happened to meet a guy named Peter Hackett at a ski resort in Lake Tahoe , California .
Hackett is a Northern California pub owner and brewer .
Before long , the conversation turned to ancient yeast .
" It started as a very casual , noncommittal , you - must - be - out - of - your - mind conversation , " Hackett recalls .
" He told me the story of how Cano revived the yeast , how it resembled brewer 's yeast .
And then he said , ' Would n't it be interesting if we could make beer with it ? ' "
Lambert and Cano had toyed with the idea for 12 years .
Before Ambergene went under , the company made a batch on a lark .
" We called it Jurassic Amber Ale or T - Rex Lager or something , and it was pretty good , " Cano says .
It was served at his daughter 's wedding , and they even sent some to the Jurassic Park 2 cast party .
That experiment had Cano and Lambert itching to release a beverage commercially .
But they wanted it to be something respectable .
" Brewing beer is a biotechnological process , " Cano says .
" I know the essentials ; I 've taught it in classes .
But the skills you need to actually make a quality beer ?
I had no clue . "
They needed a professional brewer to take their yeast for a serious test drive .
But unable to interest one , they had put the idea on ice .
Hackett , 44 , was a cocky upstart in the microbrew world , known for unique recipes like Bushwacker Wheat ( made with tangerines , blackberries , and sun-dried mandarins ) .
He had n't really wanted to spend a cold , miserable afternoon discussing yeast from the Eocene .
" But Chip is a very persistent man , " Hackett says .
" It was the only way I could get him to leave me alone . "
After some cajoling , the brewer agreed to try making a batch of beer with Cano 's yeast .
But Hackett had his doubts about the 45 million - year - old Saccharomyces .
Beer is the result of a chemical process that takes place when yeast gobbles up sugars and excretes carbon dioxide and alcohol .
The flavor depends heavily on the type of Saccharomyces doing the eating , and very few strains perform well in the hostile anaerobic conditions inside a brewing tank .
" It requires a robust cell , " Hackett says .
" My boss is a single - celled organism .
If it 's not happy , it will let me know . "
Hackett combined the yeast with all the other ingredients that make up his popular Rat Bastard pale ale recipe , so he could easily taste its distinguishing characteristics .
During the brewing , the ancient yeast 's behavior was unusual , to say the least .
" It ferments violently at the start , " Hackett says , " then it falls out of suspension and the beer becomes almost clear . "
From a brewer 's perspective , its behavior was schizophrenic :
It began like a yeast used in ales , floating at the top .
Then it began to act like yeast used in slow - fermenting lagers , settling to the bottom of the tank but not going dormant .
Normally , Hackett ends the primary fermentation process by " crashing the tank " — lowering the temperature to shock the yeast into dormancy .
But that did n't work on Cano 's yeast .
" It was just sitting on the bottom and nibbling on the sugar like a couch potato , " Hackett says .
A strain that had survived 45 million years in suspended animation was not about to go quietly .
Hackett was prepared to pour the batch down the drain if it tasted awful .
But he discovered that the flavor of the resulting ale was unique , and not in a bad way .
It was light and crisp with a citrusy , gingery tang .
It was definitely worth exploring further .
The brewer began experimenting with the ancient strain .
He indulged its idiosyncratic behavior , letting it ferment for an extra month in a cold storage tank .
He modified the hops , a plant that adds a characteristic bitterness to beer , to complement the flavor imparted by the yeast .
Cano's Saccharomyces coupled with Hackett 's know - how to yield a very tasty libation , which is now made and distributed under the name Fossil Fuels Brewing Company .
" We won the lottery , " Hackett says .
" It 's such a random thing .
A yeast cell , captured in amber , found by a mad scientist .
For it to perform well , for it to perform uniquely … I would n't have bet on it . "
Fossil Fuels pale ale caused a stir among beer aficionados like William Brand , a former critic with The Oakland Tribune who raved about it on his blog .
He noted its " light copper color and an intense clove aroma . "
He liked its sweetness and the " intriguing , very odd spicy note " in the finish .
Celebrator Beer News described the ale as having a " complex and well - developed taste profile " with " fruity flavor characteristics and just a touch of lemony sweetness .
The fact that it is made with such old yeast is fascinating , and given how good the beer is , no mere novelty . "
A 5 - gallon glass jug containing hundreds of millions of Cano 's yeast cells is sitting on the back porch of Hackett 's brewpub in Guerneville , California , 70 miles north of San Francisco .
Every half - hour or so , Hackett goes outside and shakes it up a bit .
When the sun warms the contents of the jug to 70 degrees Fahrenheit , it 'll be ready .
Hackett has been stirring malted barley into 150 - degree water in an enormous stainless steel tub .
The hot water will break down the starch in the grain , turning it into a sugary substance called wort , which is then diluted , boiled , and transferred to a fermentation tank .
When the jar of yeast has warmed up sufficiently , Hackett dumps it into the tank , where it begins to gobble up the wort .
Normally , Hackett could reuse this yeast after separating it from the freshly brewed batch of beer .
New characteristics may begin to present themselves as the tiny fungi go through tens of thousands of generations .
" Over time , genetic drift can occur , " Hackett says .
" It mutates and evolves . "
But for Fossil Fuels ' brew , Cano prefers to create new colonies that are as close as possible to the original generation he reawakened from the chunk of amber .
His yeasty beasties may not have made him a pharmaceutical millionaire , but he has finally discovered a use for them , and he wants to stay involved in the brewing process .
As Hackett finishes preparing his latest batch , Cano arrives .
He has driven up from San Luis Obispo to get a pony keg of pale ale for his own personal use .
And Lambert has come up from the East Bay .
The scientists sit on stools as Hackett brings out pints of their beer , as well as fries , shrimp , and egg rolls hot from the brewpub 's kitchen .
They 're soon ready for a second round of beer .
Fossil Fuels
Brewing will start selling its beer in pubs and restaurants throughout California this fall .
The company is creating beer - tap handles with hunks of amber embedded in the tip .
A bigger brewery — one capable of bottling the beer when they 're ready to put it on store shelves — has been enlisted to take on the commercial production duties .
Cano is delighted with the burgeoning success of Fossil Fuels ale .
It 'll earn him a little bit of money , and every pint or bottle sold could kick off a conversation about his momentous discovery 14 years ago .
His only worry is that the unfiltered nature of this beer means that some of his yeast will invariably settle to the bottom of the glass or bottle , and an unscrupulous brewer could collect that and use it in another beer .
The microbiologist has applied for a patent on his strains and has sequenced the genomes so he can tell if someone else has stolen it .
" I am the keeper of the family jewels , " Cano says .
He is n't about to let them fall into the wrong hands .

There is trouble in toyland : scores of classic children 's book and TV characters are being dusted down and re-rendered in shiny CGI or state - of - the - art , stop- motion animation .
But at least one will have nothing to do with such radical reimagining .
Step forward Bagpuss .
The pink stripy cat , his friend , the animated bookend Professor Yaffle , and a small army of carved mice are loved by millions of children the world over , despite only 13 episodes being made .
His creator Oliver Postgate – who died last year – along with the animator Peter Firmin , created what is now a multimillion - pound franchise .
The children 's television producer Coolabi has bought the rights to produce Bagpuss for television , but Mr Postgate 's son , Daniel , has scotched plans to bring the series back .
Talking from his home in Kent this weekend , Daniel Postgate , a children 's author and illustrator , said he had n't liked the new proposals at all .

" There 's something about CGI on a television level , where they can't spend so much money on it , which means it can feel lightweight and that it can lack presence , " he said .
A spate of children 's remakes has hit the silver and small screens in recent years : the latest , Where the Wild Things Are , has taken nearly $ 40 m ( £ 24 m ) in its first week , and Fantastic Mr Fox , which opened this weekend in the UK , looks likely to emulate its success after receiving rave critical reviews .
Remakes of children 's classics are not a new phenomenon .
Dozens of children 's entertainments going back to the 1950s have been retooled : even the Flowerpot Men , Bill and Ben , were brought into Technicolor nine years ago , and The Magic Roundabout was given the CGI treatment in 2005 .
Studios executives like CGI because it is relatively cheap and remaking a film or TV series is much less of a gamble than persuading audiences to buy a whole new concept .
The director and producer JJ Abrams , whose past successes include Lost and the successful reboot of Star Trek , admitted recently that it was impossible to build the sort of cityscapes that appear – and are frequently destroyed – in his films because the cost would be too high .
But not everyone is happy with the heavy use of CGI in blockbuster films .
The Batman director Christopher Nolan said modern blockbusters are " more and more like animation films or videogames " , and has adapted to using mostly props and models of sets in his own films .
Mr Postgate also complained that a poor remake of Bagpuss could also damage the existing series .
" One has to take a very careful look at exposing it on the TV again , as it could easily have a detrimental effect to the property , " he said .
" In the case of my father 's stuff , a lot of the quality of the feel of the puppets he made really worked very well because they were puppets .

" I had looked into the possibility of a new Bagpuss , " he added , " but I was n't particularly knocked out by what was proposed .
It seemed if Bagpuss was going to be redone I would n't want it to be done as a series that 's just dropped into CBeebies or something similar .
I do n't think it would be useful for Bagpuss to be remade . "

Blaming the girl , not the vaccine
The vaccines must continue
( NaturalNews ) Natalie Morton is dead .
One week ago , she was an energetic and lively 14 - year - old student who was just following doctor 's orders .
Like all her other classmates , she believed she was dutifully protecting her health by submitting to a cervical cancer vaccine jab .
But a few minutes after receiving her vaccine shot , things began to go wrong .
As one of her classmates said in a report published in the Not surprisingly , some of Natalie 's classmates are now concerned about the safety of the vaccine : Did you catch that ?
Even after killing one of their classmates , medical doctors are still lying to these girls , telling them that if they do n't continue with all three vaccines , they will have more side effects .
This , of course , is an outright lie .
But it 's par for the course when it comes to vaccines .
Natalie 's mother now deeply regrets exposing her child to the vaccine that caused her death .
" It 's all very , very worrying , " she said .
" We feel like our children are being treated like guinea pigs .
I was n't keen on my daughter having it in the first place but the school seemed insistent . "
( Source : Daily Mail , link below . )
Today , the mainstream media is reporting an obviously - fabricated explanation for her death .
A pathologist is declaring that Natalie died from a " malignant chest tumor " that just coincidentally and suddenly killed her within hours after she received the cervical cancer vaccine .
This explanation is obviously a cover story to protect the vaccine industry ; and it's not even a convincing cover story at that .
Natalie Morton had never been diagnosed with a chest tumor before , and she showed absolutely no symptoms of a cancer tumor .
Chest tumors do n't just " lash out " and attack their hosts all of a sudden , without warning .
A typical death from a cancer tumor is more often a slow , painful wasting away that can take months or years .
Natalie Morton was killed in hours , and the description of her symptoms exactly matches what might be expected from an inflammatory reaction to a chemical vaccine
But why would a pathologist cover up the true cause of Natalie Morton 's death ?
It 's simple : .
Natalie 's death threatened to put the entire first - world cervical vaccination program on hold .
" News of Morton 's death came shortly before U.S. health regulators again delayed a decision on whether to allow Glaxo to sell Cervarix in the United States where a panel of specialists has recommended its use , " reports Reuters .
The continuation of global cervical cancer vaccination programs -- which generate billions in profits -- absolutely required blaming Natalie 's death on something other than the vaccine .
Blaming it on cancer is very easy to do , since .
All the pathologist had to do was locate such a micro-tumor in Natalie 's body , then dismiss the vaccine altogether .
A GlaxoSmithKline spokesperson said , " GSK 's deepest sympathies lie with the parents at this very sad time . "
Is this a Freudian slip ?
Covering up this death will , indeed , require promoting a " lie with the parents " such as the lie about the true cause of Natalie 's death , in my opinion .
I can only imagine what 's potentially going through the minds of GSK executives today who nearly saw billions of dollars in revenues put on hold because of one teenage girl 's death .
" Thank God that girl had cancer ! " they might be thinking ...
" Our vaccine profits will continue !
" Of course , by the vaccine pushers who will stop at nothing to generate more profits pumping young teens full of medically unjustified ( and outrageously dangerous ) vaccines .
These vaccines are killing teenage girls all over the world , and yet in every single case , doctors dismiss any causal links between the vaccine and the sudden death of the teen girl receiving it .
A spokesperson for the Department of Health is even on the record saying " The HPV vaccination programme can continue as planned - there is no reason for the campaign to be suspended or interrupted .
"
Not even the fact that the vaccine might be killing young girls ?
It takes a real cold - hearted CEO to watch your product potentially kill a 14 - year - old girl in mere hours and then continue to recommend that same product to millions more .
This astonishing dismissal of concern about the vaccine 's safety is indicative of the kind of quackery taking place today with vaccines and modern medicine .
Notice howis replaced with •
Any evidence of harm ( like a girl dying after the vaccine ) is automaticallyfor no reason .
The vaccine quacks simply announce , " There is no evidence of any link ... " or come up with another reason ( blaming a cancer tumor ) . •
The idea of support the human body 's own immune system remains widely ridiculed in pro-vaccine circles .
In their minds , the human body has virtually no role in its own health unless it is activated through chemical intervention !•
The push for more vaccines continues based onbenefits that are fabricated through false statistics of " how many lives will be saved " by preventing cervical cancer .
Meanwhile , the simple fact of the matter is thatwould prevent more cervical cancer deaths than the vaccine , and vitamin D does n't kill young girls !
But neither does vitamin D generate billions of dollars in profits for the pharmaceutical giants that profit from cervical cancer vaccines .
And so the vaccine quackery must continue , even at the cost of burying teenage girls .
Today , NaturalNews sends a message of prayer to Natalie Morton and all the other teenage girls who are potentially being harmed or even killed by cervical cancer vaccines .
Had they been aware of the dangers of vaccines and decided against subjecting their bodies to such chemical injections , they might very well be alive today .
We can only ask :
How many more Natalie Morton 's must be buried before our world will wake up and recognize the inherent dangers of mass vaccinations

Yet critics contend that Wall Street has failed to change its ways - Citigroup , which lost $ 18.7 bn ( £ 11.55 bn ) last year , still gave bonuses of more than $ 1 m to 738 of its employees .
In a frank admission , Citigroup 's chief executive , Vikram Pandit , suggested to an audience in New York on Thursday evening that one of his own employees is overpaid .
A British - born Citigroup trader , Andrew Hall , stands to receive a payout of more than $ 100 m for presiding over a highly lucrative commodities business .
When asked whether he believed $ 100 m was an excessive amount for an individual , Pandit replied : " Yes . "
Clawback
America 's top 25 banks would get particularly close scrutiny from the Fed .
But any attempt by the central bank to regulate pay will face opposition from the industry .
Scott Talbott , a spokesman for the Washington - based Financial Services Roundtable , said banks have already introduced " clawback " measures to recoup pay from staff whose performance proves poor , together with lengthier vesting periods for inventive schemes to encourage a longer term outlook .
" The threat of failure and the ghosts of other institutions have prompted banks to better manage compensation , " said Talbott .
" Our concern is that the Fed will place restrictions on sales people that will undermine the ability of companies to produce revenue . "
The Obama administration has already appointed a so - called compensation " czar " , Kenneth Feinberg , who has the authority to reject any pay deal that he views as excessive at banks in receipt of government bailout funds .
The White House has also thrown its weight behind the introduction of British - style " say on pay " votes giving shareholders a voice on remuneration at corporate annual meetings .
But European leaders want the US to go much further .
The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , says he will walk out of next week 's Pittsburgh summit unless a deal is struck to curb bonuses .
Despite reservations from Britain , EU leaders vowed in Brussels on Thursday to push for a limit on bonuses .
Luxembourg 's prime minister , Jean - Claude Juncker , said members had agreed to pursue " an absolute limit on bonuses , in other words a cap " .
War 's effects on health can be much harder to identify than death and horrendous physical injuries .
The US department of veterans affairs recently accepted that Vietnam war veterans may have developed B cell leukaemias , Parkinson 's disease and ischemic heart disease as a result of exposure to a blend of herbicides known as Agent Orange , a defoliating agent sprayed by US warplanes to deprive their enemies of cover .
Similarly , ionising radiation from the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 led to medical complications such as cancers , nausea , hair loss , bleeding into the skin , inflammation of the mouth and throat and birth defects .
Professor Nigel Brown , an expert in the causes of birth defects and dean of the faculty of medicine and biomedical science at St George 's , University of London , points out that war zones such as Falluja involve many of the risk factors that cause deformities in children .
" The whole of the war situation produces a very unusual set of circumstances to which the civilian population is exposed , mainly involving the destruction of the built environment and its knock - on effects , " he said .
" Those include the degrading of sanitation , the stress [ on people of being in a place of conflict ] , the disruption of the water supply , poor nutrition and air pollution caused by both chemicals and particulates . "
It was impossible to identify any one of those particular factors that may lie behind the apparent dramatic increase of birth defects in Falluja .
In addition , despite suspicion to the contrary , there is no reliable evidence to show that the components of munitions causes birth defects , except for ionising radiation , Brown said .
Some American service personnel who had seen action in Vietnam and the first Gulf war believed those conflicts caused them to have children with serious malformations .
However , when their concerns were investigated , no proof was found .
But studies in this area have concentrated on the health of combatants and their offspring and not on civilians caught up in conflicts , so evidence is very limited .
But what of white phosphorus , which was used in Falluja in 2004 ?
No studies have been done , among either combatants or civilians , so it is impossible to link it to the abnormalities .
" These birth defects in Falluja could be the result of multiple factors including the sheer psychological stress on the local population of being in a war zone , malnutrition , air and water pollution and a cocktail of chemicals , which may include contamination from munitions , " said Brown .
Birth defects range from minor ailments , such as a discolouration of the skin , to life - threatening conditions such as hydrocephalus and spina bifida .
In most countries between 2 % and 3 % of all babies born have some form of birth defect .
However , only between 1 % and 10 % of those involve a neural tube defect , which are the most debilitating and likely to lead to death .
" If neural tube defects are occurring apparently quite frequently in Falluja now that would be a dramatic increase over the expected rate for what are , in normal circumstances , rare events and that would be a matter of considerable concern , " said Brown .
Chaz Bono Sex Change Update ( PHOTOS , VIDEO )
Chaz Bono sat for a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight and provided an update on his gender transformation .
He reports that at the age of 40 - year - old , his true identity is emerging after a very long process that began nearly a decade ago .
After years of indecision , Chaz determined he was finally ready to take the steps necessary for the female - to - male sex change early this year .
The process included the removal of breast tissue , which he called a relief rather than traumatic .
Regarding the hormone treatments , Bono reports that the testosterone has slowly caused significant changes .
" It lowered my voice .
Fat redistributes , muscles grow , hair grows , sex drive increases ... I shave about once a week now . "
Bono is the daughter of famed musicians Sonny and Cher and grew up in the public spotlight , and has been in a longtime relationship with partner Jennifer Elia - photos here .
The process is not yet complete and further surgery is planned .
Part two of the compelling interview will air tonight on ET - see part one video below .

An eeriecloud that glowed briefly in the night sky Saturday was no UFO .
It was createdby humans - more specifically a NASA rocket built to make clouds that shine atnight .
The rocketlaunched as part of an experiment to artificially create so - called noctilucent - or night - shining - clouds , the highest clouds on Earth .
They naturally appear around 50 miles ( 80 km ) above Earth ?s high latitudes and are also known as polar mesosphericclouds .
Saturdaynight ?s rocket experiment lifted off at 7:46 p.m. EDT ( 2346 GMT ) from NASA ?s Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island , Va. Itcreated a brieflight show that was visible across the United States ?
East Coast andsparked calls from curious skywatchers as far away as Boston , according to the Associated Press .
? Itwas very impressive ?
albeit short - lived , ? said Joe Rao , an instructor and guest lecturerat New York 's Hayden Planetarium , who witnessed the event .
Rao is also SPACE.com ?sskywatching columnist .
Theexperiment created a man-made noctilucent cloud using the fourth stage of aNASA Black Brant XII suborbital sounding rocket that spewed exhaust particles 173 miles ( 278 km ) above Earth .
Ground - based radar and camera stations recordedthe resulting cloud ?s formation and illumination .
The U.S. Naval Research Laboratoryand Department of Defense ?s Space Test Program oversaw the launch , which itcalled the Charged Aerosol Release Experiment .
NASA hasobserved naturallyoccurring night - shining clouds using its AIM satellite .
The Naval ResearchLaboratory and Space Test Program also uses a satellite called STPSat - 1 toobserve the phenomena and also used the spacecraft to observe Saturday night ?
sman-made cloud .
??
Wewere n't exactly sure what we were going to see , as this was the very first timethat a noctilucent cloud experiment was attempted , ?
Rao said .
?
Would it besomething obvious to the eye , or something rather faint ??
? Theresult , he added , was spectacular .
Raodescribed the cloud as ? a brilliant object ?
that displayeda wide , fan - shaped tail shortly after it was created .
But the artificialphenomenon was over in just a few minutes .
? The " head " of the comet ( which was the rocket 's fourth stage ) rapidlyfaded out and the " tail " gradually faded over the next minute or sointo the background of the sky , ?
Rao said .
Scientistswill use the measurements of the artificial cloud to better understand naturalnoctilucent clouds , as well as help predict the effects of rocket engineexhaust in the upper atmosphere .
Saturdaynight ?s experiment was a cooperative effort by NASA , the United States Naval ResearchLaboratory , the Defense Department ?s Space Test Program and severaluniversities .
But the stunning cloud it created was seen by more than just theproject ?s scientists .
? I'msure many unsuspecting folks up and down the East Coast were surprised by thisvery unusual sight , ?
Rao said .
This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
NOTE : I have not edited the text of this entry to reflect the addition of the APG to the lineup of PRPG base class options .
I have , however , added them to the lists of skill point progressions per class as shown for each of the alternate skill progression systems below .
I like the skills in D&D 3.5 and Pathfinder RPG .
They help flesh out a character , granting more life to the concept and more closely tying the character sheet to the character ’s background .
I do n’t think the skill system is perfect , though , by any means .
Leaving aside for the moment the problems of attributes assigned to specific skills and the selection of available skills , the big problem from D&D 3.5 that PRPG solved was the way skill points were handled as a generic game mechanic .
There was simply too much arithmetic involved in spending skill points — starting with the 6×4 ( for example ) at first level and continuing with the broken - ass way class skill and cross-class skill maximums are figured over the course of a character ’s advancement to 20th level .
The math was n’t difficult in D&D 3.5 , of course , but it was certainly annoying and inelegant .
One other major pain in my tuckus from D&D 3.5 survived the translation to PRPG , though : there simply are n’t enough skill points for many characters .
The worst , and most unforgivable , case is that of classes that only get two points per level .
Rogues get a veritable plague of skill points by comparison , and the Rangers are doing pretty well for themselves , with plenty of potential for fleshing out the non-combat interests and experiences of the character in terms of the what the character has learned to do .
Fighters and Paladins , meanwhile , definitely get the short end of the stick .
Not only do they suffer the indignity of being forced into a much more narrow focus than Rogues or even Rangers , with only two points per level as a base , but they also require attention to more attributes other than Intelligence to ensure effectiveness at the specialties of the class .
Intelligence often ends up being the dump stat , which also affects skill points per level .
Paladins , especially , tend to end up being rock - stupid , because in addition to needing all three physical stats to be higher than average to excel , but they also need Wisdom and Charisma .
Intelligence is the red - headed stepchild of the Paladin class .
At least Fighters get to choose Wisdom or Charisma as the primary dump stat instead , if they prefer .
I ’ve kicked around a number of ideas in my head for a while .
One very minor fix I ’ve employed was to create a replacement for the Wizard class , in the form of the Mage class ( I ’m currently procrastinating on finishing the process of updating it for PRPG ) .
This class helps deal with the problem of Wizards , who are supposed to be learned scholars , having only two points per level as their base skill progression .
Only the aid of high Intelligence as the primary attribute for the class has mitigated this problem in D&D 3.5 , and I tend to feel they should have a lot more skill points than that if they want to start gobbling up Knowledge skills ( for instance ) ; otherwise , they ’re nearly as narrow as Fighters .
To grant them more skills without eclipsing the skill - monkey specialty of Rogues , I gave Mages lots of skill points , but also required them to use some of their skill points to buy spells they know .
This does n’t solve the problem of the rest of the 2 - point classes having very dull and boring personal lives as reflected in their skills , though .
I ’ve considered a few options for a while now to mitigate or eliminate the problem , involving just giving some classes more skill points .
I ’ve been hesitant to actually use any of those options , unfortunately , because I do n’t want to overload the game with skills or cut into the benefits some classes gain by being more skill - oriented than others .
I ’ve finally pretty much reached the breaking point , in terms of my tolerance for skill point distribution .
Something needs to be done in my games .
I just need to decide which solution to use as a house rule .
The examples I have in mind follow , each of them raising the minimum possible base skill advancement no lower than four .
Minimum 4
The simplest fix would be to take the Minimum 4 approach .
All M4 does is give any class with fewer base skill points per level than four enough additional skill points to bring them up to a base of four skill points per level .
The new skill progression landscape for core classes in the PRPG CRB looks like this :
Alchemist 4 Barbarian 4 Bard 6 Cavalier 4 Cleric 4 Druid 4 Fighter 4 Inquisitor 6 Monk 4 Oracle 4 Paladin 4 Ranger 6 Rogue 8 Sorcerer 4 Summoner 4 Witch 4 Wizard 4
Perhaps surprisingly , I rather like the way the vast majority of classes end up with the same number of skill points , with only definite outliers ending up varying from the baseline of four points per level .
It assumes a default capacity for learning new skills as embodied in the skill selection for people in general , with exceptions made for those who have chosen life pursuits that require a great deal of flexibility .
Plus 2
Another simple fix is the Plus 2 approach .
With P2 , just add two skill points per level to the base skill advancement for each of the core classes :
Alchemist 6 Barbarian 6 Bard 8 Cavalier 6 Cleric 4 Druid 6 Fighter 4 Inquisitor 8 Monk 6 Oracle 6 Paladin 4 Ranger 8 Rogue 10 Sorcerer 4 Summoner 4 Witch 4 Wizard 4
My primary concern here is that Barbarians , Druids , Rangers , and Rogues may be getting a bit more out of this modification of the canonical system than is appropriate , though in PRPG at least the elimination of the multiplier for first level skill points does help keep things under control a bit .
5 Plus
Another relatively simple modification of the system , in case four points is n’t enough for the lowest point totals , is the 5 Plus system .
With 5P , just take the various categories of skill emphasis for different classes — 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 — and assign them new numbers only one point apart , starting at five :
Alchemist 6 Barbarian 6 Bard 7 Cavalier 6 Cleric 5 Druid 6 Fighter 5 Inquisitor 7 Monk 6 Oracle 6 Paladin 5 Ranger 7 Rogue 8 Sorcerer 5 Summoner 5 Witch 5 Wizard 5
This has the advantages of keeping the upper bound the same ( eight for a Rogue ) , unlike P2 , while keeping the classes categorized the same so that the classes canonically stuck with a pathetic two per level do n’t just get shoved up into the same category as the classes that normally get four per level .
The downside , of course , is that the difference between categories has been cut in half , yielding only a one - point difference between adjacent categories , which might kind of eat into the specialness of the more - skilled classes such as Bard and Rogue .
4 Plus
The 4 Plus option is achieved by raising the minimum from two to four , then increasing each category ’s base skill point advancement by as little as possible to keep it from being overtaken by the previous category .
Thus , any two becomes a four , and any four becomes a five to avoid getting overtaken by the twos that climbed to become fours :
Alchemist 5 Barbarian 5 Bard 6 Cavalier 5 Cleric 4 Druid 5 Fighter 4 Inquisitor 6 Monk 5 Oracle 5 Paladin 4 Ranger 6 Rogue 8 Sorcerer 4 Summoner 4 Witch 4 Wizard 4
As long as you think four is high enough a minimum , I think 4P gives everyone enough skill points without running the risk of giving the more skilled classes too many points , all without cutting into the skill - monkey niche of the Rogue class .
It does not , however , deal well with the notion that Bards and Rangers might be dependent on notably higher skill point totals than the less - skilled classes .
Constrained Acceleration
The Constrained Acceleration option gives the top half of the four categories double the “ velocity ” change in their improvement over previous categories .
Thus , with CA , the lower two only differ from each other by one point , but the upper two categories each differ from previous categories by two points :
Alchemist 5 Barbarian 5 Bard 7 Cavalier 5 Cleric 4 Druid 5 Fighter 4 Inquisitor 7 Monk 5 Oracle 5 Paladin 4 Ranger 7 Rogue 9 Sorcerer 4 Summoner 4 Witch 4 Wizard 4
Unconstrained Acceleration
Unconstrained Acceleration is the same as Constrained Acceleration , except that it accelerates by one point for each higher category , rather than only accelerating once beyond the second category .
This results in the second category being one higher than the first , the third being two higher than the second , and the fourth being three higher than the third :
Alchemist 5 Barbarian 5 Bard 7 Cavalier 5 Cleric 4 Druid 5 Fighter 4 Inquisitor 7 Monk 5 Oracle 5 Paladin 4 Ranger 7 Rogue 10 Sorcerer 4 Summoner 4 Witch 4 Wizard 4
UA is clearly not for those who think that increasing the number of skill points available to a Rogue is playing with fire .
Not only do Rogues get two more points per level in UA , but they also get three more per level than Bards and Rangers .
Otherwise , its benefits and detriments are the same as those of Constrained Acceleration .
Constrained Plus
The Constrained Plus system is identical to CA , except that it starts at five instead of four :
Alchemist 6 Barbarian 6 Bard 8 Cavalier 6 Cleric 5 Druid 6 Fighter 5 Inquisitor 8 Monk 6 Oracle 6 Paladin 5 Ranger 8 Rogue 10 Sorcerer 5 Summoner 5 Witch 5 Wizard 5
For those who like the way CA works , but believe a minimum of five is more appropriate than a minimum of four , and are n’t worried about Rogues getting into double - digit range , CP might be a suitable choice .
Many , I ’m sure , would balk at giving any of the core classes double digit base skill advancement , however .
Unconstrained Plus
As UA is to CA , so Unconstrained Plus is to CP .
The only difference from CP is that in UP the Rogue is not limited to a two point improvement over the next lowest category :
Alchemist 6 Barbarian 6 Bard 8 Cavalier 6 Cleric 5 Druid 6 Fighter 5 Inquisitor 8 Monk 6 Oracle 6 Paladin 5 Ranger 8 Rogue 11 Sorcerer 5 Summoner 5 Witch 5 Wizard 5
If the Rogue ’s base skill progression having two digits in previous systems made you uneasy , UP should give you a definite case of the willies and an outbreak of goose bumps , at the very least .
4 Refactored
The 4 Refactored system starts with a minimum of four , and changes the way the various classes fit into differing categories .
After all , the fact that some classes get extra skill points need not mean that all of them do .
Perhaps some classes are exactly where they should be , while others need more skill points to escape the arbitrary limits placed on them in the PHB and CRB :
Alchemist 5 Barbarian 4 Bard 6 Cavalier 5 Cleric 5 Druid 4 Fighter 4 Inquisitor 6 Monk 4 Oracle 4 Paladin 4 Ranger 6 Rogue 8 Sorcerer 4 Summoner 5 Witch 5 Wizard 5
4R brings the minimums up to four , but it also keeps the maximums down to 8 .
Clerics and Wizards , as classes likely to benefit from some amount of scholarly background , get more of a boost than other classes with a canonical two point base skill progression rate .
Of course , you may choose to do things differently ; this is just a suggestion .
As long as I ’m not using a systematic modification to the already extant system , it would be difficult for me to claim you should n’t make any changes you like , but if you like my version that should make things pretty easy for you .
5 Homogenized
I suppose I could be a dick about it , and just say everyone gets five skill points as base skill progression .
In some respects , this seems to have the greatest sense of verisimilitude of all the options I ’ve considered , but I ’m distinctly hesitant to even seriously consider this option without changing a lot of the rest of the game system .
Making a Decision
I have n’t settled on what I ’m going to do , yet , but I ’m definitely going to do something by the next time I have anyone make characters for a PRPG campaign where I ’m the GM .
I will almost certainly apply such modifications to any ongoing campaigns I have right now , too — an easy thing to get the players to accept , since all it involves is handing out a few more skill points to at least some of the characters .
If there is any difficulty in that regard , it would probably result from choosing a system that would grant extra points to only some of the classes in a campaign , leaving others perhaps feeling like they got ignored a little .
Regardless of the potential social issues of changing rules midstream in an ongoing campaign , I ’m thinking long and hard about what skill advancement system I will adopt for the next PRPG campaign I start running .
Any constructive suggestions , critiques , questions , or additional options are welcome , of course .
What do you think I should do ?
What do you think you ’ll do — if anything — to change the base skill progression numbers in your own games ?
NOTE : I 've started using the 4P system , as have some friends .
It seems to work quite well for all of our campaigns .
YMMV .

When shit is about to hit the fan .
The warning goes against the grain of efforts by Governments on both sides of the Atlantic , which have tacitly ruled out splitting up the biggest banks and opted instead to scrutinise them more actively .
Mr King , who said earlier this year that if banks are " too big to fail , then ... they are too big , " said that there is a risk the financial crisis comes and goes but the current system , in which big banks enjoy an effective guarantee from the state , remains .
I wholeheartedly endorse Peter Schiff for Senate .
To understand why , in spite of previous differences between us , please consider the following compelling case , starting with a look at government bailouts , the moral hazards of too big to fail , the current rise in the stock markets , and the " great government advance " of corporate welfare and bailouts at taxpayer expense .
Robert Reich , former Secretary of Labor , Professor at Berkeley , discusses government intrusion in Why the Dow is Hitting 10,000 While Everyone Else is Cutting Back .
So how can the Dow be flirting with 10,000 when consumers , who make up 70 percent of the economy , have had to cut way back on buying because they have no money ?
Jobs continue to disappear .
One out of six Americans is either unemployed or underemployed .
Homes can no longer function as piggy banks because they 're worth almost a third less than they were two years ago .
And for the first time in more than a decade , Americans are now having to pay down their debts and start to save .
Even more curious , how can the Dow be so far up when every business and Wall Street executive I come across tells me government is crushing the economy with its huge deficits , and its supposed " takeover " of health care , autos , housing , energy , and finance ?
Their anguished cries of " socialism " are almost drowning out all their cheering over the surging Dow .
The explanation is simple .
The great consumer retreat from the market is being offset by government 's advance into the market .
Consumer debt is way down from its peak in 2006 ; government debt is way up .
Consumer spending is down , government spending is up .
Why have new housing starts begun ?
Because the Fed is buying up Fannie and Freddie 's paper , and government - owned Fannie and Freddie are now just about the only mortgage games remaining in play .
Why are health care stocks booming ?
Because the government is about to expand coverage to tens of millions more Americans , and the White House has assured Big Pharma and health insurers that their profits will soar .
Why are auto sales up ?
Because the cash - for - clunkers program has been subsidizing new car sales .
Why is the financial sector surging ?
Because the Fed is keeping interest rates near zero , and the rest of the government is still guaranteeing any bank too big to fail will be bailed out .
Why are federal contractors doing so well ?
Because the stimulus has kicked in .

Misguided Calls For Government Intervention
Lehman Brothers Revisited
The most popular storyline offered by these Monday morning quarterbacks is that the mistaken decision to allow Lehman to fail resulted from the Bush Administration 's misplaced faith in the free markets .
In this telling , the real crises began in the days following the Lehman bankruptcy , which unleashed a financial panic that would have caused complete economic collapse -- if not for the subsequent federal intervention .
In reality , Lehman 's demise was simply the result of an unfolding crisis that began years before .
Popular belief aside , allowing the institution to succumb to the overwhelming debts on its balance sheet was perhaps the only correct decision made by government since this crisis began .
The propagandists ' complete reversal of cause and effect now threatens to spur the government to compound prior mistakes and bring on the next phase of the financial crisis .
Unfortunately , this chapter will likely be much more dangerous than what we saw last fall .
However , politics quickly trumped economics , and the Lehman trial balloon soon turned into the Hindenburg .
Washington had no stomach for the ensuing financial carnage , and when other institutions began to topple , Bush , Paulson and Bernanke abandoned their prior convictions and threw all they had into the ensuing bailout bonanza .
As a result , the moral hazard that they had sought to avoid now exists on a scale unprecedented in our history .
Capitalism has been extinguished on Wall Street , and our financial institutions now exist as public utilities .
The presidents of our biggest banks are now the highest paid civil servants in the world !
Since market forces are no longer allowed to allocate capital and control risk , these decisions are now made by government regulators and are then passed through to their subordinates on Wall Street .
This perverse organizational structure constitutes a new form of American fascism .
Super Regulator or Super Nightmare ?
It has n’t taken long for Peter Schiff , who recently announced he ’s running against Chris Dodd and others for his Connecticut Senate seat , to attack Dodd over his recent proposal to create a super regulatory agency by combining four existing regulatory agencies into one .
The four agencies Dodd would want to make into one include the Federal Reserve , the Office of Thrift Supervision , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency .
Dodd ’s point of view is that the reason there was a economic crisis last year was in a large part because banks were allowed to choose which of the above four agencies they wanted to regulate them .
He also asserts these agencies weakened regulations so the banks would choose them as their regulator of choice .
Schiff responded to the proposal of Dodd in a press release , saying this :
“ Existing regulators had all the powers they needed , and more , and they failed miserably to foresee and prevent this crisis .
Chris Dodd is now asking us to put all our eggs in one basket and trust a ’ super regulatory agency . ’
He should know better than to centralize power in the hands of Washington bureaucrats – it ’s precisely the arrangement that caused our current problems .
I think most Connecticut voters know that we need fewer czars in Washington , not more .
As long as Fannie and Freddie and Congress are meddling with the economy , changing the structure of the regulators is basically rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic .
American Fascism
Do we need someone to regulate Fannie Mae or do we need to eliminate Fannie Mae ?
Do we need regulators to look at rating agencies or do we need to eliminate government sponsorship of rating agencies ?
( If you do n't know the answer please see Time To Break Up The Credit Rating Cartel . )
Do we need regulators to watch over bank lending or do we need to promote sound money practices that are by definition self - regulating ?
Corollary Number Two :
The government / quasi - government body most responsible for creating this mess ( the Fed ) , will attempt a big power grab , purportedly to fix whatever problems it creates .
The bigger the mess it creates , the more power it will attempt to grab .
Over time this leads to dangerously concentrated power into the hands of those who have already proven they do not know what they are doing .
Corollary Number
Three :
Do n't expect the Fed to learn from past mistakes .
Instead , expect the Fed to repeat them with bigger and bigger doses of exactly what created the initial problem .

The bill coming out of the Senate Finance committee mandates everyone to have health insurance , and even has teeth — a fine if you fail to have insurance .
But no provisions to control costs , so now the health insurance companies will be able to charge whatever they want ( like they do now ) , but you will have no choice but to pay it , or pay a hefty fine .
What a lovely gift to the insurance industry .
Nov. 5 , 2009  --
For many people , it 's one of life 's most intimate moments .
But for a 23 - year - old Minnesota teacher , the birth of her first child will be an event open to anyone in the world .
For the past few months , Lynsee ( who asked to keep her last name private ) has been sharing daily details about her pregnancy on the social network MomsLikeMe .
When she gives birth in the next few days , more than a thousand women who follow her online -- plus anyone else with an Internet connection -- will be able to watch a live broadcast of her child 's birth from their computers .
" We wanted to share this experience , " Lynsee said about the decision she made with her husband Anders .
" If I were in a classroom , I 'd be teaching about development .
It was a way for me to teach …
A way for me to use myself as a textbook . "
The day Lynsee found out she was pregnant , she joined the MomsLikeMe site for the Twin Cities area .
She and her husband had just moved to Minneapolis - St.
Paul and , not knowing many people , she found the Web site to be a good way to meet other women and learn about local resources .
Other Mothers to Participate Via Live Chat
Soon after joining , she answered a message from the site 's manager asking pregnant women in the area to contact her .
And before she knew it , Lynsee was n't just a member of the online mothers ' network , she was a contributor .
After talking it over with her husband , the young woman agreed to share every last detail of her pregnancy through a daily blog , and then finish off the project with a live Internet broadcast of the delivery .
How did her husband feel ?
" He was a little hesitant at first , as was I , " Lynsee said .
But after MomsLikeMe assured them that the video would be shot tastefully , the parents - to - be embraced the idea .
" I shared pretty much anything -- it 's pretty much a tell - all blog , " Lynsee said about her online postings .
When she gives birth , a cameraman will be in the hospital room with Lynsee , her husband , her mother and her midwife .
A second camera will be mounted in the corner .
Lynsee said there will not be any graphic shots taken from over the midwife 's shoulder .
In addition to the live broadcast , anyone registered with her group on MomsLikeMe will be able to chat with Lynsee while she 's in the delivery room .
Mommy Blogger : ' New Era of Sharing Personal Events '
" I hope to give women a sense of empowerment and joy because it's a very miraculous everyday event , " she said .
" We 're just sharing the story from the empowerment and emotional aspects . "
Since making the decision to broadcast the birth , Lynsee said she has not had any second thoughts , and said her family has been 100 percent supportive .
But some mommy bloggers said they were surprised to see someone use new technology to reveal so much .
" I saw this as kind of like a door into a new era of sharing personal events , " said Kim , 25 , a stay - at - home mother from the Chicago area who blogs for Families.com and asked to withhold her last name .
When her son was born seven months ago , Kim and her husband announced his birth on Facebook .
But she said that differed from live streaming video of the actual event , or using Twitter , in that only friends and family can see what they post .
Younger Generations More Comfortable With New Media
" Birth has always been such private thing , " she said .
" We 've seen it move from the home into the hospital .
Now to see it move on to the Internet is pretty incredible . "
Last September , several blogs reported a Pennsylvania man wanted to share the birth of his child through the video site UStream .
And this summer , the wife of Twitter CEO Evan Williams tweeted to the world that their child was on the way .
" Dear Twitter , " she wrote .
" My water broke .
It was n't like Charlotte in ' Sex and the City . '
Now timing contractions on an iPhone app . "
Julie Taylor , senior editorial producer for Los Angeles - based MomLogic.com and mother of two , said that when she first heard about Lynsee 's project she thought " Wow !
I would never do that . "
But she acknowledged that younger mothers have grown up in a very different technological landscape .
" They 've lived more of their lives online , " she said .
" For them , they 've video - taped most of their lives anyway and they 've grown up on reality TV .
So maybe it's an old - fashioned notion to think twice . "
First - Person Stories Can Provide Good Lessons
Ultimately , Taylor and others agree that childbirth is a supremely personal experience and each woman has the right to fashion the experience to her liking .
" It 's a personal choice , " said Gwynn Cassidy , online director for the Internet resource HealthyWomen.org .
" We all have our personal lines in terms of what we will cross or wo n't cross . "
She added that while not many women may choose to broadcast their child 's birth live , many more are turning to new media to share milestones and first - person stories .
" It 's absolutely a trend , " she said .
" If we do n't share this information with each other who 's going to ? " Cassidy said .
" It 's a great lesson for women who do want to have children and for younger women to see how childbirth really can be . "
Waste paper and plastic have always been poor stepsisters to cardboard and cans in the recycling arena .
Times are so tough today that all four go begging .
Extra efforts are needed to make them marketable , with no guarantees that there will be buyers .
Leigh Jacobson ’s enthusiasm about recycling flies in the face of her task .
When the markets crashed last year , Auburn University ’s waste disposal needs fell on hard times .
The company out of Atlanta that had been taking co-mingled trash for no charge said , " No longer . "
No , this was no Georgia - Alabama feud .
Simple economics prevailed .
China ’s demand slumped .
The entire market for recycled materials dropped nearly to zero .
When the market disappears , companies can no longer provide dumpsters , take waste at no charge , and carry that waste to a transfer center in Opelika , saving the University $ 20 per ton for landfill fees .
So , six months ago Leigh Jacobson and others representing the City of Auburn , Opelika and Lee County secured an annual Alabama Recycling Grant for $ 120,139 .
AU got $ 40,829 of that .
The funds have come from an imposed extra $ 1 per ton on the landfill dumping fees in the state .
Sixty buildings have gotten new bins , labels , signs and posters .
Single collections of paper / cardboard and plastic bottles / metal cans are underway .
Residential areas have been the first to come on line with the project .
But , everything collected in these new bins still needs to be separated if the enterprise hopes to get paid for having collected it .
Look out our windows .
Across Magnolia , located on the east side of Donahue is Leigh ’s workspace .
Peek into the parking lot at the bins .
Watch people manually setting paper aside from cardboard and cans aside from bottles .
It is a small staff with a big goal .
Bundled cardboard fetched $ 17.50 per ton in September .
Steel and aluminum cans generally get ten cents a pound .
Plastic bottles earn one penny per pound .
A great deal of human labor is going into this recycling project with a price tag of its own .
Leigh optimistically thinks this can work .

Milloy , Steven Best Price : $ 1.25 Buy New $ 8.10 ( as of 05:10 EST - Details )
Economically , the University should stop these recycling efforts and let the waste be hauled to the landfill .
Those landfills can always be mined when there are actual markets for such materials .
The company that holds the University ’s contract for hauling waste away is Waste Management .
They do not recycle .
They own their own landfill in Salem .
The charge for dumping waste there ( " tipping " ) is $ 21.75 per ton .
AU does already landfill a large quantity of waste .
They should landfill all of it .
Ten years ago , when open dumps were closed in the state , private companies began filling that need .
Waste Management is today the largest landfill operator in the U.S. , with 281 landfills .
Now , if they ’re the largest with just 281 landfills , does that sound like enough landfills in the whole country to you ?
Is it ?
Is n’t that one of the three things everybody knows when we talk trash ?
1 ) We know we ’re running out of landfill space , 2 ) we know we ’re saving resources by recycling and protecting the environment by doing so , and 3 ) we know no one would recycle if they were n’t forced to .
Let ’s look at these three things we think we know .
Are they real or are they rubbish ?
1 ) Are we running out of landfill space ?
Two events created the perfect garbage storm in the late 1980s .
One barge and one bureaucrat created this one over - hyped myth .
The garbage barge was the Mobro 4000 .
The bureaucrat was J. Winston Porter .
Mobro 4000 gained infamous celebrity status by spending two months and 6,000 miles seeming to scour the Atlantic coastline and the Gulf of Mexico looking for a home for its load , as if no landfills existed .
The physical availability of landfill space was not the issue , but you would not have guessed that from the hysteria the media whipped up .
J. Winston Porter became a star that season at the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) by writing Agenda for Action , in which Porter proclaimed that recycling is absolutely vital because America is running out of landfill space .
What Porter thought he knew simply was not so .
The EPA had noticed that the number of landfills was dropping .
They failed to notice that the size of landfills was getting much bigger much faster .
Total landfill capacity was actually rising .
The EPA also underestimated the prospects for creating additional capacity .
Obviously , and as usual , the real landfill problem is not a landfill problem at all but a political problem .
" Fears about the effects of landfills on the local environment have led to the rise of the not - in - my - back - yard ( NIMBY ) syndrome , which has made permitting facilities difficult .
Actual landfill capacity is not running out . "
Today , 1654 landfills in 48 states take care of 54 % of all the solid waste in the country .
One - third of them are privately owned .
The largest landfill , in Las Vegas , received 3.8 M tons during 2007 at fees within the national range of $ 24 to $ 70 per ton .
Landfills are no longer a threat to the environment or public health .
State - of - the - art landfills , with redundant clay and plastic liners and leachate collection systems , have now replaced all of our previously unsafe dumps .
More and more landfills are producing pipeline quality natural gas .
Waste Management plans to turn 60 of their waste sites into energy facilities by 2012 .
The new plants will capture methane gas from decomposing landfill waste , generating more than 700 megawatts of electricity , enough to power 700,000 homes .
The end use of most landfills is parkland .
Holding all of America ’s garbage for the next one hundred years would require a space 255 feet high or deep and only 10 miles on a side .
Landfills welcome the business .
Forty percent of what we recycle ends up there anyway .
We are not running out of landfill space .
2 ) Are we saving resources and protecting the environment by recycling ?
What are the costs in energy and material resources to recycling as opposed to landfill disposal which we ’ve just looked at ?
Which method of handling solid waste uses the least amount of resources as valued by the market ?
As government budgets tighten and the cost of being " green " rubs against the reality of rising taxes , recycling coordinators like Leigh Jacobson increasingly will be under fire to justify their programs as cost - effective alternatives to waste disposal methods such as landfilling .
I do n’t think she will be able to do it .
But it should be easier for Leigh at the University than it will be for her counterpart in the City of Auburn , or in any city that funds curbside recycling like San Francisco or Seattle .
Curbside recycling is substantially more costly — that is , it uses far more resources — than a program in which disposal is combined with a voluntary drop off / buy - back option .
Overall , curbside recycling costs run between 35 percent and 55 percent higher than other recycling methods because it uses huge amounts of capital and labor per pound of material recycled .
Recycling itself uses three times more resources than does landfilling .
The largest U.S. organization dedicated to recycling just found out how difficult this chosen path can be .
The final death knell for the National Recycling Coalition ( NRC ) appeared to ring earlier this year when the organization announced it would be filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy .
The NRC ceased operations and terminated all staff members at the close of business on Sept. 4 , shortly after an attempt to merge with Keep America Beautiful failed .
NRC is now trying to avoid bankruptcy by reorganization .
Even though they are a half million dollars in debt , NRC may legally continue to exist if they can raise funds , negotiate with their creditors and develop a business plan .
What seems to be their business plan ?
They are counting on the Kerry - Boxer Bill on clean energy to include recycling language .
In other words , they are counting on being bailed out and subsidized .
The market knows this is a losing proposition , so these players are trying to get taxpayers to fund their enterprises .
The Solid Waste Association of North America found in the six communities involved in a particular study , all but one of the curbside recycling programs , and all the composting operations and waste - to - energy incinerators , increased the cost of waste disposal .
Indeed , the price for recycling often tends to soar far higher than the combined costs of manufacturing of raw materials from virgin sources and dumping rubbish into landfills .
To recycle waste is to use twice the energy and to create twice the pollution from factories , trucks and byproducts .
Recycled newspapers must be de-inked , often with chemicals , creating sludge .
Even if the sludge is harmless , it too must be disposed of .
Second , recycling more newspapers will not necessarily preserve trees , because many trees are grown specifically to be made into paper .
The amount of new growth that occurs each year in forests exceeds by a factor of twenty the amount of wood and paper that is consumed by the world each year .
Wherever private property rights to forests are well - defined and enforced , forests are either stable or growing .
Glass is made from silica dioxide — that ’s common beach sand — the most abundant mineral in the crust of the earth .
Plastic is derived from petroleum by - products after fuel is harvested from the raw material .
Recycling paper , glass or plastic is usually not justified compared to the virgin prices of these materials .
The best way to measure the scarcity of natural resources such as trees , sand or oil is to use the market prices of those resources .
If the price of a resource is going up over time , and it ’s not just inflation pushing those prices higher , the resource is getting scarcer .
If the price is going down , it is becoming more plentiful .
Indeed , since 1845 , the average price of raw materials has fallen roughly 80 percent after adjusting for inflation .
This paradox of our having more by using more is explained by the use of the most important resource — man ’s mind .
Human ingenuity makes natural resources increasingly available through prices , innovation , and substitution .
Bureaucrats , however , appear to occupy a place at the far and opposite end from human ingenuity .
Their interferences in markets do damage .
Just two examples will illustrate what I mean by that .
One is about a light that has a dark side .
The other example requires that you either clean your plate or become a composter .
Our Congress in 2007 banned incandescent bulbs .
Not exactly a market action .
The phase - out of incandescent light is to begin with the 100 - watt bulb in 2012 and end in 2014 with the 40 - watt .
By 2020 , bulbs must be 70 percent more efficient than they are today .
While a standard 100 - watt bulb cost $ 1.24 , the spiral compact fluorescent light ( CFL ) 100 - watt sold for $ 4.97 .
Advocates argue , however , the CFL lasts longer and uses less energy .
The packaging claims that after six years I will have saved $ 74 in energy .
Thereby , in the year 2007 alone , under this edict , some 397 million compact fluorescent light ( CFL ) bulbs were placed into the market .
Their debut is counted as a success .
However , the recycling of spent household CFLs has been an abject failure .
Already ?
That was 2007 .
Today is 2009 .
Does n’t this suggest that several of those bulbs did n’t last any six years ?
Despite CFL disposal bans in states like Maine , despite continuing statewide education efforts and a free CFL recycling program there , households throw the used bulbs into the trash that ends up in the landfills .
What ’s the problem with that ?
Landfills , as we ’ve learned , have the space and the appetite for our waste .
Well , the problem is the potential public and environmental health effects of the collective release of the small amount of mercury in each discarded CFL .
For example , using the mean amount of 5 milligrams per CFL , the total amount of mercury contained in the 2007 shipments of CFLs alone is 4,376 pounds .
There is no mention on GE ’s packaging of the bulb ’s mercury component or any special precautions you must take when this bulb breaks .
Notice that " mercury free " is already a selling point to the producers of new LED technology Accent bulbs .
Accent meaning you can’t actually get enough light from them to read by .
But , you can tell the packager has obviously experienced how ugly the CFL - produced light is because the buyer is assured a warm white light , which is something you do not get with a CFL .
In June of this year , Maine adopted the nation ’s first law that requires CFL bulb manufacturers to share the costs and responsibility for recycling mercury - containing CFLs through a producer - financed collection and recycling program , which must include an education component .
This mandate will drive the CFL ’s cost even higher .
Additional specialized equipment will have to be created for handling light bulbs that will be seen to be hazardous waste .
How can any savings ever result from such a boondoggle ?
Then , bringing new depth and meaning to the word boondoggle , San Francisco ’s newest mandatory recycling ordinance took effect last month .
All residences , all restaurants and all commercial buildings must participate in the city ’s recycling and composting programs .
A recent study had unearthed the fact that 36 percent of the city ’s landfilled waste is compostable .
That happens to be the ingredient that makes the landfill valuable as an energy source .
Collecting your food scraps , plant trimmings , soiled paper , and other compostables is considered necessary by San Franciscans to fight global warming .
Residents get both a green cart and a green report titled , Stop Trashing the Planet .
Residents face $ 100 fines if they fail to separate their food scraps from their papers or cans .
Businesses face fines of $ 500 .
Really bad actors could be fined $ 1000 .
The stated goal is to get to zero waste , meaning no garbage at all going into landfills , by the year 2020 .
Obviously , San Francisco believes we have run out of landfill space .
Obviously they do not have the vision to see the energy plants that landfills can become when waste is actually put there .
In light of these facts , how can San Franciscans and others think recycling conserves resources ?
First , many states and local communities subsidize recycling programs , either out of tax receipts or out of fees collected for trash disposal .
That ’s the case with AU ’s recycling grant .
Thus the bookkeeping costs reported for such programs are far less than their true resource costs to society .
Also , observers sometimes errantly compare relatively high - cost twice a week garbage pickup with relatively low - cost once or twice a month recycling pickups , which makes recycling appear more attractive .
Why do these same people think that recycling is protecting the environment by not polluting ?
Recycling is a manufacturing process , and therefore it too has environmental impact .
The U.S. Office of Technology Assessment says that it is " usually not clear whether secondary manufacturing such as recycling produces less pollution per ton of material processed than primary manufacturing processes . "
Increased pollution by recycling is particularly apparent in the cases of curbside recycling .
Los Angeles has estimated that its fleet of trucks is twice as large as it otherwise would be — 800 versus 400 trucks .
This means more iron ore and coal mining , more steel and rubber manufacturing , more petroleum extracted and refined for fuel — and of course all that extra air pollution in the Los Angeles basin as the 400 added trucks cruise the curbs .
Manufacturing paper , glass , and plastic from recycled materials uses appreciably more energy and water and produces as much or more air pollution as manufacturing from raw materials .
Resources are not saved and the environment is not protected .

3 ) Do people only recycle when they are forced to ?
If all we knew about recycling was what we hear from environmental groups , recycling would seem to be the philosophy that everything is worth saving except your own time and your own money .
Costs of recycling are so hidden .
If we add in the weekly costs of sorting out items , it would make more sense to place everything in landfills .
But , private recycling is the world ’s second , if not the world ’s first , oldest profession .
Recyclers were just called scavengers .
Everything of value has always been recycled .
You will automatically know that something is of value when someone offers to buy it from you , or you see people picking through your waste or diving into dumpsters .
Aluminum packaging has never been more than one small percent of solid waste , because metals have value .
Ragpickers may not be in season now picking out cloth from waste , but cardboard , wood and metals have always been in some demand .
Human Action , The Scho ... Ludwig von Mises Best Price : $ 10.37 Buy New $ 40.95 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Scrapyards recycle iron and steel because making steel from virgin iron and coal is more expensive .
Members of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries recycle 60 million tons of ferrous metals , 7 million tons of nonferrous metals , and 30 million tons of waste paper , glass , and plastic each year — an amount that dwarfs that of all government ( city , county , and state ) recycling programs .
Recycling is a long - practiced , productive , indeed essential , element of the market system .
Informed voluntary recycling conserves resources and raises our wealth , enabling us to achieve valued ends that would otherwise be impossible .
So , yes , people do recycle even when they are not forced to do so .
However , forcing people to recycle routinely makes society worse off .
Mandated recycling exists mainly because there is plenty of money to be made by upselling products as " green " or " recycled " to get Municipal and Federal grants .
Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig von Mises speak to our recycling topic .
In Economics in One Lesson , Hazlitt teaches us that mandatory recycling considers only short - term benefits to a few groups — politicians , public relation consultants , environmental organizations , and waste - handling corporations — instead of looking at the longer - term effects of the policy for all groups .
The negative consequence will be the squandering of human resources .
In conclusion , Mises also teaches us what to expect .
Mises , in his great work , Human Action , does not tell us that recycling is a bad belief .
He shows by example that mandatory recycling is an inappropriate means of caring about the environment .
Waste is inescapable .
Austrian economics leaves it to every person to decide whether your belief ( what you think you know even if it is n’t so ) is more important than the avoidance of the inevitable consequences of forced recycling policies : wasted natural resources and wasted human resources .

Another force pushing Americans to delay retirement is that the percentage of companies that provide health coverage to retirees is half what it was two decades ago .
Moreover , the age to obtain full Social Security benefits has increased to at least 66 for people born after 1942 , from its traditional 65 .
The median income for those 65 and over was just $ 18,208 in 2008  a quarter of them had incomes under $ 11,139 , according to Patrick Purcell , an expert on older workers and pensions with the Congressional Research Service .
The average Social Security recipient age 65 and over receives just $ 12,437 in annual benefits , he said , and among individuals 65 and older who received income from financial assets , half received less than $ 1,542 last year .
While Social Security keeps most seniors above the poverty line , there are a substantial number near poverty “ who are just getting by , ” said Richard W. Johnson , a senior fellow at the Urban Institute .
Many economists say it is good that Americans are working later in life  many are living longer and able to contribute longer .
Still , many older job seekers insist they are losing out because of age discrimination .
Last year , nearly 25,000 workers filed age discrimination complaints , a 29 percent jump over 2007 , according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
“ I often get told that I ’m overqualified , ” said Barbara Brooks , 71 , who retired in 2003 after 30 years as an administrative assistant at the University of California , Los Angeles .
She said being told that is code language for “ you ’re too old . ”
But Ms. Brooks said she wanted to work  and needed to  citing her monthly mortgage of $ 1,500 , which eats up half her monthly pension .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
It is n't clear whether the United States will ever be able to declare victory in Iraq , the top U.S. commander there said Thursday .
Army Gen. Ray Odierno speaks to reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday .
" I 'm not sure we will ever see anyone declare victory in Iraq , because first off , I 'm not sure we 'll know for 10 years or five years , " Army Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters at the Pentagon .
About 123,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq now , and President Obama says all combat forces will be gone by the end of August 2010 , leaving as many as 50,000 noncombat troops to advise and train Iraqi forces before leaving by the end of 2011 .
Odierno has said he wants to draw down the U.S. forces at a faster rate than planned if the security situation allows it .
On Thursday , he said he expected the number of U.S. troops to drop to 120,000 by the end of October , and to as few as 110,000 by the end of 2009 .
" What we 've done here is we 're giving Iraq an opportunity in the long term to be a strategic partner of the United States , but more importantly , be a partner in providing regional stability inside of the Middle East , " Odierno said .
Odierno also highlighted continuing security issues inside the country , saying Iraqi security forces have recently seized several " very large " caches of Iranian - made rockets and armor- piercing munitions known as explosively formed penetrators , or EFPs .
" If you 're training people ... in Iran to come back into Iraq , and you 're providing them rockets and other things , I call that significant because it still enables people to conduct attacks not only on U.S. forces but on Iraqi civilians , " Odierno said .
At a congressional hearing Wednesday , Odierno said the main threat to stability in Iraq are Arab - Kurd tensions , adding there has been difficulty bringing the two sides together for possible joint patrols .
" We 've had some very good meetings , " he said .
" But we still have some ways to go on that . "

While Starr said the country , which has been talking about improving health care for many decades , was " closer than we ever have been to reform , " he would not guess whether Congress would pass a bill this time .

For Huntsville resident Scottie Roberson , the letter X -- seven of them , to be exact -- led to more than $ 19,000 in Birmingham parking tickets .
Roberson said he has been to Birmingham only once in the past five years and left without a ticket .
He said city officials told him the tickets were issued by mistake because of his vanity plate -- XXXXXXX .
Roberson , 38 , said the plate is an homage to his days of building custom cars , when he was given the nickname " Racer X . "
He uses seven X's , he said , because seven is his favorite number .
When Birmingham parking patrols find cars without license plates parked illegally or at expired meters , they enter seven X's in place of the plate number , city officials said .
The parking citation form calls for a plate number , and the practice is to use X's when no number is available .
About a year ago , Roberson began receiving letters stating he had outstanding parking tickets , sometimes as many as 10 in one day in 10 places , he said .
In November , after multiple calls to city officials , Roberson received a letter stating that two of the tickets had been dismissed .
But the notices just kept coming .
Roberson said he has been receiving notifications about tickets for a year .
" Whenever I call , nobody seems to want to help me , " Roberson said .
" One woman said not to worry about it because they did n't have the manpower to come arrest me . "
City spokeswoman April Odom acknowledged on Thursday that Roberson had wrongly received the tickets because of the system and said the fines were being dismissed .
City officials are working to change the entry system to keep Roberson from receiving any additional tickets , Odom said .
Can Your Pet Save You on Your Taxes ?
Robert Davi pushes for tax break up to $ 3,500 per person for pet care expenses .
Oct. 13 , 2009  -- Will Max be a tax break ?
Can Fido help with FICA ?
A bill making the rounds on Capitol Hill marries two feel - good propositions -- tax cuts and pet ownership -- to generate a novel idea : A tax break of up to $ 3,500 per person for pet care expenses .
The measure is a legislative long shot .
But it 's been championed by a veteran Hollywood tough guy and by a conservative Michigan congressman , and has drawn the enthusiastic support of animal rights groups eager to promote pet ownership during economic down times .
" We think this is as much a health care bill as any , " said Nancy Perry , vice president of government affairs at the Humane Society of the United States .
" It 's a human health issue to ensure that pets are provided with better care because of the role they play in our families . "
The measure even has a snappy acronym : the HAPPY Act , as in Humanity and Pets Partnered Through the Years .
" What a pro-active way to be able to help the economy and change the culture in this country around animals , " Robert Davi , a veteran actor ( " The Goonies , " " Die Hard , " " License to Kill " ) who was a main force behind the bill 's introduction , told ABCNews.com in a telephone interview .
" This money goes back into the economy , and it encourages people to understand the social responsibilities we have toward animals , " Davi said .
Betsy Dribben , vice president of government relations for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , is realistic about the bill 's prospects .
Her group is supporting the bill but taking a wait - and - see attitude before pressing members of Congress .
But with more attention being paid to the fate of pets whose owners lose their homes , she said interest is growing on Capitol Hill and beyond about how the government can respond .
" There is a move afoot .
There is a general acknowledgement that people really care about their pets , " Dribben said .
" Taking care of pets does cost money , and during the dramatic decline of people 's income and the shaky economy , any possibility of assisting people in meeting those costs should be looked at . "
Tax Breaks for Pets ?
The Humane Society estimates that 39 percent of U.S. households own at least one dog , while 38 percent own at least one cat .
About 62 percent of American households own a pet .
The tax break would apply to more exotic pets as well , so long as they 're being owned within the bounds of the law .
Any " legally owned , domesticated , live animal " would qualify , under the terms of the bill .
According to the ASPCA , a cat costs about $ 670 a year on average to take care of , while dogs are about $ 200 a year more expensive .
The tax break would be capped at $ 3,500 per person , regardless of how many animals a taxpayer owned .
Davi , the owner of four dogs and a cat , said the concept of using the tax code to promote pet ownership occurred to him a few months ago , in thinking about the stimulus package passed by Democrats in Congress -- a package , he said , that he opposed .
Davi's cousin runs a prominent California animal rescue foundation , D.E.L.T.A. Rescue , and is always looking for ideas that would get more pets adopted , he said .
Why not let people deduct expenses like pet food and veterinarian bills from their taxes , like child care expenses or mortgage interest can help reduce your tax burden ?
So , Davi reached out to Rep. Thaddeus McCotter , R - Mich. , whom Davi had befriended after watching his work against the stimulus package .
McCotter was intrigued enough by the concept to craft it into legislation he offered this summer .
The bill seems unlikely to advance very far .
Both Republican and Democratic aides say it has n't risen near the top of anyone 's priority list , given the other huge challenges confronting lawmakers these days .
And reactions among conservatives are mixed at best .
Ed Morrissey , writing for HotAir.com , pointed out that carving out new tax deductions works against efforts to simplify the tax code .
" I like both Davi and McCotter , but this seems rather misguided , especially for a conservative Republican like McCotter , " Morrissey wrote .
" Republicans have been demanding tax simplification , not further complication , for the last few years , and for good reasons .
The problem with the current tax code is precisely that ' using the tax code to encourage positive behavior is common practice . '
Congress and presidents routinely press for tax breaks for their ideas of social engineering , which is why we now spend hundreds of billions of dollars in tax compliance . "
Proponents of the HAPPY
Act say pets are worth it .
" Pets release stress , give comfort , partnership in these hard times -- that 's invaluable .
They help people stay active .
They teach compassion .
In an unpredictable world , pets are consistent .
They 're really a part of the fabric of life , " said Dribben .
" This legislation is helping people so that they can keep the pets that they love . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bonuses at financial firms worldwide will increase by an average of 40 % this year , according to an annual report released Monday .
Options Group , a New York - based executive search and compensation consultancy , said near - record revenues from fixed - income , commodities and foreign exchange trading will help push bankers ' bonuses back up after a slump in 2008 .
The report , which was based on data from 300,000 industry professionals worldwide , also showed that bonuses are increasingly being offered in the form of multi- year stock options .
Even with this year 's projected rebound , however , bonuses are expected to remain below the record levels of 2007 .
Among the financial firms that are expected to increase bonus pay this year are big U.S. banks such as Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) .
Last week , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley said they stand to spend $ 35 billion combined this year on employee compensation .
Wall Street 's compensation practices have been heavily criticized by lawmakers and the public for encouraging the risky behavior that helped cause last year 's financial meltdown .
Indeed , many of the banks that are now planning to raise bonus payments this year received taxpayer - funded bailouts in 2008 .
To help prevent a repeat of last year 's crisis , the Federal Reserve is preparing to force big U.S. banks to abide by longstanding rules banning excessive or inappropriate banker pay .
The Fed said last month that a review of bank pay practices will " focus on whether compensation arrangements provide employees incentives to take excessive risks that could threaten the safety and soundness of the banking organization . "
The rebound in bonus pay comes as banks around the world have returned to profitability after last year 's crisis forced the collapse of many long - standing investment firms .
The Options Group study revealed that bonuses will be largest for employees who were able to take advantage of rallies in key markets during 2009 .
" The areas where professionals will receive largest bonuses are commodities , high - yield and investment grade credit , and equity derivatives , " said Michael Karp , co-founder of Options Group .
However , the uptick in bonus pay is partly a reflection of much lower headcounts at many global banking and investment firms .
After last year 's " unprecedented consolidation " in the banking industry , " bonus pools will actually go further this year , " according to the report .

When just a few days old , David Stevenson was abandoned outside a flat in London .
Forty - nine years later , he 's trying to piece together what happened on that fateful day in 1960 .
Taking a deep breath , David Stevenson felt like he was opening his life story and about to read the first page .
Inside the red - brick mansion building in front of him , in the winter sunshine , lay the clues to his true identity .
He imagined being carried through those front doors in his mother 's arms , 38 years before , then her leaving empty - handed , never to see her son again .
This was his first visit , in 1998 , to the flats in north London where he was abandoned as a newborn baby .

Retracing his mother 's steps , he waited for someone to leave so he could slip in the front door and make his way up two flights of stairs to the second floor .
Outside Flat 39 , he looked at the spot where someone - he believes his mother - placed him on the cold , concrete floor .
If it was her , it was the last time they were ever together .
" My story starts at that point .
Everything I know about my life since then starts there .
" I was trying to imagine a young woman carrying a baby walking through the doors and leaving a baby on the floor in the corridor .
" I 've been back a few times since and there 's still an emotion associated with going there because that 's the first location I can identify of me being somewhere .
It 's very poignant - there 's a ghost there somewhere . "
At 5 pm on 15 December 1960 , the police station in Golders Green received a phone call to say a newborn baby had been left abandoned in West Heath Court .
As one of the few female officers , Wpc Tegwen Curl was sent to the scene , where she saw a crowd of residents in the corridor around the baby , which was still on the floor outside Flat 39 .
" My overwhelming feeling is that I was left in that particular block of flats on that particular floor for a reason and there 's a connection with someone who had lived there at the time . "
When he got his adoption papers in the late 1990s , he visited the flats where he was left and looked at old newspapers to see what was reported at the time .
He was stunned to find he and President John F Kennedy had together made the front page of the Daily Mail , who nicknamed him the " rainbow baby " because of the coloured clothes he was found wearing .
" There had always been an itch to scratch .
But what sparked my interest was having children of my own .
Holding my baby son in my arms for the first time was a realisation that this was the first blood relative I had ever met . "
Attempts to find his parents were half - hearted and he had no idea how he would go about it , until his partner Julie Howell spurred him into action a year ago .
Emotional reunion
The software product manager , who lives in Watford and has three sons , began investigating who had lived in those flats at the time .
He immediately ruled out the elderly widow in Flat 39 and presumed he had been moved there by someone else in the corridor .
David ( front ) was adopted and had a happy childhood David and Julie tracked down the officer who found him , Mrs Curl , and the two had an emotional reunion .
They have since become very close , she like a mother figure to him .
She is Welsh and had named him David after her father and brother , and drew inspiration for his middle name , Charles , from a colleague called Charlie .
A magistrate gave David the surname Archer , saying a name beginning with " A " would give him a good start in life .
Archer was replaced by Stevenson when David was later adopted .
Mrs Curl told him it had immediately struck her as odd that the baby had not been gathered up in someone 's arms .
" There 's something suspicious , " he says .
" It 's almost as though the baby was somewhere else and for the purpose of calling the police the baby was put back on the floor again .
My extremities were cold so I had been there for a while , on a cold floor . "
The nephew of one couple who lived in Flat 36 came to the UK and took a DNA test to see if it matched David 's but it was negative , so he was ruled out as a relative .
The focus for David and Julie 's investigation is now on a man called Richard Hamer , who lived on that second floor at the time .
WHO IS RICHARD HAMER ?
Born in 1898 in Shropshire , grew up in Rhayader , Mid Wales Still in Rhayader in 1911 Records show he was in West Heath Court , Golders Green , in 1937 No records found for 1911 to 1937 Film booker for Odeon Cinemas during the 1940s Marries Janet Cram in 1945 Moved to Brighton in 1956 , but keeps London flat Wife dies in 1964 and Hamer remarries two years later
He died in 1978 David would like to speak to anyone related to Mr Hamer , who died in 1978 .
There are many unanswered questions that push him forward in trying to piece together the events of that day , but he has his theories about what happened .
" What drives me forward with this search is trying to discover the truth and the circumstances that led me to be left there .
" Why did it happen ?
Did a young woman in her teens get pregnant ?
The social mores at the time looked down on unmarried mothers .
" Was she in desperate straits or was she a bit older and possibly even married and had an extramarital affair ?
One can imagine all sorts of possibilities . "
David says he was relieved to find the block was not shabby A doctor who examined the baby David soon after he was discovered estimated he was about four days old , and his new birth certificate put his birthday as 10 December , which is the date David accepts and celebrates .
" Those details I 'm quite likely never to know unless my birth mother was to come forward and reveal all .
A lot of people take these things for granted but I can't . "
Many other people can empathise with David , as there are dozens of babies that are abandoned in the UK each year , and what happens to them is an issue covered by the Magazine in the past .
David says he has no anger towards his mother , accepting that she acted in a way she felt she had to .
His adopted parents fully support his quest and are excited by it , and he hopes more details will emerge as he widens his search .
" I do feel a bit incomplete .
It 's part of my identity and part of my children 's identity .
Doing this story is about pursuing information for them , as well as for me . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
Keep up the search , David .
I was born in the same year as you and adopted at 10 days old .
I met my biological parents at age 35 , pushed by a then girlfriend who wanted to know more about my health history for marriage .
It was a sense of completion and context meeting them ; you 'll see genetic traits that amaze and implicitly explain numerous characteristics ( nature mixed with nurture ) .
I 've not kept in touch with my biological parents , as the wounds between them ( especially my mother ) seemed still too deep for them .
However , despite this emotional mix the journey was well worth it for me .
John Ames , Vancouver , Canada David , I want to wish you the very best of luck in finding your birth mother and birth family and hope for you that one day you will all be able to give each other a big hug and feel at peace that you know where your life began .
When I was younger , my mother got pregnant by a man she was having a relationship with .
Unfortunately he was n't interested and as she already had four children and as a deserted wife she felt no choice but to give the baby up for adoption .
I looked after Mum and her new baby in the hospital .
No - one else knew and the other children were too small to understand .
About a week later , the people from the adoption agency came to the hospital .
We waited in the car park and I had to hand him over to the adoption agency as my Mum was too distressed to do this .
There 's not a week goes by when I do n't think about him ( he is 19 now ) and hope and dream of the day when he finds me .
I know I will know him - and then I can give him a big hug too .
Nicole , Portsmouth , Hampshire I was abandoned in a train toilet at Paddington station July 1943 .
I only found out I was adopted after my last surviving family member died in 2005 .
I was then aged 62 .
I cannot or do not want to start searching for my " blood parents " - I am surrounded by a loving family and that 's enough .
Can you imagine the scene if I suddenly found my real mother after all these years , I think it would be a real catastrophe for all .
Please accept what you have already got and leave that skeleton in the cupboard .

I have an adopted daughter and I try to explain to her how much she must have been loved by her biological mother to put her up for adoption .
She knew she would not be able to take care of her as a teen mother and it is sometimes more loving to give your child up than other options ...
Perhaps this mother was in a similar situation and perhaps her love for her child and her child 's well - being allowed her to leave him that day , knowing he would be found and taken care of .
Abby Murray , West Harrison , NY
Why would you do this ?
You are looking for a stranger who has no knowledge of your life and who may very well not even want to know you .
Blood is not necessarily thicker than water .
Why not just enjoy the company of people who do know and care for you ?
Gareth Gouldstone , UK I was adopted in 1948 after being given up at birth by my mother .
When my adopted parents had passed away I set about tracing my birth mother .
But she will not acknowledge me at all despite many letters , photographs etc .
She in fact denies she ever had me .
I have however traced her brothers ' children ( my cousins ) and have been made welcome .
Please accept that your search may also end like mine in disappointment .
I accept she is not going to change her mind and that not only will I not get to know her , but will never know who my father was .
This longing to know does not go away but sometimes you just have to give up .
Carolyn Davies , Holsworthy , Devon Being adopted myself as a baby , I can understand David 's feelings about not knowing his full identity .
I was lucky enough in later years to trace my natural parents , which led to greater self understanding and ' wholeness ' .
Unless you are in this situation it is difficult to appreciate fully the importance of one 's genetic and familial history .
I wish him good luck in tracing his roots , and hope this feature helps him .
Alan Stacey , Brighton I was abandoned by my mother at one month of age and found her 26 years later and my father a decade after that .
It has resolved no issues in me .
The loss at the abandonment is the only issue that matters and one that cannot ever be reconciled , not through reunion , counselling , nor medication .
Only accepting that one is " different " and embracing one 's self and one 's life , however depressing and empty , can lead to some sense of oneness .
There is no light at the end of the tunnel for abandoned babies ; the damage is done at the doorstep .
We just have to trudge on through life making the best of a terrible circumstance .
Finding out the truth is a waste of time because like ex-girlfriends , those folks who 've abandoned you made themselves strangers , and can offer you nothing .
James , San Francisco , US I wish David luck and hope he can find some information about his birth family .
My mum does not know who her father is , and her mother now has Alzheimer 's , and she has had to come to terms that she will probably never know .
I had a loving , adoring father , and can not even imagine how it would feel to have one or both parents a mystery .
I am not sure our liberal world is improved on the prudish past , ( multiple step - fathers ! ) but it has to help that mothers are not stigmatised in such a way that caused all this heartache for the past generations .
Best of luck David , but hold your little one a little closer and rejoice in his life .
Ruth Dearing , Beaconsfield , UK I can completely empathise with David .
I am an adopted child , and as I am now a couple of years short of seventy , I am resigned to never knowing the truth .
There are people still alive who know the truth surrounding my birth but they can not be persuaded to tell me .
I found my birth mother many years ago and she took the information to her grave .
Maybe it might be better to not know !
I also felt no anger towards her I just wanted the truth but never got it .
Like David there is an important part of my life missing .
I wish David good luck in his search .
Anjana - Victoria Waring , Poole , Dorset , England Don't give up David , keep looking , keep going by instinct also .
My late mother in law was fostered out at a young age she knew no one , after she died I tried looking for her relatives for our family tree , my first stumbling block was Hampshire county council , gave us a birth certificate with all the wrong names on it .
We searched for years for someone that did not exist .
Curiosity about the place that my mother in law was born in ( ie workhouse ) made me enquire about the people there at that time , it evolved that the master of the workhouse had registered her , and that was how the names got mixed up .
Since this time , I have found six brothers and sisters , and families .
I just wished she had known about them all before she died .
Carol Frost , Tamworth , Staffs
You are not alone mate .
I never saw my biological father but have heard of people related to him but I can not go looking for relatives who never sought me .
You might find grief instead of solace in your quest .
My belief is some things are best left as alone .
Lastchando , Salford I can only imagine the pain that this man has endured in his life - but having watched a programme on similar incidents - babies are abandoned in two ways - those who are found by pure chance & run the risk of not being found in time & those babies who are left in a place where they are sure to be found therefore guaranteeing them a better life - so perhaps being in the latter category hopefully could provide some comfort to this gentleman .
Christine Gowing , Lancaster
What a sad , desolate and cruel beginning for a human being - to be left abandoned and cold on a cold floor when only a few days old .
Yet , what a triumph for the human spirit by way of the police officer , the magistrate , the adoptive parents , and now , David and his own family that he has chosen to stay with and nurture despite the circumstances of his birth .
I wish David inner peace and can certainly understand his quest for the truth .
However , I also wonder if he might not be better off focusing on the people who have invested in him rather than expending energy on those who discarded him .

Editor 's note : Ron Paul is an 11 - term Republican U.S. representative from Texas who made a bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2008 .
His book , " End the Fed , " was recently published by Grand Central Publishing .
Washington , D.C. ( CNN ) --
A growing number of Americans are becoming aware of the Federal Reserve System , what it is , how it has precipitated our financial crisis , and how it continues to pursue policies that delay economic recovery and weaken the dollar .
The Fed 's actions , combined with the federal government 's bailout bills and stimulus packages , have struck a nerve in the American people .
Recent polls have shown that more than 75 percent of Americans support efforts to audit the Fed , something which my bill , HR 1207 , the Federal Reserve Transparency Act , aims to do .
HR 1207 has the support of 304 members of Congress , and the Senate version of the bill , S. 604 , is supported by 31 U.S. senators .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has embarked on an ambitious program of monetary expansion , more than doubling the monetary base to almost $ 1.9 trillion and doubling the size of its balance sheet to over $ 2 trillion , placing the American economy in a precarious position .
If all this excess money begins to be loaned out , the Fed risks creating a hyperinflationary crisis similar to 1920s Germany .
If the Fed contracts this money , it risks harming the banks it desperately wants to see bailed out .
It is imperative that the American people know what the Fed is up to , how much money it loans to banks and what types of agreements it enters into with foreign banks and governments .
Just about all of this information is exempt from audit or oversight .
The Fed 's actions directly affect the value of the dollar , which is coming under increasing pressure from our foreign creditors .
If we do not wish to see a complete collapse of the dollar , the Fed needs to be subject to a strict audit of its actions , if not an outright abolition of its charter .
While I would like nothing more than to see the Federal Reserve abolished , it is not absolutely necessary to do so with direct legislation .
The Fed 's influence comes about because of its monopolization of the creation of money .
If we could abolish the government monopoly on the creation of money , the Federal Reserve would be forced to clean up its act or go out of business .
Economists know that monopolies lead to reduced output and higher prices , a suboptimal allocation of resources .
This applies as well to the market for circulating currency as it does to markets for any other good .
In the previous Congress I introduced legislation that would eliminate the three major barriers to competition in currency and break the Fed 's stranglehold on money .
The first barrier : Legal tender laws , which Congress does not have the Constitutional authority to enact .
Historically , legal tender laws have been used by governments to force their citizens to accept debased and devalued currency .
Gresham 's
Law describes this phenomenon , which can be summed up in one phrase : Bad money drives out good money .
In the absence of legal tender laws , Gresham 's Law no longer holds .
If people are free to reject debased currency , and instead demand sound money , sound money will gradually return to use in society .
The second barrier : laws that prohibit the operation of private mints .
Certain sections of U.S. code classified as anti-counterfeiting statutes were in fact intended to shut down private mints that had been operating in California .
There is no reason to ban private companies from minting gold and silver coins to compete with the dollar .
All currencies are based on trust , trust that the issuing authority will not debase the currency .
If it becomes known that the issuer of a particular currency is minting underweight coins , people will stop accepting that currency and that company will go out of business .
If someone else attempts to counterfeit that currency and pass those coins , there are sufficient counterfeiting laws on the books to prosecute those counterfeiters .
Merchants and individuals are free to choose which currencies they accept , and in the absence of legal tender laws I believe that alternative currencies will gain more traction .
Stores today can accept whatever currency they like .
In Washington , DC a few years ago , some stores began accepting euros from international tourists .
Harrod 's in London accepts pounds , euros , and dollars .
There is no legal requirement in the United States for a store to accept dollars for non -debt transactions .
If you walk into a 7 - 11 to buy a soda , the clerk does n't have to accept your dollars , he could demand euros , silver , or copper .
But because legal tender laws backing the dollar have caused the dollar to drive other currencies out of circulation , it is easier for stores to accept dollars .
However , most stores also accept credit cards , personal checks , and debit cards , none of which are legal tender .
Some stores are moving to credit card - only transactions to minimize costs , which they are allowed to do .
Under a system of competing currencies , it would be to the advantage of stores to accept as many currencies as they could , in order to attract a wide range of customers .
Stores that only accepted one currency would see their customer base shrink .
The use of credit cards could simplify things just as it does today when Americans travel to Europe .
They pay in euros with their credit card , and their card company bills in dollars .
The market will find a solution to any problems that might arise .
The final barrier to competing currencies : Laws that assess capital gains and sales taxes on gold and silver coins .
Under federal law , coins are considered collectibles , and are liable for capital gains taxes .
These taxes actually tax monetary debasement .
The purchasing power of gold may remain relatively constant , but as the nominal dollar value increases because of a weak dollar , the federal government considers this an increase in wealth and assesses taxes .
Thus , the more the dollar is debased , the more capital gains taxes must be paid on holdings of gold and other precious metals .
For individuals who may wish to use gold and silver in everyday transactions , this can quickly become a complicated and costly burden .
The long - term strength of the dollar will only be weakened by maintaining the Fed 's monopoly on our monetary system .
Our foreign creditors are already moving to dethrone the dollar as the world 's currency .
The prospect of American citizens also turning away from the dollar toward alternate currencies should provide an impetus to the U.S. government to regain control of the dollar and halt its downward spiral .
Restoring soundness to the dollar will remove the government 's ability and incentive to inflate the currency , and provide stability to the financial system .
With a sound currency , everyone is better off , not just those who control the monetary system .

Conscious that by its nature , it violates the most basic norms of international law and human rights , the empire ’s publicists and their local spokesmen have unleashed , as on so many other occasions , a persistent semantic battle aimed at confusing and misleading worldwide public opinion .
To this end they resort to a euphemism : they refer to the blockade as an “ embargo ” and present it as though it were merely a commercial matter .
This is how they hide the far reaching U.S. blockade against Cuba : a blockade that is economic , commercial , financial and technological , but also international ( penalizing as it does , companies in third countries who trade with Cuba , and hindering Cuba ’s diplomatic relations with the rest of the world ) ; informational ( by preventing Cubans from gaining access to high - speed broadband internet ) ; social ( making the re-unification of Cuban families separated by emigration difficult or impossible ) ; and cultural , by impeding the free movement of artists , writers , intellectuals and scientists between Cuba and the United States .
It is a blockade that is not only illegitimate in light of civilization ’s highest values but also a blatant infringement of international law , designed to bring Cuba to its knees by causing hunger , illness and desperation among its people .
In short : it is a repeat of the barbaric policy of laying siege to a defenseless city by causing all sorts of hardships and misfortunes to its inhabitants , in the hope of weakening their resistance or bringing about a generalized insurrection against its legitimate leaders .
If anything , it is a cruel and inhumane policy which the empire applies solely and exclusively against Cuba , updating its old and unhealthy obsession of wanting to take over that island , even at the cost of violating international law a thousand times and trampling on the highest ethical norms that define the civilized co-existence of people and nations .
There are no precedents in worldwide history even remotely comparable to the blockade against Cuba , maintained without interruption by the United States over 49 years .
Nothing even remotely similar has been applied by Washington against many countries which for one reason or another , have ( or used to have ) serious conflicts with the United States : it never blockaded the Soviet Union or China , for obvious reasons , but neither did it blockade Vietnam , nor Qaddafi ’s Libya ( not even after blaming Libya for the bombing of PanAm 103 over Lockerbie , killing 259 passengers in - flight , plus 11 on the ground ) nor North Korea , nor Iran , nor any other country .
Only Cuba , a sweet American colonial dream that became -- thanks to the glorious liberating campaign of the July 26th Movement -- a painful nightmare that day and night shakes the minds of the imperialists .
Blinded by its pathological ambition to take over the unredeemed island it considers its own , the United States is in breach of Resolution 63/7 , adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on October 29 , 2008 , when 185 member states voted in favor of the immediate lifting of the blockade .
It is not only the George W. Bush administration which has ignored the U.N. General Assembly ’s recommendation , but its successor as well -- the current Nobel Peace Prize winner no less , who has continued with the same policy of maintaining the laws , regulations and administrative procedures which serve to support the blockade .
Limiting travel to the Caribbean island is rooted in Cold War policies that have been overtaken by world events .
Since 1989 , the Berlin Wall has fallen and the Soviet Union has disintegrated .
China has morphed into a capitalist powerhouse .
Whatever geopolitical value Cuba had during the Cold War -- a line in the sand against the communist takeover of vulnerable Caribbean nations and Latin America , as the famous " falling dominoes " scenario of the era would have it -- has long since faded .
... In New Jersey , Sen. Robert Menendez and Rep. Albio Sires , both Democrats , have opposed any change in policy .
In Florida , Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and former senator Mel Martinez , among others , also have resisted a new tack in the U.S. - Cuba relationship , going so far as to denounce the Organization of American States for laying the groundwork for Cuba ’s re-entry into the OAS earlier this year .
But the older generation of Cubans who regard opposition to Castro as a badge of honor and a litmus test for U.S. politicians no longer dominates the dialogue .
In March , a University of Miami survey in Miami - Dade County found a slight majority wants to continue travel restrictions ; younger respondents were not supportive of the ban or other sanctions at all .
In the last presidential election , the economy , not Cuba , was the main issue for Miami - Dade voters , where 58 percent of the voters went for Obama .
In the spring , another poll showed Americans overwhelmingly want a new approach to Cuba , and a dozen retired U.S. senior military officials called on the White House to lift the ban as a means of promoting reforms .
They got it right .
The best way to help Cuba on its journey to a more open and democratic society is to allow Americans to travel there .
This weekend the mass media is beating the war drums for the inevitability of escalation in Afghanistan .
Soon Obama will see his effigies being reviled not just at rallies of crazed and confused teabaggers but by anti-war marchers all over the world .
Yes , the embodiment of Change and Hope , who most of the international community still sees as the much needed antidote to the horrors of Bushism , is on the verge of leaving his pedestal -- a pedestal that includes a premature , at best , Nobel Peace Prize -- as he oversees the further horrors of a catastrophic and indefensible war against the Afghan people .
Obama might as well get ready for the revilement and hatred headed his way by meditating on the widely expected -- and totally deserved -- condemnation from the UN General Assembly next week .
For the past 17 years the General Assembly has voted overwhelmingly to condemn the United States for its inhuman and unjustifiable blockade against Cuba .
Last year the margin was 185 - 3-- only the U.S. itself and 2 small client states voting no .
Instead of ending the blockade and normalizing relations with Cuba , Obama has taken a couple of inconsequential , symbolic baby steps in that direction while playing the same absurd games that previous administrations have played -- i.e. , change your society to be more like ours and we 'll drop the blockade .
The blockade was a disgrace under Reagan , a disgrace under both Bushes , a disgrace under Clinton and it's a disgrace under Obama .
Wednesday there 'll be a vote on the resolution calling for an end of the U.S. economic , commercial and financial blockade of the island nation .
The blockade went into effect in 1961 and has served no purpose except to perpetuate the illegitimate power of Cuban fascists associated with the Batista Regime -- like the Diaz - Balart family -- living in Florida .
The report assembled by the Secretary General of the UN lists some of the accomplishments of Obama 's blockade of Cuba : •
The embargo stops Cuba from obtaining diagnostic equipment or replacement parts for equipment used in the detection of breast , colon , and prostate cancer . •
The embargo stops Cuba from obtaining patented materials that are needed for pediatric cardiac surgery and the diagnosis of pediatric illnesses . •
The embargo prevents Cuba from purchasing antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV - AIDS from U.S. sources of the medication . •
The embargo stops Cuba from obtaining needed supplies for the diagnosis of Downs ' Syndrome . •
Under the embargo , Cuba cannot buy construction materials from the nearby U.S. market to assist in its hurricane recovery . •
While food sales are legal , regulatory impediments drive up the costs of commodities that Cuba wants to buy from U.S. suppliers , and forces them in many cases to turn to other more expensive and distant sources of nutrition for their people . •
Because our market is closed to their goods , Cuba cannot sell products like coffee , honey , tobacco , live lobsters and other items that would provide jobs and opportunities for average Cubans .
Most people see the problem as one of internal Cuban - American politics in Florida , but that is n't completely true , where reactionaries primarily -- though not exclusively -- inside the Republican Party and hysterically opposed to any normalization steps with Cuba .
But one of the worst impediments to normalization is n't a reactionary or a Republican or even a Floridian , but ( an otherwise ) progressive Democrat from New Jersey , Robert Menendez , who has taken it upon himself to block progress in the Senate .
Yesterday the biggest newspaper in his state , thedeclared unequivocally that it 's time to lift the travel ban .
Pointing out that " Castro 's rise was made possible by the corrupt , U.S. mob-controlled government of his predecessor , Fulgencio Batista , " the editorial board makes it clear that the bill coursing its way through the Senate should be passed .
The Senate 's Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act , S.428 , was introduced by Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) and has 32 co-sponsors , across the ideological spectrum , from progressive stalwarts like Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) and Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) to the dregs of reactionary knee - jerk obstructionism , like Mike Enzi and John Barrasso of Wyoming , Mike Crapo ( R - ID ) and a pack of the worst conservative Democrats like Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mary Landrieu ( LA ) .
The identical House version of the bill , H.R.874 , was introduced by Bill Delahunt ( D - MA ) and now has 179 co-sponsors , also from across the ideological spectrum , from the best progressives like Donna Edwards ( D - MD ) , Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , Barbara Lee ( D - CA ) and John Conyers ( D - MI ) to a pack of mangy right - wing Blue Dogs such as Gene Taylor ( Blue Dog - MS ) , Collin Peterson ( Blue Dog - MN ) , Mike Ross ( Blue Dog - AR ) and Walt Minnick ( Blue Dog - ID ) and a handful of GOP obstructionists whose agricultural districts will benefit economically from normalization -- Cynthia Lummis ( R - WY ) , Jeff Flake ( R - AZ ) , John Boozman ( R - AR ) and Jason Chaffetz ( R - UT ) .
Last Wednesday ' scame out with an even stronger endorsement of lifting the travel ban than thedid .
And theirs is largely based on new polling that shows a gigantic swing in public opinion towards lifting the travel ban -- including a swing among Cuban - Americans .
Bendixen & Associates executive VP Fernand Amandi said " he was surprised by the magnitude of the swing in just seven years -- from 46 percent in favor in 2002 to 59 percent in the Sept. 24 - 26 survey .
Only 29 percent were opposed in the new survey , compared to 47 percent in 2002 .
' The significant thing is how quickly they have moved in a short period of time , ' Amandi said , adding that the shift took place across all age groups , from older exiles to more recent arrivals ...
This removes the final fig leaf for why the time has not come to change policy -- that Cuban Americans were opposed .
" The 3 neo - fascist Cuban - Americans in Congress from Miami -Dade , Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , Mario Diaz - Balart and Lincoln Diaz - Balart ( who fancies himself the next president of Cuba and whose father was in charge of torture for the Batista Regime ) , along with New Jersey 's Menendez , are willing to fight this even if it means extinguishing their political careers .
The Diaz - Balarts and Ros-Lehtinen have lost any perception of power they once had but Menendez , head of the DSCC , has said he will filibuster the bill .
There are probably enough clueless Republican cold warriors to prevent a successful cloture .
That will put progress in Cuban - American affairs back into Obama 's hands -- and his hands , the administration will point out , are already full with too many pressing matters .
Menendez ' office number is 202-224-4744 .

Earlier I posted the video of a segment broadcast this morning on CBS The Early Show , in which the network decided to censor footage of Adam Lambert kissing a male keyboardist during the AMAs and then showed the Madonna - Britney kiss moments later , appearing to prove Lambert 's accusations that there is a double - standard in media when it comes to gay male imagery .
CBS has responded with a really lame excuse :
" We gave this some real thought .
The Madonna image is very familiar and has appeared countless times , including many times on morning television .
The Adam Lambert image is a subject of great current controversy , has not been nearly as widely disseminated and , for all we know , may still lead to legal consequences . "
I hate Ferris Bueller 's Day Off .
There , I said it .
And The Last Days of Disco .
A piece in Slate , in which the author admits to hating The Hungry Caterpillar , has given us the courage to come out :
When you 're a teenager , it 's de rigueur to be pointlessly contrarian , slaughtering sacred cows and bursting the bubble of people 's complacency .
You loudly and publicly decry Life is Beautiful or Nine Inch Nails or Magic Realism or whatever feels most outre at the moment .
You get over this .

There are , of course , people who do n't , who never lose the idea that not liking stuff makes you smarter , and that criticizing things near to people 's hearts does n't make you an asshole , but rather a truth - teller .
For most of us , tearing down the stuff people love loses its charms .
One derives no pleasure from telling one 's nonogenarian grandfather that the book he loved was derivative drivel or the friend who loves Harold and Maude that you find it completely unwatchable except the score , which is admittedly really good .
As Morrissey would have it , it 's so easy to laugh , it 's so easy to hate , and there 's no justifying the things you like .
When that liking is backed up by a chorus of critics and line - quoting fans and theme - parties , well , there 's just no point .
And so we hold our tongues .
And the walls rise around us , hemming us in with assumptions and collective cultural love until we can no longer take it .
Daniel B. Smith came to this point after having to read Eric Carle 's iconic picture - book to his two - year - old daughter with mind - numbing regularity .
I can't share Smith 's passion about The Very Hungry Caterpillar - these things tend to be idiosyncratic , hence the fear of speaking out - but I have betes noires of my own .

Like I said , Ferris Bueller .
I loathe it .
I find it humorless and charmless and people intoning " Bueller " is for me tantamount to nails on a chalkboard .
Or Whit Stillman 's movies , which have always struck me as the cinematic equivalent of the mixology trend .
While we 're at it ?
M.F.K.
Fisher , who , while a good stylist , conveys a palpable chill that 's always put me off .
There , I said it !
I do n't like The Gastronomical Me with its icy narcissism , lack of discernible appetite and stony - faced infidelities !
When I posed the question of private sacred - cow slaughterhouses to the rest of the editorial board ( or equivalent ) the response was overwhelming , ranging from The Godfather , James Joyce , Breakfast at Tiffany's , Elvis Presley , Hemingway , Fitzgerald , jazz , The Sound of Music , Margaret Atwood , The Lord of the Rings , SNL , Tina Fey 's Sarah Palin impression on SNL , Wuthering Heights , The Rolling Stones , Where the Wild Things Are , Manhattan , and , um " custard squares " ( which is apparently a major deal in New Zealand . )

Of all these things , I will quote Smith when he says " I recognize that this viewpoint would appear to be contradicted by ample evidence . "
But that is the point .
Are they in fact " good ? "
Are you wrong , or just the one declaring that the emperor is naked ?
After all , going along with things , as human history tells us , can be dangerous .
On the other hand , college freshmen calling Jane Austen " bourgeois " or saying that Fleetwood Mac was better before Buckingham - Nicks even though they 've never listened to Tusk ,

The Very Grouchy Daddy [ Slate ]
WASHINGTON — On paper , Representative Alan Grayson , a freshman Democrat from Florida , seems a bit stiff : degrees from Harvard and Harvard Law ; a résumé that includes clerking for the United States Court of Appeals under Judges Antonin Scalia , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Robert Bork ; an advocate for the aging .
But in recent weeks , Mr. Grayson has catapulted himself to national renown for outlandish rhetoric and a pugilistic political style that makes him seem less staid lawmaker than a character on the lam from one of his Orlando district ’s theme parks .
First it was his comment , “ If you get sick , America , the Republicans ’ health care plan is this : Die quickly . ”
Then , appearing on MSNBC , he said of former Vice President Dick Cheney : “ I have trouble listening to what he says sometimes because of the blood that drips from his teeth while he ’s talking . ”
Finally , a radio interview surfaced in which he had called a female adviser to the Federal Reserve chairman “ a K Street whore ”  a reference to her former job as a Washington lobbyist .
That one forced him to make a formal apology .
Mr. Grayson could be the latest incarnation of what in the American political idiom is known as a wing nut  a loud darling of cable television and talk radio whose remarks are outrageous but often serious enough not to be dismissed entirely .
Mr. Grayson is the more notable because he hurls his nuts from the left in a winger world long associated with the right .

The question in my title is one that is often raised by Haskell programmers and it's a difficult one to answer rigorously and satisfyingly .
But you may notice that I 've put the question in quotes .
This is because I 'm not asking the question myself .
Instead I want to argue that often there 's a better question to ask .
Superficially Haskell looks a lot like category theory .
We have types that look like objects and functions that look like arrows .
Given two functions we can compose them just how arrows compose in a category .
We also have things that look like products , coproducts , other kinds of limit including infinite ones , natural transformations , Kan extensions , monads and quite a bit of 2 - categorical structure
So what goes wrong ?
( Besides the obvious problem that on a real computer , composing two working functions might result in a non-working function because you run out of memory . )
Among other things , Haskell functions can fail to terminate because of things like infinite loops .
Computer scientists often use the notation ⊥ to represent a non-terminating computation .
So when we talk of the Haskell integers , say , we do n't just mean the values 0 , 1 , 2 , ... but we also have to include ⊥.
Unfortunately , when we do this we break a few things .
For one thing we no longer have coproducts .
But people find it useful to talk about algebraic datatypes as constructing types using products and coproducts and that would be a hard thing to give up .
So we could restrict ourselves to considering only the category theory of computable functions .
But that 's not a trivial thing to do either , and it does n't reflect what real Haskell programs do .
But even if we did manage to tweak this and that to get a bona fide category out of Haskell , all we'd get is a custom tailored category that serves just one purpose .
One theme running through much of my blog is that Haskell can be used to gain an understanding of a nice chunk of elementary category theory in general .
Showing that Haskell simply gives us one example of a category really is n't that interesting .
When I talked about the Yoneda Lemma I felt like I was talking about more than just one property of some obscure category that I can't actually define and that most category theorists have never even heard of .
So what 's going on ?
Why does it feel like Haskell is so naturally category theoretical while the details are so messy ?
Going back to my Yoneda lemma code , consider my definition of It 's straightforward to translate this into standard category theoretical notation that applies to any category .
Even though the code is implemented in a specific programming language there 's nothing about it that prevents it being translated for use in any category .
So it does n't matter what category Haskell corresponds to .
What matters is that this bit of code is written in language suitable for any category .
And the proof I give can be similarly translated .
Consider this standard problem given to category theory students : prove that ( A×B ) ×C is isomorphic to A × ( B×C ) .
In Haskell we could construct the isomorphism as : But now we hit a problem .
We can straightforwardly translate this into mathematical notation and it will give a valid isomorphism in the category of sets , .
Butis written to accept arguments which are elements of some type .
Not all objects in categories have elements , and arrows might not correspond to functions .
And even if they did , if we were working with ( certain types of ) topological spaces we'd be giving a construction for the isomorphism , and our proof would show the underlying function had an inverse , but we'd be failing to show it 's continuous .
It looks like writing Haskell code like this only tells us about a particularly limited type of category .
But not so .
Typeto install pointfree and then runand it responds withpointfree rewrites a function in point - free style .
There are no x's , y's or z's in the written version , only , composition , and the product function .
These exist in all Cartesian closed categories ( CCC ) .
So our original function definition , despite apparently referring to elements , can be mechanically turned into a definition valid for any CCC .
We can now reinterpret the meaning of x , y and z in the original definition as not referring to elements at all , but as labels indicating how a bunch of fairly general categorically defined primitives are to be assembled together .
( Incidentally , my first foray into pure functional programming was to write a SASL compiler .
It was little more than a bunch of rewrite rules to convert SASL code into point - free compositions of S , K and I , among other combinators . )
What we have here is an example of an internal language at work .
I 'm not sure what a precise definition of " internal language " is , but it 's something like this : take a formal system and find a way to translate it to talk about categories in such a way that true propositions in one are turned into true propositions in the other .
The formal system now becomes an internal language for those categories .
The best known example is topos theory .
A topos is a category that has a bunch of properties that make it a bit like .
We take a subset of the language of set theory that makes use of just these properties .
Our propositions that look like set theory can now be mechanically translated into statements valid of all toposes .
This means we can happily write lots of arguments referring to elements of objects in a topos and get correct results .
In their book Introduction to Higher - Order Categorical Logic , Lambek and Scott showed that " pure typed λ- calculus " is the internal language of CCCs .
Even though expressions in the λ- calculus contain named variables these can always be eliminated and replaced by point - free forms .
Theorems about typed λ- calculus are actually theorems about CCCs .
When we write Haskell code with ' points ' in it , we do n't need to interpret these literally .
So despite not knowing which category Haskell lives in , much of the code I 've written in these web pages talks about a wide variety of categories because Haskell is essentially a programming language based on an internal language ( or a bunch of them ) .
Despite the fact that even a function likemight have quite complex semantics when run on a real computer , the uninterpreted programs themselves often represent completely rigorous , and quite general pieces of category theory .
So the question to ask is n't " what category does Haskell live in ? " but " what class of category corresponds to the internal language in which I wrote this bit of code ? " .
I partly answer this question for do - notation ( a little internal language of its own ) in an earlier post .
Haskell ( and various subsets and extensions ) is essentially a way to give semantics to internal languages for various classes of category .
However complicated and messy those semantics might get on a real world computer , the language itself is a thing of beauty and more general than might appear at first .
BTW
This trick of reinterpreting what look like variables as something else was used by Roger Penrose in his abstract index notation .
Just as we can sanitise variables by reinterpreting them as specification for plumbing in some category , Penrose reinterpreted what were originally indices into arrays of numbers as plumbing in another category .
Actually , this is n't just an analogy .
With a little reformatting abstract index notation is very close to the way I 've been using monads to work with vector spaces so that abstract index notation can be viewed as a special case of an internal language for categories with monads .

Making sense of everything may lead to a few late nights ( Image : Ira Block / National Geographic / Getty )
It ’s not your average confession show : a panel of leading physicists spilling the beans about what keeps them tossing and turning in the wee hours .
That was the scene a few days ago in front of a packed auditorium at the Perimeter Institute , in Waterloo , Canada , when a panel of physicists was asked to respond to a single question : “ What keeps you awake at night ? ”
The discussion was part of “ Quantum to Cosmos “ , a 10 - day physics extravaganza , which ends on Sunday .
Advertisement
While most panelists professed to sleep very soundly , here are seven key conundrums that emerged during the session , which can be viewed here .
Why this universe ?
In their pursuit of nature ’s fundamental laws , physicists have essentially been working under a long standing paradigm : demonstrating why the universe must be as we see it .
But if other laws can be thought of , why ca n’t the universes they describe exist in some other place ?
“ Maybe we ’ll find there ’s no other alternative to the universe we know , ” says Sean Carroll of Caltech .
“ But I suspect that ’s not right . ”
Carroll finds it easy to imagine that nature allows for different kinds of universes with different laws .
“ So in our universe , the question becomes why these laws and not some other laws ? ”
What is everything made of ?
It ’s now clear that ordinary matter – atoms , stars and galaxies – accounts for a paltry 4 per cent of the universe ’s total energy budget .
It ’s the other 96 per cent that keeps University of Michigan physicist Katherine Freese engaged .
Freese is excited that one part of the problem , the nature of dark matter , may be nearing resolution .
She points to new data from experiments like NASA ’s Fermi satellite that are consistent with the notion that dark matter particles in our own galaxy are annihilating with one another at a measurable rate , which in turn could reveal their properties .
But the discovery of dark energy , which appears to be speeding up the expansion of the universe , has created a vast new set of puzzles for which there are no immediate answers in sight .
This includes the nature of the dark energy itself and the question of why it has a value that is so extraordinarily small , allowing for the formation of galaxies , stars and the emergence of life .
How does complexity happen ?
From the unpredictable behaviour of financial markets to the rise of life from inert matter , Leo Kadananoff , physicist and applied mathematician at the University of Chicago , finds the most engaging questions deal with the rise of complex systems .
Kadanoff worries that particle physicists and cosmologists are missing an important trick if they only focus on the very small and the very large .
“ We still do n’t know how ordinary window glass works and keeps it shape , ” says Kadanoff .
“ The investigation of familiar things is just as important in the search for understanding . ”
Life itself , he says , will only be truly understood by decoding how simple constituents with simple interactions can lead to complex phenomena .
Will string theory ever be proved correct ?
Cambridge physicist David Tong is passionate about the mathematical beauty of string theory – the idea that the fundamental particles we observe are not point - like dots , but rather tiny strings .
But he admits it once brought him to a philosophical crisis when he realised he might live his entire life not knowing whether it actually constitutes a description of all reality .
Even experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider and the Planck satellite , while well positioned to reveal new physics , are unlikely to say anything definitive about strings .
Tong finds solace in knowing that the methods of string theory can be brought to bear on less fundamental problems , such as the behaviour of quarks and exotic metals .
“ It is a useful theory , ” he says , “ so I ’m trying to concentrate on that . ”
What is the singularity ?
For cosmologist and Perimeter Institute director Neil Turok , the biggest mystery is the one that started it all , the big bang .
Conventional theory points back to an infinitely hot and dense state at the beginning of the universe , where the known laws of physics break down .
“ We do n’t know how to describe it , ” says Turok .
“ How can anyone claim to have a theory of everything without that ? ”
Turok is hopeful that string theory and a related development known as the “ holographic principle “ , which shows that a singularity in three dimensions can be translated into a mathematically more manageable entity in two dimensions ( which may imply that the third dimension and gravity itself are illusory ) .
“ These tools are giving us new ways of thinking about the problem , which are deeply satisfying in a mathematical sense , ” he says .
What is reality really ?
The material world may , at some level , lie beyond comprehension , but Anton Zeilinger , professor of physics at the University of Vienna , is profoundly hopeful that physicists have merely scratched the surface of something much bigger .
Zeilinger specialises in quantum experiments that demonstrate the apparent influence of observers in the shaping of reality .
“ Maybe the real breakthrough will come when we start to realise the connections between reality , knowledge and our actions , ” he says .
The concept is mind - bending , but it is well established in practice .
Zeilinger and others have shown that particles that are widely separated can somehow have quantum states that are linked , so that observing one affects the outcome of the other .
No one has yet fathomed how the universe seems to know when it is being watched .
How far can physics take us ?
Perhaps the biggest question of all is whether the process of inquiry that has revealed so much about the universe since the time of Galileo and Kepler is nearing the end of the line .
“ I worry whether we ’ve come to the limits of empirical science , ” says Lawrence Krauss of Arizona State University .
Specifically , Krauss wonders if it will require knowledge of other universes , such as those posed by Carroll , to understand why our universe is the way it is .
If such knowledge is impossible to access , it may spell the end for deepening our understanding any further .
Turok says that ’s exactly why the Perimeter Institute exists , to harness the thinking of the world ’s brightest young minds in an unrestrained environment .
By optimising conditions for creative thinking , it may be possible to avoid such an impasse .
“ We ’re used to thinking of theoretical physics as accidental , ” says Turok .
“ We need to ask whether there ’s a more strategic way to speed up understanding and discovery . ”
Perhaps then all those troubled physicists can finally get some rest – or at least switch to more mundane worries .

Quite why the Heene family of Colorado thought pretending to lose their son in the basket of an airborne helium balloon was a good idea is unclear .
But as they contemplate possible criminal records for conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor , they can at least take comfort in the fact that they have distinguished company when it comes to balloon hoaxes .
On 13 April 1844 , the New York Sun published a breathless account of a great step for mankind : " The air , as well as the earth and the ocean , has been subdued by science , and will become a common and convenient highway for mankind . . .
The Atlantic has been actually crossed in a balloon . . . and in the inconceivably brief period of 75 hours from shore to shore ! "
In a precursor of the reality shows to which the Heenes apparently aspired , the Sun ran excerpts from the faked diary of the Victoria 's navigators , which ended just after their " sighting " off the coast of South Carolina .
( In reality , the Atlantic would not be crossed by a balloon until 75 years later , when the rather less romantically named British dirigible R - 34 landed in New York City after an 108 - hour flight . )
The account was cooked up by Edgar Allan Poe , a hoax - lover in an age of hoax - lovers ; he perpetrated five others .
Poe seems to have rather enjoyed the fuss : " On the morning ( Saturday ) of its announcement , " he later wrote in the Columbia Spy , " the whole square surrounding the Sun building was literally besieged , blocked up from a period soon after sunrise until about two o'clock PM . . .
I never witnessed more intense excitement to get possession of a newspaper .
. .
I tried , in vain , during the whole day , to get possession of a copy . "
But the excitement was not allowed to get out of hand .
Two days later , the Sun printed a retraction : " BALLOON – The mails from the South last Saturday night not having brought a confirmation of the arrival of the Balloon from England . . . we are inclined to believe that the intelligence is erroneous . "
And so the first great media balloon hoax was punctured .
Poe had created the report by supposedly " copying verbatim from the joint diary of Mr Monck Mason and Mr Harrison Ainsworth " , also crediting them for " much verbal information respecting the balloon itself , its construction , and other matters of interest . . . "
Extract from the diary
New York Sun , Saturday , 6 April 1844
We commenced the inflation this morning at daybreak ; but owing to a thick fog , which encumbered the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable , we did not get through before nearly 11 o'clock .
At half - past 11 , still proceeding nearly south , we obtained our first view of the Bristol Channel ; and , in 15 minutes afterward , the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately beneath us , and we were fairly out at sea .
We were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw , and we put them both into requisition forthwith , for the purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward , and in a line for Paris .
By means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction . . .
Upon this we gave nine hearty cheers , and dropped in the sea a bottle , enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the principle of the invention .
Hardly had we done with our rejoicings , when an unforeseen accident occurred which discouraged us in no little degree .
The steel rod connecting the spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place , and in an instant hung dangling out of reach .
While we were endeavoring to regain it , we became involved in a strong current of wind from the East , which bore us , with rapidly increasing force , towards the Atlantic .
We soon found ourselves driving out to sea at the rate of not less , certainly , than 50 or 60 miles an hour , so that we came up with Cape Clear , at some 40 miles to our North , before we had secured the rod . . .
It was now that Mr Ainsworth made an extraordinary , but to my fancy , a by no means unreasonable or chimerical proposition – that we should take advantage of the strong gale which bore us on , and in place of beating back to Paris , make an attempt to reach the coast of North America .
In what looks to be a central line of attack in the quest to re-balance the global economy , the Treasury Department has ratcheted up the rhetoric against China ’s currency peg .
The Treasury ’s semiannual report to Congress slammed the Chinese for their lack of exchange rate ‘ flexibility , ’ but stopped well short of accusing the Chinese of currency ‘ manipulation ’ as Tim Geithner had claimed during his confirmation hearings before Congress .
Bloomberg reports :
“ Both the rigidity of the renminbi and the reacceleration of reserve accumulation are serious concerns which should be corrected to help ensure a stronger , more balanced global economy consistent with the G - 20 framework , ” the report said .
“ The Treasury remains of the view that the renminbi is undervalued . ”
China ’s foreign - exchange reserves , the world ’s biggest , surged in the third quarter as an economic recovery attracted speculative capital and a weak dollar boosted valuations of its yen and euro assets .
Record Reserves
The holdings climbed about $ 141 billion to a record $ 2.273 trillion , the People ’s Bank of China said this week .
That was less than the unprecedented $ 178 billion gain in the second quarter .
The Obama administration wants China to “ pursue policies that permit greater flexibility of the exchange rate and lead to more sustainable and balanced economic growth , ” the report said .
The U.S. will continue to push China to allow the yuan to appreciate in two - way meetings and through meetings of officials from the Group of 20 nations .
People ’s Bank of China officials have called this year for an alternative to the dollar as a global reserve currency .
At the same time , the issue has n’t been a central point of debate at recent international summits like a meeting of Group of 20 leaders in Pittsburgh last month .
If Treasury is looking to burnish its populist credentials , making these statements to Congress where protectionist and populist sentiment is running high is certainly the place to do it .
The question is : what ’s your endgame ?
Right now the US dollar is looking weak despite Mr. Geithner ’s advocacy for a stronger dollar .
If you ask China for more exchange rate flexibility , you clearly are not serious about a strong dollar – and everybody knows it .
Here ’s how I see things playing out :
Congress looks at this report and concurs that the key to ending slower global growth is to correct global imbalances via a Chinese currency revaluation .
Fair enough .
However , individual Congressmen , looking to reassure jobless constituents ahead of the midterm elections , will escalate by presenting bills to ‘ punish ’ China if no actions are taken .
China will be aghast at this and , in a further escalation , start making noises about ditching the dollar .
At this point , the question is how does this get resolved .
To date , bilateral U.S. - Chinese economic tensions have escalated and led to protectionism .
Further escalation will yield unpredictable results and will be destabilizing .
Chinese officials cannot be seen by their domestic constituency caving to American pressure .
This would undermine their authority and create problems domestically .
Therefore , a public frontal assault on the renminbi peg is likely to backfire .
Like Stephen Roach , I see protectionism as the largest threat to global recovery .
Let ’s hope the Administration is aware of the dangers .
Nine new polls as the elections loom a week away :
I know I mentioned this last week , but the New Jersey graph looks almost identical to the 2008 Minnesota Senate Election and the addition of a Daggett ( I ) trendline to the New Jersey Graph below solidifies my point :
Christie's ( R ) decline seems to be linearly associated with Daggett 's surge while Corzine 's ( D ) support has remained consistent .
The most recent sample points do however illustrate a departure from this correlation ; Dagget 's and Christie 's numbers have declined in the last week while Corzine 's have increased .
Christie 's earlier support seems to have migrated to Daggett , and now that Corzine is back in the race , some Daggett voters are shifting to their second choice , Corzine .
In the next week I expect a minor Christie resurgence , and a solidification of Daggett 's support around the 15 % threshold .
I expect both major party candidates to head into next Tuesday 's election hovering around the 40 % mark .
Virginia is another story , Deeds ( D ) has all but lost :
Deeds was dominated in the money race , and had perception issues during the debates ; the last of which occurred on Tuesday , October 20th :
Deeds and McDonnell were generally polite , although they interrupted each other several times in a series of feisty exchanges made possible by an open - ended format .
When the moderator asked Deeds which taxes he would support increasing , McDonnell tried to jump in : " I can answer that ! "
" No , you can't ! "
Deeds responded , glaring at McDonnell before saying that he would consider raising any tax tied to transportation funding .
Still , the lively 60 - minute debate appeared to do little to change the dynamics of a race in which Deeds trails McDonnell in public opinion polls , fundraising and advertising .
The questions covered mostly familiar ground , and there seemed to be no game - changing moments .
Source : Washington Post
The last pre-election fundraising reports were due on Wednesday ; the highlights are below :
Deeds ( D ) McDonnell ( R ) Receipts $ 16,264,941.15 $ 21,466,447.67 Expenditures $ 15,327,168.54 $ 19,633,513.91 Cash on Hand $ 937,772.61 $ 1,832,933.76 Filing Period : 10/01/2009 - 10/21/2009
Source : Virginia State Board of Elections
Deeds was basically defeated in every aspect of the campaign , and his polling numbers reflect these various deficiencies .
Our mathematical projection gives
Deeds less than a 1 % chance of victory , and from a purely logical standpoint , this seems realistic .
Deeds has lost , unless something absurd happens .
New Jersey also conducted their final debate last week on Thursday , October 22nd :
The third and final debate in the tightening New Jersey governor 's race turned into something of a free - for - all on Thursday night as Gov. Jon S. Corzine tried to portray the state 's battered economy as poised for a slingshotlike recovery , while his Republican rival , Christopher J. Christie , depicted him as lamentably out of touch .
But the two were constantly harassed by a pesky Christopher J. Daggett , the independent candidate , who pointed to a new poll that showed him within striking distance , and who taunted Mr. Corzine and Mr. Christie over property taxes , corruption and the environment .
The hourlong debate , broadcast on the jazz station WBGO in Newark , broke little new ground , but allowed the three men to deliver their closing arguments .
Source : New York Times
The latest fundraising filings from New Jersey have not yet been posted , although the 11 day deadline has passed .
Hopefully the data will be available next week .
In the meantime you can read through last period 's reports at the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission .
Corzine bankrolled his own campaign , while Christie and Daggett relied upon matching public funds .
As a result Corzine had the capability to out raise his opponents , which he has done up to this point and I see no reason why this trend when end with the release of the new data .
More in a week for our probably last polling update .
I 'll also , hopefully , have a few other surprises .
Berlusconi has insisted he should not be ' distracted ' from governing
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has described himself as the most persecuted person " in the entire history of the world " .
Mr Berlusconi also said he was " the best prime minister we can find today " .
In an impassioned statement , he then mistakenly told reporters he had spent millions of euros on " judges " , before correcting himself to say " lawyers " .
Mr Berlusconi was speaking two days after Italy 's top court lifted a law granting him immunity while in office .
Correspondents say the Constitutional Court 's ruling means the 73 - year - old billionaire will probably have to face a number of trials for corruption and bribery within months .
He has described the cases against him as " false , a farce " , saying he will defend himself in court and make his accusers look ridiculous .
Bribery trial
The BBC's Duncan Kennedy in Rome says it has been a dramatic week for Mr Berlusconi , and he ended it with a typically defiant flourish .
He was asked by reporters about calls by opponents that he step down because his personal and legal problems were damaging Italy .
I do n't see any problem for the country , for the government or for me besides the fact that I will have to take some time out of my work [ to attend trials ]
Silvio Berlusconi
Italian Prime Minister
" The reality is completely the opposite , " he replied .
" In my opinion , and not only mine , I am the best prime minister we can find today .
" I do n't see any problem for the country , for the government or for me besides the fact that I will have to take some time out of my work [ to attend trials ] . "
Mr Berlusconi said he was a " dam against the Left in Italy " , accused the Constitutional Court of being biased , and said any judges who ruled against him were " trying to subvert the will of the electorate " .
" I am without doubt the person who 's been the most persecuted in the entire history of the world and the history of man , " he declared .
Mr Berlusconi later revealed that he had so far made 2,500 court appearances in his life and run up a legal bill of nearly 200 m euros ( $ 300 m ; £ 185 m ) .
It was then that he made one of his trademark gaffes , our correspondent says , by explaining that the money had gone on paying " consultants and judges " , before correcting himself to say " consultants and lawyers " .
Mr Berlusconi could soon be called as a witness in the appeal hearing in Milan of British tax adviser David Mills .
Mills was sentenced to four - and - a - half years in jail in February on charges of accepting $ 600,000 ( £ 377,000 ) from Mr Berlusconi in return for giving false testimony in two corruption trials in the 1990s .
Mr Berlusconi was initially a co-defendant in the case but charges against him were suspended after parliament approved the immunity law .
However , the removal of that law has potentially paved the way for the prime minister 's trial to resume .

This is your lucky day :
What masked gun raider told terrified woman who was seven months pregnant as he raped her
Police want to speak to this man who was filmed on CCTV in Finsbury Park 30 minutes before the attack
A heavily pregnant woman was raped at gunpoint by a burglar who told her it was her ' lucky day ' .
The 33 - year - old victim was only two months away from giving birth when masked raiders burst into her home and held a sawn - off shotgun to her partner 's head .
She was dragged upstairs by one of the three attackers wearing a balaclava .
Despite the desperate pleas of her boyfriend who begged them not to harm the mother - to - be , she was forced to perform a sex act by the masked man , who threatened to shoot the couple if she did not follow his orders .
Last night she told of her terrifying ordeal as police offered a £ 20,000 reward to capture her depraved attackers .
' I just wanted to protect my baby , ' she told the BBC's Crimewatch programme .
' I was absolutely terrified and being so late in the pregnancy I did n't want to get into a fight where they might hurt me or hurt the baby .
He said it was my lucky day . '
The victim , from North London , who does not want to be identified , has since given birth to a healthy child .
But she said the attack had devastated her life .
' Everything that you believe to be safe is no longer safe .
You ca n't walk
into the bedroom and feel relaxed because you remember that someone was in there who was n't supposed to be in there . '
The sex attack , which is classified as rape , took place on May 14 last year , but police have only just released details as the victim was too traumatised to speak out at the time .
She was watching television with her 39 - year - old boyfriend at 10.30 pm when he went to investigate a noise outside the front door of their home in Finsbury Park .
He saw some men wearing scarves and balaclavas at the end of the path and tried to shut the door but they forced their way inside , pushing him to the floor .
Police believe these two men , captured on camera outside a mini-market at the corner of Seven Sisters Road and Durham Road , ten minutes before the attack could be part of the gang
An object in a cloth bag , thought to be a sawn - off shotgun , was held to his head while the gang demanded the keys to the couple 's grey Audi TT car .
As his pregnant girlfriend was dragged upstairs , he begged them not to harm her , but one of the men hit him with the butt of the gun .
He told Crimewatch : ' I pleaded , I was shouting , " She 's pregnant , she 's pregnant , leave off her , tell me what you want " . '
The three men left in the Audi after grabbing property including a mobile phone , iPod , cash , debit cards and a laptop .
Police decided to offer the reward after failing to trace the gang .
They have released images of three men caught on CCTV at a nearby shop a few minutes before the attack , whom they wish to question .
The area of North London where the attack took place
The sex attacker is described as black , 6ft , aged 18 to 25 and stocky .
He wore a black balaclava , black jacket , black tracksuit bottoms and black shoes .
A second man was black or Asian , 5ft 6in and about 18 .
He wore light grey tracksuit bottoms , black trainers and a zip - up jacket with red sleeves .
The third suspect , who had the gun , was black , 5ft 10in , and aged between 18 and 22 .
He was wearing burgundy tracksuit bottoms .
Police say they are keen to trace the men , if only to eliminate them from the inquiry .
Details of the incident were revealed at a time when police are battling a surge in burglaries in London , in particular gangs who target houses to steal the keys of luxury cars parked outside .
Detective Inspector Robert Pack , investigating the Finsbury Park case , said : ' Every rape is a very serious crime but what makes this all the more shocking was that the victim was so clearly heavily pregnant .
' Concerns for the unborn baby can only have exacerbated what was already an emotionally and physically traumatic experience .
' Allegiances may have changed since the attack and we would urge anyone with information to contact us .
' I hope there are people out there who are prepared to do the right thing and tell us what they know . '
MPs rowed over scenes in Modern Warfare 2 in which civilians were killed .
Video games depicting war have come under fire for flouting laws governing armed conflicts .
Human rights groups played various games to see if any broke humanitarian laws that govern what is a war crime .
The study condemned the games for violating laws by letting players kill civilians , torture captives and wantonly destroy homes and buildings .
It said game makers should work harder to remind players about the real world limits on their actions .
War without limits
The study was carried out by two Swiss human rights organisations - Trial and Pro Juventute .
Staff played the games in the presence of lawyers skilled in the interpretation of humanitarian laws .
Twenty games were scrutinised to see if the conflicts they portrayed and what players can do in the virtual theatres of war were subject to the same limits as in the real world .
" The practically complete absence of rules or sanctions is ... astonishing , " said the study .
Army of Two , Call of Duty 5 , Far Cry 2 and Conflict Desert Storm were among the games examined .
Those who violate international humanitarian law end up as war criminals , not as winners
Trial / Pro Juventute
The games were analysed to see " whether certain scenes and acts committed by players would constitute violations of international law if they were real , rather than virtual " .
The group chose games , rather than films , because of their interactivity .
" Thus , " said the report , " the line between the virtual and real experience becomes blurred and the game becomes a simulation of real - life situations on the battlefield . "
The testers looked for violations of the Geneva Conventions and its Additional Protocols which cover how war should be waged .
In particular , the testers looked for how combatants who surrendered were treated , what happened to citizens caught up in war zones and whether damage to buildings was proportionate .
Some games did punish the killing of civilians and reward strategies that tried to limit the damage done by the conflict , said the study .
However , it said , many others allowed " protected objects " such as churches and mosques to be attacked ; some depicted interrogations that involved torture or degradation and a few permitted summary executions .
The authors acknowledged that the project was hard because it was not clear from many of the games the scale of the conflict being depicted .
This made it hard to definitively determine which humanitarian laws should be enforced .
It also said that the games were so complex that it was difficult to be confident that its testers had seen all possible violations or , in games in which they found none , that no violations were possible .
GAMES TESTED 24 , The Game Army of Two Battlefield Bad Company Brothers in Arms - Hell 's Highway Call of Duty 4 Call of Duty 5 Close Combat : First to Fight Conflict Desert Storm Far Cry 2 World in Conflict Frontlines : Fuel of War Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Hour of Victory Medal of Honour Airborne Metal Gear Solid Soldier of Fortune Tom Clancy Rainbow 6 Vegas Tom Clancy Splinter Cell Double Agent True Crime Streets of LA
It noted that , even though most players would never become real world combatants , the games could influence what people believe war is like and how soldiers conduct themselves in the real world .
It said games were sending an " erroneous " message that conflicts were waged without limits or that anything was acceptable in counter - terrorism operations .
" This is especially problematic in view of today 's reality , " said the study .
In particular , it said , few games it studied reflected the fact that those who " violate international humanitarian law end up as war criminals , not as winners " .
The authors said they did not wish to make games less violent , instead , they wrote : " [ We ] call upon game producers to consequently and creatively incorporate rules of international humanitarian law and human rights into their games . "
John Walker , one of the writers on the Rock , Paper , Shotgun games blog , said : " Games really are treated in a peculiar way . "
He doubted that anyone would campaign for books to follow humanitarian laws or for James Bond to be denounced for machine - gunning his way through a supervillain 's underground complex .
He said the authors did not understand that gamers could distinguish between fantasy and reality .
Said Mr Walker : " For all those who mowed down citizens in Modern Warfare 2's controversial airport level , I have the sneaking suspicion that not a great deal of them think this is lawful , nor appropriate , behaviour . "
Jim Rossignol , who also writes on Rock , Paper , Shotgun , said there was scope to mix real - world rules of war into games .
" Whether or not the rules of war are included in the game should be based entirely on whether that improves the experience for the player , " he said .
Mr Rossignol said there was plenty of evidence that gaming violence is " fully processed " as fantasy by gamers .
Studies of soldiers on the front line in Iraq showed that being a gamer did not desensitise them to what they witnessed .
He added : " Perhaps what this research demonstrates is that the researchers misunderstand what games are , and how they are treated , intellectually , by the people who play them . "

Given a proposal for a new building in a city like Edinburgh , they can also create virtual realities , almost microscopically accurate , so viewers might see what the building looks like from all angles in the place where it ’s intended to go , including the shadows it might cast at different times of day .
The technology is n’t brand new or unique to Scotland , but the Glasgow team is on its cultural front line .
Douglas Pritchard , a Canadian - born architect by training , is the wizard behind the Digital Design Studio at the art school .
He heads the Scottish laser expedition with David Mitchell , director of Historic Scotland ’s Technical Conservation Group .
Describing how fast laser modeling has progressed and how far it might soon go , Mr. Pritchard said , “ We ’re no longer a million miles from the ‘ Star Trek ’ holodeck . ”
He was perfectly serious .
The cultural implications of the technology are big , as are the political ones for Scotland , which , via the country ’s culture minister , Michael Russell , has latched on to the laser team ’s work .
It was about three years ago that Mr. Pritchard ’s art school group began surveying a swath of the center of Glasgow , along the River Clyde , creating 3 - D digital representations of some 1,400 buildings and dozens of streetscapes .
They caught the attention of Mr. Mitchell , who enlisted Mr. Pritchard to scan a decaying iron bridge in Dundee , which was nearly impossible to survey with much accuracy except by laser .
The bridge project led to scans of Stirling Castle and Rosslyn Chapel , the 15th - century Gothic fancy to which “ The Da Vinci Code ” has lately brought swarms of conspiracy - minded tourists .
One of them was a man who tried one day to take a sledgehammer to the so - called Apprentice Pillar , convinced that the Holy Grail was hidden inside it .
No harm done , but the event illustrated , as Mr. Mitchell noted , why scans are necessary .
“ Remember Windsor ? ” he asked , referring to the fire in 1992 that burned parts of the British royal castle .
“ If restorers had had laser scans back then , they could have rebuilt everything to within three millimeters of accuracy , but instead they had to rely on conjecture from photographs . ”
He noted the more recent case of the Buddhas in Afghanistan that the Taliban blew up in 2001 .
New S.F. chief seeks amnesty for officers SAN FRANCISCO
SAN FRANCISCO - AUGUST 11 : New San Francisco police Chief George Gascon smiles during his first news conference August 11 , 2009 at the Hall of Justice in San Francisco , California .

Discipline cases against dozens of San Francisco police officers would be dismissed under an amnesty program proposed by Chief George Gascón .
The new police chief told The Chronicle on Wednesday that he wants to see " the great majority " of roughly 75 discipline cases pending before the civilian Police Commission end with little or no punishment for officers accused of minor misconduct .
Those cases , he said , include charges such as use of inappropriate language , being discourteous , failing to properly fill out a police report or a first - time misdemeanor drunken - driving arrest .
They would also most likely involve first - time offenders rather than officers with a long history of complaints against them .
" We do n't get anything out of taking a pound of flesh , " Gascón said .
Cases involving more serious complaints , including harassment or use of unnecessary force , would be pursued and could end in termination .
" There 's a very small group of people in the department whose history is irredeemable , " the chief said .
" We have a moral and ethical obligation to say enough is enough . "
Gascón is in discussions with the Police Commission and Police Officers Association to clear the long backlog of cases .
Gary Delagnes , president of the association , could not be reached for comment .
Gascón wants to use the police chief 's power to suspend an officer for up to 10 days - the most he can do without sending a case to the Police Commission - and push for the discipline or termination of those officers who commit a second offense .
Only the commission can fire an officer .
Six years ago , San Francisco voters gave residents a uniquely big say over police officers following the notorious Fajitagate street brawl .
In that case , three off - duty officers were accused of picking a fight with two men , one who refused to hand over his to - go bag of fajitas .
That incident became a scandal when some top police brass were accused of a cover-up .
Charges were dropped in the case , and many of the top brass had their names cleared by the courts .
Under the current system , there are two channels for investigating misconduct by an officer : the independent Office of Citizen Complaints , which usually handles on - duty violations of police conduct rules , and the Police Department 's management control division , which usually handles off - duty misconduct .
Both routes can end up with a case before the Police Commission .
The commission , a seven - member body appointed by the mayor and the Board of Supervisors , handles cases that can't be resolved with the chief 's 10 - day suspension power .
The commissioners , who have other full - time jobs , hold hearings that can last several weeks .
Cases often languish for months or even years , meaning unfit officers continue to get paid when they should be fired and good officers are stuck on desk duty .
" Our system makes discipline a long , slow process and nobody 's happy with that , " said Joe Marshall , the commission president .
He said " the best - case scenario " would be holding two hearings a month , meaning the backlog would take roughly three years to clear .
Marshall said he had n't heard specifics of Gascón 's plan and that each case that stands to be dismissed needs to be looked at individually .
" I can't give a blanket statement about anything , " he said .
" Each case has to be judged on the merits and the facts . "
Reaction to the chief 's amnesty idea among city officials was mostly positive .
Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi , whose district includes the crime - plagued Western Addition , said he sat down with the chief earlier this week and was informed about his plan for discipline cases .
" There 's no reason for cases that are gridlocked for even the most minute infraction or administrative correction to remain without any resolution , " he said .
Mayor Gavin Newsom selected the new chief and has said he does n't want to micromanage Gascón .
Newsom , who has been traveling in Mexico over the last few days , issued a statement Wednesday saying , " I appointed him to reform the department and to use his best professional judgment to make important decisions like this . "
Michael Koziarski : Switch to on - by - default XSS escaping for rails .
This consists of :
String #html_safe !
a method to mark a string as ‘ safe ’
ActionView : : SafeBuffer a string subclass which escapes anything unsafe which is concatenated to it
Calls to String #html_safe !
throughout the rails helpers
a 'raw ’ helper which lets you concatenate trusted HTML from non-safety - aware sources ( e.g. presantized strings in the DB )
New ERB implementation based on erubis which uses a SafeBuffer instead of a String
Not mentioned in the commit message , but for backwards compatibility , html_escape and h helpers still exist , but essentially do nothing .
This change is also being backported to 2.3 .
For existing applications , the changes needed will tend to be small and easily spotted .
The biggest impact will be to books and tutorials .
New users will either see what they perceive as line noise being emitted and wonder what they did wrong , or will follow instructions such as the following ( from Edition 3 ) and wonder why it does n’t work as advertised :
In general , try to get into the habit of typing < %=h … > in templates and then removing the h only when you ’ve convinced yourself it ’s safe to do so .
And what about Microsoft Security Essentials — MSE ?
As many of you many know , Microsoft released their free security product earlier this week .
Called MSE ( Microsoft Security Essentials ) , it is a replacement for their One Care Product .
It has been interesting reading the press coverage and the reaction from competitors .
Some declare it will transform the security business and solve all security problems .
Some equate it to a bad movie sequel .
And some think it is Shakespearean — " Much Ado about Nothing " .
Ourselves , we are pretty ambivalent about Microsoft entering the free security space .
We have long believed that security protection should be freely available .
And there are already several top - notch free security products available ( including avast of course ) .
But , we do n't think that MSE is in the " top notch " category .
In the last AV - Comparatives ( I wrote about it in a previous blog entry ) , Microsoft 's One Care did not do very well .
While it tied with us for 2nd in false positives ; out of 16 , it was 14th in detection and 13th in speed .
And of course , MSE 's performance is the same as One Care's .
So while MSE is better than nothing , and even Microsoft describes it as basic protection , it is not yet up to the standards of the paid products .
And , it is even further behind the performance of the top free products ( including avast ) that handily outscored the paid products .
Microsoft also seems to think that 60 % of users have no security protection .
I do not know where this number comes from as they do not cite any sources .
But , it does not make much sense .
There are about 500 million consumer computers in the world ( Gartner and IDC data ) .
From published numbers , Avast , Avira , and AVG protect about 250 million ; maybe closer to 300 million now .
Also from published numbers , Symantec , McAfee , Trend , and Kaspersky , and a few others protect just under 100 million .
This leaves 150 million but I would guess that a good 50 million of those are protected by local products ( K7/ SourceNext in India and Japan , Rising and Kingsoft in China , Ahn in Korea , etc. ) .
So it seems there should only be about 20 % ( 100 million ) unprotected .
Now of course , that is still too many to be without protection , especially when good security is free .
But it sounds like a case of Microsoft offering a solution in search of a problem .
It was also interesting to read how most journalists just recited the Microsoft story .
I saw very few mentions of the large free providers .
One even dismissively referred to the current free vendors as " no- name " vendors .
How can three companies with 250 million users be called " no- name " companies ?
I have to chalk it up to ignorance and great PR from Microsoft and the traditional security vendors .
A legitimate concern I saw expressed from Symantec and McAfee was something about a " level playing field " .
That sounds like whining but it refers to how the product is distributed .
Symantec , McAfee , and the traditional vendors distribute through retail , OEMs , etc .
The free vendors ( such as us ) distribute through download servers .
Microsoft tried the traditional distribution route with One Care — and failed .
They are trying the download server route with MSE .
But , they have an ace up their sleeves if they distributed MSE as part of Windows — or if they try to force OEMs to install MSE on new computers as a condition of getting Windows 7 .
It is monopolistic distribution like this that caused the large anti-trust suits of past years with Netscape and others .
Security is a highly competitive business — it probably has more competing titles than any computing segment other than games .
That competition is invaluable .
Without it , none of us improves .
Having many healthy large companies drives the security industry forward and provides better protection for users .
We all learn for each other — and even copy ( legally ) each other at times .
I could name many examples of where a given product has influenced other products .
We even share malware samples with each other .
Having just a couple of dominant players ( such as the recent past with Symantec and McAfee ) can lead to stagnation and lower protection for users .
Also , security these days goes far beyond a layer of protection for the operating system ( Windows ) .
Many threats have nothing to do with the underlying operating system .
They are in Firefox , Mozilla , browser plug-ins , infected web sites , social engineering , other applications ( such as Adobe ) , etc .
So it is healthiest for the security providers , and the users , if Microsoft is on the same playing field — distributing through similar channels and not taking advantage of their almost monopolistic domination of operating system distribution .
MSE is not the silver bullet but it is also not the bad sequel to One Care that some claim — it is just another average security product .
It has probably been hyped much more than deserved and thus the Shakespeare comparison may be the best .
A recent review by Neil Rubenking of PCMag ( http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2353699,00.asp) probably says it best :
So should you rely on Microsoft Security Essentials for free protection ?
I 'd say no , unless you strongly value the Microsoft name .
My own testing suggests that you 'll do better with one of the other free anti-malware solutions such as AVG Anti-Virus Free or avast !
antivirus Home Edition .
Ultimately security is about trust .
The user has to trust that the product ( and the company behind the product ) will protect them , their computer , and their data .
We are glad we have earned the trust of over 90 million users .
We aim to keep and enlarge that trust .
Who do you trust ?
Do you want to lose weight , detoxify , and cleanse your body at the same time ?
If so , then this Three Step Full Body Detox Plan is for you !
Update : now includes some great fat loss routines to help you detox your system .
Why You Should Detox Your Body
Thousands of toxins enter our bodies at work , at home , through our lungs , in the medicines we take , and in our food and water .
On the western diet , we eat more processed , sugary foods than ever .
We regularly poison our bodies with sedatives , stimulants , chemicals , and medicines .
It is time to start paying attention to the pollution problems that surround us .
For decades now , scientists have studied pollutants in our food , water , air , and soil .
Now they are starting to examine pollution levels in humans , and their findings are disturbing .
Our bodies are not capable of fully eliminating all these atmospheric toxins on a daily basis .
These toxins cause a wide range of health problems as they accumulate in our bodily tissues such as liver , kidneys , intestines , heart , brain , and lungs .
Read on to find out how to implement a safe 2 step system for full body detoxification .
Symptoms of Toxification
asthma
skin and hair problems
foul - smelling stools
junk food cravings
fatigue
low energy
bad breath
headache
nausea
fat gain
arthritis
allergies
insomnia
flatulence , gas , and bloating
impaired digestion
mood swings
Sabotaging our attempts to maintain good health in the face of these pollutants , is a concept called autointoxication .
Autointoxication is a belief that undigested foods , often including red meat , causes a build - up of mucus and bacteria in the large intestines .
Theoretically , this mucus buildup produces toxins that are absorbed by the intestines and poison the body by entering the bloodstream .
This absorption theory is probably true , experts agree because rectal suppositories are often given in medical emergencies to rapidly administer medicine into the bloodstream .
After all , our intestines are incredibly absorbent and effective at sucking up intestinal nutrients and dumping them directly into the blood .
The Solution to Toxification
Sometimes toxification can cause discomfort and even bodily pain that persists over time .
One way we can help to fight the pain , stiffness , and swelling that accompany this chronic condition is to supplement with an anti-inflammatory and try to eat foods with anti-inflammatory properties .
Aside from that , we can attempt to detox using the following strategy .
Combined , Acai Berry and Colon Cleanse create the ultimate safe and effective full body detox plan .
You will remove unwanted waste from your system while burning fat efficiently and effectively .
You could literally lose several pounds within the first 7 - 10 days !
You will certainly feel the difference from the overall detoxification effect .

November 13 , 2009 MSNBC : Countdown with Keith Olbermann , Lawrence O'Donnell guest host
Dave N. :
The famed 9/11 widow -- one of the people who helped force the creation of the 9/11 Commission and one of the leaders of the 9/11 victims ' families organization -- went on with Lawrence O'Donnell last night and countered the right 's favorite new fearmongering meme , namely , that holding civilian trials for the 9/11 conspirators in New York might set them free .
O'Donnell : Some of the victims ' families of 9/11 have indicated that they 're not pleased with this move to New York .
How do you react to this ?
Breitweiser : I think those families seem to be indicating a sense of anger or fear .
And I think really , to be feeling those types of things , it does n't fit my personality .
I think that that 's bowing to the terrorists .
I think there is no better place than the Southern District of New York to be having these prosecutions heard .
I think it 's an open forum .
And I think it speaks to the world that we are in fact a nation of laws .
And frankly , I think , after eight years of the Bush administration we 've got a lot of work in restoring our legitimacy to the rest of the world , that we are indeed a just nation that follows the rule of law .

SECULARISM ALERT : Obama Not Sworn In Using A Bible Jan. 21 , 2009 — During the televised inauguration on Tuesday , much was made of Mr. Obama taking the Oath of Office using the Bible that President Lincoln used during his inauguration .
This was done to stifle fears that Mr. Obama 's supposed Christian faith was merely a calculated ruse to hide his Muslim - Atheist leanings .
However , things were not as they seemed .
Mr. Obama , who is known for his oratory skill , managed to befuddle Chief Justice John Roberts by " accidentally " interrupting him before he could finish saying the opening line .
This caused the Oath to be recited incorrectly by both Chief Justice Roberts and Mr. Obama , meaning that Mr. Obama was not officially sworn in that day .
Instead , the official swearing - in ceremony was conducted in near - secrecy the next night ( Jan. 21 ) in the White House Map Room .
Only this time , Mr. Obama did not use a Bible !
According to the AP article : " The president said he did not have his Bible with him , but that the oath was binding anyway . "
While directives for the use of a Bible are neglected in the Constitution , all presidents since George Washington have been sworn in on the Word of God.
Mr. Obama , by not using a Bible , has become the first Atheist President .
Thus we begin slouching towards Secularism .

CHRISTIAN PERSECUTION ALERT : Atheists Persecuting Military Christians Sept 27 , 2007 — OBJECTIVE : Ministry 's resident retired military expert Jack Holgroth has alerted us to a distressing new act of anti-Christian persecution happening right now in our own military : Major Freddy Welborn , warrior for the Lord Jesus Christ currently serving with the 3rd Infantry Division Civil Military Operations ( Governance ) in Baghdad Iraq , is being persecuted by Atheists who have filed a frivolous lawsuit against him .
The lawsuit seeks to keep Major Welborn from freely practicing his religious calling to preach the Gospel of God to service men and women in Iraq -- including so - called " Atheists " holding " meetings " on government property .
We do n't need our brave Christian soldiers worrying about their assets being seized by Atheist lawyers back home while fighting on the front line .
This vexatious distraction will only cost lives and help the terrorists win .
I know I and my fellow Christian game theoreticians at the DoD did n't help defeat the Godless Soviets just so Atheist fifth - columnists could undo all our hard - won religious freedoms !
I urge all Christians to write their representative and demand that emergency legislation be swiftly enacted to protect Christians in uniform from religious persecution via the courts .

Is the basic inequality in wealth distribution repeated in country after country the result of the talents or lack thereof of a country 's citizens ?
Not according to a new study .
According to this excerpt from a Harvard Business Review article , the disparity " appears to be something akin to a law of economic life that emerges naturally as an organizational feature of a network . "
by Mark Buchanan
The economic world is full of patterns , many of which exert a profound influence over society and business .
One of the most controversial is the distribution of wealth .
You might expect the balance between the rich and the poor to vary widely from country to country .
Different nations , after all , have different resources and produce different kinds of products .
Some rely on agriculture , others on heavy industry , still others on high technology .
And their peoples have different backgrounds , skills , and levels of education .
But in 1897 , an Italian engineer - turned - economist named Vilfredo Pareto discovered a pattern in the distribution of wealth that appears to be every bit as universal as the laws of thermodynamics or chemistry .
Suppose that in the United States or Cuba or Thailandor any other country for that matter you count the number of people worth , say , $ 10,000 .
Then you count the number of people at many other levels of wealth , both large and small , and you plot the results on a graph .
You would find , as Pareto did , many individuals at the lowest end of the scale and fewer and fewer as you progress along the graph toward higher levels of wealth .
But when Pareto studied the numbers more closely , he discovered that they dwindled in a very special way toward the wealthy end of the curve :
Each time you double the amount of wealth , the number of people falls by a constant factor .
The factor varies from country to country , but the pattern remains essentially the same .
Pareto 's distribution has , from a mathematical standpoint , stubbornly defied explanation .
 Mark Buchanan
Unlike a standard bell curve distribution , in which great deviations from the average are very rare , Pareto 's so - called fat - tailed distribution starts very high at the low end , has no bulge in the middle at all , and falls off relatively slowly at the high end , indicating that some number of extremely wealthy people hold the lion 's share of a country 's riches .
In the United States , for example , something like 80 % of the wealth is held by only 20 % of the people .
But this particular 80 - 20 split is not really the point ; in some other country , the precise numbers might be 90 - 20 or 95 - 10 or something else .
The important point is that the distribution ( at the wealthy end , at least ) follows a strikingly simple mathematical curve illustrating that a small fraction of people always owns a large fraction of the wealth .
What causes this pattern ?
Is there some kind of regularity in human behavior or culture that supersedes national variations ?
Is there some devilish conspiracy among the rich ?
Not surprisingly , given the strong emotions stirred by matters of wealth and its disparity , economists have flocked to such questions .
Of the central issues in economics , John Kenneth Galbraith wrote in his History of Economics , the first is " how equitable or inequitable is the income distribution .
The explanation and rationalization of the resulting inequality has commanded some of the greatest , or in any case some of the most ingenious , talent in the economics profession . "
Despite all the attention , however , Pareto 's distribution has , from a mathematical standpoint , stubbornly defied explanation .
Finding out why one individual is richer than another is , of course , relatively straightforward .
One has only to delve into the details of inheritance and education , inherent ability and desire to make money , circumstance , and plain old luck .
The sons or daughters of doctors or bankers frequently become doctors or bankers themselves , while children born into inner-city poverty often remain mired in hardship , unable to escape their environment .
But Pareto 's distribution is n't about individuals .
It captures a pattern that emerges at the level of large groups , leaving individual histories aside .
It is , it might be posited , a network effect .
As scientists have discovered , many of the overarching organizational features of networks depend only weakly or not at all on the actions or character of their individual members .
Physicists , to take just one example , have long known that , in some cases , they can build strikingly accurate models of complex molecular systems using only a few very crude assumptions .
It turns out that the details of individual atoms have little influence over the behavior of the entire network .
In principle , the same might be true of wealth .
Perhaps Pareto's distribution reflects less about people and their characteristics than it does about the deeper , impersonal laws of network organization .
Webs of wealth
To find out , let 's forget for the moment about creativity and risk taking , the distribution of intelligence , and all the other factors that might influence an individual 's destiny .
Instead , let 's focus on the flow of wealth in an economy .
Think of an economy as a network of interacting people .
At any given time , each person has a certain amount of wealth , and over the days and weeks , that amount will change in one of two fundamental ways .
Your employer pays you for your work ; you sell your car ; you build a patio ; you take a vacation in Italy .
Such transactions transfer wealth from one person to another along the links in the network .
But suppose you purchase a house or a piece of land , and , sadly , its value falls .
Or you invest in stocks and , as in the 1990s , the market soars , showering on you a pile of totally new wealth .
In such cases , wealth is not merely transferred but actually created or destroyed .
Very basically , then , a person 's wealth can go up or down either through transactions with others or by earning returns ( positive or negative ) on investments .
This is hardly news , of course , but it implies that two factors control the basic dynamics in the web of wealth .
As people earn salaries , pay rent , buy food , and so on , wealth should flow through the network in a more or less regular way , like water through a network of pipes .
Meanwhile , owing to investments , overall wealth should generally increase slowly , even as individuals ' wealth randomly kicks up or down as their investments go particularly well or especially poorly .
The finding suggests that the basic inequality in wealth distribution seen in most societies may have little to do with differences in the backgrounds and talents of their citizens .
 Mark Buchanan
Obviously , this picture leaves out almost every detail of reality except the most basic .
And yet it is intriguing to wonder if these two simple factors might imply something about how wealth ends up being distributed .
A couple of years ago , physicists Jean - Philippe Bouchaud and Marc Mézard of the University of Paris took a large step toward answering this question by bringing into the picture one other " obvious " fact that the value of wealth is relative .
A multimillionaire , for example , will not ordinarily sweat losing a few thousand dollars in the stock market , but the same loss would likely be catastrophic for a single parent trying to raise her son while putting herself through college .
The value of money depends on how much one already has , and consequently wealthy people tend to invest more than the less wealthy .
With these commonplace observations , Bouchaud and Mézard formulated a set of equations that could follow wealth as it shifts from person to person , as each person receives random gains or losses from his investments , and as those who accumulate more wealth invest relatively more .
Equations in hand for a network of 1,000 people , the two physicists set to work with a computer to create an economic model .
Not knowing precisely how to link people together into a network of transactions , they tried various alternatives .
Unsure of how precisely to set the balance between interpersonal transactions and investment returns , they tried shifting it first one way and then the other .
But no matter what they did , the model always produced the same basic shape of wealth distribution precisely the same shape as Pareto 's distribution .
This happened even when every person in the model started out with exactly the same amount of money .
And it happened when every person was endowed with identical money - making skills .
The finding suggests that the basic inequality in wealth distribution seen in most societies may have little to do with differences in the backgrounds and talents of their citizens .
Rather , the disparity appears to be something akin to a law of economic life that emerges naturally as an organizational feature of a network .
Shades of inequality
Bouchaud and Mézard 's discovery suggests that the temptation to find complex explanations behind the distribution of wealth may be seriously misguided .
What makes wealth fall into the pockets of a few appears to be quite simple .
On the one hand , transactions between people tend to spread wealth around .
If one person becomes dramatically wealthy , she may start a business , build a house , and consume more products , and in each case wealth will tend to flow out to others in the network .
Conversely , if a person becomes terribly poor , he will tend to purchase fewer products , and less wealth will flow through links going away from him .
Overall , the flow of funds along links in the network should act to wash away wealth disparities .
But it seems that this washing out effect never manages to gain the upper hand , for the random returns on investment drive a counterbalancing rich - get - richer phenomenon .
Even if everyone starts out equal , differences in investment luck will cause some people to start to accumulate more wealth than others .
Those who are lucky will tend to invest more and so have a chance to make greater gains still .
Hence , a string of positive returns builds a person 's wealth not merely by addition but by multiplication , as each subsequent gain grows ever bigger .
This is enough , even in a world of equals where returns on investment are entirely random , to stir up huge wealth disparities in the population .
That does n't mean that inequities in wealth can't be mitigated .
In a Pareto distribution , the factor by which the number of people declines as wealth increases remains constant in any particular country , but the factor itself is different in different countries .
So , while there is always a disparity between the rich and the poor , there are differences in degree from country to country .
And , socially speaking , there 's a world of difference between an 80 - 20 distribution and 90 - 5 .
Bouchaud and Mézard 's network model can track those degrees of inequality and show how Pareto 's distribution can be influenced .
Specifically , the two researchers found that the greater the volume of money flowing through the economy and the more often it changes hands , the greater the equality .
Conversely , the more volatile investment returns are , the richer the rich tend to get .
This scene is taken from the movie , Minority Report , that shows Tom Cruise accessing computer information using advanced gesture controls .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Microsoft researches have teamed up with the University of Washington and the University of Toronto to develop a muscle - controlled interface that allows for hands - free , gesture - driven interaction with computers .
By attaching a band of electrodes to a person 's forearm , electrical activity can be read from different arm muscles .
The signals are then compared to different hand gestures and processed by software .
Video Caption : Science advisor , Steven Spielberg has created a real - world implementation of the computer systems seen in the Minority Report .
The current model uses six electromyography sensors ( EMG ) and two ground electrodes placed in a ring around a person 's upper right forearm for sensing finger movement .
Two additional sensors are placed on the upper left forearm for identifying hand squeezes .
Since the sensors can't accurately interpret muscle activity , software must be used to train the associate electrical signals with different gestures .
By using standard machine - learning algorithms , the software learns to recognize EMG signals produced by a user performing gestures .
The algorithms use three aspects of the EMG signal : the magnitude of muscle activity , the rate of muscle activity , and the wave patterns taking place across several sensors at once .
Video : Microsoft
After the software is properly trained , using standard machine - learning algorithms , participants gestures were accurately determined 85 percent of the time .
In the early stages of training , participants ' gestures must be carefully controlled so that the machine - learning algorithms are properly trained .
The goal of this research is to provide a more seamless integration between user and computer .
One day advance gesture control , using muscle - base interface , will become the norm and current PC interfaces , such as a mouse , will become obsolete .

A new alternative energy technology relies on the element most associated with climate change : carbon .
University of Wisconsin- Madison researchers are studying how to create inexpensive , efficient solar cells from carbon nanotubes , which are sheets of carbon rolled into seamless cylinders one nanometer in diameter .
Many researchers are studying how to use nanotubes for mechanical and electronics applications , but materials science and engineering assistant professor Michael Arnold is one of the first to apply them to solar energy .
" We are developing new materials and methods to create scalable , inexpensive , stable and efficient photovoltaic solar cell technologies , " Arnold says .
" Semiconducting carbon nanotubes have remarkable electronic and optical properties that are ideally suited for photovoltaics , so they are an interesting starting point . "
Carbon is a promising choice for solar cells because it is an abundant , inexpensive element , and carbon nanotubes have excellent electrical conductivity and strong optical absorptivity .
Most current solar cells use silicon , which converts 10 to 30 percent of sunlight absorbed into electricity .
This is a good rate , but silicon cells are expensive .
" The cost is upfront for silicon cells , and the cost per kilowatt - hour is five times more than you 'd pay for coal over 20 years — that 's not very motivating for people , " says Arnold .
With carbon nanotubes , he hopes to achieve efficiency comparable to silicon solar cells for less cost .
Arnold says solar is a valuable energy source since the sun outputs approximately 1,000 watts per square yard .
A solar cell that is only 20 percent efficient would generate about 200 watts per square yard on a sunny day , so coating the roof of an average 40 - square yard house with solar cells would make a significant dent in the average energy needs of the household .
To have an effect on the national electric grid , Arnold envisions expansive fields of solar cells built in desert regions .
" Solar is a viable technology for producing energy , " Arnold says .
" It 's just too expensive right now . "
To create the new carbon nanotube solar cells , Arnold and his students grow nanotube structures and then separate the useful semi-conducting nanotubes from undesirable metallic ones .
They also separate the tubes according to diameter , which determines a particular nanotube 's bandgap , or wavelength of light the tube can absorb .
Certain bandgaps are more suitable than others for absorbing sunlight .
After sorting out the useful nanotubes , the team wraps them in a semi-conducting polymer to make the tubes soluble .
They turn the combined nanotubes and polymer into a solution , which can be sprayed in a thin film onto transparent indium - tin - oxide coated glass substrates .
The researchers then deposit an electron - accepting semiconductor and a negative electrode on top of the nanotubes to complete the entire cell .
In creating the new solar cells , Arnold , who is funded by the National Science Foundation , is attempting to answer a variety of fundamental science and research questions .
He is studying how charge is generated in the nanotubes in response to light and how different electron - accepting materials affect the efficiency and speed of the separation of that charge .
" The driving question is , can we understand how to both process the tubes to get the morphology we want , and can we also learn how light creates charges in our carbon nanotube materials and how these charges separate ? " he says .

Writing in The American Conservative , Jack Hunter opines :
Warning that popular talk radio and Fox News host Glenn Beck was " Harmful to the Conservative Movement , " Peter Wehner wrote on Commentary 's " Contentions " blog in September : " he seems to be more of a populist and libertarian than a conservative , more of a Perotista than a Reaganite .
His interest in conspiracy theories is disquieting , as is his admiration for Ron Paul and his charges of American ' imperialism . '
( He is now talking about pulling troops out of Afghanistan , South Korea , Germany , and elsewhere . ) "
Wehner is not alone in his criticism .
When Beck told CBS News ' Katie Couric , " John McCain would have been worse for the country than Barack Obama , " fellow radio talker and New York Times bestselling author Mark Levin fired back : " to say that he would be worse than a president who 's a Marxist , who 's running around the world apologizing for our nation , who 's slashing our defense budget … to say he would be worse is mindless … incoherent , as a matter of fact . "
Beck has been criticized from both Left and Right for his melodramatic , sometimes conspiracy - minded , intermittently bizarre style .
But his conservative critics seem most offended not by Beck 's manner but by his deviationism .
He wo n't stick to the ideological script … .
During the George W. Bush years ,
Beck 's politics were less differentiated from those of other radio talkers .
He deferred to the Bush administration , promoted militarism as patriotism , and called the day 's news along partisan lines .
When Ron Paul received national attention for questioning America 's interventionist foreign policy during a 2007 GOP presidential primary debate , Beck called Paul " crazy " and asked , " how did this guy get on stage ? "
At the time there were no complaints about Beck from the likes of Wehner and Levin — because Beck sounded much like them .

David Axelrod tells POLITICO that the administration is not dialing back its support for a public health - insurance option .
Axelrod : Firm on public option
White House senior adviser David Axelrod tells POLITICO that the administration is not dialing back its support for a public health - insurance option as part of a reform bill , and that a comment he made on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” was misinterpreted .
Axelrod told NBC ’s David Gregory that President Barack Obama “ certainly agrees that we have to have competition and choice , to hold the insurance companies honest .
…
He believes the public option is a good tool .
Now , it should n’t define the whole health care debate , however . ”

The Associated Press , which often sets the agenda for how other news organizations cover Sunday shows , popped up a headline saying : “ White House shifts on public health care option " .
The story 's lead : " WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Barack Obama 's top political adviser is backing away from having a government health care plan compete against private carriers . ”
Axelrod disputed that interpretation in an e-mail .
“ In no way did I back off our position , ” he wrote .
“ I must have said half a dozen times that he thinks the public option is an important tool to bring about competition and choice that will help consumers .
To say that it is not the whole of health insurance reform , in a country where 160 million people have employer - sponsored health insurance and would not even be affected by this , does not mean I am backing off ! ”
Indeed , Axelrod also told Gregory : “ He said there must be an exchange where people can get insurance at a competitive price .
He believes in competition and choice .
The public option is an important tool to help provoke that where there is no competition .
He still believes that .
...
So we want to create a pool in which people who do n't have insurance , and small businesses , can go and get insurance at a competitive price .
And a public option would be a valuable tool within that group , that package of plans that would be offered , private and public . ”
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs made similar remarks on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
Host George Stephanopoulos , summing up a long exchange , said to Gibbs : “ The president , from what I can hear , is going to make the case for the public health - insurance option — for a form of the public health - insurance option — on Wednesday , but he is not going to say : ‘ If you do n’t bring me one , I veto the bill . ’ ”
Gibbs replied : “ I doubt we ’re going to get into heavy veto threats on Wednesday .
We ’re going to talk about what we can do , because we ’re so close to getting it done .
He will talk about the public option , and why he believes , and continues to believe , that it is a valuable component of providing choice and competition , that helps individuals and small business , at the same time provides a check on insurance companies . ”
Giving the opposition view , Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind. ) , chairman of the House Republican Conference , said on " This Week " : " Republicans are ready to work for comprehensive health care reform .
When I went home and did town hall meetings across the state of Indiana , I heard people saying , ‘ Look , we need health care reform .
We need to do something to lower the cost of health insurance for families and small businesses and lower the cost of health care . ’
" But I also heard people say that they do n't want a government - run plan that is going to lead to a government takeover of health care in this country , paid for with $ 800 billion in higher taxes .
... I really think the American people — at least at the town hall meetings that I had , George — many Americans feel that this federal government is spiraling out of control . "
As millions of Americans are finding themselves waking up with less disposable income , fewer job prospects , less income thanks for forced furloughs or lost value in their 401 ( k ) s , some are rediscovering the joys of growing our own food , sharing picnics with others in our community , going for hikes in the woods , or spending more time with our family .
Instead of working at a job they hate , they ’re starting their own enterprise that makes the world a better place .
As it turns out , a new version of happiness is emerging based on relationships and connections to each other and nature , not all the goods found at the Mall .
Many of us are choosing to live and work in a world where the economists ( who presently dominate the national economy and national discourse ) do n’t matter .
The authoritative new book from Cecile Andrews and Wanda Urbanska , Less is More : Embracing simplicity for a healthy planet , a caring economy and lasting happiness ( New Society , 2009 ) , is just the right tonic for these topsy - turvy times .
Side - step stress , do n’t give into your fear , and thrive , instead , in a world of abundance where freedom and cooperation still reign .
My wife and I had a chance to peek at the advance galley of Less is More before it went to print and found Andrews and Urbanska masterful both in their prose and their ability to bring together an eclectic array of writers , thinkers and sustainability advocates who live in ways that echo what they write about .
Less is
More is divided into three parts — simplicity defined , solutions , and policies — each containing short essays , analysis and inspiration from some of the leading sustainability , simplicity and community thinkers and doers .
From Sarah Susanka discussing clutter and Robyn Griggs Lawrence ’ tome on wabi-sabi time to Juliet Schor ’s exploration of a carbon - friendly economy and David Korten ’s treatise on caring and connecting , a diverse array of perspectives woven throughout Less is More illuminate why there ’s greater freedom in having enough rather than always striving to have more and more .
Writes essayist David Wann : “ According to surveys taken by the US National Science Foundation for the past 30 years , even with the steady increases in income , our level of overall happiness has actually tapered off . ”
So what ’s the economy for anyway , to support a bigger government or make a few really rich people richer ?
As Andrews and Urbanska set out in the Introduction of Less is More , “ Simplicity is asking yourself : ‘ How do I really want to live ?
What truly makes me happy ?
What are my actions doing to the planet ?
How does my lifestyle contribute to the greater good ? ' ”
These are questions I reflect upon daily as I operate Inn Serendipity Bed & Breakfast with my wife and son .
The questions overlap with those that help distinguish ecopreneurship from entrepreneurship that I write about in ECOpreneuring .
Even if you ’re no stranger to the sustainability or environmental movement , there ’s plenty of hard - hitting research and provocative insights from Less is More contributors .
For example , David Wann writes : “ If so many of us are willing to die for our country , why are we afraid to live for it , moderately and unselfishly ?
Why do we place a higher value on convenience , size and speed than the well - being of living things ( including ourselves ) ? ”
He calls for a change in the patterns of how and where we live , work and eat .
It ’s exactly these kinds of changes that will contribute to a more sustainable tomorrow in a restoration economy , if only the politicians would pay closer attention .
Maybe we can live richly on a budget .
Until then , we can do what we must in our life , our work and our community .
We all know you ca n’t buy happiness , great friends or a healthy community .
By rediscovering the joy and satisfaction that comes from simplicity , frugality , and community , we can remake the world where everyone gets to share .
Let Less is More inspire your journey .
Space power ?
June 12 , 2009
Posted by Maury Markowitz in solar power satellites Tags : solar power satellites
A few weeks back the science interwebs were alight with the news that Pacific Gas & Electric , California ’s largest power supplier , had inked a deal to buy solar power beamed down from space .
The fact that the post was on the NEXT100 blog , not an official PG&E press release , did n’t stop anyone from blogrolling it to the other end of the Earth in moments .
Nor did the fact that the company , Solaren Corp , did n’t even have a web page seem to trigger any concern .
If you googled it up , you could only find this company from Armenia , and even today you have to poke about a bit to find this page , which is entirely content - free and may not even be the same company ( it ’s listed in Washington ) .
Space power , eh ?
Ain’t gonna happen .
Let me show you why …
Building a solar panel on Earth is pretty easy , but you only get sunlight during the day , and there ’s weather to consider too .
Poking about on the net , I found that we get a little under 2000 hours of “ bright direct sunlight ” a year here in Toronto .
Since there ’s 8544 hours in a year , that means we get useful sunlight about 1 /4 of the time .
And even then we do n’t get all of the power we could ; in Earth orbit , with no atmosphere to filter the sunlight , there ’s about 1,366 Watts of solar energy for every square meter , but by the time it gets down here , we get about 1,000 W /m2 .
The high frontier
Ok , so put those solar panels in space .
Five times as much power , right there – four times the sunlight because there ’s no night or clouds , and another boost because of the greater power of that light due to the lack of the atmosphere .
Of course you have to get the power down to the planet , but we know how to do that .
There ’s a system called a “ rectenna ” that beams the power down as microwaves , and it ’s pretty efficient , upward of 90 % .
This will be attenuated somewhat by the atmosphere , so maybe the overall effect is on the order of 85 % .
Now put the satellite in a geostationary orbit ( GEO ) so it sits above your target market , like California , and beam the power down to the grid .
So we ’re looking at getting maybe four times as much power as the same panel on Earth , and it ’s almost 24 hours a day ( there ’s the odd eclipse ) .
That ’s a lot more useful than day - only power like a panel here on Earth .
So what ’s not to like ?
Show me da money !
Uhhh , how about the $ 12,000 a pound shipping costs ?
Here , follow along as I do a little math …
A really good solar cell for space applications is the ZTJ cell from emcore .
It ’s about 30 % efficient , which is way higher than a traditional cell like you see on a rooftop , which might get you about 12 % if you ’re lucky .
At 30 % , you ’re looking at getting around around 400 W /m2 of the 1,366 available .
The Next100 press release stated they were looking at 200 MW , so that ’s 500,000 m2 of cells .
How much do they weight ?
emcore has them at 84 mg/cm2 .
That ’s 5 billion cm2 we have to cover , so that ’s 420 billion mg , or about 925,000 pounds .
At $ 12,000 a pound that ’s $ 11 billion just for the launch cost of the cells .
Ok , you know , $ 11 billion is n’t all that much in the grand scheme of things .
OPG is planning on spending over $ 20 billion CAD on the Darlington B expansion , for instance .
But the difference is the power it ’s going to produce .
Solar cells are generally rated for about 20 years , so we ’re looking at 200 MW being generated 24/7 for 20 years .
That ’s about 35 billion kWh in total .
How much is a kWh ?
Well for baseload , here in Ontario you ’re looking at about 4 cents and in California it peaks out at about 6 cents .
Let ’s split the difference and call it 5 cents .
So over 20 years we get $ 1.75 billion worth of electricity .
Anyone else see the problem ?
Now there are ways you can improve on this , slightly .
Solaren ’s patent shows a system that uses concentration , which boosts you into the 40 % efficiency range and lets you replace the solar cells with mirrors .
Those mirrors can be based on lightweight inflatable structures , so the launch mass goes down .
But solar cells are n’t really that heavy in the first place , so the savings are n’t huge – they ’re nowhere near the 100 times reduction you ’re going to need to make the numbers work out .
And then there ’s the small problem that every attempt to make a lightweight space mirror has failed miserably .
Basically if you just set up those exact same panels on Earth you get some amount of power , let ’s call it 1 solaren .
Now if you set them up in space you get 5 solarens .
The difference is 4 solarens .
Unless the shipping costs are less than the price you get paid for those 4 solarens , just set it up here on Earth and use the money you save to buy four more of them .
And the simple fact of the matter is that electricity is cheap , rockets are not .
Fugetaboutit !
I need to point out that there ’s nowhere near this many high - efficiency solar cells in the world , and no way to make them fast enough either .
emcore ’s the only company that ’s actually signed deals for concentrated PV , and their production is only a few hundred kW a year .
A 850 kW plant was going to take 15 months to supply .
200 MW represents decades of worldwide production , and there ’s no sign that either emcore or Spectolab has any sort of deal with Solaren .
And forget about actually launching this stuff up there .
The entire worldwide capacity to GTO is about 70 launches a year , with an average of about 5 tons of payload .
Most of these are used by the military , and they ’re not going to sell them to you .
To get this stuff up there , you ’ll need to buy the spare capacity of the entire world for several years .
And they say they ’ll be operational in 2016 ?
Hmmm .
And did I say 20 years of power ?
Good luck with that .
There ’s this looming problem called the Kessler Syndrome that we ’re right on the leading edge of running into .
Basically all the junk that we ’ve been putting up there for the last forty years is still floating around , bumping into things .
We ’ve already lost two satellites in GEO , and they were way smaller .
Sweet mother Earth
I do n’t know what to think of the Solaren story .
The company really exists , at least there ’s a phone number and people who answer it .
They really did file a patent , but anyone can do that .
But the plan is so grandiose , and so near - term , that there ’s just no way I can see this being remotely possible .
If they said they wanted to launch a 2 kW testbed in 2016 that ’s one thing , but a 200 MW production system ?
Hear that beeping ?
That ’s my BS detector going off .
Treasurys have been sending strong signals these days .
Today 10 yr Treasury yields dropped to 3.19 % , a drop of 11 points on one single day :
Note the huge gap on opening today .
On September 2nd I noted :
Today ’s action in gold was beautifully complemented by corresponding action in Treasury yields which dropped by 8 basis points to close at 3.29 % , a recent July low .
If it breaks , the way down is more or less open :
Click on image to enlarge .
Now take a look back at the first chart I posted .
Notice how that support mark of 3.29 % was n’t even touched for a second today !
Buyers leaped past that level and bid up prices so at opening yields were already at around 3.25 % .
I am not saying that this necessarily has to mean something , but the likelihood that it expresses a huge demand for safety on any piece of bad news at this point , should not be discarded .
What else was noteworthy on this one day today ?
Look at the development in the gap between 10yr Treasury ( IEF ) , 20+yr Treasury ( TLT ) vs. corporate ( HYG ) bond yields :
See “ Corporate Bond Yields – Where to From Here ? ” for the significance of the above data .
This may all be just a small twitch .
But it may also be the mother of all warning signs .
Mind the Treasury market in all your investment decisions .

A family medical professional wearing a stethoscope in Dorchester , Mass .
Boston had the longest wait times to see family doctors and specialists , according to a Merritt Hawkins study .
HOW LONG IT TAKES HOW LONG IT TAKES Average appointment wait times in days for five medical specialties included in the Merritt Hawkins survey :
For complete survey results , see merritthawkins.com
They say patience is a virtue , but for those who need health care , it 's a necessity .
And if you live in an urban area , you could be waiting several months to get an appointment with specialist or family doctor .
A study by Merritt Hawkins and Associates shows that appointment wait times have increased on average by more than a week since the survey was last conducted in 2004 .
Merritt Hawkins , a consulting firm that specializes in recruiting physicians and other health care professionals , surveyed more than 1,150 medical offices in 15 cities .
The survey measured average appointment wait times in family practices as well as four specialties : cardiology , dermatology , obstetrics / gynecology and orthopedic surgery .
The survey found that , on average , wait times have increased by 8.6 days per city .
Boston had the longest wait , averaging 49.6 days , followed by Philadelphia with 27 and Los Angeles with 24.2 .
The shortest was Atlanta with an 11.2 - day wait .
In all cities among all the specialties , the wait was 20.5 days .
The survey surmises that long wait times in Boston could be the result in part of the 2006 health reform initiative that requires nearly every Massachusetts resident to get health insurance .
Phil Miller , vice president of public relations for Merritt Hawkins and Associates , sees one clear solution to long wait times : " We need to be training more physicians , particularly primary care physicians , " he says .
" We have been training the same number of doctors for the past 25 years , but a lot has changed in the last quarter - century . "
Government restrictions on education spending have curtailed the supply of doctors , says Richard Cooper , professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania .
At the same time , he says , the government is trying to increase insurance coverage and access .
" This will demand more physicians .
It 's like preparing for a war having previously decided to stop training soldiers .
Madness , " he writes in an e-mail .
The survey also asked which offices accept Medicaid patients .
It found that 55 % of all metro markets accept Medicaid , a program for the needy .
Minneapolis ranked highest ; 82.4 % of offices accepted Medicaid .
Dallas , at 38.6 % , ranked lowest .
Medicaid 's vulnerable patients often have to jump through hoops to get care , says Joseph Heyman , chairman of the American Medical Association .
" Our nation has a clear history of reducing health care program budgets through across - the - board cuts to health care professionals , and the impact on patients is reduced access to care , " Heyman says .
" Public safety - net programs like Medicaid and Medicare need to be properly financed so that they work for patients and physicians . "

The strange quest : Mathematics as Concrete Art
I have to confess that this post has not been an easy one to write .
I wanted to express some ideas that are difficult to put into words .
The central , rather playful , thesis is that pure mathematics itself is a branch of concrete art .
Let me begin with some easy facts .
This month , I have had the great fortune to be able to take part in a studio exhibition with a group of constructive / concrete artists , including members of the systems group from the 1960’s .
The exhibition was curated by Trevor Clarke in Peter Lowe ’s studio .
As a result I have had a chance to have some fascinating conversations with several artists , including Peter Lowe , Trevor Clarke and Jeffrey Steele .
One goal of the exhibition is to start dialogues between artists and technicians , in the spirit of the studio exhibitions that started the systems group in the 1950 ’s around Adrian Heath and Kenneth and Mary Martin .
With that in mind I would like to give some of the ideas that emerged for me from the conversations .
Constructive and Concrete art arose from a natural conclusion of the process of abstraction .
In the case of concrete art this is explicit and stated in Van Doesberg ’s “ Manifesto of Concrete Art ” .
Abstraction began by cutting away the figurative and symbolic content of artworks .
As this program progresses more and more is cut away until , in a natural conclusion , one is left with nothing .
Nothing is a fascinating concept .
It is certainly not a trivial one , as we see with relatively late arrival of zero as a number .
It does not , however , give a large space in which ideas can work .
An empty canvas is an empty canvas and one ends up unable to tell the profound from the lazy .
Concrete art emerges from this vacuum as the attempt to produce artworks that are not empty but have no figurative or symbolic meaning .
It seems that this goal can be achieved in two distinct ways .
One can either take the subconscious or irrational approach that leads to mysticism or the hyper-rational approach to create small works with their own logic .
For obvious reasons I want to consider the second here .
This would seem to argue for a very subjective art , as we must not only consider different personal opinions about a piece , but the individual world that each piece inhabits .
Constructivism is more ambitious than this .
The idea of removing figure and symbol is not nihilism , but a desire to address raw or objective beauty .
It is of course fully accepted that no such beauty exists .
This leads to a strange quest , where the goal is known to be unobtainable .
I come into this from a different point of view .
My art does not contain mathematics in order to have no content , but to communicate mathematics .
The mathematics is precisely the symbolic meaning .
Yet what is mathematics ?
My personal definition is that mathematics is any concept that can be considered without reference to the real world .
I know that this is an intellectual land grab , but I favour overlapping disciplines anyway .
Putting this definition together with the constructivist quest for beauty led to some interesting similarities .
Let us consider a parallel history of the two topics .
In the late nineteenth century , while painting was starting the move to abstraction with the work of impressionists and others , mathematics was starting a re-examination of its axiomatic roots .
Just as art became more abstract the concepts and fields of mathematics were being cut back to rest on top of the set theory of Cantor and Dedekind .
By the 1930 ’s the impossibilities inherent in both quests were becoming apparent .
A year after Van Doesberg published the “ Manifesto of Concrete Art ” , Göodel published “ On formally undecidable propositions of Principia Mathematica and related systems ” .
This work showed that whatever axioms one considered ( that allow arithmetic ) there would always be holes , statements that the axioms did not say were true or false , and one could never be sure that there was not a contradiction a statement both true and false .
This was the end of the dream of a perfect mathematical machine .
Pure mathematics thus joined in the strange quest , seeking patterns and structure without the possibility of obtaining a final goal .
In fact by the 1940 ’s the two subjects were recognising their similarities .
Hardy published “ A mathematician ’s Apology ” in 1940 that claimed that mathematics was an art form .
With the humility that only a Cambridge academic can feel for his own place in the world he declared :
“ A mathematician , like a painter or poet , is a maker of patterns .
If his patterns are more permanent than theirs , it is because they are made with ideas . ”
The quest of a mathematician , to Hardy , was to find beauty and truth , yet without defining exactly what he meant by either .
This bears a striking similarity to the vision of constructivism that I described above .
It is no surprise therefore that , perhaps unaware that mathematics had been declared an art , in 1949 Max Bill considered “ The Mathematical Approach in Contemporary Art ” .
I want to reverse Bill and consider that perhaps the mathematical structure itself , from gauge theory to groups , from motives to matrices from the games of Conway to the technical depth of Grothendieck , stopping on the way to take in the Hopf fibration and bifurcation , the Penrose tiling , and the 57 - cell , is simply one giant work of concrete art put together by a cast of thousands .
An edifice built with some logical consistency on the Zermelo - Frankael axioms and the fudge factor axiom of choice .
So here ’s to everyone pursuing the strange quest in the belief that the universe has an inexhaustible supply of secrets , and there will always be new beauty to be found even in some of its simplest corners .

Some party .
After getting dressed for what they thought would be a Sunday night festival of fun in a posh Rome neighborhood , 200 young Italian women found themselves being pitched to convert to Islam by none other than Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi , who was attending a United Nations food conference in the city .
The women were responding to an advertisement posted by a local agency seeking “ attractive girls between 18 and 35 years old ” and 5 ’ 7 ’’ or taller .
Miniskirts and low - cut dresses were out of the question , but high heels and fur coats were a -okay .
In a nation where the prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , is known to enjoy being surrounded by beautiful women , this group must have expected at least an exciting evening .
But after cooling their heels for about an hour at the Libyan ambassador ’s residence , the women were greeted by Gaddafi , who went on and on about why they should become Muslims .
Gaddafi ’s lecture included claims that Jesus Christ was not crucified and his insistence that Islam is not anti-woman .
“ Jesus was sent to the Jews , ” he said , “ not for you , but Muhammad was sent to all humans . ”
Although the evening did not pan out as they had hoped , the women did not leave empty handed .
Each received $ 75 , a copy of the Quran and a copy of The Green Book , in which Gaddafi expounds on his philosophy of life .
They also received an invitation to visit him in Libya .

Increasingly facial recognition is picking out people in a crowd A surveillance state , with cameras on every street is commonplace but now Big Business is also turning to Big Brother .
Face recognition , behaviour analysing surveillance cameras , biometric profiling and the monitoring and storing of our shopping patterns has made snooping into our habits , movements and private lives ever easier .
Dismayed at its shrinking power to market to us via traditional media or even the internet , the private sector is now proposing to reach potential customers in ways that critics say should have us all concerned .
" There is an enormous pent - up demand for personalised location advertising , whether it is on your cellphone or PDA , on your radio in your car , or on the billboards you walk by on the streets and inside stores , " says Bruce Schneier , chief security technology officer of BT .
" This is yet another technological intrusion into privacy .
And like all such intrusions , it will be taken as far as the owner of that intrusion finds it profitable . "
Emotional reactions
Are adverts watching you ?
New surveillance technology could even evaporate the advertiser 's favourite grouse that " half of advertising is wasted , but we do n't know which half " .
Advertisers are turning to " intelligent " digital billboards that use cameras to watch you watching the ads .
In Germany , developers have placed video cameras into street advertisements attempting to discern people 's emotional reactions to the ads , according to the Washington - based privacy advocate outfit the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) .
It warns that this type of surveillance encroaches on civil liberties .
Such face , voice and behaviour technology could be a means of tracking individuals on a mass level across their entire lives , it says .
Pushed by the demands of advertisers and security - minded governments , these technologies are becoming so increasingly smart and intrusive that they now resemble something out of science fiction , it warns .
Science fact Some of the technology available now seems to have overtaken fiction .
When an interactive ad shouts out to Tom Cruise 's character in the 2002 film Minority Report : " John Anderton , you could use a Guinness ! "
It identified him as he walked through a mall by scanning the unique pattern of his iris .
This is now pretty standard .
Face recognition technology is proving to be a handier , more sophisticated tool to pick us out on the street , a crowded room or at passport control .
Such systems are able to automatically detect and identify human faces using recognition algorithms .
The first step for a facial recognition system is to recognise a human face and extract it from the rest of the scene .
Next , the system measures the distance between the features -- a distinctive aspect of our faces that does not change with disguises or even surgery .
Matches can then be found in databases in under a second , although 100 % accuracy is not yet guaranteed .
Currently the private sector is finding such systems useful for what it calls " targeted marketing , " or " dynamic advertising . "
Japan 's NEC , for instance , sells face - recognition technology to allow advertisers to tailor what ad is showing on a digitised screen depending on the viewer 's sex and age .
Tracking systems , such as these , can determine the viewer 's gender 85 - 90 % of the time , approximate age and ethnicity , and change the ads accordingly .
NEC denies the system raises privacy concerns as it does not store any images , only the analysed results ( age and sex ) based on those images .
But as Schneier points out systems like these are likely liable to " function creep " where a technology is brought in for one purpose , to profile your sex while viewing an ad for example , and then begins to push the boundaries .
" Once the cameras are installed and operational , once they 're networked to central computers , then it's a simple matter of upgrading the software , " he says .
" And if they can do more -- if they can provide more " value " to the advertisers -- then of course they will .
To think otherwise is simply naive . "
And when advertisers start to follow us , our privacy , our right to be left alone will be severely compromised , he thinks .
More control EU commissioner Viviane Reding wants to see tighter controls Democratic governments , charged with protecting us from such violations , are beginning to wake up to these practices .
The US is about to propose a bill to ensure that consumers know what information is being collected about them .
The EU promises to rigorously police what it claims are already stringent controls on our personal data .
" Europeans must have the right to control how their personal information is used , " Viviane Reding , the EU 's commissioner for information society and media told BBC news .
" We can not give up this basic principle , and have all our exchanges monitored , surveyed and stored , in exchange for a promise of ' more relevant ' advertising . "
Despite such assurances , given the pervasiveness of such technologies firstly on the internet and now spreading to the physical world , what we do about them in the next few years will be crucial .
It might control our privacy for generations to come say human rights advocates .
" Companies are increasingly impatient to get to us and once these practices are commonplace it will hard to reverse them , " says Marc Rotenberg director of EPIC .
" Particularly as , ironically , we lose privacy these companies are gaining secrecy . "
It would seem sensible to debate now how far business and the state should be allowed to tag us while we still have a privacy to protect .

how cash - for - clunkers played out : " data - share - img= " " data - share = " twitter , facebook , linkedin , reddit , google , mail " data - share - count = " false " >
Good on the AP for FOIAing the details of how cash - for - clunkers played out :
The single most common swap — which occurred more than 8,200 times — involved Ford F - 150 pickup owners who took advantage of a government rebate to trade their old trucks for new Ford F - 150s .
The fuel economy for the new trucks ranged from 15 mpg to 17 mpg based on engine size and other factors , an improvement of just 1 mpg to 3 mpg over the clunkers .
It gets worse :
In at least 145 cases the government reported consumers traded old vehicles that got better than or the same mileage as the new vehicle they purchased .
A driver in Negaunee , Mich. , traded a 1987 Suburban that got 18 mpg for $ 3,500 toward a new Silverado pickup that got only 15 mpg .
An Indianapolis driver traded a 1985 Mercedes 190 that got 27 mpg for $ 3,500 toward a new Volkswagen Rabbit that got only 24 mpg .
In at least 15 deals in nine states , owners of large pickups cashed in old trucks for between $ 3,500 and $ 4,500 toward new Hummer H3 SUVs that got only 16 mpg .
I think this is safely the worst policy implemented to date by the Obama administration : it has almost nothing in the way of redeeming features .
Let ’s hope it was some kind of weird aberration .

Overview
SVN migrations to Git can vary in complexity , depending on how old the repository is and how many branches were created and merged , as well as if you use regular SVN or a facade such as SVK to do your branching and merging .
If you have a fairly new repository and the standard setup of a trunk , branches , and tags directory , your job could be pretty easy .
However if you ’ve done a ton of branching and merging , or your repository follows a non-standard directory setup , or that setup changed over time , you could have a bit more work on your hands .
SVN to Git Conversion
Building Git
The very first thing to do is make sure you are running the newest git .
And for this I recommend from source .
So grab it and do the usual compile stuff
$ wget http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.6.5.2.tar.bz2 $ tar xjf git-1.6.5.2.tar.bz2 $ cd git -1.6.5.2 $ ./ configure $ make
Now I ’m not sure if this is because I am always using local : : lib but I tend to get this error after a while of building .
If you do n’t get it you can obviously skip this step
Only one of PREFIX or INSTALL_BASE can be given
This is fixable by going into the git / perl directory and manually building the perl modules
$ cd perl / $ perl Makefile .
PL
Then go back up a directory and finish the build
$ cd .. $ make $ sudo make install
Using git-svn
If you have made any merges using SVK then you should grab the git -svn from Sam Vilain ’s git branch here .
I had to download it because the git clone was n’t working so grab it like so
$ wget http://download.github.com/samv-git-ccef8e0.tar.gz
Open it up , and copy the git - svn. perl script into your bin directory
$ tar xzvf samv - git - ccef8e0.tar.gz $ cd samv - git - ccef8e0 $ cp git-svn.perl ~/bin/git-svn
Now you can git svn clone your repository with the git -svn command .
The –prefix=svn / is necessary because otherwise the tools can’t tell apart SVN revisions from imported ones .
If you are using the standard trunk , branches , tags layout you ’ll just put –stdlayout like we have below .
However if you had something different you may have to pass the –trunk , –branches , and –tags in to identify what is what .
For example if your repository structure was trunk / companydir and you branched that instead of trunk , you would probably want ‘ –trunk=trunk/companydir –branches=branches ‘ .
You can optionally provide an authors file , and the last option to our script is the repository URL .
$ git -svn clone -- prefix = svn/ -- stdlayout -- authors - file = authors.
txt
http://example.com/svn
This can take a few minutes or as long as a few hours depending how big your repository is .
When its done you should end up with a git checkout of your repository .
If you look at your remote branches you ’ll see that its ported our svn stuff with the svn prefix we used
$ git branch -r svn /dbic_versioning svn/ feed_source svn/trunk
Anyway at this point it does n’t hurt to create a tarball of your project so you can get back to it later if you screw up .
Fixing the Git Repository
There are a few more scripts you need to grab to finish this off .
We want to clone the git - svn - abandon repository for these .
$ git clone git://github.com/nothingmuch/git-svn-abandon.git
Now go into that directory and copy the new scripts into your local bin directory , or wherever you feel is good for your purposes
$ cd git - svn- abandon $ cp git- svn- abandon -* ~/bin/
You can now run git - svn - abandon - fix - refs , which will run through all the imported refs , recreating properly dated annotated tags , and makes branches out of everything else .
It ’ll also rename trunk to master .
$ git-svn- abandon - fix - refs
We can see that it took the things that our git branch -r command earlier listed and imported them into actual git branches , as well as putting us on the master branch which is analogous to the trunk from svn
$ git branch dbic_versioning feed_source * master
Grafting Your Branches
Depending how correct you want your repository , you could skip this step .
However it could be a good idea to try to get your merge history correct .
This requires a little bit of understanding of the git internals , so at a minimum you should read and understand this introduction .
There is also a nice presentation of how git works here that you may consider watching .
So now you understand ( you went over those links right ? ) that the way git figures out merges is such that it basically creates a new node on the graph that points to both the head of master and of the branch .
And then it basically takes the file contents from the 3 points , the new merge base node ( the ancestor ) , and each parent , deltafies them and applies the result to the ancestor .
Obviously if they do n’t apply cleanly a conflict is created and must be resolved .
The previous revisions contents is no longer relevant at all , except as a part of history , and our new snapshot of the history is born .
So this is basically what we have to fix .
This is a snapshot from gitk of my repository .
We can see near the bottom that it branched properly , but even though the repository was merged in svn , it does n’t appear to be merged in our migration to git .
The way to fix this is to edit the .git / info / grafts file .
With my great photoshop skills I ’m going to point out what goes in there
We need to take what the first arrow is pointing to , and tell git that its parents are its current parent ( the third arrow ) as well as the point the branch was merged in ( the second arrow ) .
So all we have to do is add the hash from each of those commits , put the top node first , then the second and third with a space in between each to the .git / info /grafts file .
After we add those to the .git / info/grafts file we can just reload gitk or gitx to see those changes that visually show the branch was merged
When you are done you can run git - svn - abandon - cleanup which cleans up SVK style merge commit messages and removes git - svn - id strings .
Another important thing that happens is the grafts entries are incorporated into the filtered commits , so the extra merge metadata becomes clonable
$ git svn-abandon - cleanup
Publish Your Repository
If you followed the last article you ’ve got a gitosis setup that we can use to store our code centrally .
So depending what host this is on you can import it like so
$ git remote add origin git@localhost : repository .git $ git push -- all $ git push -- tags
And we ’re done .
Conclusion
We ’ve gone over how to migrate an SVN repository to Git and how to deal with some of the complications of how Git interprets our repository based on what was in SVN and how to go about fixing that .
Hopefully we also learned a little bit about Git too in the process .

They do n't all need glasses .
But if you always suspected basketball referees are biased -- well , you 're right , according to a couple of professors who 've studied the matter .
Refs favor the home team , the academics say .
They 're big on " make - up " calls .
They make more calls against teams in the lead , and the discrepancy grows if the game is on national TV .
The professors studied 365 college games during the 2004 - 05 season and found that refs had a terrific knack for keeping the foul count even , regardless of which team was more aggressive .
Exhibit A : The 2005 Final Four meeting between Illinois and Louisville .
The Illini , known for being more aggressive defensively , got whistled for the first seven fouls .
By the end of the game , the foul count was Louisville 13 , Illinois 12 .
The Illini won 72 - 57 .
Results like this were the norm across all the games the professors studied from that season -- from the Big East to the ACC to the Big Ten and all 63 NCAA tournament games .
The take - home message for coaches :
The more aggressive your teams the better because , in the end , the foul count is going to be about even no matter what .
It helps explain , the professors say , why college basketball has gotten increasingly physical over the past 25 years .
" Part of the reason for the study came from something my coach used to tell me , " said study co-author Kyle Anderson , a visiting professor at Indiana University 's Kelley School of Business , who played at Division III Knox College .
" He said a team can come in and push and shove and grab and hold , and by the end of the game , or end of the half , they 've only got one or two more fouls because officials kind of get tired of calling it . "
Among the key findings , which were published The Journal of Sports Sciences earlier this year :
• The probability of a foul being called on the visiting team was 7 percent higher than on the home team .
• When the home team is leading , the probability of the next foul being called on them was about 6.3 percentage points higher than when the home team was trailing .
The professors also cited an earlier study that concluded there were more calls against teams ahead in games on national TV versus those ahead in locally televised games .
Calling fouls against the leading team tends to keep games closer , the studies said .
• The bigger the difference in fouls between the two teams playing , the more likely it was that the next call would come against the team with fewer fouls .
When the home team had five or more fouls than the visiting team , there was a 69 percent chance the visiting team would be whistled for the next foul .
As part of their 365 - game sample , the professors looked at 93 games played on neutral courts , and the numbers remained largely the same when it came to leveling the foul count .
" There 's something to it , " said Irv Brown , a former official who worked six Final Fours and was supervisor of officials for the Western Athletic and Big Sky conferences .
" If you 're looking at the board and one team has a lot more fouls , you probably look a little harder to do something , subconsciously . "
Brown said he used to experiment and try not to look at the scoreboard , but human nature dictates that referees will .
Same for home - court advantage .
Try as they might , there 's no way a referee can completely block out thousands of fans yelling at him from close range .
" As an official , you get the reputation that you 're tough on the road , and that 's what you want , " Brown said in a telephone interview last week .
" But it takes a lot of years .
You have to get established .
Some guys who are n't established , you 'll see them out there , trying to take some of the heat off , trying to take care of the home crowd . "
Anderson said he talked to a number of referees as part of the research and the majority said " you 're crazy .
We do n't do this . "
" But a few others said , ' Yeah , I try to make it even out , ' " Anderson said .
The NCAA asked for a copy of the study , and Anderson said he has n't received any negative feedback -- at least not yet .
The professors looked only at first halves because teams committing intentional fouls while in catch - up mode at the end of games skewed the second - half results .
Anderson and his co-author , David Pierce of Ball State , made it clear in the study that referees are n't intentionally trying to influence foul counts .
" We 'd like them to have no memory and strictly call what 's going on on the court , " Anderson said .
" But part of this is , if I 'm a ref , I want everyone to think I 'm fair and if I call 10 fouls on one team and two on the other , people are going to think something 's going on here .
It 's sort of subconscious .
And it points out one of the biggest problems with basketball is that it's a very hard game to officiate . "
As usual , the end came without a warning .
On Friday morning Rick Emerson and his in - studio posse -- newsman Tim Riley , producer Sarah Dylan and production assistant Greg Nibler -- were doing what they 've been doing for years : broadcasting their quirky , Portland - based radio talk show .
They left the KUFO - FM headquarters when their morning shift ended at 9 , but by midafternoon one of the station 's new executives , Scott Mahalick , who most had yet to meet , summoned them back :
They were finished .
After just six months as KUFO 's wake - up show -- and 3 1/ 2 years after they started their afternoon show on sister station KCMD - AM -- Emerson and company had been fired .
No time for goodbyes to the audience .
That 's how they do it in broadcasting , lest a disgruntled , just - ex - employee hijack a microphone and raises havoc on the air .
Which is n't to say that Emerson , or any of the other on - air personalities and executives who had been dismissed by the company 's new corporate owners had n't seen it coming .
" You can tell when things are in serious free - fall when you can't get any of the executives to return your e-mails , " Emerson said Monday .
" It 's this weird environment where everyone knows , but nobody says .
I figured it was time to start packing . "
Not just for the Emerson gang , either .
KUFO 's afternoon hosts , Cort and Fatboy , also were let go Friday .
Meanwhile , sister station KUPL was in the midst of its own shake - up .
Main morning host Lee Rogers announced his retirement , effective the end of the year .
The fate of the rest of KUPL 's morning team , Alana Lynn and Jake Byron , has yet to be determined .
At KINK , longtime Portland deejay Dolbeer will be taking over the evening show , while Sean Martin moves to the afternoon drive shift .
A lot of change , but much less surprising once you recall that KUFO , along with KINK - FM , KUPL -FM and KCMD - AM , are all under new management , having been sold by CBS Radio to the new , Portland - based conglomerate , Alpha Broadcasting in August .
The company also picked up Paul Allen 's two local stations , political talker KXL - AM and the all - sports talk station , KXTG -FM , and very quickly set to installing their own executives , and planning for significant changes at all the stations .
" We want to be live and local and based here in Portland , " said Alpha president Bob Proffit .
" Focus is in making the best live radio we can . "
What that will entail is as mysterious as the enormous UFO hovering above Portland in the promotional video airing on KUFO 's Web site .
" It is not our intention to harm you , " an alien voice says .
" We come in peace . "
Which would probably be more reassuring if it were n't for the other tagline hovering above the ad : " The Beast Must Be Fed . "
And while this may seem like a sinister way for a new media company to establish itself as a small , local alternative to the vast media behemoths who run the majority of Portland 's other broadcast outlets , it seems all too familiar to Emerson and company .
Raised in Kennewick , Wash. , and an 11 - year veteran of Portland 's airwaves , Emerson , 36 , has done a lot of his growing up on Portland "s airwaves .
The talk show host has cycled through a few stations and even more owners over the years , but the essence of his show , along with his newsman / sidekick Riley and producer / on - air foil Dylan , has been more or less consistent since 2001 .
The quirky , pop culture - dominated show ( on which this journalist has appeared as an on - and - off guest commentator ) attracted a cult audience that is almost unnervingly enthusiastic .
When Emerson got fired from Entercom 's KOTK - AM in 2005 , his listeners bombarded the station with so many coffee cups ( a protest referring to the host 's addiction to caffeine ) that he was offered a job from a CBS Radio executive who began their first meeting , Emerson said , by asking : " How do you account for your audience 's loyalty ? "
Emerson and friends restarted their midday show at CBS ' KCMD - AM in March of 2006 , and stayed there until this March , when the nationally syndicated morning show KUFO had been running went out of business .
Promoted to the higher - profile morning slot ( where they were allowed to hire back newsman Riley , who had been laid off in a cost - cutting measure the previous December ) , the team went through a bumpy transition .
" We were like the boyfriend who 's so appealing to his girlfriend until they move in together , " Emerson said .
" Once they had us they realized everything about us had to be made over . "
Eventually things seemed to settle down .
But never entirely , which Emerson now chalks up to CBS ' quiet campaign to make its Portland stations suitable for purchase .
Alpha , which is owned largely by Larry Wilson , who had been semi-retired since selling his first company , Citadel Communications , in 2001 , came to terms with CBS in early August .
The new owners began moving in almost immediately , before taking full control in late September .
Much of that time , company president Proffit said , has been devoted to figuring out what Portland radio listeners like to hear , and what they wish they could hear more .
" I think markets tend to be more alike than they are different , " Proffit said .
" But given the opportunity I 'll go with the research .
It 's always best to get a read of the market . "
And though Proffit and his colleagues are being close - mouthed about how their plans will come together on the air , a few hints have emerged .
A disc jockey from Seattle 's KISW -FM who goes by the name Ricker will take over KUFO 's midday slot .
The new morning show will remain a mystery until Wednesday at dawn , Proffit said .
So what 's to become of Portland 's just - extinguished live and local talk radio host ?
Emerson is n't quite certain .
" I 've got possibilities , " he said .
" But I really love Portland .
Of all the places I 've lived , Portland is the only place I 'd call home .
The audience I 've found here , the culture of the place .
This is where I want to be .
Will there be another ' Rick Emerson Show ' ?
Where does it belong ?
At this point , I do n't have an answer . "
All he knows for sure is that the Beast , whatever it is , has been fed .
( CNN ) -- A Kentucky census worker who was found dead in September committed suicide and staged the scene to look like a homicide , authorities said Tuesday .
The body of William E. Sparkman Jr. , 51 , was found September 12 near a cemetery in southeastern Kentucky 's Clay County .
He was wearing only socks .
" A thorough examination of evidence from the scene , to include DNA testing , as well as examination of his vehicle and his residence , resulted in the determination that Mr. Sparkman , alone , handled the key pieces of evidence with no indications of any other persons involved , " Kentucky State Police said .
Sparkman 's wrists were bound with duct tape , and a rope around his neck was tied to a tree , but his body was touching the ground , authorities said .
He had " Fed " written on his chest in black ink .
However , Sparkman 's wrists were loosely bound in front of his body at shoulder width apart , allowing for " considerable mobility , " said Kentucky State Police Capt .
Lisa Rudzinski .
He was also in contact with the ground , " almost on his knees , " she said .
" To survive , all Mr. Sparkman had to do was stand up . "
Lividity on the body -- marks made as blood stops pumping and settles in areas of the body -- showed that Sparkman died in the same position , Rudzinski said .
His glasses were taped to his head , and that tape was underneath tape that held a rag in his mouth , she said .
" Mr. Sparkman had extremely poor eyesight " and so would have needed his glasses secured , Rudzinski said .
But the most compelling evidence came from the fact that Sparkman had obtained $ 600,000 in accidental - death insurance , which would not have paid in the event of a suicide , as late as May , she said .
In addition , he told a " credible witness " of his plans to commit suicide and stage the scene to make it look like he was slain because he worked for the federal government .
The details were consistent with how Sparkman died and was found , Rudzinski said .
The witness did not take action after Sparkman shared his plans out of a belief that he would not follow through , authorities said .
" It was learned that Mr. Sparkman had discussed recent federal investigations and the perceived negative attitudes toward federal entities by some residents of Clay County , " Kentucky state police said in a statement .
Police believe that Sparkman 's primary motive in staging the scene was to ensure that the insurance would be paid , Rudzinski said .
His motive for committing suicide or any secondary motives might never be known , she said , as Sparkman left no note .
" We do n't know what Mr. Sparkman was thinking or why he ultimately committed this act , " she said .
Autopsy results showed no evidence of any cancer or terminal illness , officials said , although it was reported that Sparkman had previously had lymphoma .
Police would not say who the beneficiary of the insurance was .
Forensic analysis of the writing on Sparkman 's chest showed that he had written it himself , Rudzinski said .
Analysts found ink dots , made by writers on completing a letter , at the top of the letters , rather than at the bottom -- as would be expected if someone had made the writing on Sparkman .
Despite a search by authorities , the black felt pen used for the writing has not been found .
Police do not believe that anyone assisted Sparkman , she said .
Sparkman had told the witness , whom police declined to name , that he intended to dispose of some of his personal effects , including his laptop computer and other items .
Police have not found those items , Rudzinski said .
Toxicology tests showed that Sparkman was not drugged or under the influence of any substance , she said .
The red rag removed from his mouth was similar to those found in his pocket and at the scene .
DNA testing of the rags and the rope used in creating a ligature on Sparkman 's neck , as well as 7 feet of discarded rope discarded near his body , found only Sparkman 's DNA , she said .
The police investigation is still open , and additional test results are expected in the next two to three weeks , authorities said .
Authorities met with Sparkman 's son and told him of their findings before publicly releasing them .
" Our hearts go out to him , " Rudzinski said .
" He still lost his father at the end of the day . "
She would not say whether his son accepted the findings , saying she did not want to speak for the family .
One of the most notorious works of art in the history of the Tate Gallery in London is back on exhibition at the Tate Modern .
The interactive exhibition initially went on show 38 years ago and had such an enthusiastic response from the public that art was damaged and the exhibition was forced to close , after just four days .

Recently ITU ( International Telecommunication Union ) has approved a universal mobile charger ; this charger will work with any of your cell phone .
I call it a simple and smart solution to mobile charger problems .
It is estimated that each year 51,000 tones of different chargers are generated .
It ’s very obvious that the chargers are changed with the change in the mobile devices , but now with the universal charger people wo n’t have to do that .
Previously we saw another solution to the problem that a charger will single input has output of all famous company standards .
This way one charger can be used for every device .
However this is a better solution that all mobile phones should have one common input standard for charging like USB standard .
“ Every mobile phone user will benefit from the new Universal Charging Solution ( UCS ) , which enables the same charger to be used for all future handsets , regardless of make and model , ” the ITU said in a statement on Thursday .
These universal chargers would be energy efficient and also environment friendly , as they would reduce the green house gas emission up to 13.6 m tones .
“ This is a significant step in reducing the environmental impact of mobile charging , ” said Malcolm Johnson , director of ITU ’s Telecommunication Standardization Bureau .
The mechanism of these chargers is basically based on the Micro - USB port , the same port that is available at the digital cameras .
Some manufactures might also provide the function ability to detach the cable from the adapter and charge it directly from the computers USB port .
It wo n’t be compulsory for the mobile manufacturers to adopt these chargers .
However some of the manufactures have already signed for it including Motorola , Nokia , Apple , Sony Ericsson , LG , NEC , Qualcomm , Research in Motion , Samsung and Texas Instruments .
The chargers would be launched in the first half of 2010 and would be roll out with new products .

Pentagon backs massive missile sale to Turkey
The Pentagon agency said the sale was essential for Turkey to maintain " a strong and ready self - defense capability that will contribute to an acceptable military balance in the area .
by Staff Writers
Washington ( AFP ) Sept 14 , 2009
The Pentagon has told US lawmakers it is ready to sell Turkey a 7.8 - billion - dollar Patriot missile system , a move designed to bolster its only NATO ally which borders Iran .
The sale would include 13 " fire units , " 72 PAC - 3 interceptor missiles and a host of related hardware , the Pentagon 's Defense Security Cooperation Agency has notified Congress in a document obtained Monday by AFP .
Turkey , a long - time US ally , is the only NATO member to have a land border with Iran .
The Pentagon agency said the sale was essential for Turkey to maintain " a strong and ready self - defense capability that will contribute to an acceptable military balance in the area .
" Turkey will use the PAC - 3 missiles to improve its missile defense capability , strengthen its homeland defense , and deter regional threats . "
The notification comes as tensions soar between the United States and Iran over the Islamic Republic 's nuclear program , which Washington suspects is bid to obtain a nuclear bomb .
Iran has refused to suspend uranium enrichment despite five UN Security Council resolutions calling on it to do so .
Volkswagen and Stanford University go way back , having collaborated on two cool autonomous cars for DARPA , and now they 've gone in together on a laboratory where researchers and students will develop technology they say will lead to safer , greener cars .
The German automaker , through Volkswagen Group of America , is investing $ 5.75 million in the Volkswagen Automotive Innovation Laboratory to spur the creation of new automotive tech .
Along with VW ’s Electronics Research Laboratory in Palo Alto , VAIL gives VW the largest Silicon Valley research presence of any automaker .
“ This collaboration can draw on a long - standing relationship between the Volkswagen Group and Stanford , which continues to increase the exchange between industrial and academic talent , ” Dr. Franz - Josef Paefgen , chairman and CEO of Bentley Motors , said in a statement .
( VW owns Bentley . )
“ The goals are to accelerate automotive - related research on campus , increase opportunities for collaboration between the VW Group and Stanford and build a global community of academic and industrial partners committed to the future of automotive research . ”
VW has been working with Stanford since at least 2005 , when the two collaborated on Stanley , an autonomous Touareg that won the DARPA Grand Challenge that year .
Stanley is now on display at the Smithsonian .
It was followed in 2007 by Junior , a Passat that was runner up in the DARPA Urban Challenge .
That 's Junior in the main pic , being driven sans hands .
Volkswagen , through Audi , also has developed an autonomous TT -S , pictured below , that will attempt to conquer Pike 's Peak sometime next year .
That 's an audacious goal , given the 12.42 - mile course to the 14,110 - foot summit features 156 turns and is among the greatest challenges in motorsports .
Volkswagen 's investment at Stanford includes $ 2 million for building construction and $ 750,000 annually for five years to fund research and teaching activities .
“ When the new building opens early next year , VAIL will provide a home on campus for faculty and students from around the university to work on advanced automotive research , " said Jim Plummer , dean of the Stanford School of Engineering .
" Transportation is a globally important area in which engineers play a vital role . ”
The partners look at VAIL and ERL as an exclusive , combined learning laboratory where Stanford researchers and students as well as visiting scholars will work alongside automotive equipment manufacturers and Silicon Valley experts to foster innovation .
VW and Stanford hope to build on their DARPA partnership and want to leverage their success with Stanley and Junior in a variety of applications .
Volkswagen also plans to work on further development of its Audi Clean Air Initiative .
The company 's sees a future where linked , intelligent vehicles interact with each other to increase safety and ease the environmental impact of automobiles
“ By partnering with a prestigious university such as Stanford , we ’ve built a global community of academic and industry professionals that are committed to the future of automotive research , ” said Dr. Burkhard Huhnke , executive director of the Electronics Research Laboratory .
“ Our event is intended to showcase the successful partnership between VW and Stanford that has helped drive automobile innovation into the future . ”

Only 25 adult Madagascar pochards have been counted in the wild Conservationists have taken the first step in their quest to save the world 's rarest duck - the Madagascar pochard .
After being hampered by harsh weather and illness , a team successfully set up a small rearing facility for the ducks .
This rescue plan was mounted when scientists realised how close the birds were to the brink of extinction .
The pochards were believed to be extinct in the late 1990s .
They were rediscovered in 2006 but are now classified as critically endangered .
The project involved the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust ( WWT ) .
The birds were found on only one volcanic lake in Madagascar .
A reconnaissance visit to the lake earlier this year spotted only six females and revealed evidence that chicks of just a few weeks old had died .
So the decision was made to protect the few remaining birds by setting up a captive breeding programme .
The birds survive at one location where human disturbance is minimal
Duck - watching Scientists monitored the birds during the breeding season and noted when the female birds were preparing to lay eggs .
" Duck specialists " then flew to Madagascar to bring the precious eggs into captivity .
Dr Glyn Young from Durrell said it was a " race against time " to get to the lake before the eggs started hatching .
" Massive electrical storms had delayed our arrival in the country .
Once all the equipment had cleared Customs , we had to wait for three days as a bridge was repaired on the only access road to the lake , " he recalled .
It was a delicate eight - hour journey on really dodgy roads
Andrew Terry
Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust " To add to our woes , having finally made it to the lake , we all fell ill ! "
But , after all the set - backs , the team commandeered part of a local hotel to create a temporary breeding facility .
They then travelled to the lake and removed a batch of ready - to - hatch eggs from a lake - side nest .
" The eggs were hatched by the side of the lake , " said Andrew Terry from Durrell .
" We set up a lab in a tent with all the equipment and the chicks fully hatched out in an incubator . "
The day - old chicks were then taken to the holding facility in a four - wheel - drive .
" It was a delicate eight - hour journey on really dodgy roads , " Mr Terry said .
Peter Cranswick from WWT said : " Safely bringing birds into captivity marks the start of a 20 - or 30 - year conservation project that will also help restore wetlands across the region . "
Eight rescued ducklings are now reported to be doing very well .
They represent a very large proportion of the population ; as of 2008 , only 25 adult birds were counted in the wild .
Work is continuing and the team will attempt to secure two more clutches in the coming few weeks .

Susan Davis reports on the magic of state politics .
The wizard lobby is wading into Maine ’s fight over gay marriage .
The Harry Potter Alliance , a Massachusetts - based nonprofit that is “ dedicated to bringing the themes of Harry Potter into the real world ” announced today a grassroots effort to help defeat a Nov. 3 ballot initiative in Maine that seeks to repeal a recent state law legalizing same sex marriage .
Associated Press A potential future member of the Harry Potter Alliance .
The alliance announced an Oct. 24 concert series in Portland featuring Harry and the Potters and Draco and the Malfoys — two indie rock bands that sing songs from the perspective of Harry Potter characters .
The bands and concert attendees will then spend the day canvassing voters to vote against Proposition 1 in conjunction with Maine Equality , a gay rights group .
Then , the bands will play a second concert , which will be live - streamed to fans who are also being asked to take part in a phone bank that day .
The lobbying day is being constructed as a House Cup Competition from the books — including the creation of a feature in the phone bank system that allows participants to register and earn points based on which House at Hogwarts they identify with .
Headlining the effort is Evanna Lynch , who plays Luna Lovegood in the Harry Potter films .
Autodesk has lost ( again ) its bid to shut down eBay resellers of its terrifically expensive AutoCAD software — but the issues raised by the case are n't anywhere close to being settled .
The dispute arose when Autodesk was trolling eBay for sales of its software in an effort to cut down on piracy and counterfeit copies of AutoCAD .
It found Tim Vernor , a full - time eBay reseller , who was offering AutoCAD far below the price of the newest version from Autodesk .
The software maker managed to have Vernor 's eBay access cut off for a month in 2007 , and eventually sued him for copyright infringement in a federal court .
But Vernor 's copies were't counterfeit ; it emerged during the court case that he had obtained them from Seattle architecture firm Cardwell / Thomas Associates ( CTA ) , which sold them in 2007 along with a bunch of old office equipment .
This did n't matter to Autodesk ; the company asserts that it controlled the software anyway because it had only " licensed " it to customers under specific terms that eliminated the right to resell the software .
US law typically gives a buyer the right to do what he or she likes with a product , including selling it to others ( read our primer on the " first sale " doctrine ) .
As the judge sums up Autodesk 's argument , " Autodesk believes that it still owns the AutoCAD packages in Mr. Vernor ’s possession .
It contends that it never transferred ownership of the AutoCAD packages to CTA .
Indeed , in Autodesk ’s view , it never transfers ownership of AutoCAD packages to anyone . "
So did Vernor have the right to sell the copies ?
Judge Richard Jones ruled in Vernor 's favor in 2008 .
With discovery completed and both sides pressing the judge for summary judgment , Jones ruled again this week — again for Vernor .
One new wrinkle has emerged over the course of the case : CTA had actually agreed way back in 2002 to " destroy all copies of AutoCAD software in the AutoCAD packages that it [ later ] transferred to Mr. Vernor in 2007 " as part of a discounted AutoCAD upgrade .
So Autodesk went after CTA as well and obtained a consent decree in which the architecture firm " agreed that it had breached its promise to destroy the AutoCAD packages , and that it had transferred those packages to Mr. Vernor in violation of Autodesk ’s copyright . "
Whoops .
Messy justice
But back to Vernor .
Judge Jones ruled this week that Autodesk had in fact licensed its software , but that this was immaterial ; what mattered was whether the license " transferred ownership " ( more like buying a book ) or was a " mere license " ( more like renting a movie ) .
Although groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation called the decision a major one for their side , Judge Jones made clear that the issue was swamplike in its murkiness .
The Ninth Circuit , whose jurisdiction Jones is under , has issued various ( and contradictory ) ways of thinking about the difference between a " transfer of ownership " and a " mere license . "
Jones was unable to reconcile the competing precedents , and so he decided the issue based the " oldest precedent among conflicting opinions from three - judge Ninth Circuit panels . "
That precedent favored the idea that Autodesk had essentially transferred ownership when someone purchased an AutoCAD license ; that in turn triggered " first sale " rights to resell the software ; that in turn vindicated Vernor 's eBay auctions .
If this sounds like the messiest form of justice , it is .
Jones even admits that if he had to follow more recent precedent , Autodesk would win the case .
Given the conflicting opinions and the fact that the Ninth Circuit is currently considering two similar cases ( one about reselling " promo " CDs , the other involving game developer Blizzard ) , EFF and others hope that the Ninth Circuit will soon provide more clarity .
Killing software devs or killing libraries ?
Both sides in the case resorted to apocalyptic rhetoric in making their cases .
Autodesk told the court , for example , that " this court 's interpretation of ' owner ' will harm consumers and software producers alike .
It suggests , for example , that software prices would rise if producers had to confront the possibility of resale , and that resale promotes piracy . "
In other words , getting rid of used gaming and CD stores ( the " secondary market " ) would actually lower prices for consumers .
Vernor was skeptical of the claim , telling the court that " Autodesk ’s preferred interpretation of ' owner ' would give copyright holders of all stripes the ability to destroy secondary markets for their works by the simple expedient of declaring transfers of copies of their works to be ' licenses ' rather than sales .
For example , a book publisher could transfer its wares pursuant to licenses retaining title and barring resale or use by other parties , effectively eliminating not only the secondhand market , but preventing a library from lending the book as well . "
Which do you want — the death of libraries or the crippling effects of software piracy ?
Judge Jones saw the question as a false dichotomy , chiding both sides .
" Piracy depends on the number of people willing to engage in piracy , and a pirate is presumably just as happy to unlawfully duplicate software purchased directly from Autodesk as he is to copy software purchased from a reseller like Mr. Vernor , " he wrote .
As for the death of the secondary market and the end of libraries , " Mr. Vernor ’s fear of the destruction of established resale markets also seems misplaced .
The court notes , for example , that widespread piracy of musical recordings from compact disks has not led the music industry to adopt a restrictive licensing regime like the one Autodesk advocates . "

Prof Nutt said ministers ignored his advice in reclassifying cannabis MPs have asked Home Secretary Alan Johnson to explain his decision to sack the government 's chief drugs adviser .
The Commons Science Committee has written to him asking for clarification of the reasons for the decision and the sequence of events leading up to it .
It wants to know whom he consulted before removing Professor David Nutt and whether the adviser broke any rules in making comments about cannabis risk .
Mr Johnson said Prof Nutt overstepped the mark in criticising drug policy .
Version of events
The home secretary said he lost confidence in the chairman of the advisory panel on the misuse of drugs after he suggested cannabis posed less of a risk than alcohol and tobacco .
Prof Nutt 's sacking led to an outcry in the scientific community and prompted two other members of the panel to quit .
The committee has discussed holding an inquiry into the affair but wants to gather evidence from the main players before deciding whether to conduct hearings .
Lib Dem MP
Phil Willis , the committee 's chairman , said he was asking the home secretary for his account of events leading up to the sacking in light of the " considerable " media coverage of the story .
He said the committee was keen to ascertain whether Prof Nutt had breached the panel 's remit or the code of conduct for scientific advisers in any of his public comments about the relative risk of different drugs .
In addition , Mr Johnson has been asked to confirm whether he consulted Professor John Beddington , the government 's chief scientific adviser , before taking the decision and if not , to explain why .
The home secretary is also being pressed on his views on the future of the advisory panel and whether , following the spate of resignations , it has " sufficient expertise " to carry out its functions .
The committee has also written to Prof Nutt and Prof Beddington asking them for their version of events .
In July , the committee recommended that members of advisory committees should not be criticised for publishing scientific papers or making statements as professionals independent of their public role .
It also urged ministers to speak up in support of scientific advisers whenever their independence was threatened by political actions .
Prof Nutt has criticised the decision to sack him and floated the idea of setting up a separate advisory body .
Gordon Brown has backed the home secretary 's decision , saying the government could not afford to send " mixed messages " on drugs .

Google Chrome Frame – accessibility black hole
See update 07/2012 : Google Chrome accessibility update
Google have released Chrome Frame a plugin - in for Internet Explorer “ that seamlessly brings Google Chrome ’s open web technologies and speedy JavaScript engine to Internet Explorer . ”
What it also does is seamlessly bring Google Chrome ’s lack of support for assistive technologies to Internet Explorer .
If a page is viewed through Google Chrome Frame in Internet Explorer no content is available to the user of assistive technology ( AT ) .
This can be illustrated using the Microsofts accexplorer tool :
An example page viewed without Google chrome frame :
When not using Google Chrome Frame , all of the content is available in Internet Explorer to assistive technology via the MSAA Accessibility API .
The same example page viewed using the Google Chrome Frame plug -in :
No content is available to assistive technologies via the MSAA accessibility API .
Effectively the whole page becomes invisible to users of AT .
Why would a user of AT install Google Chrome Frame ?
Like other people it is presumed users of AT want the opportunity to take advantage of the latest technologies and powerful new features Google Chrome provides , and may want to install the plug - in if they are prompted to do so to access site content .
What does the lack of support for AT in Google Chrome Frame mean ?
Users of AT are locked out of taking adavantage of “ Google Chrome ’s open web technologies and speedy JavaScript engine ” until Google makes its Google Chrome Browser and Google Chrome Frame plug - in fully support assistive technology .

NEW DELHI 
The leaking of a long - awaited confidential report on one of the most divisive attacks in modern Indian history raised a furor in India ’s Parliament on Monday , with lawmakers demanding to know how the report made its way to a newspaper and cable news channel .
The report , 17 years in the making , is an investigation of the destruction of the Babri Masjid , a mosque in the town of Ayodyha , by radical Hindu activists who claimed the site as the birthplace of the god Ram .
They claimed Muslim rulers had destroyed the temple and replaced it with a mosque in the 16th century .
After years of heated protest over the site , a Hindu mob stormed the mosque in 1992 , reducing it to rubble .
The destruction of the mosque set off violent clashes between Hindus and Muslims that left more than 1,000 dead , mostly Muslims .
The scale of the violence was among the worst since the partition of British India , and bitterness and recrimination over the event have reverberated for years .
Saudi Aramco pumps about 10 million barrels of oil a day , about four times as much as Exxon Mobil Corp .
How much oil Aramco , the national oil company of Saudi Arabia , can pump has an enormous impact on oil prices – and therefore the global economy .
So , what to make then of Aramco ’s recent interest in supercomputers ?
The biannual list of the world ’s 500 fastest computers was released on Tuesday and Aramco had two new entries at No. 119 and No. 134 .
Both are Dell clusters , running Intel processors and both are very , very fast .
The oil industry uses Concorde - jet speed computing to aid it understanding underground reservoirs and to look for new sources of oil and gas .
Aramco used another computer cluster to build a “ full field model ” of the Safaniya oilfield in 2008 .
Clearly , Aramco is taking a sophisticated approach to understanding its remaining oil resources .
And peak oilers will likely argue that Aramco ’s interest in teraflops is a sign that it needs all the help it can get to ensure oil keep flowing out of its once mighty fields .
After all , why bother throwing so much muscle into understanding the reservoir if there were no worries about its future performance .
Breast milk , long revered for the nutritional advantages it gives a newborn , could be just as vital in terms of infant development , a leading scientist will claim this week .
Up to three different types of stem cells have been discovered in breast milk , according to revolutionary new research .
Dr Mark Cregan , medical director at the Swiss healthcare and baby equipment company Medela , believes the existence of stem cells means breast milk could help a child " fulfil its genetic destiny " , with a mother 's mammary glands taking over from her placenta to guide infant development once her child is born .
" Breast milk is the only adult tissue where more than one type of stem cell has been discovered .
That is very unique and implies a lot about the impressive bioactivity of breast milk and the consequential benefits to the breastfed infant , " said Dr Cregan , who is speaking at Unicef 's Baby Friendly Initiative conference this week .
His research has isolated adult stem cells of epithelial ( mammary ) and immune origin , with " very preliminary evidence " that breast milk also contains stem cells that promotes the growth of muscle and bone tissue .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Scientists will use his discovery , made at the University of Western Australia , in Perth , Australia , to attempt to harvest stem cells from breast milk for research on a range of issues – from why some mothers struggle to produce milk to testing out new drugs that could aid milk production .
" There is a plentiful resource of tissue - specific stem cells in breast milk , which are readily available and from a non-invasive and completely ethical source , " Dr Cregan said .
Advocates hope the discovery will help to lift the UK 's breastfeeding rates : only one - third of babies are exclusively breastfed at one week , the number dropping to one - fifth at six weeks .
At five months , only 3 per cent of mothers still exclusively nurse their babies – although the World Health Organisation recommends that babies should consume only breast milk until they are at least six months old .
Rosie Dodd , campaigns director at the National Childbirth Trust , said : " This finding highlights the many factors that are in breast milk that we know so little about and that all have different advantages , such as helping a baby 's immune system to develop . "
Dr Cregan said the discovery of immune stem cells was the " most exciting development " , adding , " It 's quite possible that immune cells in breast milk can survive digestion and end up in the infant 's circulation .
This has been shown to be occurring in animals , and so it would be unsurprising if this was also occurring in human infants . "
British scientists gave a cautious welcome to Dr Cregan 's discovery , warning that just because stem cells exist in breast milk did not mean that they could be used to develop a therapy – the ultimate goal of stem cell research .
Chris Mason , professor of regenerative medicine at University College London , said : " It may give us some insight into specific breast diseases and is potentially valuable when it comes to drug discovery and drug development but it is fanciful to think it could provide routine therapies . "
Jailbreak status update of the new 3GS .
Apparently , Apple is n’t taking this whole iPhone jailbreaking hooplah too lightly .
Last week , Apple began shipping 3GS iPhones with an updated bootrom ( iBoot - 359.3.2 ) that effectively blocks the current 24 kpwn jailbreak exploit .
The cat and mouse game between Apple and the infamous Dev-Team has been going on since iPhone version 1.0 .
Every major hardware or firmware update has broken the jailbreak tool of the time - but for every update up to now the Dev-Team has pulled through to support the growing community of users who wish to install unapproved iPhone apps .
And let ’s not forget the thousands of non-AT&T iPhone customers who rely on jailbreaking to even use their phones .
There are those who will claim the new 3GS bootrom is “ unhackable ” or “ jailbreak - proof , ” which is verily overdramatic .
With such a large community of jailbreakers relying on a fix , it seems unlikely the Dev-Team or some other resourceful hacker wo n’t find an exploit for the new 3GS eventually .
It does , however , further show that Apple is not all too happy with jailbreakers opening up their otherwise extremely closed , controlled environment .
Perhaps this could be a sign of Apple ’s plans to make more aggressive moves to keep the iPhone on lockdown .

Have you ever been to an art show ?
Â
They ’re fairly similar toÂ homelessÂ shelters , but without as good of food .
Â
That being said , there are n’t usually too manyÂ homelessÂ people at them .
Â
Art museums , on the other hand , give you your own homeless person to escort you through the exhibits .
Â
It ’s useful .
Why does Professor Hobo not turn at the artÂ exhibit ?
Â I ’m afraid out fair professor may have spent too much time teaching and Â transformedÂ from hobo to academic .
Â
Toss up which is more useless .
A public marriage proposal can be a nice gesture .
It shows the other person that you are vulnerable , confident , and extremely happy to be with them .
The use of signs in your proposal can be an interesting way to pop the question ( as seen here ) .
Unfortunately for Jennifer , things did n’t go so well .
more info about the proposal can be found here .
And for another whacky relationship “ gift ” go here .
Sometimes there ’s a second possible answer to a puzzle just staring at your perverted face .
Today ’s list is my personal adaptation of the old “ a million monkeys on a million typewriters ” theory .
That is : Based on the sheer volume of the crossword puzzles , jumbles , Scrabble Grams and other word games that have been produced over the years , eventually , a random layout of letters is going to produce something dirty .
Here are 11 games and puzzles that inadvertently ( or , in one or two cases , probably , um , vertently ) turned out dirty , inappropriate or just plain wrong .
Enjoy .
1 | The dirty Scrabble Gram
The sad part is , it took me about three seconds to see “ butt sex ” and a solid 40 seconds to figure out the actual correct answer .
( “ Subtext , ” by the way . )
2 | What ’s Yours Like ?
Clearly , she ’s referring to her “ favorite kind of rope walking . ”
3 | Vagina tiles
Since these were magnetic tiles , this is n’t a case of the letters randomly shuffling during shipping … it ’s either a random error by a machine or an intentional practical joke by a bored factory worker .
I ’m strongly leaning toward the latter .
4 | Fun with mom
Ironically , when I was younger , one of the fun things I did with my mom was puzzles .
( Not insultingly easy word searches with Oedipal typos though .
We did the complicated logic chart ones and crosswords and such .
What can I say ?
Until about age eight I was just like Langdon Alger : I was quiet and enjoyed puzzles . )
5 | The logical follow - up
If you do have an orgy with mom , maybe you should get a quick beatin’ .
6 | Suck it , Trebek
A lot of the puzzles on this list are inadvertently dirty .
But when 69 across is “ The _____ __ mightier than the sword , ” you know it was the puzzle maker slipping one past the goalie .
7 | Stop the violins
Violins and violence should not be connected .
Unless you ’re referring to the way people like Al Capone and Delonte West transport their guns , I suppose .
Go Cavs !
8 | It ’s not a dildo , it ’s a math award
Best I can tell , on the Scrabble website , a word is randomly and automatically pulled from the Scrabble dictionary to be the word of the day .
Clearly , no one took the time to audit this automatic process to make sure embarrassing words would n’t come up .
And that ’s how an entire day ’s worth of visitors to the Scrabble website found out that dildos are defined as the equivalent of genital Egg Beaters .
9 | 18 Down
Is n’t “ cuni . ”
It ’s “ aer . ”
Just like the answer to 13 Down is n’t “ my wife ’s titties . ”
10 | How did the editor not catch this ?
How can any person look at this and not instantly stare down the word “ penis ” ?
I mean , I could see someone missing a dirty word if it was spelled backwards , but not this one .
11 | On further review …
You should instantly see a bad word backwards , too .

His mother ’s maiden name was Moon .
Buzz Aldrin , it seems , was destined from birth to travel to the rocky sphere more than 200,000 miles from planet Earth .
Today he says of being on the moon : “ I was exhilarated but guarded .
. . .
I knew that our every move and word were on display to the entire world , even though we were the only living creatures within a quarter of a million miles . ”
While walking on the moon , Aldrin uttered the words “ magnificent desolation , ” describing the monochromatic vastness of the cratered surface .
Those words became the title of his new memoir , in which he lays bare his adult life -- from Apollo 11 and beyond .

The return to Earth was hard .
Alcoholism , depression and divorce riddled his post - moonwalk life .
He considers the wherewithal to climb out of dark moments among his great triumphs , he writes .
Aldrin , now 79 , has written children ’s books and science fiction , and made documentaries .
He ’s even tried his hand at rapping , recently laying down tracks with Snoop Dogg and Talib Kweli : “ Moonwalking is such a trip , ” he says at the microphone , accompanied by background crooners .

Aldrin talked about his new book , his Twitter feed and the possibility of living on Mars .

What ’s your life like now ?
It ’s busier than it ’s ever been .
That includes training and isolated appearances .

You spent 21 hours on the moon .
Do you ever wish you could go back ?
No .
I went there once and had the lucky brass ring .
I was at the right place at the right time .
Combined with the turmoil I had returning to the Air Force and having to deal with other inherited and cultivated traits , it was a tough return .

What ’s the future of the U.S. space program ?
Without a doubt , I think I have the prescribed plan of what we should do now in the space program .
When you have a fork in the road , you take it .
We had a fork in the road with the Columbia accident .
We learned lessons from that accident , and the implementation of those lessons is the road to take .
The first time , we got to the moon too soon because we were in a race with the Soviets .
It was continuous and there was no gap -- from Sputnik to Apollo .
Now , after the Challenger and Columbia , it ’s as if we have said :
That ’s enough !
We have to take our experience and go to the next level .

In one of your chapters you envision space hotels on Mars .
Do you think human beings could live on Mars ?
Should we send people there ?
Absolutely .
We need to accumulate people there .
Just like the pilgrims at Plymouth Rock , we need to settle Mars .
We could have human intelligence in orbit around Mars , building things there .
Ideally , we ’d send people there in intervals and they ’d stay there 1 1/2 years at a time and come back .

Think about it .
The leader of a group of people on Earth -- whoever the leader is -- who establishes a settlement of humans on another planet .
That ’s huge .
Much bigger than two people holding nuclear weapons to each other ’s heads .
Mars is much closer to the characteristics of Earth .
It has a fall , winter , summer and spring .
North Pole , South Pole , mountains and lots of ice .
No one is going to live on Venus ; no one is going to live on Jupiter .

You rapped with Snoop Dogg .
What made you do it ?
I want to reach a new generation .
That ’s why I am Twittering now .
I have a BlackBerry , an iPhone and a Mac .
My favorite music is Karen Carpenter , but people are into this rap .
So I thought maybe I could work a deal where I could have some space experts appreciate rap and have the rappers understand space .
I kind of learned the words and picked up the rhythm and I got some advice from experts like Snoop Dogg and others .
I was rapping about space exploration .
“ All you need is a rocket experience ! ”
That ’s the chorus .
We had a ball , and we ’re getting a lot of reaction from Twittering .

“ Magnificent Desolation ” covers your life after returning from the moon .
You even ask : “ What does a man do for an encore after walking on the moon ? ”
You were only 39 at the time of your return .
What was going through your head ?
“ Magnificent Desolation ” -- I was a little hesitant about that title .
Originally we thought , “ The Real Buzz ” or just “ Buzz . ” I did n’t want [ the title ] to make my life sound a like a big glittering nothing .
The book is really about the long journey home .
It encapsulates what it is like coming back to being an Earthling .
I was on my own , not knowing what to do .

There ’s a love story in the book .
Yeah , I ’d been a bachelor for 10 years and I was getting tired of looking around .
I decided that I ’d been living in West L.A. , but I really liked the ocean , and so I wanted to move to Laguna .
I purchased a condominium down there .
One Friday night , I went to a singles event on the beach in L.A .
That ’s where I met Lois .
I asked her for a date .
She said , “ No , you do n’t want to go out with me , I live in Laguna . ”
And I said , “ Well , I ’m moving there tomorrow ! ”

What is your greatest wish for future generations in terms of space travel , science and future discoveries ?
What about the kids out there who still want to be astronauts ?
It appears to me that we have a generation coming along that ’s confused and not sure what they should focus on .
It seems they think :
What ’s in it for me ?
It seems that Wall Street just did that very same thing in a very professional way , and it got us in a lot of trouble .
It seems there are many chasing the cash wagon .

In case you missed it , Windows 7 is available now .
October 22nd was marked with a moderate amount of hoopla to introduce the new flagship operating system .
Now , users are faced with the task of not only deciding whether or not to upgrade , but of choosing which of the many variations of Windows 7 to install .
Microsoft has 6 different versions of Windows 7 available : Starter , Home Basic , Home Premium , Professional , Ultimate , and Enterprise .
The Windows 7 Starter version is aimed primarily at low - end netbook devices , and the Windows Home Basic version is only available in emerging markets , so we can rule those two out right away .
Microsoft thinks that it is doing you a favor by essentially making Windows Home Premium the de facto version .
A quick browse through the systems available from Best Buy or Amazon shows that almost every system available now comes pre-installed with Windows Home Premium , with a significant percentage being the 64 - bit version of Windows Home Premium .
Windows Home Premium is OK , but it lacks key features .
Microsoft has this habit of adding all kinds of eye candy and multimedia bells and whistles to the home version , but leaving out important security features and customization capabilities .
I chalk it up to an effort to provide a dummy - proof entertainment system and be more like Apple , but the result is that consumers get an inferior version of Windows that does n't come close to the Mac OS X experience .
Microsoft is n't Apple and Windows is n't Mac .
If Microsoft focused more on providing the best version of Windows for consumers and less on trying to be cool or dummy proof , it would be doing itself and you both a favor .
Microsoft aims the cream of the crop of the security features at enterprise customers .
Granted , they need them as well , but enterprises tend to have IT administrators and technical support personnel who install , manage , and oversee firewall and antivirus products , monitor the network for outbreaks , and provide security remediation and cleanup when necessary .
Home users do n't have those resources so they need the operating system to be as secure as possible by default .
Home users should have Windows 7 Ultimate in order to have the full range of Windows 7 features and capabilities .
Laptop users in particular should upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate so they can take advantage of BitLocker Disk Encryption to protect the data on the laptop in the event that it is lost or stolen .
Small businesses are more or less ignored by Microsoft .
They are not an enterprise or a consumer .
Microsoft intends the Windows 7 Professional version for small and medium business customers .
Windows 7
Professional has some enhancements such as the ability to join a Windows network domain , but still lacks key features like BitLocker , as well as the enterprise capabilities like DirectAccess and Branch Cache .
Granted , small and medium business customers need to have a Windows Server 2008 domain environment to take advantage of these advanced Windows 7 features , but it is worth it for organizations with remote and roaming workers or branch locations .
To gain access to these features , I suggest small and medium businesses also invest in Windows 7 Ultimate .
There you have it .
If I were calling the shots at Microsoft we could instantly narrow the field down to three options : Windows 7 Starter for netbooks , Windows 7 Enterprise for large corporate customers , and Windows 7 Ultimate for everyone else .
If you are going to spend the time and money to upgrade to Windows 7 , you may as well invest a little extra and get the version that has all of the features , and capabilities rather than choosing one with limited functionality .
You 'll thank me later .

I ’ve made one blog post about Haskell , and found the processs to be too tedious to be tolerated .
The wysiwyg tinyMCE editor that is avalaible for WordPress is useless for formatting code segments and editing directly in the raw HTML editor WordPress provides is agonizing .
Figuring there must be a better way , I looked around for an offline tool that would just work for me .
I turned up a few editors , free and non-free , some which looked just horrid , a few almost reasonable , but none that would make the mix of Haskell and narrative as easy as it seems it ought to be .
What I really want is an easy way to take Literate Haskell ( you know , those seemingly innocuous text messages that are suddenly interrupted with ominous passages like :
> {-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-} > module BlogLiterately where
for no immediately apparent reason ) file , perhaps with simple markdown encoded text commentary , and just magically upload it to my blog , with good HTML formatting of the markdown and Haskell sections .
Haskell , theoretically , has all sorts of libraries for doing all sorts of wonderful things .
Perhaps it would n’t be to hard to mash something together from Haskell libraries that did precisely what I wanted .
Somehow I ’d osmotically absorbed from the ether the knowlege that there was a Haskell - based tool around called Pandoc , by John MacFarlane , which deals with markdown , HTML and other formats .
It is , like all good Haskelly things , available on hackage , both as a program and library .
So it seemed like a good place to start .
> import Text .
Pandoc
Looking over the documentation for Pandoc , I observed that although was it able to do wonderful things with loads of formats , it did n’t automatically do what I wanted with the actual Haskell source code .
What I want is to make the source look like what Haskell code looks like as part of haddock documentation , especially the Haddock documentation available on Hackage .
Haddock uses hscolour , a tool by Malcolm Wallace , to format source listings .
> import Language .
Haskell .
HsColour ( hscolour , Output ( .. ) ) > import Language .
Haskell .
HsColour .
Colourise ( defaultColourPrefs )
Assuming Pandoc and hscolour do what I want , I ’d still need some way of actually publishing the blog post .
With a bit of googliness I learned that my blog software supports something called the MetaWeblog API , which is an XML - RPC - based protocol for interacting with blogs .
There ’s a Haskell XML - RPC library , HaXR , by Bjorn Bringert , ( on hackage ) which seems like it should be appropriate .
> import Network .
XmlRpc .
Client > import Network .
XmlRpc .
Internals
And it works that out I ’ll need some miscellaneous other stuff .
Since I ’m writing a command line tool , I ’ll need to process the command line arguments , and Neil Mitchell ’s CmdArgs library ought to work for that :
> import System .
Console .
CmdArgs
I ’m going to end up needing to parse and manipulate XHTML , so I ’ll use Malcolm Wallace ’s HaXml XML combinators :
> import Text .
XML . HaXml > import
Text .
XML . HaXml .
Verbatim
I ’ll need to do some text IO , which I ’ll use the UTF8 encoding for , leading to Eric Mertens ’ ubiquitous ( until GHC 6.12 ! ) ut f8 - string library :
> import qualified System .
IO . UTF8 as U
And I ’ll need a couple other bits and pieces :
> import Control .
Monad ( liftM , unless ) > import Text .
XHtml .
Transitional ( showHtml ) > import Text .
ParserCombinators .
Parsec
The program I envision will read in a literate Haskell file , use Pandoc to parse it as markdown , then somehow find the code blocks in the ( parsed ) input , and use hscolour to transform those .
Pandoc turns its input into a structure of type :
data Pandoc = Pandoc Meta [ Block ]
where a Block ( the interesting bit , for my purposes ) looks like :
-- | Block element .
data Block = Plain [ Inline ] -- ^
Plain text , not a paragraph | Para [ Inline ] -- ^ Paragraph | CodeBlock Attr String -- ^ Code block ( literal ) with attributes | RawHtml String -- ^ Raw HTML block ( literal ) | BlockQuote [ Block ] -- ^
Block quote ( list of blocks ) | OrderedList ListAttributes [ [ Block ] ] -- ^
Ordered list ( attributes -- and a list of items , each a list of blocks ) | BulletList [ [ Block ] ] -- ^
Bullet list ( list of items , each -- a list of blocks ) | DefinitionList [ ( [ Inline ] , [ Block ] ) ] -- ^ Definition list -- ( list of items , each a pair of an inline list , -- the term , and a block list ) | Header Int [ Inline ] -- ^ Header - level ( integer ) and text ( inlines ) | HorizontalRule -- ^ Horizontal rule | Table [ Inline ] [ Alignment ] [ Double ] [ [ Block ] ] [ [ [ Block ] ] ] -- ^ Table , -- with caption , column alignments , -- relative column widths , column headers -- ( each a list of blocks ) , and rows -- ( each a list of lists of blocks ) | Null -- ^ Nothing deriving ( Eq , Read , Show , Typeable , Data )
The literate Haskell that Pandoc finds in a file ends up in various CodeBlock elements of the Pandoc document .
Other code can also wind up in CodeBlock elements — normal markdown formatted code .
The literate Haskell code seems to be differentiated from other by the Attr component , which has the form :
type Attr = ( String , [ String ] , [ ( String , String ) ] )
Experimentation reveals that CodeBlock elements that have an Attr of the form ( _ , [ " sourceCode " , " haskell " ] , _) are literate Haskell code blocks , and other CodeBlock elements are the markdown code blocks .
I want to syntax - highlight both kinds of code blocks , but when both get rendered to the output HTML , I want to preserve the literate Haskell as literate ( it needs the prepended > character ) .
Actually , I want to do just a little bit more …
When writing a Literate Haskell File , I might want to include non-Haskell but nevertheless ‘ code ’ examples in the text .
Samples of how one might express the same thing in ML , or examples of how to run a program , etc .
So not all code blocks should be colourised by hscolour , just specific Haskelly ones .
Markdown does n’t provide a way to express what kind of code a code block might be , but since I ’m munging all the code blocks anyway , I can adopt a simple convention .
If a code example looks like :
[ Haskell ] foo :: String ->
String
it is a Haskell block .
If it looks like something else , e.g .
[ C++ ] cout << " Hello World ! " ;
or
[ other ] foo bar baz
etc. , it is something else .
ed :
It turns out that although Markdown does n't provide a way to do this , Pandoc 's extensions to Markdown do allow it , in a way fairly similar to what I 've proposed .
If I revise this further , I 'll use the Pandoc convention .
Thanks to John MacFarlane for pointing this out in the comments .
I can strip off the code type indicator from the beginning of each block as I examine them for code to colourise .
I use Parsec to recognize the opening tag :
> unTag :: String -> ( String , String ) > unTag s = either ( const ( " " , s ) ) id $ parse tag " " s > where tag = do > tg <- between ( char ' [ ' ) ( char ' ] ' ) $ many $ noneOf " [ ] " > skipMany $ oneOf " t " > ( string " rn " < |> string " n " ) > txt <- many $ any Token > eof > return ( tg , txt )
To highlight the syntax using hscolour ( which produces HTML ) , I 'm going to need to transform the String from a CodeBlock element to a String suitable for the RawHtml element ( because the hscolour library transforms Haskell text to HTML ) .
Pandoc strips off the prepended > characters from the literate Haskell , so I need to put them back , and also tell hscolour whether the source it is colouring is literate or not .
The hscolour function looks like :

Hscolour supports a few different HTML - based Output formats : HTML , CSS , and ICSS .
HTML is HTML with font tags , which are inherently evil and so I 'll wo n't bother exploring this option .
CSS is formatting using HTML class tags , which allows you the flexibility of using a separate stylesheet to control how hscolour - annotated code is style .
ICSS is ' inline - CSS ' a.k.a. HTML ' style ' tags , which is really what I need for my WordPress blog , as I refuse to the pay $ 15 a year WordPress.com charge for the privilege of storing a stylesheet on their site .
Unfortunately , hscolour 's inline styling options are quite limited ( very few colours , little control of fonts ) , but I 've come up with a slightly more convoluted way of turning CSS coloured source into inline - css HTML .
So I will start off by using hscolour in CSS mode to transform my source :
> colourIt literate srcTxt = > hscolour CSS defaultColourPrefs False True " " literate src ' > where src ' | literate = prepend srcTxt > | otherwise = srcTxt
Prepending the literate Haskell markers on the source is trivial :
> prepend s = unlines $ map p $ lines s where p s = '>' : ' ' : s
Hscolour uses HTML span elements and CSS classes like ' hs - keyword ' or hs - keyglyph to markup Haskell code .
What I want to do is take each marked span element and replace the class attribute with an inline style element that has the markup I want for that kind of source .
I can capture the style posibilities with a type :
> data StylePrefs = StylePrefs { > keyword :: String , > keyglyph :: String , > layout :: String , > comment :: String , > conid :: String , > varid :: String , > conop :: String , > varop :: String , > str :: String , > chr :: String , > number :: String , > cpp :: String , > selection :: String , > variantselection :: String , > definition :: String > } deriving ( Read , Show )
Each field in the above type will contain the desired style for the class hscolour assigns to a span of code .
A default style that produces something like what the source listings on Hackage look like is :
> defaultStylePrefs = StylePrefs { > keyword = " color : blue ; font - weight : bold ; " > , keyglyph = " color : red ; " > , layout = " color : red ; " > , comment = " color : green ; " > , conid = " " > , varid = " " > , conop = " " > , varop = " " > , str = " color : teal ; " > , chr = " color : teal ; " > , number = " " > , cpp = " " > , selection = " " > , variantselection = " " > , definition = " " > }
I can read these preferences in from a file using the Read instance for StylePrefs .
I could handle errors better , but this should work :
> getStylePrefs " " = return defaultStylePrefs > getStylePrefs fname = liftM read ( U . readFile fname )
Hscolour produces a String of HTML .
To transform it , we need to parse it , manipulate it and then re-render it as a String .
I 'll use HaXml to do all of this :
> xformXml :: StylePrefs -> String ->
String > xformXml prefs s = verbatim $ filtDoc ( xmlParse " input " s ) where > -- filter the document ( an Hscoloured fragment of Haskell source ) > filtDoc ( Document p s e m ) = c where > [ c ] = filts ( CElem e ) > -- the filter is a fold of individual filters for each CSS class > filts = foldXml $ foldl o keep [ > filt " keyword " keyword , > filt " keyglyph " keyglyph , > filt " layout " layout , > filt " comment " comment , > filt " conid " conid , > filt " varid " varid , > filt " conop " conop , > filt " varop " varop , > filt " str " str , > filt " chr " chr , > filt " num " number , > filt " cpp " cpp , > filt " sel " selection , > filt " variantselection " variantselection , > filt " definition " definition > ] > -- an individual filter replaces the attributes of a tag with > -- a style attribute when it has a specific ' class ' attribute .
> filt lbl f = > replaceAttrs [ ( " style " , f prefs ) ] `when` > ( attrval $ ( " class " , AttValue [ Left ( " hs - " ++ lbl ) ] ) )
To completely colourise a CodeBlock we now can create a function that transforms a CodeBlock into a RawHtml block , where the content contains marked up Haskell ( possibly with literate markers ) :
> colouriseCodeBlock prefs ( CodeBlock attr @ ( _ , inf , _ ) s ) = > if tag == " Haskell " || lit > then RawHtml $ xformXml prefs $ colourIt lit s' > else CodeBlock attr s' > where ( tag , s' ) = unTag s > lit = " sourceCode " `elem` inf && " haskell " `elem` inf > colouriseCodeBlock _ b = b
And colourising a Pandoc document is simply :
> colourisePandoc prefs ( Pandoc m blocks ) = > Pandoc m $ map ( colouriseCodeBlock prefs ) blocks
Transforming a complete input document string to an HTML output string :
> xformDoc :: StylePrefs -> String ->
String > xformDoc prefs s = > showHtml > $ writeHtml writeOpts -- from Pandoc > $ colourisePandoc prefs > $ readMarkdown parseOpts -- from Pandoc > $ fixLineEndings s > where writeOpts = defaultWriterOptions { > writerLiterateHaskell = True , > writerReferenceLinks = True } > parseOpts = defaultParserState { > stateLiterateHaskell = True } > -- readMarkdown is picky about line endings > fixLineEndings [ ] = [ ] > fixLineEndings ( 'r ' : ' n ' : cs ) = ' n ' : fixLineEndings cs > fixLineEndings ( c : cs ) = c : fixLineEndings cs
Now that I can transform a document , I need to be able to post the document to my blog .
The metaWeblog API defines a newPost and editPost procedures that look like :
metaWeblog.newPost ( blogid , username , password , struct , publish ) returns string metaWeblog.editPost ( postid , username , password , struct , publish ) returns true
For my blog ( a WordPress blog ) , the blogid is just default .
The user name and password are simply strings , and publish is a flag indicating whether to load the post as a draft , or to make it public immediately .
The postid is an identifier string which is assigned when you initially create a post .
The interesting bit is the struct field , which is an XML - RPC structure defining the post along with some meta - data , like the title .
All I need is to be able to provide the post text and a title , so I can create the right struct like so :
> mkPost title text = > [ ( " title " , title ) , ( " description " , text ) ]
The HaXR library exports a function for invoking XML - RPC procedures :
remote :: Remote a => String -- ^ Server URL .
May contain username and password on -- the format username : password@ before the hostname .
->
String -- ^ Remote method name . -> a -- ^
Any function -- @( XmlRpcType t1 , ... , XmlRpcType tn , XmlRpcType r ) => -- t1 -> ... -> tn -> IO r@
The funtion requires an URL and a method name , and returns a function of type Remote a => a .
Based on the instances defined for Remote , any function with zero or more parameters in the class XmlRpcType and a return type of XmlRpcType r =>
IO r will work , which means you can simply ' feed ' remote additional arguments as required by the remote procedure , and as long as you make the call in an IO context , it will typecheck .
So to call the metaWeblog.newPost procedure , I can do something like :
> postIt :: String -> String -> String -> String -> String -> String -> Bool -> IO String > postIt url blog
Id user password title text publish = > remote url " metaWeblog.newPost " blog
Id user password ( mkPost title text ) publish
To update ( replace ) a post , the function would be :
> updateIt :: String -> String -> String -> String -> String -> String -> Bool -> IO Bool > updateIt url post
Id user password title text publish = > remote url " metaWeblog.editPost " post Id user password ( mkPost title text ) publish
I 've got most of the pieces in place -- I just need to turn it into a command line program .
I can capture the command line controls in a type :
> data BlogLiterately = BlogLiterately { > style :: String , -- name of a style file > publish :: Bool , -- an indication of whether the post should be > -- published , or loaded as a draft > blogid :: String , -- blog - specific identifier ( e.g. for blogging > -- software handling multiple blogs ) > blog :: String , -- blog xmlrpc URL > user :: String , -- blog user name > password :: String , -- blog password > title :: String , -- post title > file :: String , -- file to post > postid :: String -- id of a post to updated > } deriving ( Show , Data , Typeable )
And using CmdArgs , this bit of impure evil defines how the command line arguments work :
> bl = mode $ BlogLiterately { > style = " " &= text " Style Specification " & typFile , > publish = def &= text " Publish post " , > blogid = " default " &= text " Blog specific identifier " , > blog = def &= arg Pos 0 & typ " URL " > & text " URL of blog 's xmlrpc address ( e.g. http://example.com/blog/xmlrpc.php) " , > user = def &= argPos 1 & typ " USER " & text " blog author 's user name " , > password = def &= argPos 2 & typ " PASSWORD " & text " blog author 's password " , > title = def &= argPos 3 & typ " TITLE " , > file = def &= arg Pos 4 & typ " FILE " & text " literate haskell file " , > postid = " " &= text " Post to replace ( if any ) " }
The main blogging function uses the information captured in the BlogLiterately type to read the style preferences , read the input file and transform it , and post it to the blog :
> blogLiterately ( BlogLiterately style pub blogid url user pw title file postid ) = do > prefs <- getStylePrefs style > html <- liftM ( xformDoc prefs ) $ U . readFile file > if null postid > then do > postid <- postIt url blogid user pw title html pub > putStrLn $ " post Id : " ++ postid > else do > result <- updateIt url postid user pw title html pub > unless result $ putStrLn " update failed ! "
And the main program is simply :
> main = cmdArgs " Blog Literately v0.1 , ( C ) Robert Greayer 2009 " [ bl ] >>= blogLiterately
I can run it to get some help :
$ ./BlogLiterately -- help Blog Literately v0.1 , ( C ) Robert Greayer 2009 blogliterately [ FLAG ] URL USER PASSWORD TITLE FILE -? -- help [ =FORMAT ]
Show usage information ( optional format ) - V --version Show version information - v -- verbose Higher verbosity -q -- quiet Lower verbosity -s --style=FILE Style Specification -- publish Publish post - b -- blogid=VALUE
Blog specific identifier ( default=default ) --postid=VALUE
Post to replace ( if any )
Which tells me I can actually upload a post something like :
$ ./BlogLiterately https://greayer.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php myuser mypass " Blogging Literately in Haskell " BlogLiterately.lhs
This is a great start for what I want .
Handling of exceptions is non-existent ; I simply cross my fingers and hope that the default error message will be self explanatory .
I ought to also allow the author and categories for the document to be specified .
But it works as is , and it's a tool I 'd actuallly use ( and did , to post this ) .

He deplores the way many post -Second World War conductors converted his work into a glutinous syrup – " especially Herbert von Karajan , who should have been shot for the disservice he performed " – and wants instead to " show that this is music of enormous visceral power and at times coarse brutality , as well as of almost unbearable sweetness " .

Australian governments spend about $ 4.7 billion a year on the war on drugs .
This figure was arrived at using information from the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation and other sources and is an estimate of how much the Government would save and get in tax revenue if illicit drug sales were regulated and taxed the way tobacco is .
I compiled the figure because of a growing interest in the economic consequences of the war on drugs launched by the US president Richard Nixon in 1971 .
Dr Alex Wodak , director of the Alcohol and Drug Service at Sydney 's St Vincent 's Hospital , observed in the Herald recently that there is a growing belief - across the political landscape - the war has been lost .
At the United Nations in 1998 there was acknowledgement that the war was not going so well , and a pledged of a renewed effort in reducing demand within 10 years .
As the deadline approached , RAND Europe and the Netherlands ' Trimbos Institute reported to the European Commission that they found no evidence the global drug problem had declined .
Interventions against drug producers , such as coca growers in South America , caused local disruption but had little effect on global supply .
Drug prices generally declined , even in those Western countries that toughened their law and order approach .
In 2005 a Harvard economist , Jeffrey Miron , produced a paper urging legalisation of marijuana because the prohibition had minimal benefits and could cause substantial harm , including the diversion of government spending that might be better used .
Five hundred economists wrote to the American government supporting his call .
They included the Nobel laureates George Akerlof , Vernon Smith , and the late Milton Friedman .
The debate in Australia could do with some economics .
Dr Wodak said this week : " After 40 years , it 's time to consider just what the war on drugs has really achieved , and at what cost .
It would be very interesting to know just how much Australia has spent on drug law enforcement , and how much has been gained . "

The Patient Is in Stable Condition and Improving Rapidly
The Atlantic Politics team asks the question on somebody 's mind : " Can President Obama 's media blitz – appearances on five Sunday talk shows this weekend – save health reform ? "
Save health reform from what ?
Consider the recent developments :
Two weeks ago , four of five committees had passed their bills , and one committee was tangled in an interminable and opaque process .
Last week , that committee produced a bill that , though not perfect , is pretty close to the other bills on the table .
On Friday , the committee chairman and the crucial Republican both announced that the subsidies need to be raised , which addresses the main problem liberals have with the legislation .
Later this week , the Massachusetts Senate is expected to allow an interim replacement for Sen .
Ted Kennedy , giving Democrats their 60th vote .
Obama 's weekend blitz was n't meant to save health - care reform .
It was meant to push it those final 10 yards .
He could fail in that effort , but that 's where we sit : incredibly , incredibly close to the finish line .
Closer , by far , than we have ever been before .

Microsoft has recruited another big -name application to bolster the rather thin ranks of the Windows Store , with the introduction of a Spotify app .
That means Windows 10 users can now benefit from an automatically - updated store app for Spotify , and moreover , so can those running Windows 10 S – and Windows Store apps are obviously particularly vital for the latter group of folks , because that ’s the only software they can use .
The new app is available in all 60 countries where you can get Spotify , and is basically a direct port of the standard desktop client with all the same options , from custom playlists to intelligent suggestions of music you might like , along with both free and paying subscription options .
Note that Windows 10 users will need to be running at least the Anniversary Update or better for the Spotify app to be compatible .
These are the best Windows tablets you can buy right now
Musically gifted
Early feedback from users on the Windows Store seems very positive , with an average rating of 4.5/5 stars .
The one niggle folks are pointing to is that the new app does n’t solve one of the gremlins that plagues the desktop version of the client – namely that music playback stops when the device ’s screen gets turned off .
As we saw in a recent TechRadar interview , when Microsoft revealed that this Spotify app was in the pipeline , the company believes it can persuade more major players to bring their software to the Windows Store , using the carrot of there being over 500 million users of Windows 10 devices out there now .
And even more so following the recent launch of the Surface Laptop carrying Windows 10 S , Microsoft needs to ensure that more key apps come to the store so users do n’t feel like they ’re missing out on too much .
Vaiseshika 's Atomic theory .
Dakshinamurti Stotra of Shri Shankaracharya translated by Alladi Mahadeva Sastry
Vaiseshika 's threefold cause .
Indian Atom 3D
Vaisheshika , or Vaiśeṣika , is one of the six Hindu schools of philosophy of ancient India .
Historically , it has been closely associated with the Hindu school of logic , Nyaya Vaisesika philosophy of atomism is that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to a finite number of atoms .
This school of philosophy traces its origin to the sage Kaṇāda or Kana - bhuk , translated into English as atom-eater , around the 2nd century BCThe paramanus , the extremely small atoms , combined together , constitute the upâdâna or material cause of the universe .
Hence it is that a pot manifests itself in constant association with clay , but not with Isvara .
It is the indivisible extremely subtle things called paramanus , which , combining together in various ways , give rise to the universe comprising all created objects with their attributes and activities .
We speak of a substance as the upadana or material cause of other things when it is found invariably associated with them , and upon whose existence the existence of those other things depends .
Nothing in our experience is thus invariably found associated with Atman , the Self , or Isvara .
On the other hand , every created object is found invariably associated with something other than Atman , with something or other , which is insentient .
A pot , for instance , is invariably associated with clay .
Hence the conclusion that the insentient atoms , not the sentient Isvara nor His Maya , are the material cause of the universe .
It is the qualities , such as color , taste , etc. , inherent in the atoms themselves , which produce qualities of a kindred sort in the effect separately .
Thus , the atoms and their qualities give rise to all objects in creation as well as their qualities , so that Isvara is not the material cause either of the substances or of their qualities .
That with which the effect is intimately associated is the samavâyi - kârana , the inseparable or material cause , as. opposed to the accessories such as the potter 's wheel , which belong to a category different from the samavâyi - kârana .
That is said to be the asamavayi - karana , the accidental or separable cause , which , while quite necessary to produce the effect , resides in the samavâyi , or in the substratum of the samavâyi .
An efficient ( nimitta ) cause of all effects is Isvara , like the potter .
The Vaiseshika says that there are three kinds of causes for every positive effect , known respectively as the samavayi or upadana - karana , the material cause ; the asamavayi - karana , the accidental cause ; the nimitta - karana , the efficient or intelligent cause .
Thread is the material cause of a cloth , because the latter is in constant relation with the other .
According to the definition of the asamavayi - karana given in the verse 4 , the combining of threads with one another constitutes the asamavayi - karana of the cloth , because the act of combining resides in the threads , which form the samavayi - karana of the cloth .
Again , according to the definition , the color of the thread is the asamavayi - karana of the color of the cloth , because the former which gives rise to the latter resides in the thread which forms the substratum ( the samavayin ) of the cloth , and the cloth again is the substance wherein the color of the cloth inheres in constant relation and is therefore called the samavayi of that color .
The remaining factors in the causal aggregate comprise ( 1 ) what is called the nimitta - karana , the efficient cause like the weaver , and ( 2 ) the sahakari or auxiliary cause such as the instruments used by him in producing the cloth out of the thread .
Isvara is said to be a mere efficient cause in all effects .
And as the efficient cause
He is a necessary factor in the creation of the universe ; for , we see that without an impulse from a sentient being no effect is ever produced out of a material .
Without a potter , for instance , no pot is ever produced out of clay .
Isvara being thus only one of the factors in the creation of the universe , to hold that the sole cause of the universe is the sentient Brahman is opposed to all our experience .
Whencesoever an effect is born , there it abides ; a pot abides in clay , a cloth in thread , a finger - ring in gold .
Thus say the Vaiseshikas as well as the Naiyâyikas .

Researchers found " size - zero " people are often considered to look unhealthy Young men find " normal " sized women more attractive than size zero celebrities , research has suggested .
Male students at St Andrews University were asked to rate female faces for attractiveness and health .
The study found that girls with an average weight and build were ranked as being the most attractive and healthy .
Researchers said the findings sent out a strong message to young women who believe being underweight is considered to be attractive .
The research was carried out by a team from the university 's Perception Lab , who asked 84 female students a variety of questions on their health , took their blood pressure and photographed them .
People in the normal weight range were judged healthier and more attractive than under or overweight individuals .
Professor David Perrett
University of St Andrews
The photographs were then shown to a group of male students who were asked to rate them for health , attractiveness and weight .
Professor David Perrett , who supervised the project , said : " In our study , people in the normal weight range were judged healthier and more attractive than under or overweight individuals .
" This sends a strong message to all the girls out there who believe you have to be underweight to be attractive .
" The people making judgments in our study were all between the ages of 18 and 26 and they did not rate underweight girls most attractive .
They preferred normal weight girls . "
Lead researcher Vinet Coetzee said although people often remark on how healthy or unhealthy someone looks , it can be very difficult to say precisely how we know this .
' Already suffering '
She added : " Scientists have been trying to answer this question for decades , and have made many breakthroughs in our understanding of health and attractiveness , but until now they have tended to overlook the influence of weight . "
Ms Coetzee said students who were rated as being overweight reported more frequent and longer - lasting cold and flu bouts , used antibiotics more frequently and had higher blood pressure than the students who were considered normal weight .
" Even at this young age , their health was already suffering because they were overweight , and what is more , other people can spot this in their face , " she added .
The findings have been published online by the scientific journal Perception .

Is God Good By Definition ?
( 1992 )
Graham Oppy
[ This article was originally published as " Is God Good By Definition ? " , Religious Studies , 28 , 1992 , pp.467-474 . ]
As a matter of historical fact , most philosophers and theologians who have defended traditional theistic views have been moral realists .
Some " divine command " theorists have held that the good is constituted by the content of divine approval -- i.e. that things are good because , and insofar as , they have divine approval .
However , even amongst those theists who hold that the good is independently constituted -- i.e. those who hold that God 's pattern of approval is explained by the fact that he approves of all and only that which is good -- the dominant meta-ethic has been strongly realistic .
As a further matter of historical fact , one of the main motives for the development of non-realist meta-ethics has been the desire to give an adequate atheistic account of the nature of the good .
Thus many subjectivist , projectivist , and error - theoretic accounts of the good were developed in the context of atheistic enquiries .
Of course , atheistic accounts of the good can be realist -- e.g. G. E. Moore 's non-natural objectivism .
However , the question which I wish to take up is whether theistic accounts of the good can be non-realist .
In fact , I shall argue that the traditional philosophical conception of God requires a commitment to moral realism .
Despite the range of non-realist meta-ethics which have been developed , there is none which is compatible with theism .
Consequently , there is a hitherto ignored argument against theism which emerges for assessment , viz :
1. Ethical realism is a necessary consequence of traditional theism .
2. Ethical realism is false .
3. ( Therefore ) Traditional theism is false .
In this paper I shall focus on 1.-- i.e. I shall not attempt to provide an argument for 2 .
However , I believe that there are independent arguments -- i.e. arguments independent of the debate about theism -- which favour the view that ethical realism is false .
Consequently , I believe that the argument of this paper makes a contribution to the case against theism .
What I take to be the traditional conception of God has been expressed by Richard Swinburne .
In The Existence Of God ( Oxford University Press , 1979 ) , he writes :
I take the proposition " God exists " ... to be logically equivalent to " there exists a person without a body .. who is eternal , is perfectly free , omnipotent , omniscient , perfectly good , and the creator of all things " .
I use " God " as the name of the person picked out by this description . ( p.8 )
I do not think that one ought to say that " God exists " is logically equivalent to " there exists a person without a body ... etc " .
For , in saying this , one is committed to the view that if , for example , ( i ) there exists a person without a body who is eternal , perfectly free , omnipotent , omniscient , very ( but not quite perfectly ) good , and the creator of all things ; but ( ii ) there is no person without a body who is eternal , perfectly free , omnipotent , omniscient , perfectly good , and the creator of all things , then God does not exist .
This seems to me to be an odd view to take ; in the circumstances described , it seems to me that it would be more natural to say that God does exist , but that he is not quite as we imagined him to be .
However , this is not a serious problem .
What I think Swinburne ought to say is that we use the expression " person without a body ... etc " to fix the referent of the expression " God " :
God is the being , if any , which comes closest to satisfying this description .
If two or more beings satisfy the description equally well , then -- strictly speaking -- God does not exist ( though perhaps certain gods do exist ) .
Moreover , given this amendment to Swinburne 's account , it then becomes a substantive theory that God is a " person without a body ...etc " .
I shall assume without further argument that the amended account does capture the traditional conception of God .
The crucial point for what follows is that many theists have been committed to the view that it is a definitional or constitutive or necessary truth about God that he is perfectly good -- and it is this view which I claim is incompatible with a non-realist meta -ethic .
Before I turn to the details of the argument , I wish to introduce an independent reason for interest in it .
This reason arises in the context of a dispute between Michael Tooley and Richard Swinburne over the correct meta-ethical background in which to situate a discussion of the problem of evil .
In " Does Theism Need A Theodicy ? " ( Canadian Journal Of Philosophy 18 , 1988 , pp.287-312 ) , Swinburne writes :
I need to establish a position on the status of moral judgements .
I hold that they have truth - value ; some are true and some are false .
...
There could only arise an issue as to whether certain evils were compatible with the existence of a good God if goodness and evil were properties which belonged to persons , actions , and states of affairs , and judgements which affirmed or denied their existence had a truth value .
( p.290 )
In response to this passage , Michael Tooley ( in " The Argument From Evil " , forthcoming ) comments that :
Embedded in what is otherwise a very thoughtful discussion , these claims by Swinburne that the problem of evil arises only if moral judgements are either true or false , and only if goodness and evil are real properties of persons , actions and states of affairs , are rather jarring .
For ... suppose that John Mackie 's error theory is correct , and that , although we are ascribing non-natural properties to actions when we describe them as right or wrong , and to states of affairs when we describe them as good or bad , the world in fact contains no such properties .
All of our " positive " ethical beliefs would be false in that case , but that would not be a barrier to some of John 's ethical belief being logically inconsistent with some of Mary's , nor to some of John 's ethical beliefs being mutually inconsistent , or to their giving rise to inconsistencies when combined with some of his non-moral beliefs about the world .
( p.8 )
Tooley 's point is that questions about the consistency of sets of ethical beliefs can be raised quite independently of considerations about the ontological status of the objects of those beliefs -- and , from this , it might seem to follow immediately that " the problem of evil " can also be investigated quite independently of considerations about the ontological status of the objects of moral judgements .
However , I think that Tooley has been mislead by Swinburne 's ( apparent ? ) suggestion that any dispute about the compatibility of the existence of evil with the existence of certain non-moral states of affairs requires the background assumption of moral realism .
Given that Swinburne holds that it is a definitional property of God that he is morally perfect , it follows immediately that a being which lacked the attribute of moral perfection could not possibly be God .
Consequently , it would be inconsistent for Swinburne to adopt Mackie 's error theory : if there is no such property as " moral perfection " -- or if there is such a property , but it is the case that nothing lies in its extension -- then , according to Swinburne 's definition , God does not exist .
Now , of course , this argument does not show that Swinburne 's definition of God commits him to the meta-ethical view that moral judgements have truth values ( and that goodness and evil are properties which belong to persons , actions , and states of affairs ) .
However , as I shall now go on to argue , I think that it is plausible to suggest that Swinburne is ( perhaps unwittingly ) correct when he suggests that the problem of evil only arises in the context of the assumption of meta-ethical realism .
There are so many non-realist accounts of the nature of moral properties that I cannot possibly hope to discuss them all .
However , I think that the theories which I shall consider are representative .
My aim is to make it appear plausible that there really are no non-realist accounts of the nature of moral properties available to traditional theists .
1. Straightforward Subjectivism : First , let us consider the simple view that when a speaker says " x is morally perfect " what that speaker does is to express a maximal pro-attitude towards x .
In general , the idea behind this view is that value judgements --" x is good " , " x is admirable " -- are expressions of pro-attitudes .
In addition , the view also holds that the proper use of expressions such as " x is morally perfect " is to express maximal pro-attitudes about x-- i.e. pro-attitudes of maximal intensity .
( With minor changes , the following discussion should apply to all theories which hold that moral judgements are merely subjective expressions of attitudes or emotions . )
One difficulty which this view presents , to the theistic project of definition , is that there is an indexical element in the use of the expression " x is morally perfect " : different objects will evince ejaculations of this expression from the mouths of different speakers .
How , then , could such an expression be any use in the community - wide definition of a single object ?
This would seem to make as much sense as the supposition that the expression " object nearest to me " defines the same speaker - independent object no matter from which mouth it issues .
Of course , this difficulty would be avoided if we all approved of the same things to the same extent .
But we do n't ; there are many different patterns of approval and disapproval which are exhibited , even by monotheists .
However , there is also a more important difficulty .
If I adopt this sort of subjectivist emotivist meta-ethic , then I recognise that it is quite appropriate for one person to say that an object ( action , thought , etc. ) is morally good even though another person says that the same object is morally bad .
Moreover , I recognise that there is no good reason to suppose that there will be universal convergence in the application of the expression " morally perfect " .
Consequently , I recognise that it might happen that the theistic definition picks out a unique object in some mouths , but not in others .
( Of course , it might also happen that the definition picks out no object in any mouth . )
Should I subscribe to the theistic definition ?
Well , what reason do I have for thinking that my use of the expression " morally perfect " is one of the privileged ones which does in fact lead the thesitic definition to pick out a unique being ?
Surely I should be guilty of a very unchristian hubris to think that I am especially privileged in this respect .
( Since even monotheists disagree in their moral judgements , the fact that I am a particular sort of believer cannot be enough ! )
The conclusion which I draw from this is that if one subscribes to the theisitic definition , then one should not also adopt a straightforward subjectivist meta-ethic .
2. ( Blackburn's ) Projectivism : A more sophisticated subjectivist meta-ethic has recently been defended by Simon Blackburn ( see , e.g. , Spreading The Word , Oxford University Press , 1984 - - chapter 6 ) .
On Blackburn 's projectivist view -- as on the straightforward subjectivist view which we considered above -- moral judgements are a species of non-descriptive judgements which serve to express our desires ( and other non-cognitive attitudes ) .
However , Blackburn 's theory is also quasi- realistic : i.e. it attempts to ground our ostensibly realist moral talk and moral practice within a more broadly projectivist framework .
Thus , for example , in " Just Causes " ( Philosophical Studies , vol 63 , 1991 , pp.3-17 ) , Blackburn attempts to show that projectivism can account for the intuition that there is a common and communicable topic involved in any moral debate .
Blackburn 's suggestion is that the projectivist can say that , in any worthwhile moral debate , the participants will recognise that there is some range of features to which it is not wildly idiosyncratic to respond with some among a range of responses .
Then , the common subject matter of the debate is constituted jointly by the range of features and the range of responses .
( E.g : Socrates and Thrasymachus are both talking about justice because they are both responding to societal structures with attitudes of favour and disfavour . )
Perhaps the success of this response can be granted to the projectivist ; but it is little help to the theistic project of definition .
Suppose we agree that we shall hold that , by definition , God is morally perfect .
Suppose further that we agree that we all mean by this that God possesses a set of properties which fall inside the limits imposed by idiosyncracy on what can count as " moral perfection " .
Then the following will become a perfectly intelligible position : I believe that God exists , I believe that God is morally perfect , and yet I do not have the slightest disposition to regard God favourably .
( After all , for all I know , he may be utterly monstrous -- e.g. he may agree with Thrasymachus about justice ! )
Now , I grant that this position is intelligible .
However , I also hold that it is one which no traditional theist would wish to adopt .
Part of the traditional view is that God 's moral perfection helps to make him a suitable object for universal worship and adoration .
But , on Blackburn 's projectivist reconstruction of the notion of moral perfection , that part of the view is bound to be lost .
If God is to be a suitable object for universal worship and adoration , then surely it must turn out not only that he is perfectly good according to the lights of each , but also that ( according to each ) he is perfectly good in a sense which ( ceteris paribus ) can motivate each to be disposed to regard him favourably .
So I conclude that ( Blackburn 's ) projectivism cannot provide a notion of moral perfection which is suitable for the theistic project of definition .
3. Response - Dependent Accounts :
We can see the ( above ) highlighted feature of Blackburn 's projectivism as an attempt to reduce the intersubjective variation in the content of moral concepts which is found in straightforward subjectivism .
The final theory which I wish to consider -- the view that evaluative moral concepts are response - dependent -- can be viewed as a further attempt in this same direction .
On a response - dependent view , it is an a priori truth about moral concepts that they satisfy the following constraint : objects fall under these concepts iff those objects are such as to produce certain non-trivially specifiable responses in certain non-trivially specifiable subjects under certain non-trivially specifiable conditions .
So , for example , if moral goodness is a response - dependent concept , then it will be the case that an object is morally good iff it is such as to produce responses R in subjects S under conditions C. ( Cf. Mark Johnston " Dispositional Theories Of Value " , PAS , 1990 for further characterisation and discussion . )
Now , in one sense , there is no barrier to the supposition that a response - dependent concept might be used in the definition of an object .
Suppose -- for the sake of an example -- that colour concepts are response - dependent , so that an object is red iff it is such as to produce certain responses ( looking red ) in certain subjects ( not colourblind , mentally alert , etc ) under certain conditions ( good lighting , etc ) .
Consider the description : " the largest red object in the universe " .
It is clear that this description does succeed in picking out an object -- at least if the universe is finite and there is not a tie for largest red object -- and it is also clear that the " indexical " difficulty which we found in the case of " object nearest to me " does not apply .
Nonetheless , there still seems to be something wrong with the idea that this sort of concept should form part of the definition of God .
After all , if we had different responses , our concepts would be different , and then - - on this picture -- it seems that our definition could only be satisfied by a quite different entity .
( Here , I imagine that eveything else is held constant -- so that the same form of words is used to express evaluative concepts , but the content of those evaluations differ because the relevant responses differ . )
Thus , I recognise a range of possible situations : there are cases in which our reponses are such as to lead the thesitic definition to pick out a unique entity , and there are cases in which only some other responses are such as to lead the tehistic definition to pick out a unique entity .
Should I subscribe to the theistic definition ?
Well , what reason do I have for thinking that our use of the expression " morally perfect " is one of the privileged ones which does in fact lead the theistic definition to pick out a unique being ?
I suppose that there are two sorts of answers which might be given at this point .
First , one might try to argue on a posteriori grounds -- i.e. to argue that available empirical evidence supports the view that the creator of the universe is morally perfect .
This response seems to me to be on shaky ground .
Doubtless , if God does exist , then it is reasonable to attribute some good actions , intentions , etc. to him .
Moreover , this attribution seems to be perfectly compatible with a response - dependent analysis of moral concepts .
But it also seems to me that the evidence adduced in traditional presentations of the problem of evil does not support the conclusion that God is morally perfect .
That is , the available evidence strongly suggests that some sort of a priori justification of the attribution of moral perfection to God is required .
The second option which one might pursue is to try to argue on a priori grounds that God is morally perfect .
But now , since it appears that there are no a priori arguments which turn on the actual content of our moral concepts , it seems that the same objection which we raised in the case of simple meta-ethical subjectivism takes hold .
For example , if one were to argue that there is a priori good reason to suppose that the creator of the universe is perfect in every respect , one would not have provided any reason for thinking that God is morally perfect .
A priori , it seems no less reasonable to suppose that some other range of responses would give rise to a concept of " moral perfection " which is truely applicable to God than it is to suppose that God is morally perfect .
Surely we should be guilty of a very unchristian hubris to think that we are especially privileged in the pattern of responses to which we conform .
After all , we are erring and fallible -- and our patterns of moral response have undergone great changes across the millenia ... .
I suppose that one answer which a theist might give is that God has so arranged things that our responses are of just the sort which is needed in order to ensure that our definition does pick him out .
However , this answer seems to conflict with other theistic views about freedom of the will -- and , in any case , would seem to be an entirely groundless claim .
Surely we have no evidence at all to support the view that a certain range of evaluative responses are just the ones which we need to make in order to bring it about that the theistic definition of God is uniquely satisfied by an object in our universe .
In sum , then , the problem is that it seems that one could not really be justified in doing all of the following :
( i ) adopting the traditional definition of God ;
( ii ) believing that God exists ;
( iii ) adopting a response - dependent account of moral concepts .
For the putative fact that moral concepts are response - dependent seems to leave us with no good reasons for thinking that there is an omniscient , ominpotent , eternal being who is also morally perfect .
If , as I have suggested , questions of empirical evidence can be set aside , then it seems that the actual content of our moral concepts is irrelevant to arguments about the nature of God -- and yet , on a response - dependent analysis , purely formal features of our moral concepts can give us no reason for thinking that God is morally perfect .
( There is a related and more venerable objection to the idea that God is morally perfect which might also be mentioned here .
Numerous medieval writers held that it was impossible for finite and imperfect creatures like us to form an adequate conception of the infinite and perfect properties of God .
It seems to me that there is something to this objection in the case of the attribution of the property of moral perfection to God given the recognition that ethical properties are response - dependent .
For , given that questions of empirical evidence can be set aside , what reason can we have for supposing that God possesses a property which is defined in terms of our responses ? )
Finally , in order to allay possible misgivings , I should point out that these considerations do nothing to undermine the plausibility of a response - dependent account of evaluative concepts .
The possibility of other ranges of response need not do anything to undermine our confidence in the truth of our ordinary judgements about good and bad , right and wrong .
However , it seems to me that the recognition of that possibility does serve to undermine any attempt to use those judgements as part of the foundation of a definition of " God " .
Given the above arguments , I think that it is reasonable to conclude that the traditional thesitic conception of God requires the assumption of meta-ethical realism .
Any meta-ethical theory which gives a constitutive role to the subjective responses of human subjects will be vulnerable to the sorts of arguments which I have given .
For any such theory produces a " relative " conception of goodness -- i.e. a conception of goodness in which the content of that concept depends upon how we actually respond , what we actually do , etc .
( Note , by the way , that the central issue is not about the right to speak of the " truth " of moral judgements .
Both ( quasi- realist ) projectivist and response - dependent theories can licence talk of the truth of moral judgements .
Rather , the central issue concerns the response - independence of moral judgements . )
Furthermore , I also think that it is reasonable to suppose that this conclusion does count against the traditional theistic conception of God .
It is , I think , very hard to see how the motivating force of moral considerations can be captured in a meta-ethical theory in which the content of moral judgements is strongly independent of our actual responses , judgements and actions .
However , as I said in the introduction , that is a topic for another occasion .
Finally , I should point out that the argument of this paper cannot also be used to support the view that those tradional theistic views are incompatible with fairly strong forms of meta-ethical objectivism .
For there seems to be no barrier to the supposition that an a priori argument might be used to establish that God is necessarily morally perfect given that moral perfection is a response - independent property of the universe .
The prospects for such arguments may be dim ; but that is an entirely different issue .

Sat-nav applications are also available for mobile phones
Shares in sat -nav device companies have fallen substantially after Google unveiled its free live sat-nav for mobiles on Wednesday .
US firm Garmin fell 18 % after details of Google Maps Navigation were revealed .
Dutch firm TomTom fell 9.5 % when markets closed on Thursday .
The Google application promises free real - time , turn - by - turn directions for people to follow on their phones .
The Motorola Droid will be the first mobile phone equipped with the system .
Google Maps Navigation , revealed on Wednesday , combines services including a search engine to find addresses , Google Street View for photos of locations , and live traffic data .
Other mobile sat-nav applications , such as TomTom 's , can cost up to £ 60 to add .
TomTom 's share decline wipes out all of its gains since August .
Separately the company warned of lower prices in the coming months .
LONDON  Assisted suicide has been illegal in England for nearly 50 years .
But , ordered by the courts to clarify the law , the country ’s top prosecutor on Wednesday set out a list of conditions under which his office would be unlikely to prosecute people who helped friends or relatives kill themselves .
The new guidelines are likely to make it easier for the terminally ill and those with degenerative diseases to receive help in committing suicide .
But the prosecutor , Keir Starmer , the director of public prosecutions , appears to have waded into a legal and emotional thicket .
While there is little legislative appetite to make assisted suicide legal here , prosecutors have tended to interpret the existing law flexibly , quietly and case by case .
The new guidelines are an attempt to codify their decision - making , but they have raised other issues , including questions about the role of doctors in assisted suicide , experts say .
In a statement , Mr. Starmer said that the law  under which “ aiding , abetting , procuring or counseling ” suicide is punishable by up to 14 years in prison  had not changed and that there were “ no guarantees against prosecution . ”
In the past , I jokingly said that broccoli might someday be banned as soon as the public begins to learn about the potent anti-cancer chemicals found in the vegetable .
That s because , as I jested , the FDA wouldnt want people treating their own cancer with the anti-cancer medicines found in cruciferous vegetables .
But it seems that my joke wasnt so funny after all , because the FDA is now threatening cherry growers with raids to confiscate their cherries , haul them into court , and put them out of business for doing one simple thing that the FDA cannot stand to allow :
The distribution of scientific information describing the health benefits of cherries .
On October 17 , 2005 , the FDA sent warning letters to 29 companies that market cherries .
In these letters , the FDA threatened these companies with legal action and told them they had to remove the scientific information on their websites that described the health benefits of the natural medicines found in cherries , such as the anthocyanins that reduce inflammation for arthritis sufferers .
According to the warped FDA logic that now seems to be standard , when cherry growers post scientific information about the health benefits of their cherries , they magically transform their cherries into drugs and therefore , as drugs , they must have FDA approval in order to sell them in the United States .
The FDA says a cherry is a drug
Now , any normal , sane person would look at a cherry and say ,  It s just a cherry . 
It s a natural fruit that people have been eating for as long as anyone can remember .
But the FDA , in light of the fact that people are now discovering that cherries are actually good medicine , looks at a cherry and says ( paraphrasing ) ,  No , it s a drug , and you have to have our permission to market it , and if you continue to talk about the health benefits of cherries , we will use our power to put you out of business . 
Ive often talked about the tyranny of the FDA and its campaign to censor the scientific truth about the healing benefits of natural foods , including cherries and many other items .
This event demonstrates perfectly well the sinister nature of the FDA , which clearly intends to restrict the spread of knowledge about cherries and thereby protect the profits of anti-inflammatory drugs that treat joint pain .
If Americans knew the true power of cherries to reduce inflammation , you see , the sales of anti-inflammatory drugs might plummet , and the criminal drug pushers who run organized medicine today can't allow that to happen .
Hence , censorship and oppression of scientific information are the tactics used to keep the American people ignorant and , therefore , controlled .
Because it 's not just cherries that contain powerful medicine , you see .
It 's blueberries , garlic , cabbage , onions , ginger , turmeric , cinnamon , aloe vera , almonds and a thousand other natural foods and medicinal herbs .
If the public understood the true healing power of these foods -- and the powerful medicines they contain -- conventional medicine and all its drug- pushing participants would suddenly be irrelevant and bankrupt .
That 's what the drug pushers absolutely cannot allow to happen , and that 's why the American people must be kept ignorant at all costs , even if it means engaging in book burning , armed raids on alternative medicine clinics , and jackbooted censorship of simple truths that might empower people to take charge of their own health .
It is the most insidious use of power by any federal agency because its aim is ignorance , not education .
It seeks to isolate people from information that might save them in order to control them , and it is the same tactic used by every evil regime in world history , including Nazi Germany .
It also makes the FDA the single greatest threat to the health and safety of the American people , far outweighing the threat of terrorism in terms of the number of people harmed or killed .
( See " Statistics prove prescription drugs are 16,400 % more deadly than terrorists " )
So I m just curious ; are cherry growers who distribute scientific information now going to be arrested as cherry traffickers ?
Will people start smuggling cherries across borders so that their customers can benefit from the healing effects of these natural foods ?
Will the FDA raid cherry orchards with guns drawn like it did Dr. Jonathan Wrights clinic in Seattle many years ago ?
Will cherry growers be arrested and tried on crimes of making health claims or illegally marketing unapproved drugs ?
These things were once thought of as being ridiculous .
The very idea that a natural food could be outlawed was once considered a joke .
Now it is one step closer to reality as this tyrannical organization , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , is censoring scientific information on the health benefits of cherries and using its power to threaten cherry growers into silence .
More nonsense from the FDA
Amazingly , the FDA doesnt claim to disagree with the scientific information about cherries .
Instead , it says that cherries have not been recognized as safe and effective when used as labeled . 
And as the Life Extension Foundation explains , the FDAs interpretation of the law means that cherry growers are engaged in criminal conduct by relaying findings that have been published in peer reviewed scientific journals . 
So now publishing information makes you a criminal even if that information is scientifically sound and widely known to be absolutely true .
If this is n't a blatant violation of the First Amendment , I do n't know what is .
Where 's the Electronic Freedom Foundation on this issue ?
Is n't this a clear case where the tyranny of the FDA should be openly challenged by champions of Free Speech ?
Cherries are now , according to the FDA , not recognized as safe and effective when used " as labeled . "
I m just curious , what does the label of cherries say about using it ?
Does it say ,  Eat me ? 
Because that 's what we should all be saying to the FDA right now , as it is an agency immersed in such absolute nonsense that even fools can see the emperor has no clothes .
To say a cherry is a drug and then threaten cherry growers with drug crimes is something ripped right out of the pages of 1984 and its Ministry of Truth .
( See Wikipedia to learn more . )
In terms of genuine authority , the FDA is nothing short of an utter joke and an embarrassment to the American people .
Unfortunately , it still has power , and it is exploiting that power to threaten cherry growers with criminal prosecution for doing what people have done for countless generations on this earth , which is to grow their own fruits and eat those fruits while enjoying their many benefits .
Do not tolerate unjust authority
Gandhi once initiated the Salt March to Dandi ( the " Salt Satyagraha " ) in defiance of the tyrannical salt taxation rules of the occupying British government , and there he and his followers intentionally violated the law by harvesting salt from the waters .
It was a practice that had been carried out for centuries by the people there , and one that provides essential minerals for human health .
Gandhis defiance may teach us something very important about modern times , and that is that when a law is so unjust as to stand in violation of fundamental human rights ,
The FDA operates today much like the occupying British in 20th century India , oppressing the people , outlawing natural traditions like salt harvesting in order to control a monopoly market , silencing dissent , and threatening any organization or individual that challenges its power .
The FDA , as it exists today , is an organization of tyranny and injustice that simply has no place in a free society .
That s why I believe it is time for growers of cherries , fruits , vegetables and other healing foods to take a stand against the FDA .
Stand firm against oppression and censorship , and stand up for your right to tell the truth about the healing benefits of your natural products .
The FDAs reclassification of cherry growers as criminals is a violation of every system of law and ethics that weve known on this planet .
It is a violation of natural law , it is a violation of Gods law , and it is a violation of basic human rights , which include the right to grow and eat food and share that food with your neighbors along with information about what those foods can do to nourish them .
The FDA would like to imagine that it is the ultimate authority over all things health related and that only it can approve what words we might use to describe the fruits and vegetables we share with our neighbors .
And as such , the FDA is an entity of ignorance and evil that actually seeks to de-educate the American people , and the day of outing the criminals who currently operate the FDA is long overdue .
This is an agency whose decision makers need to be immediately arrested and tried for their crimes against humanity .
It is an agency that demands wholesale reform from top to bottom and that must eliminate its obvious conflicts of interest and its desire to protect the pharmaceutical industry .
It must be reformed with a new mission that it should have been following all along :
To protect the health of the people it is supposed to serve .
End the tyranny of the FDA
If you 're an American voter , one of the best ways to protect your health freedom , which is clearly under assault by the Food and Drug Administration as well as other disease - promoting interest groups , is to support the ( HR4282 ) .
It is a bill that will allow organizations like cherry growers to tell the truth about their products , as long as that truth is based on sound science .
It would allow cherry growers , for example , to reference the published scientific studies that report on the healing benefits of the phytochemicals found in cherries .
It is a shame that in this country we even need such a bill , but we do need it , because the level of censorship , oppression , and tyranny now practiced by the FDA has reached its apex , and we must fight back with legislation that ends the tyranny of the Food and Drug Administration and reinforces our right to access information that can help us live happier , healthier and longer lives .
Support the Health Freedom Protection Act ( HR4282 ) by writing your representatives in Congress and voicing your opinion .
Also visit the Life Extension Foundation , publishers of Life Extension Magazine , which contributed to this report .
Finally , refuse to live as a slave of conventional medicine and the FDA for another day .
Demand health freedom and settle for nothing less than the ending of this age of medical tyranny that seeks to turn us all -- you , your parents , your children and preschoolers -- into ignorant , drug - induced consumers who will never know true freedom , nor true health .
Perhaps the greatest legacy that we can pass on to our children is the ending of this medical McCarthyism and the unfolding of a new golden age of health freedom .
Stay active and informed , and do not let ignorance and oppression prevail .

[ Haskell ] Announcing Haskell 2010
I 'm very proud to announce a new revision of the Haskell language , Haskell 2010 .
Over the last couple of months the committee has been making final decisions about which extensions should be a part of this revision .
The final list is : DoAndIfThenElse HierarchicalModules EmptyDataDeclarations FixityResolution ForeignFunctionInterface LineCommentSyntax PatternGuards RelaxedDependencyAnalysis LanguagePragma NoNPlusKPatterns
You can read more about each one , including rationale for and against , on its relevant wiki page , which are linked from the tickets :
http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&state=accepted&milestone=Haskell+2010&order=priority
Haskell 2010 is a small but significant step on the road that was started by the Haskell ' committee 4 years ago ,
The process has not been a smooth one , and there have been several changes of direction , but the current process is actually producing concrete results that let us move the language forward in positive steps , so I feel we 're on the right track .
We all owe the current committee a big thank - you for sticking with the process this long : most of them did n't realise the magnitude of what they were signing up for at the beginning .
The short list of changes above tells only a small part of the story , there is a wealth of wiki content and mailing - list discussion that future language revisions can draw on .
So what now ? *
We will produce a revised version of the Haskell language report incorporating these changes .
That will happen over the next few months .
* Compilers can start implementing the changes , and flags to select the Haskell 2010 revision .
In GHC we expect to have support in the next major release , i.e. 6.14.1 . * Right now , we will start forming a Haskell 2011 committee to mange the process of deciding on changes for next year 's revision .
The current committee is still discussing how to go about finding a new committee ( the plan is to at least have open nominations ) but I expect to be able to announce more details very soon .
* Everyone can participate in the Haskell 2011 process , by discussing and refining proposals .
Information about how to do that is on the Haskell Prime wiki : http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki
Remember : this is a community effort .
The changes that get adopted in each revision are drawn from the pool of fully - specified proposals , and those proposals can be written by anyone .
Thanks ,
Simon , on behalf of the Haskell 2010 committee
Give him credit for consistency :
The second “ core principle ” of the 9/12 Project is , after all , “ I believe in God and He is the center of my life . ”
I complained about that not long ago and a bunch of Beck fans jumped in to remind me that he ’s said one need n’t believe in all the “ core principles ” to be part of the movement .
No ?
Watch this clip and tell me how optional you think the God principle is in his mind .
I take his point about some liberal atheists filling the spiritual void with belief in government — it ’s a pet peeve of an evangelical Democrat friend of mine , in fact — but ( a ) it ’s not true of all nonbelievers , especially of the conservative stripe , and ( b ) personally , if I were inclined to get on my knees and wish / hope / pray for intervention from either God or Barack Obama , I ’d call out for The One too .
After all , there ’s at least a chance he might show .
I do n’t get the either / or dichotomy Beck draws between social justice and eternal justice either ; for starters , I can imagine Martin Luther King objecting rather strenuously to that .
Nor do I understand the snotty , presumptuous accusation that atheists are “ filling the void ” with money and careers .
Personally , I do n’t feel any spiritual void , and even if I did , I ’d rather not be lectured about it by a guy who has his own media empire and who ’ll make more money this year than my entire extended family has made in the past century .
What “ void ” in Beck ’s soul is he filling with his fantastically popular show ?
See how condescending it is to even ask that ?
And one more thing .
If the key to American governance is the passage in the Declaration of Independence about god - given inalienable rights , why ’d the authors of the Constitution go ahead and enumerate some of those rights anyway ?
And why , if they ’re inalienable and god - given , were n’t those rights made exempt from amendment or repeal via Article V ?
The touchstone of the Constitution is n’t God , it ’s rule by popular consent ; religion may well influence the public in deciding which rights are so critical that even the popularly elected government should be forbidden to touch them , but when push comes to shove , it ’s your call , not God’s .
Slavery was once a right too , after all , and I ’m sure there were plenty of apologists who found religious backing for that , fair or not .
Exit question :
Why does he keep pushing the argument that his show is n’t about Democrat vs. Republican ?
That ’s true , strictly speaking — he ’s a libertarian , not a party apparatchik — but the Dems have been the party of big ( ger ) government for the past 40 years , at least .
They ’re antithetical to his philosophy .
Saying his show has , or should have , no partisan resonance is like Janeane Garofalo insisting that she ’s not about Dems or Repubs , just “ truth . ”
And guess what ?
Watching TV while eating may not be the end of civilization as we know it .
In a 2009 study of 806 teenage girls , Professor Neumark - Sztainer concluded that watching television during dinner had little impact on substance abuse rates .
What mattered was that the family ate together .
( “ Though I ’m not a proponent of watching TV at dinner , ” she added . )
And for those who think family dinners should include thoughtful exchanges and revelations ?
Tell that to a 14 - year - old .
Amy Middleman , an adolescent medicine specialist at Texas Children ’s Hospital in Houston , said that the dinner table may be the last place a teenager chooses to drop a humdinger .
“ There ’s too much time to see your parents ’ reaction and their over - reaction , ” she said .
“ That ’s why they prefer to drop them just as they ’re getting out of the car . ”
Dr. Middleman herself has three children , ages 5 , 9 and 11 .
Her schoolteacher husband usually gives them a late snack and helps prepare dinner , so that they all sit down by 8 p.m .
She believes in the family dinner .
She counsels patients with eating disorders to eat with their families .
And yet she is not certain that the fundamental element of “ family dinner ” is even food itself .
“ The family dinner research may be telling us that that some of the more important elements may be about slowing down , organizing our lives with a little bit less harried time , ” she said .
“ There just needs to be some element of structure and reconnection during the day .
And I do n’t know that it has to be ‘ meaningful . ’
It could be a drive , a walk , a regular conversation . ”
To separate from the family in a healthy way , Dr. Middleman said , a teenager “ has to have some level of reassurance that when they come back , what they left will still be there .
And so whatever it takes to make that clear is probably what we ’re getting at with ‘ family dinners . ’ ”

I am pleased as punch !
A day after the Roman Catholic leadership in the country issued statements pressuring him to change his stand on the Reproductive Health Bill , Sen. Benigno “ Noynoy ” Aquino III has promptly answered that he will not give up his support for the use of artificial contraceptives to curb population growth — even at the risk of incurring the ire of the Catholic Church .
According to newsreports , Noynoy has appealed to Catholic bishops , exhorting them to “ wake up to the reality that something must be done to arrest the rapid growth of the country ’s population , which now stands at 95 million or almost double the 50 million in 1986 .
Noynoy has reportedly said that there really IS a problem , “ I hope that the Church will see that I have the reasonableness of my position on the issue , ” he said .
It ’s very commendable that Noynoy stood firm against the Church and its threat to mount a campaign against candidates in the 2010 election who will defy its supposedly “ pro-life ” and “ pro-family stand ” ( how ’s that for self - righteousness – as if the Church has the monopoly on knowledge , as if it ’s the main authority on what is good for families ; as if those who support the RH Bill are anti-life and anti-families ! )
Noynoy has further stated that while he is in favor of artificial contraceptives , he does not believe that the government should force couples to practice them , including the use of birth control pills .
“ I am encouraging the use of contraceptives .
But that will be left to the conscience of the person , ” he said ( Imagine being told that you will rub elbows with Satan and the rest of hell ’s denizens for using condoms , for using an IUD , for taking birth control pills !
Nevermind that you ’ve done nothing but good in your life ! )
Another quotable quote from Noynoy : “ The State has no right to dictate to its citizens who they should plan their families .
It can only provide guidance . ”
Hear , hear !
Noynoy added that it is the responsibility of the government to remind the citizens of their duty to take care of the needs of their children , including their education .
He also denied that there is a provision in the RH bill that would allow abortion .
What Noynoy is proposing is that Church leaders should be made to participate in population education program envisioned under the RH bill to enable them to present their side .
Let people think for themselves , for crying out loud !
It ’s great that Noynoy is unfazed and will not buckle to the pressure of the Catholic Church .
This all the more strengthens the opinion of some that he is running not because he wants to be powerful , but because he believes in something and hopes that he can make a difference by being president .
It ’s not every politician who willingly defies the Church and stands pat on his beliefs on issues regardless of threats that support will be denied his electoral campaign .
As for me , it ’s all the more flawed and unjustified for the Catholic Church to present itself as the main authority on life and families when for one thing , priests do n’t even have their own families : they ’re not allowed to have sex , to marry , and to have children .
I know the Church means well , but on this issue ( and in some many others … ) , it is waaaay off the mark .
Let parents see the options on how they can take of their families ; let mothers and women decide for themselves .
If they choose to follow Church doctrine against family planning , fine ; but if they choose something else , that ’s well within their rights .
The Church says that it ’s out to protect life , but how can you protect the unborn if the mothers who will carry them are unhealthy ?
Imagine a woman who has given birth four times before , and she ’s poor and has no access to medical care .
She can barely provide for her children ; but since she ’s still young , she might still get pregnant .
What if she does n’t want to anymore , because she knows she should n’t because her body ca n’t take it and she ’s aware that bearing another child will have severe impact on how she will be able to take care and look after her already existing children – should n’t she be allowed to do something to stop herself from getting pregnant ?
And for those who do want more children , should n’t they be allowed and even encouraged to determine when they ’re going to have them ?
Two years between pregnancies will allow the mother ’s body and health to recuperate from the rigor of childbearing and birth ; and by then , the previous baby will be a toddler and will be less difficult to look after ( compared to taking care of a one year old AND a newborn ) .
In the meantime , there are so many developments in the field of science that have to do with birth control .
There studies that say that pills are dangerous for women ’s health .
Would n’t it be better for people to be able to talk and discuss these developments among themselves and with professional , medical practitioners instead so they can make informed decisions ?
So they can take care of themselves better ?
Making something a taboo topic , if it has to do with health and safety , is dangerous .
Some would say that the Church should not get involved in other issues outside religion and faith ; I disagree .
By all means , the Church and its people should not separate themselves from society and politics , but JEEZ , THEY SHOULD MAKE THE CORRECT STANDS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMIC , POLITICAL AND CULTURAL WELFARE OF THE POOR AND WORKING PEOPLE .
And how will they know what is good ?
That ’s a different blog altogether .
But for starters , I would suggest that they abandon their rich parishes and go to where the poor and oppressed are and listen to them , discover their problems , live with them and help them to defend and assert their right to eat , to have homes , to have work , to live and not merely exist in a state short of waiting for death or whatever else that comes before death .
The Church should WORK with Filipinos as they fight for life against entropy and despair — a life that is better , more productive , more meaningful , less troubled , and more dignified .
Work and not just preach .
Guide instead of order .
Respond , instead of command .
Roman Catholic priests can also take lessons from their counterparts in the Iglesia Filipina Independiente .
In the meantime , think about this : the Arroyo government has a budget of P252.49 for the health needs of each Pinoy for entire 2010 .
This is according to the the Health Alliance for Democracy ( HEAD ) .
Should n’t the Church lobby for higher government allocations for health services and cutbacks on military spending and foreign debt payments instead of venting its ire on the RH Bill ?
And for the record , it ’s not GOD I have issues with ; it ’s THE CHURCH .
In a piece today in The Times , Sony boss Michael Lynton yet again champions 3 strikes for alleged pirates and states that combating piracy could add millions to the economy .
He also says that due to piracy , in 2008 Hollywood made the lowest number of movies in the last decade .
So where did its record earnings go ?
Michael Lynton , chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment , is becoming a confusing guy .
Back in May this year , millions of people looked on in disbelief as he labeled one of the world ’s greatest technological and communications achievements – the Internet – as a mechanism from which nothing good had come , period .
Then , a little later , Lynton hit back at his critics .
He pointed to the leak of an unfinished copy of Wolverine , which appeared on the Internet ( from a movie studio source who has never been identified ) a month before its official release .
As Techdirt pointed out , none of this hurt the movie .
Despite terrible reviews and this “ devastating ” leak , Wolverine still did very well at the box office , taking $ 35 million on its first day , beating both X : Men ( $ 20.8 m ) and X2 : X - Men United ( $ 31.2 m ) .
In a guest piece in The Times today , Lynton is complaining again .
“ Internet piracy means less money to make movies , ” warns the headline .
Lynton begins by plugging Sony ’s launch tomorrow of Michael Jackson ’s This Is It , noting the importance of releasing it simultaneously worldwide .
“ If Sony released it only in the US on Wednesday , by late Thursday it would be camcorded , uploaded on to the internet and available free to anyone with a broadband connection , ” he said .
While absolutely correct , everyone also knows that the following is also true .
The quality would be absolutely dire , Jackson ’s singing would be punctuated by the rattling of candy packets and accompanied by a myriad of noisy cinema - goers singing their own version of his songs , probably all in D - Minor .
The video would undoubtedly bring a whole new dimension to Black or White .
People download this garbage but no - one enjoys it , and for good movies sales are not affected – but I digress .
“ Online theft siphons billions of dollars out of the marketplace .
That means less money to make movies .
Projects get scaled back and others dropped .
Some potential blockbusters wo n’t get made .
Some new writers , actors and film - makers wo n’t get discovered , ” writes Lynton , adding ;
“ Last year the leading Hollywood studios made 162 films — more than 40 fewer than in 2006 , and the lowest number in a decade . ”
But of course , just counting the “ leading ” studios does n’t give the full picture .
Even the MPAA ’s own stats reveal a slightly different picture ;
“ The total number of films released domestically in 2008 was up 1.8 % , to 610 films . ”
So , if one casts the net slightly wider ( yes , there is a world outside Universal , Warner , Paramount , Sony and Twentieth Century Fox ) , things look slightly different .
2004 Total Movies Released : 567 Total Combined Gross : $ 9,327,315,935
2005 Total Movies Released : 594 Total Combined Gross : $ 8,825,324,278
2006 Total Movies Released : 808 Total Combined Gross : $ 9,225,689,414
2007 Total Movies Released : 1022 Total Combined Gross : $ 9,665,661,126
2008 Total Movies Released : 1037 Total Combined Gross : $ 9,705,677,862
2009 Total Movies Released : 1177 Total Combined Gross : $ 7,596,626,766
( 2009 figures incomplete , total movies scheduled to be released , gross to date )
Admittedly less money seems to be being made per movie , but that has n’t resulted in less being made – movie releases are set to almost double from 2004 to 2009 .
But in the end , Lynton is arguing that more piracy means that less money goes into the studios ’ pockets .
But in an Ars Technica piece ‘ What piracy crisis ?
MPAA touts record box office for 2007 ‘ , the stats speak for themselves ;
“.. data that shows the US box office doing its biggest year of business ever in 2007 , growing 5.4 percent over 2006 and bringing in $ 9.63 billion . ”
So maybe 2008 was a disaster ?
Not quite .
In another Ars piece ‘ What piracy ?
Movie biz sees record box office in 2008 ‘ , the stats also speak loud and clear ;
“ Domestic film box offices broke multiple records this year [ 2008 ] , grossing an estimated $ 9.78 billion . ”
Even the MPAA ’s own stats reveal that the “ Worldwide box office reached another all - time high in 2008 at $ 28.1 billion , an increase of 5.2 % over 2007 . ”
I ’m absolutely no statistician , but I simply find Lynton ’s claims confusing .
I ca n’t imagine that I ’m on my own .
How did Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- saved a year ago by the US taxpayer -- magically make $ 3 billion in 3 months a year later ?
This as the US dollar collapses , unemployment soars and foreclosures hit a record ?
Here is the Goldman , Sachs & Co. revenue break down for the past 3 months :
Financial Advisory - M/A : 325 million .
Equity Underwriting : 363 million .
Debt Underwriting : 211 million .
Trading - Principal Investments : 10 billion .
Notice that 10 billion is much bigger than two or three hundred million made from the traditional Wall Street businesses .
That $ 10 billion is evidence of their magic trick .
For we the taxpayer gave Goldman Sachs the following :
$ 10 Billion in TARP $ 11 Billion from the Fed $ 30 Billion from the FDIC $ 13 Billion from AIG
For a grand total of almost $ 70 Billion ( Goldman along with every other bank and AIG would have been defunct without this money ) .
Goldman at the apex of the crisis is delivered this money -- which they then use to borrow against at $ 20 or $ 30 for every $ 1 .
Which at 30 x equals $ 2.1 trillion in available capital .
As one of the only banks in the world with money at the time , Goldman Sachs was able to buy billions in distressed assets around the world at record low prices -- only to watch $ 23.7 trillion in US taxpayer money be deployed during the past year to re-inflate the asset 's values that Goldman had purchased with our tax money .
The question is not why did we bail out the banks .
The question is why did we give the banks billions of our money so they could then buy assets by the trillions with our money and they keep the profits ?
The answer is Henry Paulson , former Goldman Sachs CEO who ran the US Treasury , and Tim Geithner , current Treasury Secretary who at the time ran the New York Federal Reserve , willingly delivered Goldman Sachs the $ 70 Billion -- with no strings attached .
So what can we do ?
We must demand the return of those investment gains made with America 's money - it was stolen from us and we can get it back .
Demand Claw Backs - and not from the future but from the past -
That is where our money is .
We must have an exchange for all credit derivatives -- the current version is riddled with loopholes that let banks avoid transparency by mobbing offshore and prohibiting government regulators from being able to force the use of the exchange by the banks .
So how do you do it ?
Heed the Call !!!!

The late summer / fall wildfire season is in full swing in the western United States .
Significant wildfires are observed each year by astronauts orbiting the Earth on the International Space Station .
This astronaut photograph documents the Arnica Fire in Yellowstone National Park .
The fire was started by a lightning strike near Yellowstone Lake on September 13 , 2009 .
By the time it was detected on September 23 , 2009 , it covered approximately 2 hectares ( 4 acres ) .
The fire was photographed by the astronauts on the following day ( September 24 ) ; by then , it had grown to 101 hectares ( 250 acres ) in size .
Warm , dry and windy conditions in the area provided a favorable environment for growth of the fire , and as of October 1 , 2009 , the fire was estimated to be 3,764 hectares ( 9,300 acres ) in size .
The image is highly oblique , or taken looking outwards at an angle , rather than straight down towards the Earth ’s surface .
The ISS was approximately above Lake Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada — almost 1,200 kilometers ( 746 miles ) to the northeast of the fire — when this image was taken using a long lens .
Landmarks visible in the image include Yellowstone and Jackson Lakes at image center ; the Teton Range is visible in the background .
The reflection of the smoke plume is visible in Yellowstone Lake .
A regional view of the Arnica Fire was acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) sensor on NASA ’s Aqua satellite .
The MODIS image shows the areal extent of the Arnica smoke plume , and the oblique astronaut photograph provides complementary information on the vertical plume structure .
As the two images were taken 3 days apart , they cannot be directly paired ; however , together they provide a more complete picture of smoke plume evolution than either image would separately .

The Australian Labor Party and the war in Afghanistan
Socialist Equality Party ( Australia )
7 October 2009
Today marks the eighth anniversary of the US invasion of Afghanistan .
From the outset , this neo-colonial war has had the unconditional support of not only the former conservative government of John Howard , but the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) .
Since its election in November 2007 , the Rudd Labor government has escalated Australian military involvement .
Just as Afghanistan is now referred to as Obama ’s war , so it has become Rudd ’s war .
For the Australian military , the war in Afghanistan has already become the longest and most costly conflict since Vietnam , and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has made clear he intends to deploy troops there for at least another five years .
Under the pretext of a “ war on terrorism ” Washington , with its allies , is attempting to establish an American client state and US military bases in the heart of Central Asia .
No less than Iraq , the Afghanistan war is a predatory operation aimed at dominating a region replete with critical reserves of oil and gas .
Using its military prowess , US imperialism is seeking to offset its protracted and historic decline relative to its major rivals in Europe and Japan and new challengers , such as China and Russia .
Labor ’s support for this criminal agenda enjoys the full backing of the political and media establishment , including those elements that expressed certain “ reservations ” about the Howard government ’s participation in Iraq .
The Australian media constantly repeats the lie that the Afghan war is a struggle against “ terrorism ” or a means of establishing “ democracy ” .
The so - called “ left ” and trade union delegates at this year ’s ALP conference unanimously endorsed a resolution stating “ Labor will provide military support to Afghanistan ” .
The anti-Howard online organisation GetUp ! , which modeled itself on the anti-Bush MoveOn.org , does not mention the conflict as one of its ongoing “ campaigns ” .
Within the Senate , Greens ’ leader Bob Brown has called for a debate on the deployment of Australian forces to Afghanistan .
The Greens , however , have no differences in principle with the UN - endorsed occupation by American and NATO forces .
Brown declared , for example , in August that he believed Australian troops were in Afghanistan to fight for “ liberty , democracy and decency ” .
His sole reason for advocating a withdrawal of Australian troops is that that they should be deployed more directly in the “ national interest ” , i.e. , to further Canberra ’s neo-colonial operations in the South Pacific .
The Victorian branch of the Greens demonstrated the organisation ’s essentially pro-war stance by refusing to endorse protests this weekend to mark the anniversary .
The support or silence over the Afghan war is all the more striking given the stance of the “ lefts ” , unions , GetUp ! and the Greens during the 2007 election .
At that time , they argued that Rudd ’s pledge to withdraw the small number of Australian combat troops in Iraq was evidence that Labor represented an “ anti- war ” alternative to Howard .
Even more pernicious was the role played by the middle class protest organisations such as Socialist Alliance .
These tendencies declared that while Labor was no less pro-war than Howard , its token differences over Iraq demonstrated it was a “ lesser evil ” and “ more responsive ” to mass pressure .
Labor ’s record , both in opposition and government , underscores the utterly dishonest nature of this campaign .
The ALP is a committed defender of the US - Australia alliance and has made support for the war in Afghanistan a corner - stone of its foreign policy since 9/11 .
It actively advocated Australian military involvement following the initial invasion in 2001 , condemned the Howard government for withdrawing troops in late 2002 and agitated for the redeployment of combat forces in 2005 .
The Labor Party ’s differences with the Howard government over Iraq were purely tactical .
It shared the view of a significant faction of the American political establishment , which feared the war in Iraq was undermining US interests and distracting attention from Afghanistan and Central Asia .
In 2008 , the Democratic Party chose Barack Obama — who was promoted by ex-lefts and liberals in the US and around the world as a “ progressive ” — to be the public advocate of this position .
Like Rudd , Obama was portrayed as “ anti-war ” .
His administration , however , has pursued the same essential agenda as that of Bush .
The military suppression of armed resistance in Iraq , at the cost of over one million Iraqi lives , has enabled US imperialism to redirect forces to Afghanistan .
Obama has already dispatched 21,000 additional troops and as many as 40,000 more may be sent , adding to the 100,000 American and NATO personnel already in the country .
Since Obama came to power , Labor has marched in lockstep with the tactical shift in US foreign policy .
It has increased the Australian military contribution in Afghanistan from 1,100 to 1,550 , and if Rudd is asked by Obama to send even more troops , particularly for frontline combat operations when Dutch forces leave in mid-2010 , there is no doubt that he will comply .
Special Air Service ( SAS ) troops and army commandos are already operating as death squads to hunt down and assassinate alleged insurgents in Afghan villages and towns .
In numerous incidents , Afghan civilians have been killed or maimed .
Other Australian forces are occupying the province of Uruzgan , where the population is overwhelmingly opposed to the foreign occupation .
Casualties are rising .
In the nearly two years since Labor took office , eight Australian soldiers have been killed and dozens wounded , compared with three deaths in Afghanistan and two non-combat fatalities in Iraq in the preceding six years .
The ex-left organisations that promoted Labor as the “ lesser evil ” in 2007 bear political responsibility for this escalating Australian involvement in Afghanistan .
Their campaign for the election of a Rudd government was a conscious effort to block the development of an independent political movement of the working class against both big business parties .
Labor ’s support for the criminal wars of aggression being waged by Washington is a profound expression of the class interests that it serves — those of the Australian corporate and financial elite .
Like Howard , Labor ’s primary concern is preserving Australia ’s postwar ANZUS alliance with the United States , which is pivotal to investment , trade and access to industrial and military technology .
Moreover , the alliance is central to Australian imperialism ’s ability to maintain its position as a dominant regional power in the South Pacific , in the face of growing influence by China and other countries .
The Australian troops who took control of East Timor in 1999 and the Solomon Islands in 2003 were , in the final analysis , only able to do so with US backing .
In return , Washington requires Australian participation in its own wars of aggression .
Labor ’s support for US militarism is matched by its domestic agenda .
As the global economic crisis worsens , neo -colonial operations abroad go hand in hand with deepening attacks on the working class at home .
Rudd is presiding over a wholesale assault on wages , working hours and conditions , and the further dismantling of public health , education and other essential social services .
At the same time , his government has budgeted tens of billions of dollars to expand the armed forces to prepare for even bloodier wars in the future .
The same organisations that advocated Labor ’s election now sense that opposition to the war in Afghanistan has reached unprecedented levels .
Opinion polls show that the majority of the population opposes any involvement and more than two thirds reject sending any more troops .
The Socialist Alliance - dominated Stop the War Coalition is responding with another cynical campaign to prevent this opposition from becoming a conscious political repudiation of the Labor Party .
Its demonstrations are aimed at sowing the illusion that protests can “ pressure the Rudd government to bring the troops home ” .
They will provide a platform for a handful of union officials to offer demagogic criticisms of the war , while the trade union movement as a whole continues to support Labor ’s foreign and domestic agenda .
Opponents of militarism must reject the futile protest politics behind the Afghanistan war anniversary demonstrations and draw the necessary conclusions from past experiences .
In February and March 2003 , the largest ever protests took place around the world , including in Australia , against the impending US invasion of Iraq .
Those protests , however , were dominated by similarly fatal illusions : that the UN or France and Germany ( all of which continue to back the war in Afghanistan ) would stop the Bush administration ’s criminal aggression .
Any genuine struggle against war involves a political fight to abolish its root cause — the capitalist profit system .
Colonialism and inter-imperialist conflict are the inevitable outcome of an economic order based on private profit and the division of the world into competing nation states .
In Australia , the precondition for a mass political movement against war is a political break with the Labor Party and its pro-capitalist program and the struggle to build a party of the working class based on socialist internationalism — the rational and harmonious reorganisation of the world economy to meet the interests of the mass of ordinary people , not the profits and privileges of a tiny minority .
That is the perspective for which the Socialist Equality Party fights , along with its sister parties in the International Committee of the Fourth International around the world .
A major story is breaking in climate science , after hackers posted a 61 megabyte data file on a Russian server that appears to be confidential emails and climate data hacked from the UK Met Office Hadley Centre .
The data raises major questions about the role of scientists in what appears to be a deliberate conspiracy to mislead the public :

Dear Ray , Mike and Malcolm ,
Once
Tim's got a diagram here we 'll send that either later today or
first thing tomorrow .
I 've just completed Mike 's Nature trick of adding in the real temps
to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) amd from
1961 for Keith 's to hide the decline .
Mike 's series got the annual
land and marine values while the other two got April - Sept for NH land
N of 20N .
The latter two are real for 1999 , while the estimate for 1999
for NH combined is +0.44C wrt 61-90 .
The Global estimate for 1999 with
data through Oct is +0.35 C cf. 0.57 for 1998 .
Thanks for the comments , Ray .
Cheers
Phil

If there 's an innocent explanation , I 'll be interested in hearing it .
In the meantime I 've sent an email to Phil Jones asking if this email is genuine .
For those interested , the large file can be downloaded here [ UPDATE , file removed from server .
Have decided not to re-link in case some of the new ones around have been modified .
I have a copy of the original .
You can check out some of the alternative download links at Watts , but checksum the file as per their instructions to ensure it is the original ]
UPDATE : Am busy on the TGIF deadline so have only generally perused the leaked emails .
It appears to be a collection that might have been prepared for a possible FOIA ( freedom of information ) request and were in the process of being scrutinized .
The tone of many is quite waspish , although like others the email above seems too damning to be true .
Surely they were n't that stupid to commit such comments to writing back in 1999 ?
UPDATE 2 : One of the emails refers to stacking the peer - review process to ensure scientific papers by the likes of NZ's Chris de Freitas do n't make it past review into the IPCC 's 2007 AR4 .
The other paper by MM is just garbage – as you knew .
De Freitas again .
Pielke is also losing all credibility as well by replying to the mad Finn as well – frequently as I see it .
I can't see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report .
K and I will keep them out somehow – even if we have to redefine what the peer - review literature is !
Shocking .
Lends authenticity to the documents as well – a US or European based hacker would not be likely to pluck de Freitas ' name out of thin air if they were making something up .

Casey Stoner claimed his third successive win at the Australian Grand Prix on a day when Valentino Rossi moved a step closer to retaining his FIM MotoGP World Championship title .
Fiat Yamaha rider Rossi finished second behind Stoner but more importantly saw his team - mate and nearest title rival Jorge Lorenzo fail to make it beyond the first corner after the Spaniard tangled with Nicky Hayden .
Ducati rider Stoner looked comfortable at the front as he led home Rossi by two seconds to claim a hat - trick of triumphs at his home event and his first win since returning from the illness which sidelined him for three races earlier this season .
Rossi's near - perfect day saw him move onto 270 points , a lead of 38 over Lorenzo with two races remaining .

Never before has the legendary Mont Ventoux appeared so late in the Tour de France , and never has it been as decisive for the overall classification as it will be come Saturday when the race finishes at its summit on the penultimate stage .
Absent in the Tour de France for seven years , it was last the scene of Frenchman Richard Virenque 's solo triumph and one place where Lance Armstrong further cemented his fourth Tour victory .
Standing 1,912 metres tall in the Provence region of southern France , the Mont Ventoux has been visited by the Tour 13 times , seven as a summit finish and six in passing during a stage .
It will be the third and final mountain top finish of the 2009 Tour de France , the final obstacle of the 167 - kilometre penultimate stage .
It is a mountain known for its bald , limestone summit absent of vegetation and with unrelenting wind - the mistral has been recorded at speeds in excess of 320 km/h - and during Tour stages , its usual oppressive heat .
Many chapters of Tour de France heroism and heartbreak have been written on Mont Ventoux , and the Tour organisers are expecting that the 2009 Tour 's outcome will still be in doubt until the Ventoux has been conquered .
Coming from Montélimar , the peloton will pass through olive country near Nyons and hit the hilly hinterland of the mountain from its Northern side .
A loop eastwards will then see the riders tackle the non-classified Col de Notre - Dame des Abeilles before they hit the final climb from its traditional , most difficult side starting in Bédoin .
The peloton will face an unrelenting 21.1 - kilometre ascent averaging 7.6 percent that ends at the rocky scree of a summit which will lay the fortitude of our yellow jersey contenders as bare as its lunar - like landscape .
Before one can predict who will emerge victorious atop this Giant of Provence , we must first dig deep into the history books to see how previous battles on this climb have unfolded .
1958 : Stage 15 , Bédoin - Mont Ventoux ( 21.5 km time trial )
A Tour de France stage would end at Mont Ventoux 's summit for the first time in 1958 , the year Luxembourg 's climbing and time trialing phenom Charly Gaul would achieve his only Tour victory .
And while Gaul did n't attain the maillot jaune on the slopes of the Ventoux , he would make a dramatic move up the GC with his dominating win .
Gaul , who started the day ninth overall , 10:41 behind Italian Vito Favero , would end the day within striking distance of the new leader , France 's Raphaël Géminiani .
Gaul moved into third behind Géminiani and Favero , who finished 24th , 7:59 slower than Gaul .
Only one man , Spain 's " Eagle of Toledo " , Federico Bahamontes , would finish close to Gaul at 31 seconds , but he was no threat overall .
The remaining 91 riders would all cede minutes to Luxembourger , who , despite preferring cooler weather , still excelled in the scorching conditions that day .
He would ultimately prevail by 3:10 over Favero and 3:41 ahead of Géminiani when the race finished .
Mont Ventoux was the second of three time trials that year , all won by Gaul .
The Luxembourger cemented his place in Tour lore and legend by also winning the 219 - kilometre stage 21 from Briançon to Aix les Bains in apocalyptic rain , beating the nearest finisher by nearly eight minutes , fully negating the ten minutes he lost due to a mechanical incident the day after his Ventoux triumph .
Gaul 's time of 1:02:09 for the 21.5 - kilometre ascent of Mont Ventoux would stand as the record for nearly 41 years until Jonathan Vaughters set a new best time in winning the third stage of the 1999 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré , a time trial along the same course from Bédoin to the Mont Ventoux summit , in 56:50.9 .
Iban Mayo , the Basque Euskaltel - Euskadi climber , set the current record in the 2004 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré 's stage five time trial , ascending the Giant of Provence in 55:51.49 .
1965 : Stage 14 , Montpellier - Mont Ventoux ( 173 km )
France 's beloved Raymond Poulidor , " the eternal second " , finished on the Tour podium eight times in his career , thrice second and five times third , and never wore yellow for one day of the 14 Tours he started .
On paper , 1965 should have been Poulidor 's year to triumph in the absence of arch-rival Jacques Anquetil , but nobody expected 22 - year - old Italian Felice Gimondi , in his first year as a professional , to capture his solitary Tour victory .
However , Poulidor drew great satisfaction from his triumph on Mont Ventoux during which he moved into second place overall and reduced his GC deficit to only 34 seconds behind Gimondi .
Poulidor bested Spain 's Julio Jimenez , who he had been in a break with for much of the stage , by six seconds .
Gimondi made a superhuman effort to close the gap to Poulidor to 1:34 on the day , finishing in fourth place .
" Felice Gimondi took quite some time from me in the first part of the Tour that year .
In the mountains I was able to distance him but it was n't possible to make up all the time on him , " Poulidor told Cyclingnews .
" That day , I won on the Mont Ventoux ahead of [ Julio ] Jimenez and Gimondi was in difficulty .
He was able to restore the situation to his advantage in the end , and finally won the Tour de France .
But the Mont Ventoux that day was part of my greatest victories , it was a revelation . "
Poulidor commented on what makes Mont Ventoux such a special fixture in professional cycling .
" You climb it from the south side , during a very hot season , in the beginning of the afternoon .
It 's practically a desert !
There is no vegetation , nothing ... the heat is unbearable , you can't breathe .
" The finish on top of the Ventoux is the finish of the stage , so you 've already made considerable efforts beforehand in the stage .
There had been attacks of those who thought they might have a chance to win ... there is no time to recover . "
Poulidor is particularly looking forward to watching Saturday 's stage , where the Ventoux will see tired riders tackle this climb to the finish .
" This year , it will be especially hard .
It was a very good idea by the organiser to put the Ventoux practically at the end of the race .
" We will have three or four potential winners that day - one at the foot of the climb , another one halfway up , yet another one with three kilometres to go and the final winner in the finish !
That would be absolutely extraordinary !
" Everything is possible that day .
If there are three or four overall favourites within one minute of each other - or even more - nothing will be decided until the very last metres of the climb . "
1970 : Stage 14 : Gap - Mont Ventoux ( 170 km )
It should come as no surprise that Belgian legend Eddy Merckx would make his mark on the slopes of Mont Ventoux during his storied career .
Merckx wore yellow for all but three days of the 1970 Tour , including the final 18 in a row , and won eight stages en route to beating runner - up Joop Zoetemelk by 12:41 and Sweden 's Gosta Pettersson by 15:54 for his second Tour victory .
Going into the Tour 's 14th stage to Mont Ventoux Merckx already held a commanding 6:39 advantage over Zoetemelk while Pettersson 's deficit stood at 10:42 , but Merckx being Merckx he stamped his authority on the race yet again , leaving all in the peloton behind amidst the suffocating heat on that July 10th .
Merckx 's former teammate Martin Van den Bossche would finish closest , 1:11 behind , while Pettersson , in 9th place , lost a further 1:39 to the Cannibal and Zoetemelk ceded 2:47 to finish in 15th place .
The victory did exact a toll on Merckx , however , as his pedalling become rather erratic in the closing several hundred metres of the stage .
While walking to the podium Merckx fainted and received oxygen in a nearby ambulance before stepping to the stage .
In a poignant moment approaching the stage 's finish , Merckx tipped his hat while passing the memorial to deceased English professional Tom Simpson two kilometres from the Ventoux summit just as Tour de France race director Jacques Goddet was leaving a bouquet of flowers at the memorial .
Three years earlier , Merckx was a teammate of Simpson on Peugeot - BP - Michelin ( although not a competitor in the 1967 Tour ) , the year Simpson died on the slopes of the Ventoux , and was the only professional cyclist to attend his funeral .
Merckx would be the only cyclist to ever win a summit finish at Mont Ventoux while wearing the yellow jersey .
1972 : Stage 11 : Carnon - Plage - Mont Ventoux , ( 207 km )
It was something of a minor miracle that Bernard Thévenet was even in the Tour de France on stage 11 after being part of a brutal crash in the Pyrenees on stage 7 .
While pursuing Merckx on a descent in wet , treacherous conditions , Luis Ocaña crashed taking Bernard Thévenet , Lucien Van Impe and Alain Santy down as well .
Thévenet received a concussion and temporarily lost his memory .
According to Vélo he looked down at his Peugeot jersey and wondered whether he might be a cyclist and upon recognizing the team car , he said , " I 'm riding the Tour de France ! "
Four days later , however , Thévenet soled to victory on Mont Ventoux , beating race leader Eddy Merckx by 34 seconds and Luis Ocaña by 39 seconds .
Eddy Merckx would win his fourth consecutive Tour in 1972 , while Thévenet would have to settle for ninth overall , 37:11 behind , plus stage wins on Mont Ventoux and one week later in Ballon d'Alsace .
Thévenet would win his first Tour five years later in 1977 .
1987 : Stage 18 : Carpentras - Mont Ventoux ( 36.5 km time trial )
Jean - François
Bernard 's masterful time trial victory on Mont Ventoux propelled the 25 - year - old Frenchman into the yellow jersey and into the hearts of France , but his stint in yellow the following day would be the only stage in which Bernard would ever wear yellow throughout his career .
Bernard raised some eyebrows while seen warming up on his low - profile time trial bike for a mountain time trial , but his Toshiba - Look directeur sportif Paul Koechli had a plan in mind .
The opening 15 kilometres of road rose at a very gentle gradient from Carpentras to the beginning of Mont Ventoux 's climb , so Bernard would start on his time trial bike to gain an aerodynamic advantage before switching to his road bike to complete the 21.1 - kilometre ascent to the summit .
Bernard rode like a man possessed to Mont Ventoux 's summit past a crowd estimated at 400,000 people , stopping the clock at 1:19:44 .
Admitting afterwards that " I felt terrible " , nonetheless Bernard beat the cream of the Tour 's climbers with Colombia 's Luis Herrera 1:39 behind in second place while Spain 's Pedro Delgado finished third , 1:41 back .
Bernard beat Stephen Roche , the fifth place finisher , by 2:19 and bested race leader Charly Mottet by a hair less than four minutes .
Bernard now led Roche by 2:34 , Mottet by 2:47 and Delgado by 3:56 , but would finish the next day 's stage 4:16 behind Delgado and Roche due to an untimely puncture and turn over the yellow jersey to the Irishman .
Bernard would finish the Tour on the podium for the only time in his career , in third behind Roche and Delgado , having won two time trials along the way .
1987 was Roche 's magical year : he became only the second rider in history to win the Giro , the Tour and World Championship in a single season .
The first , of course , was Eddy Merckx .
2000 : Stage 12 : Carpentras - Mont Ventoux ( 149 km )
When the peloton reached Bédoin with only the 21 - kilometre ascent of Mont Ventoux remaining , a nine - rider break held a two - minute advantage over the peloton .
As the chasing field approached the sharp left - hand bend in St. Esteve that signaled the start of the steep section of Mont Ventoux , US Postal Service had taken over the chase .
First Tyler Hamilton , then Kevin Livingston did yeoman 's work up front for Lance Armstrong , while behind , José Maria Jimenez ( Banesto ) , Alex Zülle ( Banesto ) , Fernando Escartin ( Kelme ) and Christophe Moreau ( Festina ) simply dropped off the intense pace of the front runners on the wooded forest road .
With 10 kilometres to race , the front group had been whittled down to six , composed of Armstrong ( USPS ) , Roberto Heras and Santiago Botero ( Kelme ) , Richard Virenque ( Polti ) , Joseba Beloki ( Festina ) and Jan Ullrich ( Telekom ) , with Marco Pantani ( Mercatone Uno - Albacom ) yo- yoing off the back of this group .
Ullrich made most of the tempo going up , and when the steep Ventoux climb leveled out a bit at Chalet Reynard with 6.5 kilometres to go , Pantani made it back to the front group for good .
Chalet Reynard is just above the tree line on Mont Ventoux , at 1410 meters above sea level , and it's where the riders are exposed to the full force of the fierce mistral wind .
Suddenly Pantani attacked , his acceleration visibly hurting the other leaders , notably Richard Virenque , who went out the back almost immediately .
Pantani attacked three more times and eventually got a gap with 3 kilometres to race .
Armstrong , the maillot jaune , attacked from the rear of the group to chase Pantani and made contact with 2.5 kilometres left to the line .
Armstrong and Pantani rode away from the elite chase group and at the summit the Italian nosed ahead of Armstrong to claim victory , 33 years to the day after Tom Simpson died on the Ventoux 's slopes .
But did Armstrong " gift " Pantani the stage ?
A war of words would forever strain relations between the two champions about the circumstances surrounding Pantani 's victory and the theme " no gifts " would become an Armstrong mantra in future Tours .
2002 : Stage 14 : Lodève - Mont Ventoux , 221km
Richard Virenque would etch his name into the legends of Mont Ventoux seven years ago when he arrived at the summit nearly two minutes ahead of Russia 's Alexandre Botcharov and 22 seconds more in front of race leader Lance Armstrong .
Virenque went long that hot July Sunday , situating himself in an 11 - man break which went clear only 19 kilometres into the 221 - kilometre stage .
The escapees attained a maximum advantage of 12:03 over the US Postal Service - led peloton and arrived at the foot of Mont Ventoux with a lead of nearly seven minutes .
With nine kilometres remaining to the summit , Virenque dropped Botcharov , the Frenchman 's last remaining companion from the day - long break , while Armstrong found himself without teammates in a group containing the ONCE duo Joseba Beloki and José Azevedo , Lithuania 's Raimondas Rumsas , Italy 's Ivan Basso ( leader of the best young rider classification ) and Spain 's Francisco Mancebo .
Emerging from the scrubby pine woods at Le Chalet Reynard into the lunar last stretch up to the finish with 6.5 kilometres to go , the struggling Virenque had 4:00 on the Armstrong group .
Beloki attacked on a steep pitch 1 km before Le Chalet Reynard and Armstrong quickly pounced on the ONCE rider 's wheel , then turned the tables on Beloki and counterattacked him hard .
Armstrong dropped the Basque , decisively demonstrating just who was the boss of the 2002 Tour de France .
As Armstrong set a savage tempo .
One kilometre up the road with four kilometres remaining , Virenque was hanging on to a 3:50 advantage on the surging Texan , while Beloki was desperately chasing in the desolate treeless , lunar landscape .
As he did the previous year winning Paris - Tours , despite his damaged reputation , Virenque was showing his class , suffering mightily as he heaved himself upwards to the Ventoux summit .
With 3 kilometres to race , Virenque still had 2:00 on Botcharov , with Armstrong coming up fast .
The top three would remain in that order at the finish , with Armstrong extending his GC lead over second place Beloki and third place Rumsas .
Returning veterans
Twenty - seven members of the 2002 peloton will return to the 2009 Tour de France , most notably , of course , being Lance Armstrong .
Only three other 2009
Tour starters cracked the top 20 the last time the race climbed the Mont Ventoux .
Levi Leipheimer ( who unfortunately abandoned the Tour prior to Mont Ventoux ) finished 11th , 4:25 behind Virenque .
Stéphane Goubert , currently with AG2R La Mondiale , finished in 13th at 5:25 and Cofidis ' David Moncoutié finished right after in 14th at 5:46 .
Lance Armstrong is the only member of the 2009 Tour 's top 10 to compete in the 2002 Tour .
Carlos Sastre , who currently sits in 15th on GC , finished Mont Ventoux seven years ago in 29th place , 8:37 behind Virenque .
Sastre would ultimately arrive in Paris in 10th place that year , the only rider other than Armstrong in the 2009 Tour peloton to crack the top 10 in 2002 .
Just what will transpire on Saturday 's penultimate stage is still anyone 's guess , but perhaps one can gleam some sort of precedent from past visits to the Giant of Provence .
Will a Luxembourger with an impeccable climbing pedigree stamp his authority on the barren slopes ?
Can a Frenchman once again capture the attention of his home nation with a dramatic victory ?
Will the maillot jaune stamp out the hopes of all pretenders to the throne with one final , emphatic victory before his coronation on the Champs - Élysées ?
Are there any Italian climbers able to sprint to victory by the Ventoux Observatory ?
Will a certain Texan reclaim a gift given in error nine years ago ?
Or perhaps another American , Christian Vande Velde , can , as director Jonathan Vaughters puts it , " pull off the win of his life " ?
No matter what the outcome , it 's certainly to be a worthy addition to the history of Mont Ventoux .
In addition to Mont Ventoux being a summit finish on seven occasions , the Tour de France has passed over Mont Ventoux a further six times .
Three times prior to the first summit finish in 1958 , the Tour ventured over the Giant of Provence .
The first man to ever crest the summit of Mont Ventoux in the Tour was the Greek - born , naturalised Frenchman Lucien Lazarides during 1951 's stage 17 .
Lazarides would finish seventh on the stage , 56 seconds behind winner Louison Bobet , but would ultimately arrive in Paris on the podium in third place .
One year later in 1952 , Frenchman Jean Robic reached the Ventoux summit first in the 178 - kilometre stage 14 and would push on to win alone by 1:37 over an elite seven - man chase group led by Gino Bartali and containing the likes of Raphaël Géminiani , 1952 Tour runner - up Stan Ockers and 1952 Tour winner Fausto Coppi .
1955 Tour winner , Frenchman Louison Bobet , was the first over Mont Ventoux on the 198 - kilometre stage 11 , winning his second stage of the Tour .
Bobet would have to wait six more days before assuming the maillot jaune and ultimately claiming his third consecutive victory , the first time a rider claimed three straight Tours .
What was perhaps most memorable , and disturbing , about that hot Monday 's transverse of Mont Ventoux was the collapse of Jean Malléjac , who was sitting eighth overall at the day 's start , 10 kilometres from the Ventoux summit .
Malléjac lapsed into a state of semi- consciousness , his eyes rolled back into his head and the race doctor had to pry open his jaw to administer first aid .
Malléjac was forced to abandon , but fortunately recovered from the harrowing incident , denying that doping was the reason for his collapse .
The event foreshadowed the tragedy which fell upon the next passing of Mont Ventoux , on July 13 , 1967 , the day which Tom Simpson died on its slopes .
The tragedy which will forever be synonymous with the Giant of Provence .
Spaniard Julio Jimenez was the first to reach the summit of Mont Ventoux during the 211.5 - kilometre stage from Marseille to Carpentras won by the Dutchman Jan Janssen , but the day will be forever remembered as the day Simpson collapsed three kilometres from the Ventoux summit .
The race doctor tried for 40 minutes to revive Simpson on the roadside .
He was taken by helicopter to hospital in Avignon , but could not be revived .
A memorial to Simpson stands approximately two kilometres from the summit of Mont Ventoux .
In 1974 Eddy Merckx would win his fifth Tour de France , and during stage 12's 231 - kilometre journey from Savine - le - Lac to Orange the unheralded Spaniard Gonzalo Aja crested Mont Ventoux first while Belgian Jozef Spruyt , a teammate of Merckx , claimed stage honours .
Aja would finish fifth to Merckx that year , 11:24 behind the Belgian .
One of the most memorable ascents of Mont Ventoux in Tour de France history occurred in 1994 , the year Italian gentle giant Eros Poli broke away early in the 231 - kilometre fifteenth stage from Montpellier to Carpentras .
Poli arrived at the base of Mont Ventoux with nearly a 25 minute lead over a complacent peloton and needed virtually all of those minutes to drag his 6 ' 4 " frame up the 21.1 - kilomtre ascent in the race lead .
Poli , a gold medalist in the team time trial at the 1984 Olympics and a force in Mario Cipollini 's lead - out train , had a physique totally at odds with rapid climbing , and he managed to lose one minute per kilometre as he made his painful , weaving ascent to the Ventoux summit .
Poli prevailed , however , still maintaining a couple of minutes at the Ventoux summit , and put his physique to better use plummeting off Mont Ventoux to achieve a most epic solo victory in Carpentras , 3:39 ahead of the day 's second - place finisher .

By Rachel Maddow Show - October 5 , 2009
RACHEL MADDOW : Joining us now is the man who introduced that amendment , Sen. Bernie Sanders , Independent of Vermont , who is also only one of seven senators to vote against de-funding the community group ACORN .
Sen .
Sanders , thanks very much for joining us tonight .
SEN .
BERNIE SANDERS ( I - VT ) : Good to be with you , Rachel .
MADDOW : Your proposed amendment to the Defense Appropriations Bill focuses on defense contractors .
And I know that Project On Government Oversight has already done some investigating into fraud and other problems with defense contractors .
Who would be the worst hit here ?
SANDERS : Well , you 're looking at the big three defense contractors - that 's Lockheed Martin , Boeing , and Northrop Grumman .
And Rachel , since 1995 , these three companies have been cited 109 times - 109 times for misconduct .
They have been fined or reached settlements for $ 2.9 billion .
So here , you have major multinational corporations who on a systemic basis have been ripping off the American people .
And I think if we can go after ACORN , and I voted against that , that ACORN received $ 53 million over 15 years , you 're looking at companies that have received hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars and their punishment in 2007 was $ 77 billion in government contracts .
So there is a scandal here and we 've got to take a hard look at it .
MADDOW : The thing that is politically ambitious and impressive and makes a good story about this is the way that the attack on ACORN has been turned back by you in the Senate and by these liberal members of the House on the other side - in the other chamber , turned back on the people attacking ACORN to say , " You know what ?
Put your money where your mouth is .
If you 're really against contractors who have done anything wrong , let 's say it applies to everyone . "
What sort of arguments are you hearing against your amendment ?
What sorts of arguments are you hearing from people who are n't willing to go along with it ?
SANDERS : Well , you know what the most obvious argument is ?
That if you barred these corporations from receiving funds , the military would collapse , because these are the major contractors , the people who supply the weapons systems to our military .
So you have a situation where these major contractors , year after year after year , have been engaged in systemic fraud to the tune of billions and billions of dollars .
And yet , if you really went after them you would have them not supplying the weapons system that the military has asked for .
MADDOW : And that argument -
SANDERS : That 's the response .
MADDOW : And that argument in itself makes the case for why these companies have been able to get along - get away with it for so long .
If they 're seen as necessary , then nobody is going to crack down on them for anything , right ?
SANDERS : And Rachel , I think the point to add to that is that a lot of these investigations were done under the Bush administration which I think , as most people know , was not very hard in terms of investigating large companies .
So what we may be seeing in terms of 109 instances of misconduct is certainly - could be just the tip of the iceberg .
So my point is , the time is now .
Instead of going after little groups like ACORN , let 's take on the big guys who have been ripping off the American people to the tune of billions and billions of dollars , and by the way , in some instances , by producing defective equipment have put the lives of American servicemen at risk .
MADDOW : Sen .
Bernie Sanders , Independent of Vermont , thanks for your time tonight , sir .
I really appreciate it .
SANDERS : Thank you .
Philip
Roth 's late run of productivity has long been a source of wonder in the literary world , with his latest novel coming out this week less than a year after the last , and another already complete .
But the 76 - year - old 's own energy is not , according to him at any rate , any reflection of vibrant life in fiction itself .
Roth has long been pessimistic about the survival of the novel in a gaudy , short - attention - span culture , but his latest prophesy is one of his bleakest yet , predicting that the form will dwindle to a " cultic " minority enthusiasm within 25 years .
The author believes that the concentration and focus required to read a novel is becoming less and less prevalent , as potential readers turn instead to computers or to television .
" I was being optimistic about 25 years really .
I think it 's going to be cultic .
I think always people will be reading them but it will be a small group of people .
Maybe more people than now read Latin poetry , but somewhere in that range , " Roth told Tina Brown , editor - in - chief of The Daily Beast .
He said it was " the print that 's the problem , it 's the book , the object itself " .
" To read a novel requires a certain amount of concentration , focus , devotion to the reading .
If you read a novel in more than two weeks you do n't read the novel really .
So I think that kind of concentration and focus and attentiveness is hard to come by – it's hard to find huge numbers of people , large numbers of people , significant numbers of people , who have those qualities , " he said .
And the advent of e-readers such as the Kindle will make no difference .
" The book can't compete with the screen .
It could n't compete [ in the ] beginning with the movie screen .
It could n't compete with the television screen , and it can't compete with the computer screen , " Roth said .
" Now we have all those screens , so against all those screens a book could n't measure up . "
Roth 's new novel , The Humbling , is published later this week ( and has already received a scathing review from the Observer 's William Skidelsky , who called it " a piece of scandalous frippery " ) .
Roth told Brown that – like The Humbling 's hero Simon Axler , an ageing stage actor who has " lost his magic " – he worries about running out of ideas .
" Routinely when I finish a book , I think ' What will I do ?
Where will I get an idea ? '
And a kind of low - level panic sets in .
And then eventually something happens , " he said .
" I think I write and publish as often as I do because I can't bear being without a book to work on ...
I do n't feel I have this to say or that to say or this story to tell , but I know I want to be occupied with the writing process while I 'm living . "
Roth 's pessimism about the future of the novel is not a recent moodswing .
Talking to the Observer 's Robert McCrum in 2001 , he said that " I 'm not good at finding ' encouraging ' features in American culture .
I doubt that aesthetic literacy has much of a future here . "
NEW YORK -- Andre Agassi used crystal meth periodically for " a year or so , " the eight - time Grand Slam champion revealed in an interview with People magazine .
In his upcoming autobiography , Agassi admits he used crystal meth in 1997 and failed a drug test -- a result he says was thrown out after he lied by saying he " unwittingly " took the substance .
" If you 're going to tell your story , you owe it to yourself to tell it honestly , " Agassi told the magazine in its latest issue .
" Especially if you 're going to call it ' Open , "

Advertisement A warship built with steel salvaged from the World Trade Center has arrived in New York City .
The USS New York sailed up the Hudson River to near Ground Zero , where it fired a 21 - gun salute in tribute to those killed in the 2001 attacks .
It was watched by relatives of 9/11 victims , along with members of the emergency services and the public .
The US Navy is to hold an official commissioning ceremony for the new warship on Saturday .
The New York set off on its maiden voyage from Louisiana , where it was built , nearly three weeks ago .
The bow of the boat contains 7.5 tonnes of melted steel from the fallen buildings of the World Trade Center .
The ship 's crest includes images of the Twin Towers and features the colours of the city departments that first responded to the terrorist attacks in which nearly 3,000 people died .
' A transformation '
People gathered by the waterfront to watch the ship 's 21 - gun salute honouring those who died in the 11 September attacks .
The crew stood to attention along the deck as the guns were fired .
In pictures : USS New York Among those watching was JoAnn Atlas , who lost her firefighter husband in the attacks .
" We have to remember .
It 's a way to honour them , " she told the Associated Press news agency .
Rosaleen Tallon , whose firefighter brother was among those killed , said she was pleased that the steel from the towers had been reused in the ship .
" It 's a transformation of it from something really twisted and ugly , " she told AP .
" I 'm proud that our military is using that steel . "
About one in seven of the 361 sailors serving on the ship are from New York state , a higher percentage than would normally be the case , a Navy spokeswoman told AP .
She said there had been many requests from Navy personnel to serve on the ship .

Prologue : A troubled past
A bit less than three years ago , Windows Vista was officially launched after a long delay .
The operating system brought a raft of long - overdue new features to the Windows platform to make it truly fit for hardware of the 21st century .
In came a new graphics stack and sound stack , as well as significant security , networking , and storage changes .
The changes were all well and good — the graphics work in particular was essential to allow Windows to offer functionality equivalent to that found in Mac OS X for many years — but they came at a high cost .
To take advantage of all the new features required the use of all - new Windows Vista hardware drivers .
In the OS 's early days , these were often slow , unreliable , or simply non-existent .
In spite of the extended development process and lengthy open beta , many vendors were apparently caught off - guard by Windows Vista 's release and its preference for new drivers , so they chose to ignore the new OS for many months .
Software vendors did n't fare much better .
Vista 's new User Account Control ( UAC ) system meant that most of the time even administrators were stripped of their full privileges , forcing all software to run as a regular user account ; full access was only provided after a confirmation prompt .
Though software should long ago have stopped requiring admin rights —
Windows NT had this kind of security since its inception — the reality was that many applications lazily assumed that the person running them would have full administrator privileges all the time .
Take those privileges away , and the programs start breaking .
As for its impact on users , Vista also brought with it higher hardware demands that caused many to recoil in horror .
This was n't a new phenomenon , of course ; Windows XP and Windows 2000 before it both had the same effect .
So big , so bloated , so slow — these are traditional criticisms leveled at any new Windows release , and Vista was no exception .
In truth , Vista 's hardware requirements were not egregious ; the problem was that in comparison to XP 's ancient , five - year - old requirements , Vista 's requirements represented a big step up , especially in the area of video hardware .
So when Windows Vista became publicly available in early 2007 , the reception was rather lukewarm .
Third - party hardware and software support was spotty , backwards compatibility was reduced , and system demands were markedly higher .
This led to a computing public that clamored for the continued availability of Windows XP , and many businesses ( chipmaker Intel among them ) swore off the new version of Windows in favor of its ancient predecessor .
This was unfortunate .
Sure , the new operating system had teething trouble , but this was nothing new .
XP also got booed
Long - time Windows observers will remember that XP 's reception was immensely hostile , and for substantially the same reasons ; users migrating from Windows 98 found that the new Windows did n't work with their hardware , did n't work with their software , ran slower , and used more memory .
And who would want that ?
Business users similarly saw little compelling reason to migrate from Windows 2000 ( which was then less than two years old ) , as XP offered them relatively little .
The thing that XP had on its side was time .
XP should have been replaced by Windows Longhorn in 2004 or 2005 , but the cancellation of the Longhorn project and subsequent wait for Vista meant that everyone — users , software developers , hardware vendors — treated Windows XP as the main ( or even only ) version of Windows , with the result that everything worked with XP .
The early woes were forgotten , and XP , old and clunky as it was , became the version of Windows that everyone loved and adored ( or at least , tolerated ) .
Just as XP was fundamentally not as bad as its initial reception would lead one to believe , the same was true of Vista .
Stripped of the Vista name and placed in front of unsuspecting users , " Windows Mojave " was warmly received .
And even corporate customers have started to migrate to the OS .
Vista was progress , and it paved the way for Windows 7
Although Windows Vista may have caused vendors and users alike some amount of pain , it was all for a good reason .
To take advantage of modern video cards , Windows needed a new graphics stack ; to withstand the increasing malware onslaught , Windows needed to tighten security and make running as a regular user more comfortable .
These changes were not made lightly ; the break with the past was necessary to put the operating system on the same footing as its competition and to address long - standing , legitimate criticisms of the platform .
Microsoft was never going to revert to a more XP - like operating system , no matter how desperately some cling to the old OS .
Indeed , in this writer 's view , Vista was far and away the best version of Windows ever shipped ; the searchable Start menu alone ensured it received that accolade .
I have way too many icons in my Start menu and way too many documents on my PC for hunting through hierarchies to ever be an effective way of finding , well , anything .
Hitting the Windows key and then just typing what I 'm looking for beats browsing hierarchies hands - down .
And it 's like crack ; I was hooked from the first time I ever did it , and using Windows XP ( with its dumb old - fashioned Start menu ) feels like stepping back into the 1980s .
People put up with that ?
And for so long ?!
Unbelievable .
But I digress .
The Start menu was n't the only positive change in Vista .
The new video subsystem , for example , meant that I 'm no longer beholden to the likes of NVIDIA or ATI for my computer 's stability .
My video drivers still crash , but hey , it no longer bluescreens my machine .
Vista moved the bulk of video drivers into user mode , which means that they can crash and be restarted more or less seamlessly .
In a similar vein , upgrading video drivers without rebooting is now a reality .
Moving from video to sound , Vista 's new sound stack lets me set my audio volume on a per-application basis , which is another feature I can't believe I lived without .
In the end , Vista brought a lot of good stuff .
It was a major overhaul of the platform , and in retrospect , it 's not entirely surprising that the transition was somewhat imperfect .
Third parties could , and should , have done better , but they have at least caught up now .
Yes , I know what I ’ve been saying about baguettes , that they ’re the ultimate “ fast ” bread , that bakeries whip them out in as little as four hours .
The thing is , that ’s only true if you ’ve got your preferments on - hand and ready to go ( like full - time bakeries do ) .

Bei den derzeit noch inoffiziellen Verhandlungen zwischen Rat und Parlament der Europäischen Union über eine Regelung zur " abgestuften Erwiderung " auf Urheberrechtsverletzungen im Internet ist eine Einigung in weite Ferne gerückt .
Der Ausschuss der Ständigen Vertreter der Mitgliedstaaten ( COREPER ) will auch den Vorschlag für einen aufgeweichten Paragrafen zum Grundrechtsschutz im Kampf um ein " Three Strikes " - Verfahren bei der geplanten Novellierung des Telecom - Pakets nicht akzeptieren .
Eine Sitzung von Vertretern der verschiedenen Positionen endete so am Mittwochabend ohne Verständigung auf einen gemeinsamen Gesetzestext .
Nun müssen die Parteien in den eigenen Reihen noch einmal den Spielraum für Änderungen ausloten .
Andernfalls droht die Tagung des offiziellen Vermittlungsausschusses am 4 .
November zu platzen .
Damit wäre die gesamte angestrebte Neufassung der Regulierungsvorschriften für den Telekommunikationsmarkt wohl kaum noch zu retten .
Die Verhandlungsführerin des EU - Parlaments , die französische Sozialistin Catherine Trautmann , setzte sich zuletzt für eine Klausel ein , die betroffenen Internetnutzern ein " faires und unabhängiges Verfahren " unter Beachtung der Unschuldsvermutung und des Anhörungsrechts von Betroffenen zugestehen will .
Ein solches Zugeständnis sollte den umkämpften Änderungsantrag 138 des Parlaments ersetzen .
Mit diesem hatten sich die Abgeordneten in der 1 . und 2 .
Lesung des Telecom - Pakets klar dafür ausgesprochen , dass Eingriffe in die Grundrechte der Nutzer ­ wie etwa das Sperren von Internetzugängen ­ nur nach einer entsprechenden Gerichtsentscheidung verhängt werden dürften .
Trautmann betonte in der Schlussrunde der Hinterzimmergespräche , dass die von Bürgerrechtlern als nicht ausreichend kritisierte Kompromissformel der einzig gangbare Weg für die Abgeordneten sei .
Andernfalls würde die Parlamentsseite auf dem unveränderten Korrekturvorschlag 138 bestehen .
Die Auseinandersetzung um die Grundrechtsklausel entwickelt sich so zu einem Machtspiel zwischen Volks - und Regierungsvertretern vor dem geplanten Inkrafttreten des EU - Reformvertrags von Lissabon Anfang 2010 .
Die EU - Reform soll die Mitspracherechte des Parlaments stärken .
Beobachter gehen davon aus , dass damit auch die Bedenken des Juristischen Dienstes des Abgeordnetenhauses gegen den Änderungsantrag 138 in seiner ursprünglichen Form hinfällig werden .
Obwohl das Gesetzgebungsverfahren nach dem Widerstand im Rat gegen den von Trautmann aufgezeigten Kompromiss wieder offen ist , zeigte sich " La Quadrature du Net " enttäuscht über den Stand der Verhandlungen .
Die deutliche Ansage des Parlaments in den Lesungen des Novellierungsprojekts sei schon durch die Position der Verhandlungsführerin in " nutzloses " Fachgeschwätz und einen " sanften Konsens " aufgelöst worden , erklärte ein Sprecher der Bürgerrechtsorganisation .
Die Minister der EU - Mitgliedsstaaten hätten den Änderungsantrag 138 nicht rasch genug vom Tisch bekommen können , um das Internet " ohne Störung durch die Judikative regulieren " zu dürfen .
Der Fall drohe ein Paradebeispiel für die Machtlosigkeit der Abgeordneten zu werden .
" Wenn das Parlament den Diplomaten des Rates nicht Paroli bieten kann , steht es schlecht um die Demokratie in der EU " , kritisierte auch Benjamin Henrion , Präsident des Fördervereins für eine Freie Informationelle Infrastruktur ( FFII ) , den Lauf der Dinge gegenüber heise online .
Auch ansonsten wird der Druck von Bürgerrechtlern auf die Volksvertreter stärker , in der Grundrechtsfrage nicht nachzugeben .
So appelliert etwa die " European Digital Rights " - Initiative ( EDRi ) in einem offenen Brief an die Abgeordneten , die " Kernbedeutung " des Änderungsantrags beizubehalten .
Ansonsten drohe die Glaubwürdigkeit des Parlaments Schaden zu nehmen .
Auch der Dachverband der europäischen Verbraucherschutzverbände BEUC und die Providervereinigung EuroISPA haben die Abgeordneten in separaten Stellungnahmen ( PDF - Datei ) aufgefordert ( PDF - Datei ) , ihren demokratischen Auftrag wahrzunehmen und ihre in den bisherigen Abstimmungen gezeigte Haltung durchzusetzen .

I had to write some reports for some legacy software today and I was unpleasantly surprised with the results of my SQL queries .
I was selecting dollar values and summing them to for the monthly spending of certain individuals .
Easy enough right ?
I wrote a query something like this :
SELECT SUM ( t.money_spent ) as sum_of_spent , c.customer_name from transactions t join customers c on t.customer_id=c.customer_id group by customer_name order by c.customer_name asc
SELECT SUM( ROUND (t.money_spent ) ) as sum_of_money_spent , c.customer_name from transactions t join customers c on t.customer_id=c.customer_id group by customer_name order by c.customer_name asc
I ended up getting numerical values that were 10 decimal places long with seemingly random numbers .
After checking to make sure the database did n’t have any odd entries I stumbled on this bug report
The ‘ money_spent ’ column had a data type of float , which is a waste , but I still do n’t think that it should sum up incorrectly .
When I select individual values I get proper two decimal results .
Apparently floats and doubles use floating point math , which deals with approximate values for numbers and can thus result in confusion like this .
It seems that it is n’t really possible to store 0.1 in a column of type float .
You can only store 0.00999999977648258 .
This behavior is a little silly but easily fixed by using the ROUND ( ) function :

Disney is hoping to motivate 1 million people to volunteer , and hopefully some of these volunteers will find that giving back is fun and continue to volunteer in the future .
交通事故の被害に遭った場合には加害者に対して損害賠償を請求することができます。その手続きを進めたいときにはどこに相談したら良いのかと悩んでしまう人もいるでしょう。交通事故に関する悩みは損害賠償に限ったことではないかもしれません。
長崎で交通事故に遭ってしまったときに相談したいと思ったらどんな選択肢があるのでしょうか。
⇒福井県で交通事故に遭ったらどこに相談すべきか
交通事故の損害賠償請求なら弁護士へ
交通事故の被害に遭ってしまったときに損害賠償を請求するための相談をしたいと考えたら弁護士に依頼するのが最も良い方法です。法律のプロとして弁護士が正しい手続きで請求を進めてくれます。長崎には数多くの法律事務所や弁護士事務所があるので、その中から適切なところを探して相談を持ちかけましょう。
重要なのは専門の一つが交通事故に関わる損害賠償請求となっている事務所を選ぶことです。弁護士には専門分野が必ずあり、刑事事件に強い弁護士もいれば離婚相談を得意としている弁護士も相続対策に長けている弁護士もいます。
それ以外の分野になると知識も経験もなくて適切な対応ができない場合もあるので注意しなければなりません。交通事故の損害賠償請求に強いかどうかは事務所のホームページを見てみたり、事務所の広告などを確認してみたりするとわかります。
大きく業務内容として打ち出されているところなら信頼できる可能性が高いでしょう。実際に相談するときには電話で連絡してみるのも重要です。交通事故の損害賠償請求について相談したいという話をして、実績がどのくらいあるかも確認しておくと良いでしょう。
事務所によっては予約制になっているため、電話をして相談先として適切な様子であればその流れで予約を取りましょう。
弁護士に相談すると慰謝料が増えることが多い
弁護士に交通事故の損害賠償請求について相談するのには実は金額的なメリットがあります。通常、特に弁護士に相談しなかった場合には加害者が加入している自動車保険の保険会社の担当者との間で損害賠償についての協議が行われるのが普通です。
その場合、保険会社が金額を提示するのが一般的で、加害者が加入している保険の内容や保険会社が持っている基準によって決まります。しかし、弁護士に相談した場合には弁護士基準で損害賠償の金額を決めて弁護士から提示してもらうことが可能です。
実際に裁判などで請求された金額を参考にして決めるのが特徴で、通常は保険会社が提示するよりもかなり高い金額になります。特に金額が大きく変わるのが慰謝料です。場合によっては倍以上もの請求ができることもあるので弁護士に相談するメリットは大きいと言えるでしょう。
ただし、弁護士に依頼すると手付金や報酬金を支払わなければならないので、その兼ね合いも考えて決める必要があります。
交通事故相談所を活用しよう
長崎県では交通事故の被害に遭って悩んでいる人を助ける目的で、交通事故相談所を設けています。
交通事故に関して悩みがあったときには公的機関である交通事故相談所を活用してみるのも良い方法です。
交通事故相談所では多岐にわたる相談を受け付けています。
自賠責保険の請求の仕方や損害賠償額の計算方法、示談交渉の始め方や進め方などのように交通事故の被害に遭ってから悩みになりがちなことはなんでも相談することが可能です。
利用に費用がかからないのも特徴なので積極的に活用してみましょう。
⇒交通事故の示談交渉は弁護士に相談
交通事故相談所の使い方
長崎県の交通事故相談所では面談、電話、手紙の三種類の方法で相談することが可能です。最も単純でわかりやすいのは手紙による相談方法で、交通事故相談所の住所に相談内容について書いた手紙を送ると返事をしてもらえる仕組みになっています。
手紙が届くのにも返信するのにも時間がかかるので、早急ではない相談をするときに適している方法です。一方、電話による相談も交通事故相談所の電話番号にかけるだけで良いので簡便な方法でしょう。月曜日から金曜日の平日が受付日で、祝日と年末年始には対応していません。
朝 は9時から開始し、夕方は4時まで受け付けています。面談による相談の場合には事前予約が必要になります。巡回相談のシステムになっていて、地域によって相談日が異なるので注意しましょう。相談日の二日前までに電話で予約して相談に行くことになります。
離島地区を除くと午前10時から4時の対応で、離島では3時までになっています。佐世保市であれば毎月1回の機会がありますが、他の地域では少ないと年に1回しか機会がありません。速やかに相談に応じて欲しいときには他の方法を選んだ方が良い場合も多いということは念頭に置いておく必要があります。
弁護士の電話相談も活用しよう
長崎では電話相談を受け付けている弁護士もいるので活用を考えてみましょう。弁護士には損害賠償請求を依頼する以外にも色々なアドバイスを求めることができます。交通事故相談所と同じように交通事故全般についての悩みを相談しても問題はありません。
特に法律や賠償金がかかわる内容であれば弁護士が適切な回答をしてくれるでしょう。対面での相談では相談料がかなり高くなってしまうケースが多いですが、電話相談の場合には無料で受け付けていることがよくあります。
まずは電話で様子を確認して対面で相談するかどうかを決めるのは合理的な方法でしょう。電話でどのくらいまで対応してくれるかは弁護士によって異なります。交通事故でこのような怪我を負ってしまってこのくらいの期間入院していたのだけれど慰謝料はどのくらい請求できるのかと聞いてみると、具体的に数字を答えてくれる弁護士もいます。
一方、慰謝料がいくらになるかは大まかな数字しか言わず、詳しくは事務所に来て相談してくれたときに説明するという流れにする弁護士もいるでしょう。最終的には弁護士としては依頼を受けたいのでどこまで電話で聞けるかはケースバイケースですが、情報をある程度は提供してくれるので積極的に使ってみるのが大切です。

On September 30 , 2001 , I published a special issue of Crypto - Gram discussing the terrorist attacks .
I wrote about the novelty of the attacks , airplane security , diagnosing intelligence failures , the potential of regulating cryptography — because it could be used by the terrorists — and protecting privacy and liberty .
Much of what I wrote is still relevant today :
Appalled by the recent hijackings , many Americans have declared themselves willing to give up civil liberties in the name of security .
They ’ve declared it so loudly that this trade - off seems to be a fait accompli .
Article after article talks about the balance between privacy and security , discussing whether various increases of security are worth the privacy and civil - liberty losses .
Rarely do I see a discussion about whether this linkage is a valid one .
Security and privacy are not two sides of a teeter - totter .
This association is simplistic and largely fallacious .
It ’s easy and fast , but less effective , to increase security by taking away liberty .
However , the best ways to increase security are not at the expense of privacy and liberty .
It ’s easy to refute the notion that all security comes at the expense of liberty .
Arming pilots , reinforcing cockpit doors , and teaching flight attendants karate are all examples of security measures that have no effect on individual privacy or liberties .
So are better authentication of airport maintenance workers , or dead - man switches that force planes to automatically land at the closest airport , or armed air marshals traveling on flights .
Liberty - depriving security measures are most often found when system designers failed to take security into account from the beginning .
They ’re Band - aids , and evidence of bad security planning .
When security is designed into a system , it can work without forcing people to give up their freedoms .
[…]
There are copycat criminals and terrorists , who do what they ’ve seen done before .
To a large extent , this is what the hastily implemented security measures have tried to prevent .
And there are the clever attackers , who invent new ways to attack people .
This is what we saw on September 11 .
It ’s expensive , but we can build security to protect against yesterday ’s attacks .
But we ca n’t guarantee protection against tomorrow ’s attacks : the hacker attack that has n’t been invented , or the terrorist attack yet to be conceived .
Demands for even more surveillance miss the point .
The problem is not obtaining data , it ’s deciding which data is worth analyzing and then interpreting it .
Everyone already leaves a wide audit trail as we go through life , and law enforcement can already access those records with search warrants .
The FBI quickly pieced together the terrorists ’ identities and the last few months of their lives , once they knew where to look .
If they had thrown up their hands and said that they could n’t figure out who did it or how , they might have a case for needing more surveillance data .
But they did n’t , and they do n’t .
More data can even be counterproductive .
The NSA and the CIA have been criticized for relying too much on signals intelligence , and not enough on human intelligence .
The East German police collected data on four million East Germans , roughly a quarter of their population .
Yet they did not foresee the peaceful overthrow of the Communist government because they invested heavily in data collection instead of data interpretation .
We need more intelligence agents squatting on the ground in the Middle East arguing the Koran , not sitting in Washington arguing about wiretapping laws .
People are willing to give up liberties for vague promises of security because they think they have no choice .
What they ’re not being told is that they can have both .
It would require people to say no to the FBI ’s power grab .
It would require us to discard the easy answers in favor of thoughtful answers .
It would require structuring incentives to improve overall security rather than simply decreasing its costs .
Designing security into systems from the beginning , instead of tacking it on at the end , would give us the security we need , while preserving the civil liberties we hold dear .
Some broad surveillance , in limited circumstances , might be warranted as a temporary measure .
But we need to be careful that it remain temporary , and that we do not design surveillance into our electronic infrastructure .
Thomas Jefferson once said : “ Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty . ”
Historically , liberties have always been a casualty of war , but a temporary casualty .
This war — a war without a clear enemy or end condition — has the potential to turn into a permanent state of society .
We need to design our security accordingly .

That 's the warning a University of Alberta geophysics researcher has for hydrocarbon and water drillers after discovering uncharted land forms beneath the surface of the province .
Deep valleys , cut out by glaciers and then filled with loose aggregate rock , silt and sand , are hiding fresh water reservoirs and natural gas deposits .
Both the water and the gas could be considered treasures , says Doug Schmitt , Canada Research Chair in rock physics .
But , he says they can also be problematic .
" Energy exploration could unknowingly pollute the water , " and then there 's the potential for a gas explosion .
" Natural gas can collect in pockets in these porous rock formations , " said Schmitt .
" If drillers think they 're pushing through dense bedrock and suddenly they hit loose porous rock with gas in it , that can be a serious safety hazard .
Rigs have burned to the ground because of this . "
Schmitt 's group , in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Canada and the Alberta Geological Survey , combined a number of existing high resolution seismic and electrical underground mapping technologies used in the petroleum , mineral and environmental industries .
The researchers discovered the 300 metre - deep valley hidden beneath the surface of the ground near the community of Rainbow Lake in northwestern Alberta .
" Seismic crews searching for natural gas had been all over the area in the past , but their search focused more on deep gas deposits within the bedrock , " said Schmitt .
" We collected multiple types of geophysical data over one 10 kilometre - long profile to show that right under their feet there 's a valley , two to three kilometres wide . "
Schmitt says there are hidden valleys like this all over Alberta and , indeed , the entire glaciated northern hemisphere of the planet .
One of Schmitt 's concerns is for the fresh water aquifers that can lie in these underground structures .
If they go undetected and a tailings pond is put in the area and the liner fails , the effluent could spread via the aquifer far and wide , says Schmitt .
In countries like Germany , Denmark , Norway and the United Kingdom , geological surveys of hidden glacial valleys are an important issue .
Schmitt says these countries are much smaller than Canada with higher populations , and protecting ground water from pollution is a high priority .
Schmitt has co-authored a research paper on these findings that will be published this month by the Geological Society of America .
Schmitt is hoping the research will be seen in a positive light because it's a wake - up call .
" This is new information .
We can delineate the ground beneath us in more detail and avoid polluting our fresh water supplies as well as offering people involved in resource exploration an added margin of safety . "

Old Fort Niagara is located near Youngstown , New York on the banks of River Niagara at its mouth on Lake Ontario .
Niagara
Fort was originally set up as a fortification to serve the interests of New France in North America .
The first structure was built in 1678 and was called Fort Conti .
It was replaced by Fort Denonville in 1687 , named after the Governor of New France , the Marquis de Denonville .
However in 1688 the post was abandoned and the stockade pulled down .
In 1726 , a two storied structure called the Machicolated House was constructed here .
Its was called the ‘ House of Peace ’ or trading post to appease the Iroquois .
The fort was increased to the present size in 1755 .
In July 1759 after the ‘ Battle of Fort Niagara ’ the French surrendered to the British .
Fort Niagara became a Loyalist base in America during the American Revolutionary War .
The fort was ceded o the United States after the Treaty of Paris ended the American War of Independence in 1783 .
But essentially the region remained under the British for the next thirteen years .
The American Forces occupied it only in 1796 after signing the Jay Treaty .
In 1812 the British captured the fort but in 1813 they handed it over to the US under the Treaty of Ghent .
It has been under US ever since .
It was later used for various purposes in the Spanish - American War , World War I , WW II and the Korean War etc .
Today the renovated fort serves as Fort Niagara State Park and Museum .
There are exhibits relating to the American history .
The fort buildings are great to tour – they exude the intrigue of yester years .
Often there are reenactments of the 18th century battles and also period dances .
Most of the days there is demonstration of Musket loading and shooting by a person in old British uniform .
It is quite some distance from Niagara Falls .
So while visiting the Falls one would have to drive down to the fort or take a cab / taxi from Niagara Falls .
Sight seeing and activities at the Niagara Falls are covered under the Discovery Pass .
For those visiting Niagara , the closest airport would be at Buffalo and international ones would be the New York airports – JFK – Kennedy airport , La Guardia – LGA airport and Newark - EWR - Airport .

Wednesday 's announcement of Dollhouse 's cancellation came as no surprise to most , but that does n't mean that we 're not here to help those for whom the news means emotional turmoil .
Let us walk you to happiness , one step at a time .

Psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler - Ross , in her 1969 book On Death and Dying , introduced the concept of the Five Stages of Grief to help those dealing with personal tragedy get through it as easily as possible .
We 've discovered that those Five Stages are almost applicable to less serious emotional issues , such as the cancellation of a favorite television show .
As The Aristocats ' Thomas O'Malley once said , let me elucidate here :
1 : Denial
How many times did fans deny Dollhouse 's falling ratings , or tell themselves that miracles could happen despite a tiny audience and uneven quality - A self - delusion not helped by the series getting a second season in the first place , admittedly - and everything could turn out okay ( " Look what happens when you add in the time - shifted audience ! " ) ?
The writing may have been on the metaphorical cancellation wall for sometime , but that does n't mean that plenty of people were pretending that they could n't read when they saw it .

2 : Anger
As those who 've survived the loss of Firefly should remember , the cancellation of Dollhouse will have one clear effect on fans : Blaming Fox .
Never mind that they gave the show two seasons with a promise to show the complete second season despite reruns of House getting more viewers and making them more money in the same timeslot , Fox will very clearly be the bad guy in the fan version of this story ; as Preston Beckman , Fox 's VP of strategic programming told Broadcast & Cable , " I 'll still get hate mail and death threats . "
But why stop there ?
There 's lots of mad to go around :
Why not get mad at Joss for going back to Fox after the clusterfuck that was Firefly ( By which I mean , the way Fox treated it , not the show itself .
I 'm not pissing off those River Tam fans ) ?
Or at the rest of America who , quite clearly , did n't see the entertainment value in a morally - ambiguous show about brainwashed slaves even with the amount of gratuitous T'n 'A thrown in ?
Or Smallville for somehow managing to build on its ratings on a Friday night even in its ninth season ?
Or Ghost Whisperer just for existing in the first place ?
There 's a lot of mad in there .
Just let it out .
You 'll fell better afterwards .
3 : Bargaining
We 'll throw this one over to Syfy 's senior VP of digital Craig Engler 's Twitter stream from Thursday November 12th to illustrate this point for us :
Whenever some other network cancels a sci- fi show , I 've noticed a distinct trends in the type of tweets I receive about it : 80 % Polite : Could you please pick up X show ?
I think it'd be a great fit with your network !
8 % Analytic : X shows has more viewers than your show Y so why would n't you pick it up !
5 % Bribe : I 'll star watching / will watch more of your network if you pick up X show !
4 % Less Polite :
Why do n't you pick up X show ?
It 's better than any of the crap you air !
3 % Blame :
You suck for canceling X show and / or not picking it up from another network !
( OFTEN SENT IN ALL CAPS !!!!!)
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
I think you get where we 're coming from here .
( And in case you were wondering , Craig directly addressed Dollhouse later that day :
Leaving aside viewership , the biggest issues are , we simply can't afford network budgets and no one has even offered it to us AFAIK .
Then you have to consider , it had much more exposure on Fox than it would ever get on Syfy , but the audience never quite materialized .
We 'd of course LOVE to do a project with Joss Whedon for Syfy that was affordable .
Overall we 're big fans of his work ...
If we could hold [ the audience size from the Fox airings ] ( doubtful ) , it * could * be a good number if the budget were remotely in our ballpark .

What 's the point in watching any new shows ?
Wo n't they all run into network interference issues ( V ) or get canceled early ( Eastwick , but , really , does anyone care that much about Eastwick ? ) , like Dollhouse ?
Is n't Fringe also supposed to be having cancellation woes - and it's on Fox !
If Joss Whedon can't make television work , what chance does anyone else have ?
We understand that it can be hard to believe in the healing power of television at a time like this , but think of it like this : Sometimes early cancellation can be a good thing .
Imagine a world without Angel Starbuck or Deanna Troi being turned into a cake in Data 's dream , and suddenly your silver lining has been found .

5 : Acceptance
Yeah , okay , this is the one that - for some fans - may never happen .
Fandom in all its forms knows how to hold grudges , and if Firefly has taught us anything , it 's that fandom never forgets .
Now that Fox has killed two Joss Whedon shows ( and Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , for that matter ) , there 's going to be an element of fandom that will never be able to trust the network again , never believing that Fox had good reasons to keep us from the full run-up to " Epitaph One . "
Of course , identifying all the stages does n't mean that you should rush through them , especially when there are nine episodes still to air , and an ARG still to decipher .
We 're not saying that you should hold onto your sadness until mid-January , of course ... but if you want to , we 're going to be here for you no matter what .
And possibly going through exactly the same thing .
The DOL reports weekly unemployment insurance claims decreased to 545,000 :
In the week ending Sept. 12 , the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 545,000 , a decrease of 12,000 from the previous week 's revised figure of 557,000 .
The 4 - week moving average was 563,000 , a decrease of 8,750 from the previous week 's revised average of 571,750 .
...
The advance number for seasonally adjusted insured unemployment during the week ending Sept. 5 was 6,230,000 , an increase of 129,000 from the preceding week 's revised level of 6,101,000 .

This graph shows the 4 - week moving average of weekly claims since 1971 .
The four - week average of weekly unemployment claims decreased this week by 8,750 to 563,000 , and is now 95,750 below the peak in April .
It appears that initial weekly claims have peaked for this cycle .
However it seems that weekly claims are stuck at a very high level ; weekly claims have been in the high 500 thousands for almost 3 months .
This indicates continuing weakness in the job market .
The four - week average of initial weekly claims will probably have to fall below 400,000 before the total employment stops falling .
On the day Gordon Brown made his " major policy speech " on Afghanistan , repeating his surreal claim that if the British army did not fight Pashtun tribesmen over there , they would be over here , the stench of burnt flesh hung over the banks of the Kunduz River .
Nato fighter planes had blown the poorest of the poor to bits .
They were Afghan villagers who had rushed to siphon off fuel from two stalled tankers .
Many were children with water buckets and cooking pots .
" At least " 90 were killed , although Nato prefers not to count its civilian enemy .
" It was a scene from hell , " said Mohammed Daud , a witness .
" Hands , legs and body parts were scattered everywhere . "
No parade for them along a Wiltshire high street .
I saw something similar in south - east Asia .
An incendiary bomb had razed most of a thatched village , and bits of charred people were hanging on upended fishing nets .
Those intact lay splayed and black , like large spiders .
I have never believed you need witness such a hell to comprehend the crime .
A standard - issue conscience is enough for all but the morally corrupt and powerful .
Fresh from another dysfunctional photo opportunity with troops in Afghanistan - a contrivance far from the impoverished suffering of that country - Brown " authorised " the Rambo - style rescue of Stephen Farrell , a journalist of British and Irish nationality , at the site of the Nato attack .
It was a stunt that went wrong .
A British soldier was killed and Farrell 's guide , Sultan Munadi , an Afghan journalist , was abandoned and killed .
Munadi's family now fully appreciates the different worth of British and Afghan lives .
During the 1914 - 18 slaughter , Prime Minister Lloyd George confided : " If people really knew [ the truth ] , the war would be stopped tomorrow .
But of course they do n't know and can't know . "
Have we not yet advanced over a century 's corpses to a point where the likes of Brown are denied their mendacious subterfuge ?
The Afghan war is a fraud .
It began as an American vendetta for domestic consumption in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks , in which not a single Afghan was involved .
The Taliban , who are Afghans , had no quarrel with the United States and were dealing secretly with the Clinton administration over a strategic pipeline .
They offered to apprehend Osama Bin Laden and hand him over to a clerical court , but this was rejected .
The establishment of a permanent US / Nato presence in a resource - rich , strategic region is the principal reason for the war .
The British are there because that is what Washington wants .
Preventing the Taliban from storming our streets is reminiscent of President Lyndon B Johnson 's plaint : " We have to stop the communists over there [ Vietnam ] or we 'll soon be fighting them in California . "
There is one difference .
By refusing to bring the troops home , Brown is likely to provoke an atrocity by young British Muslims who view the war as a western crusade ; the recent Old Bailey trail made that clear .
He has been told as much by British intelligence and security services .
Brown's own security adviser has said as much publicly .
As with Tony Blair and the bombs of 7 July 2005 , he will bear ultimate responsibility for bringing violence and grief to his own people .
More than MPs ' fake expenses , it is this corrupting and trivialising of life and death that mark a fitting end to the " modernised " Labour Party , the party of criminal war .
Do the delegates preparing for the party 's annual rituals in Brighton comprehend this ?
It says enough that most Labour MPs never demanded a vote on Blair 's bloodshed in Iraq and gave him a standing ovation when he departed .
One timid motion proposed by the " grass roots " at Brighton might be allowed .
This concludes that " a majority of the public believe that the war [ in Afghanistan ] is unwinnable " .
There is no suggestion that it is wrong , immoral and based on lies similar to those that led to the extinction of a million Iraqis , " an episode more deadly than the Rwandan genocide " , according to one scholarly estimate .
This is largely why the game of parliamentary politics is over for so many Britons , especially the young .
In 2005 , a bent system allowed Blair to win with fewer popular votes than the Tories in their catastrophe of 1997 .
New Labour 's greatest achievement is the lowest turnouts since universal voting began .
Today , voters watch Brown give billions of public money to casino banks while demanding nothing in return , having once hailed their practices as an inspiration " for the whole economy " .
At the recent meeting of G20 leaders in London , Brown distinguished himself by opposing , and killing , a modest Franco - German proposal for a limit on bonuses and penalties for companies that broke it .
The gap between rich and poor in Britain is now the widest since 1968 .
New Labour 's causes and effect extend from the one in five young people denied employment , education and hope to the £ 12 m that Blair coins in a year , " advising " the rich and lecturing to them at £ 157,000 a time .
For Blair 's and Brown 's more extreme mentors and courtiers , such as the twice - disgraced Peter Mandelson , this represents the most sought - after achievement of all : the positioning of Labour to the right of the Tories , though it is probably correct to say the two main parties have converged , competing feverishly with each other to threaten cuts in public services in order to pay for the bailing out of the banks and for the drug lords of Kabul .
There is no mention of cutting the billions to be spent on replacing Trident nuclear submarines designed for the defunct cold war .
The game is over .
Corporatism and a reinvigorated militarism have finally appropriated parliamentary democracy , a historic shift .
For those Afghan villagers blown to pieces in our name , one craven motion at Labour 's conference is too late .
At the very least , the party 's " grass roots " might ask themselves why .
Google has forged a deal to distribute Chrome in Sony PCs sold in North America , the company 's first such deal with a PC vendor and one of a number of efforts to popularize the Internet browser .
Sony started installing Chrome in PCs bound for North America in May , a Sony representative said .
The deal was initially a test run for the two companies , but the test phase is nearly over .
The Sony deal marks an important step for Chrome into PCs .
Launched almost exactly a year ago , the browser has had a rough time against rivals such as Microsoft 's Internet Explorer and Mozilla 's Firefox .
Internet Explorer continued to reign as market leader in July with a 67.7 percent share of the browser market , compared to 22.5 percent for Firefox , 4.1 percent for Apple 's Safari and 2.59 percent for Chrome , according to Net Applications .
Google is talking with other PC vendors as well , and is seeking other ways to increase Chrome 's market share .
" Users ' response to Google Chrome has been outstanding , and we 're continuing to explore ways to make Chrome accessible to even more people , " Google said in a statement .
More than ever in this time of economic troubles and societal change , entering upon an undergraduate education should be a voyage away from visual overstimulation into deep , sustained reading of what is most worth absorbing and understanding : the books that survive all ideological fashions .
There is general agreement on the indispensable canon : Homer , Plato , the Bible , Virgil , Dante , Chaucer , Cervantes , Shakespeare , Montaigne , Milton .
From the 19th century until now , keeping only to English and American authors , a slightly more arbitrary selection might include Blake , Wordsworth , Austen , Dickens , George Eliot , Hardy , Yeats and Joyce in England and Ireland .
Among the Americans would certainly be Emerson , Thoreau , Melville , Walt Whitman , Emily Dickinson , Hawthorne ; and in the 20th century , Faulkner and the major poets : Robert Frost , Wallace Stevens , T. S. Eliot , Hart Crane .

Many of these authors are difficult and demand rereading , but that doubles their value .
A freshman may have read Shakespeare before , but the richest and most available of all writers is also the most profound and elliptical .
Rereading “ Hamlet ” and “ King Lear ” should teach a student Shakespeare ’s mastery of the art of leaving things out .

GUNMEN shot dead a former KGB spy turned basketball tycoon in his car yesterday a few hundred metres from the Moscow office of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , officials said .
Shabtai von Kalmanovic , who went on to organise a Michael Jackson concert in Moscow and help two clubs win Europe 's top basketball title , died at the scene , the state prosecutor 's office said .
More than 20 shots were fired at Kalmanovic 's Mercedes from a silver Lada a few hundred metres from the White House , the seat of Russia 's Government headquarters , state Russian television channel Vesti reported .
Kalmanovic 's driver , who was wounded , gave chase to the attackers but had to abandon it because of his wounds , investigators said .
Kalmanovic spent five years in an Israeli prison for passing secret military technology to the KGB before being released in 1993 , state media reported .
Returning to Russia , Kalmanovic set up a market in the centre of Moscow and helped organise concerts by Tom Jones , Liza Minnelli and Michael Jackson in Russia , the reports said .
The attack was likely a contract killing , senior investigator Anatoly Bagmet said .
A citizen of Israel , Russia and Lithuania , Kalmanovic 's financial support helped Lithuanian basketball club Zalgiris Kaunas win the Euroleague , the continent 's top basketball competition , in 1999 .
He helped Spartak Moscow win the women 's Euroleague in each of the past three years .

It ’s part of the American Dream .
Everyone would love to win the lottery and spend the rest of their lives with no financial worry .
Hey , even a $ 5 scratch - off ticket gives the purchaser the feeling of victory and satisfaction .
One of the most popular fantasies American ’s have had over the years is to look out your window and see a mini-van , a pretty woman holding flowers and a man in a suit carrying a large check and balloons .
You guessed it …the Prize Patrol has arrived and you are the winner !
For years American ’s have been purchasing magazine subscriptions and sending in the return envelopes with their application for winning the Publisher ’s Clearing House Grand Prize !
We ’ve all been “ Guaranteed to be the $ 5 Million Dollar Winner ” as shown through the front of the PCH envelope and the thought of the victory keeps millions of people coming back to try again and again .
So would n’t you be ecstatic if one Sunday morning you peaked out of your front window to see the Prize Patrol walking up your front steps !
Recently for many , this event has come as a major disappointment and in one instance sent a man to the hospital .
So how can this be ?
What is causing dozens of complaints across central Utah in the past few weeks regarding the Prize Patrol arriving at their homes ?
As it turns out these people are not the Prize Patrol at all .
It is a new ploy being experimented with by one chapter of the Jehovah ’s Witnesses !
Over the years the number of individuals who actually open the doors when a Jehovah ’s Witness arrives is few and far between .
You see them coming and just do n’t answer the door .
They have changed their attire , used attractive members and many other ploys to get your front door open .
This new method gets your door open but with a serious downside .
Instead of hearing the good news , like “ Are you Mr. Johnson ?
Well you are the winner of our $ 5 Million Dollar Grand Prize ! Congratulations ! ” Un-expecting American ’s hear “ Mr. Johnson ?
Are you familiar with the Watchtower Literature ? ” .
Once you land back down on Earth and realize what has just happened a major disappointment sinks in .
You then look at the large check being dangled in front of your face to see the name on the check is not yours and on the amount line is written “ 5 Million ” then in smaller lettering “ reasons to love Jesus ” .
The number of complaints has been overloading the Sheriff ’s Office in the small town of Green Fountain , Utah .
“ Seventeen calls just this morning ” said Deputy Roscoe Train .
“ Must be a bunch of ‘em out there today .
But they disappear just as quick as the complaints come in so we ca n’t catch ‘ em .
The only one we got so far is still in intensive care with his jaw wired shut ….he aint talkin’ .
Boy , Jimbo Jones sure hit that man hard . ”
So far there have not been any other reports outside of Green Fountain , but the warning is out !
If the Prize Patrol arrives at your door step do n’t get too excited .
But make sure it ’s really not them before you decide not to answer the door .

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- European banks could have as much as $ 40 billion of exposure to Dubai after helping to arrange a string of bonds and loans linked to the Middle East city - state , according to analysts at Credit Suisse .
The broker said it 's identified $ 10 billion of bonds issued by the government 's Dubai World investment vehicle just since 2005 , along with a further $ 26 billion of syndicated loans .
Fears of a potential sovereign default by Dubai roiled financial markets Thursday , sinking stocks across Asia and Europe and pushing up government bond prices , after Dubai said late Wednesday it would restructure Dubai World and announced a six - month standstill on repayments of the conglomerate 's debt .
See full story on the impact on financial markets .
In a note to clients , Credit Suisse said the middle - East region is unlikely to be more than 1 % to 2 % of banks ' total exposure and Dubai itself would just be a small part of that .
Still , it estimated that a 50 % loss on the exposure that bank 's may hold would be the equivalent of a 5 % increase in provisions in 2010 .
For the banks that Credit Suisse analysts cover , which could have an exposure of around 13 billion euros ( $ 19.6 billion ) , that would equate to a combined hit of around 5 billion euros , it added .
Bookrunners on bond and loan deals typically retain around 10 % to 15 % of the issue on their own balance sheet , the broker said .
Among the European banks that frequently acted as bookrunners or participants in bond and loan deals were Barclays ( BARC ) BCS , +1.00 % , Deutsche Bank ( DBK ) DB , +1.57 % , Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) RBS , - 2.42 % , BNP Paribas ( BNP ) , ING Group ( INGA ) and Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY ) LYG , +0.77 % .
Standard Chartered ( STAN ) and HSBC ( HSBA ) HBC , +6.76 % also have significant loan books in the Middle East .
U.S. banks that have been involved in bond or loan deals in Dubai include Bank of America BAC , +1.34 % , Citigroup C , +1.62 % and J.P. Morgan Chase JPM , +0.96 % .
Shares in the European banking sector were down across the board , with ING -- down 7.1 % -- and RBS -- down 8.6 % -- among the biggest fallers .
A spokeswoman for Barclays said the bank 's exposure is " not significant " and that it is closely monitoring the impact on broader markets .
A spokesman for ING said the group has negligible exposure to Dubai World bonds .
He added ING participated in some loan deals , but that the group does n't see any reason to change its forecasts for loan losses .
Standard Chartered said in a statement that it would n't comment on specific clients , adding " we are fully aware of our disclosure obligations , and would make a statement in the event that we had anything material to disclose . "
Other banks either declined to comment or did not respond to emails and phone calls .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper speaks with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet at the APEC summit on Saturday .
( ( Adrian Wyld / Canadian Press ) )
U.S. President Barack Obama and nearly two dozen fellow leaders from Canada , Asia and Europe at an APEC summit in Singapore agreed Sunday that next month 's international climate change meetings will be a way station — not the end point — in the so - far elusive search for a new worldwide treaty to tackle global warming .
The 192 - nation climate conference beginning in three weeks in Copenhagen had originally been intended to produce a new global climate change treaty .
More recently , it has become increasingly clear that would n't be the case .
On Saturday , Prime Minister Stephen Harper who is attending the APEC summit , said that full global participation in cutting greenhouse gases is necessary to tackle global warming .
Emerging economies already contribute close to half of all global emissions , and that proportion will rise to two - thirds in the future , he told reporters .
" If we do n't control those , whatever we do in the developed world will have no impact on climate change , " Harper said .
Prof . Tim Flannery of the Copenhagen Climate Council , also in Singapore for the summit of the Asia - Pacific Economic Co-operation countries , delivered a harsh assessment of Canada 's record on reducing emissions .
Flannery told The Canadian Press that Canada faces an international credibility crisis because it is " by far the biggest defaulter " on previous Kyoto Protocol obligations .
He said even though Canada signed on 11 years ago , it has failed to meet its obligations .
" The people of Canada , through their government , made the commitment , and it needs to be honoured somehow or other , or it needs to be dealt with , " the Australian climate - change expert said .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen chat with U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday .
( ( PMO / Jason Ransom ) )
" Canada is by far the biggest defaulter on its Kyoto obligations on a tonnage basis .
And as a result of that there is a lack of trust , " he said .
The APEC summit comes less than a month before a United Nations climate change conference opens in Copenhagen , where leaders of almost 200 countries will gather to hash out a successor to the Kyoto Protocol .
Harper acknowledged there are " significant differences " over how to tackle climate change , but he said every leader he 's spoken to at the summit agrees on the need for a long - term plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
When it comes to the economy , the prime minister is pushing for a reduction of trade barriers , in light of the global recession .
David Emerson , Canada 's former minister for international trade , told CBC News that in the 21st century , environmental issues cannot be separated from economic and trade issues " because they 're becoming increasingly intertwined . "
Canada needs to get more pro-active on boosting trade with emerging economies , including having a physical presence in those countries , which means direct investment , Emerson said .
" It means moving people into those markets … it means cultural knowledge and adaptation and fluency with language , " he said in an interview on CBC's The National on Saturday .
" It 's a much different game today and it 's going to take a much broader , deeper , more comprehensive effort for Canada to get back in the game in the way we should be . "
nations need not fear the success of another , " Obama said .
" Cultivating spheres of co-operation — not competing spheres of influence — will lead to progress in the Asia Pacific . "

An NBC News / poll yesterday showed continued growth in support for a public option .
Voters want meaningful health care reform with choices for consumers that do n't leave them to the mercies of avaricious insurance companies .
And as support for the public option grows , approval of GOP obstructionism on health care remains steady at just over 20 % , while around 65 % of Americans disapprove of the way the Republican congressional caucus is handling the health care debate .
It 's counterintuitive than dozens of weak , frightened Democrats are joining the Republicans in their opposition .
Let 's leave Lieberman 's possibly toothless attention - grabbing threat to join the filibuster of health care reform alone for a moment and assume Harry Reid can work that out with him .
And let 's close our eyes and imagine that Reid already told Blanche Lincoln that if she makes one more peep about filibustering she 's out of her Ag Committee chairmanship .
And let 's even leave Ben Nelson 's demand that the " opt out " ( which is bad enough ) be changed to an " out in " ( which is intolerable ) .
Why ?
Because we have to deal with the House first and we 're not 100 % there yet -- not for the public option with a reimbursement rate of Medicare + 5 % , the most ideal position left on the table .
Democratic Whip Jim Clyburn says there are 47 hard no votes among conservative Democrats as well as 8 more leaning in that direction ( 55 in all ) .
There are 256 Democrats -- so 201 after the 55 who have announced they will be crossing the aisle to vote with the Republicans against meaningful health care reform .
Far be from me to second - guess Clyburn 's numbersanother good source has given me a list of the hard no votes and the undecided votes .
First the 43 for sure no votes : John Barrow ( Blue Dog - GA - 12 ) Brian Baird ( D - WA - 3 ) Melissa Bean ( D - IL - 8 ) Marion Berry ( Blue Dog -AR - 1 ) John Adler ( D - NJ - 3 ) Dan Boren ( Blue Dog -OK - 02 ) Jason Altmire ( Blue Dog - PA - 4 ) Rick Boucher ( D - VA - 9 ) Allen Boyd ( Blue Dog -FL - 02 ) Bobby Bright ( Blue Dog - AL - 02 ) Ben Chandler ( Blue Dog -KY - 06 ) Travis Childers ( Blue Dog -MS - 01 ) Jim Cooper ( Blue Dog - TN - 05 ) Kathy Dahlkemper ( Blue Dog - PA - 03 ) Lincoln Davis ( Blue Dog - TN - 04 ) Joe Donnelly ( Blue Dog - IN - 2 ) Bart Gordon ( Blue Dog - TN - 06 ) Parker Griffith ( Blue Dog - AL - 05 ) Debbie Halvorson ( D - IL - 11 ) Stephanie Herseth Sandlin ( Blue Dog - TX - 01 ) Baron Hill ( Blue Dog - IN - 09 ) Tim Holden ( Blue Dog - PA - 17 ) Steve Kagen ( D - WI - 08 ) Frank Kratovil ( Blue Dog -MD - 1 ) Betsy Markey ( D - CO - 04 ) Jim Marshall ( Blue Dog - GA - 08 ) Jim Matheson ( Blue Dog - UT - 02 ) Mike McIntyre ( Blue Dog-NC - 7 ) Michael McMahon ( D - NY - 13 ) Charlie Melancon ( Blue Dog - LA - 03 ) Mike Michaud ( Blue Dog -ME - 02 ) Walt Minnick ( Blue Dog - ID - 01 ) Harry Mitchell ( Blue Dog - AZ - 05 ) Collin Peterson ( Blue Dog -MN - 07 ) Earl Pomeroy ( Blue Dog -SD - 01 ) Mike Ross ( Blue Dog -AR - 04 ) Heath Shuler ( Blue Dog -NC - 11 ) Ike Skelton ( D - MO - 04 ) Zack Space ( Blue Dog -OH - 18 ) Bart Stupak ( D - MI - 01 ) John Tanner ( Blue Dog - TN - 08 ) Gene Taylor ( Blue Dog -MS - 04 ) Harry Teague ( D - NM - 02 ) On top of that Ann Kirkpatrick ( AZ - 01 ) is leaning no .
But there are another 10 Democrats , most of whom are Blue Dogs , leaning yes as of last night : Dennis Cardoza ( Blue Dog - CA - 18 ) Jim Costa ( Blue Dog - CA - 20 ) Gabby Giffords ( Blue Dog - AZ - 08 ) Ron Klein ( D - FL - 22 ) Daniel Lipinski ( D - IL - 03 ) Dan Maffei ( D - NY - 25 ) Scott Murphy ( D - NY - 20 ) Glenn Nye ( Blue Dog - VA - 02 ) Loretta Sanchez ( Blue Dog - CA - 47 ) David Scott ( Blue Dog - VA - 03 ) If any of these are your congressmembers , it 's worth calling their offices and telling them how important this vote is to you and your family .
Keep in mind that this has been the Republican message and the Insurance Industry message ( as well as their paid whores for months ) :

Some type of logger or sniffer exists for almost every form of electronic communication .
Your keystrokes , phone conversations , and wireless networks could all be monitored .
In this awesome proof - of - concept project , [ James ] expanded that array to include garage door openers .
After receiving a piece of chain mail which stated that criminals have the technology to record any remote code and play it back , [ James ] wondered if he could build such a device that would work on at least his opener model .
[ James ] started off with a trip to the hardware store .
He was unable to find both a transceiver that worked on the frequency of his remote control ( 308MHz clocked MAX7042 chip ) , so at least for this incarnation ( he plans to build another one that is capable of replaying a captured signal ) , only a receiver was implemented .
The receiver was connected to a logic analyzer in order to determine its protocol .
Since the signal coming from the receiver was very low , [ James ] had to amplify it through a buffer before it could be detected .
An ATtiny26 and a 4 line x 20 character backlit LCD were used to interpret and display info from the receiver .
[ James ] built the sniffer around a custom PCB ( though he ran into a few layout errors that he had to fix post- production ) .
All of the firmware was written in C .
It is fairly straightforward , but takes up 98 % of the microcontroller ’s memory .
The program is designed to monitor pin change interrupts and timers to filter out invalid codes as well as noise .
Any info ( the door codes that have been sniffed ) is displayed through a 4 - bit interface on the LCD , for easy recording .
With the codes , one can configure another garage remote to open the door .
If you have any suggestions for V2 , We ’re sure [ James ] will be reading the comments .
Update :
The code and PCB files ( with the error ) are available through one of the following mirrors :

Where do you leave your bike overnight ?
I 'm lucky enough these days to live somewhere with an adjoining lock - up garage , where my cycles spend their off - duty time , attached securely to a ground anchor set in the concrete floor .
But at earlier addresses the only bike storage has generally been corridors and stairways , whether my own or shared .
In one flat I even stored two bikes in the kitchen , though to be fair it was an unusually spacious kitchen .
I got thinking on this after receiving a press release from a chain of estate agents which , unusually for such a document , contained a certain amount of common sense .
While car parking has long been a factor considered by potential landlords , Ludlow Thompson argue , it 's important now that they also think about where would - be tenants can keep their bikes .
Decent bike provision could even increase the property 's price or rental value , it effectively says .
The chain operates only in London , but the advice of the eponymous Stephen Ludlow would seem relevant to anyone thinking of letting a property in an urban area :
Cyclists are increasingly important if you intend to let or sell to the 20 - 35 year old post - university market .
Cyclists prefer not to leave their bike chained up on the street .
When renting a flat in converted houses , cyclists often ask if they can leave their bicycle in the shared hallway .
Most contracts explicitly prevent this because if often leads to damage and can upset the other tenants .
By agreeing , a landlord might have the edge if a tenant is weighing up two options .
Landlords of ex-local authority and new build housing can often offer the best solution , as those properties frequently provide storage sheds which are perfect for bicycles .
But landlords in other housing types can make their properties more attractive to cyclists by installing safe storage , such as a secure shed unit which will fit in even a small front garden .
Landlords that are leaseholders – either in a converted house or in a more modern block – can be proactive and negotiate with other leaseholders and the freeholder to provide shared storage .
There will often be a net benefit as the desirability of the property is improved .
That all seems obvious to me .
But it 's astonishing how few properties , whether for rent or sale , have even the most basic secure cycle parking .
The most common option is simply to carry your greasy , sometimes grubby machine into a hallway and repaint the scuff marks on the wall once in a while .
Central government guidance , even for new blocks , is pretty vague .
A Department for Communities and Local Government transport planning policy document ( pdf ) advises that " the amount of good quality cycle parking in developments should be increased to promote more cycle use , " but ultimately the details are up to local authorities .
Provision certainly seems patchy .
My ride home takes me past a brand - new apartment block where you get a glimpse into a grubby store room where half a dozen hooks have been loosely screwed into a wall .
I 'm guessing this is the designated bike storage – unsuprisingly it 's empty while the balconies are littered with bikes .
Is it wishful thinking that cyclists ' pressure can change this ?
Would bike storage affect your property rental – or even purchasing – decisions ?
Sept. 14 , 2009  --
A defrocked priest who has appealed his rape conviction in Boston is now stirring controversy in the psychiatric community by challenging the notion of repressed - recovered memories , or dissociative amnesia .
Paul Shanley , 78 , was sentenced in 2005 to 12 to 15 years for raping a 6 - year - old boy in a Boston suburb parish in the 1980s .
During Shanley 's trial , the then 27 - year - old victim testified that he never remembered the abuse until 2002 when news reports of other men accusing Shanley of sexual assault triggered his own memories -- disturbing scenes of Shanley pulling him out of Sunday school over a six - year period to rape and grope him in the bathroom , the confessional and the pews .
Shanley had pleaded not guilty .
Internal church records within the Boston Archdiocese showed that church officials were aware of sexual abuse complaints against Shanley as early as 1967 , according to the Associated Press .
Now , Shanley 's lawyers assert that jurors never should have heard the victim 's tearful account because the psychiatric community cannot agree on whether repressed memories truly exist .
" It 's a very difficult issue for people to understand because you have a group of people who say this exists , you also have a large group of people to say that it has not been established , " said Robert F Shaw Jr. , Shanley 's attorney .
The Meaning of a Memory
The judge in Shanley 's trial accepted the theory of repressed - recovered memories , as did a superior court that heard his first appeal in November .
But in an appeal to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Thursday , Shaw submitted a " friend of the court " brief backed by about 100 prominent experts in psychiatry , neuroscience , cognitive science and psychology that dismissed the validity of repressed memories .
The brief argued that " ' repressed - recovered memories , ' ' dissociative amnesia ' and related concepts are best described as pernicious psychiatric folklore devoid of convincing scientific evidence .
Such theories are quite incapable of reliably assisting the legal process . "
Shaw said , " We are not talking about not thinking about something and later remembering it and we 're not talking about somebody who has some memory distortion and then can't remember part of a experience later .
We are talking about somebody who was in a concentration camp and then forgot it ever happened . "
Lawyers Debate How Much One Can Forget , or Repress
Shanley 's lawyer submitted an affidavit by Harvard researcher Dr. Harrison Pope , who cited a wealth of research and argued , " adding up the more than 14,000 victims reported in more than 120 studies … it is inconceivable that ' repressed memory ' could be a valid and accepted scientific theory , yet not be demonstrated in a single unequivocal case reported throughout this vast literature . "
But representatives for the Leadership Council for Child Abuse and Interpersonal Violence -- another group of prominent psychiatrists and psychologists -- said that judges allow repressed - recovered memory as testimony " all the time " and that it is , indeed , an accepted phenomenon among psychiatrists .
" Even this [ Massachusetts ] court has already decided that it's a well - settled question , " said Wendy Murphy , adjunct professor at the New England School of Law and founder and director of the Victim Advocacy and Research Group in Boston .
Although courts have allowed repressed memories , several convictions in high - profile cases have been overturned based on repressed - and recovered - memory testimony .
In 1995 , for instance , a federal judge overturned the 1990 conviction of George Franklin Jr .
Franklin 's daughter accused him of the 1969 murder of her 8 - year - old best friend 20 years after the murder , saying she had recovered a memory of her father holding a rock over her friend 's head .
The judge overturned the verdict after Franklin 's daughter accused him of a second murder .
Yet Murphy asserts repressed memories , in the form of dissociative amnesia , are considered a valid phenomenon by psychiatrists across several countries .
" The way that you know for certain that it is not a scientific dispute , is if you look at the DSM -- that 's essentially the bible for psychiatrists , " Murphy said of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders .
Can Psychiatrists Judge the Judge ?
Indeed , " dissociative amnesia " was an entry in the extensively peer - reviewed and researched DSM , which serves as the equivalent of the Physician 's Desk Reference for those in the mental health field .
" Who are we as the judicial branch to say otherwise that it 's not accepted in psychiatry , " Murphy said .
Intentionally or not , legal experts say Shanley 's appeal also challenges a 1993 Supreme Court decision , Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals , that set a standard that judges -- not an academic or scientific community -- should decide which expert testimony is acceptable for the court .
" It 's where the judge gets to serve as gatekeeper , " said Rosanna Cavallaro , a professor who teaches evidence at Suffolk University Law School in Boston .
" The question for the judge is whether the methods and techniques provided by the expert are legitimate . "
With the exception of banning lie - detector results as evidence in many courts , Cavallaro said most appellate courts now leave the discretion of which expert is credentialed enough for testimony to the individual judge .
" What the court was worried about was that there would be this time lag , " Cavallaro said .
" For example , what if I 'm the first scientist to say this drug can treat cancer , but the general acceptance among doctors would n't agree for five to 10 years . "
But unlike in the case of cancer , Cavallaro pointed out , psychiatrists can't set up controlled abuse experiments to test a theory .
Usually , psychiatrists can only survey and ask abuse victims after the crime .
Complicating the issue further are the prominent clinical psychiatrists who report treating repressed memories first hand -- even if it 's rare .
" It really raises the whole question , what 's the difference between forgetting and repression -- which is not the same as forgetting , " said Dr. Philip R Muskin , a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University in New York City .
" I 've certainly seen patients who said , ' I was in an accident and we were driving down the road ' and the next thing they know is they 're in a neck brace -- and I have seen patients who have been assaulted who say , ' I can't remember the details of what happened but I know it happened ' , " Muskin said .
Yet while Muskin said he has seen patients who have blocked out moments in a traumatic memory , he has not yet heard of someone repressing the memory of the entire event .
" Can people truly repress violently traumatic events so they do n't know they happened for years and years and years , and then they can remember it years later ?
The answer is no , " Muskin said .
" Especially in a case where someone who had just been functioning fine , and has no problems , relates well to men and women for decades -- there should be some echo of the traumatic experience that happened . "
On the other hand , Muskin was cautious to say extreme cases of repressed - recovered memories could " never happen " in a patient .
" To say that it 's absolute either way is just unfair to science , " he said .
Team boss Ross Brawn has pledged to allow his drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello to battle it out for this year 's world championship title .
Barrichello lead Button home to a one - two at the Italian Grand Prix , reducing the Englishman 's lead to 14 points .
With Red Bull drivers Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel losing ground after a poor result , Brawn said : " I ask only that they compete openly and fairly .
" They have got to work together and it all has to be on top of the table . "
Barrichello's victory , his second in three races , took him to 66 points in the championship , with Button on 80 .
" My advantage has got smaller and Rubens is going to be a tough rival .
He has shown his skill over the years and it looks like this is going to go down to the wire .
Jenson Button Vettel is 26 points behind Button with a maximum of 40 available in the remaining four races after finishing eighth at Monza , a position to which he was promoted when McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton crashed out of third place on the last lap .
Webber , who retired on the first lap after a collision with Robert Kubica 's BMW Sauber , is 28.5 points off the lead and admitted after the race that his title hopes had suffered " a blow " .
Brawn , who was part of the Ferrari management when they regularly imposed team orders to assist Michael Schumacher , said he would allow his drivers to fight it out .
" We will just leave them to it , " he said .
" They are old enough to deal with it .
You have just got to make sure the atmosphere is calm , consistent and open and that there are no distractions . "
Button said : " Rubens is obviously my big rival for the title now .
That 's good , because we get on great .
" After the problems we have had in the last couple of races it is good to finish second , " admitted Button , who had gone five races without a podium finish since his last race win in Turkey in June .
" I would obviously prefer to be where Rubens is , but he did a really good job - congratulations to him .
" We have a good relationship .
We are still going to be sharing information because it is possible for Red Bull to be strong at the next races .
" My advantage has got smaller and Rubens is going to be a tough rival .
He has shown his skill over the years and it looks like this is going to go down to the wire .
" It 's going to be a tough few races , that is for sure , obviously we are both super competitive and want to win , so we will race now until the end of the season . "
Barrichello has cut Button 's lead nearly in half since the Englishman 's last victory in Turkey in June , and has won two of the last three races .
We will keep pushing , we have n't given up on anything
Christian Horner
Red Bull team boss
The Brazilian , the oldest driver in F1 at 37 , believes there will be no issues between him and Button as the season draws to a close .
" It is a winning year for us whatever happens , " Barrichello said .
" It 's not long ago that we had no jobs so we have to remember that - the team have done a fantastic job .
" But I am going to give my very best .
The title is my target and my dream , everyone knows that .
" I 'll just keep smiling and working and hopefully I 'll get there .
It 's going to be a good and a healthy fight and I am looking forward to that .
" There is a saying that you only win in F1 if you are tough , but we are both nice guys and the best thing in life is respect .
" That is what we have , it is an open book between us .
At the end of the day our cars are set up in similar way - I just had the edge but there is nothing in it .
" The main thing right now is that we scored maximum points and our rivals had problems . "
Red Bull boss Christian Horner refused to give up hope of one of his drivers challenging the Brawns , but he conceded they had " a mountain to climb " .
" We will keep pushing , we have n't given up on anything , " Horner said .
" We know it 's a mountain to climb up but we wont be giving up until it is mathematically impossible .
" Engines are a key factor and we can see that the Mercedes engine is performing extremely well .
ANDREW BENSON BLOG Monza was a breakthrough race for Button - he must fancy his chances of being able to defend a 14 - point lead over a man in the same car over the next four grands prix
" We are down in that department at the moment and that is something we need to address if we want to compete .
It is no coincidence that we are struggling on circuits that are predominantly power based .
" But we want to finish the year on a high . "
The next race is the Singapore Grand Prix on 27 September , with Japan , Brazil and Abu Dhabi playing host to the final three races on the calendar .

Tastier sausages could result from a first draft of the domestic pig's genetic blueprint produced by scientists yesterday .
The genetic codebook , or genome sequence , is 98 % complete .
It is expected to improve breeding practices , help scientists studying human diseases in pigs , and pinpoint genes that might improve pork production and meat quality .
Researchers based their analysis on DNA from a red - haired Duroc pig living on a farm at the University of Illinois in the US .
The Duroc is one of five major breeds used in pork production worldwide , and one of about 200 varieties of domesticated pig .
An international team of scientists , including British experts worked together on the sequencing project , which cost around £ 15 m .
Professor Alan Archibald , from the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh , one of the British scientists involved , said : “ This is a great day for the pig research community .
“ When we launched the international pig gene mapping project nearly 20 years ago , few if any of us thought a pig genome sequence attainable or affordable . ”

UK games companies are being asked to give their own suggestions on how to maximise the effectiveness of future funding programmes , according to a new government initiative .
The Technology Strategy Board has asked firms to visit the website www.innovateuk.org and help influence the direction of funding programmes and collaborations .
The board is also promoting a live online seminar on November 2 called " Digital Horizons : Commercialising Innovation " .
The board recently published The Creative Industries Strategy 09 and the next application period for funding is expected to being in the spring .
Funds will be awarded via peer - judged competitions based on priority areas identified in the strategy .
" We 've worked with around 100 key organisations and industry leaders from the creative sector to write the report and identify which areas we should focus on for the highest returns to the UK creative economy , " said Jeremy Silver , the Technology Strategy Board 's lead specialist in creative industries .
" Now we want to hear from those working in the gaming sector on how best we can work towards meeting these priorities , which will have a direct impact on where future funding goes to achieve the biggest impact . "
" The strategy aims to get the creative industries working more closely together to fully exploit new commercial opportunities and , by getting involved in shaping its delivery , gaming professionals have a great opportunity to influence funding programmes they stand to directly benefit from , " added Silver .
McLaren were always expected to be strong at the Italian Grand Prix and the fuel - corrected qualifying times emphasise just what good shape they are in for the race .
The drivers who are in the top - 10 shoot - out are not allowed to refuel after qualifying , so once the weights of the cars are revealed it is possible to work out who was genuinely the fastest man in qualifying - as well as the lap on which they are likely to make their first pit stop .
At Monza , that honour went to McLaren 's Heikki Kovalainen .
Having qualified an impressive fourth with a heavy fuel load , the Finn is therefore in theoretically the strongest position to win the race .
But the Brawn drivers also look to have a very strong chance - and if the Mole was to stick his neck out and make a prediction , it would be to make Button the favourite for victory .
But we 'll come back to that in a minute .
BBC Sport 's full fuel - adjusted top 10 , with predicted first pit stops , is as follows :
1 Kovalainen ( lap 28 )
2 Rubens Barrichello +0.016secs ( lap 30 )
3 Lewis Hamilton +0.047secs ( lap 16 )
4 Jenson Button +0.073 ( lap 29 )
5 Adrian Sutil +0.200 ( lap 17 )
6 Kimi Raikkonen +0.266 ( lap 19 )
7 Vitantonio Liuzzi +0.296 ( lap 27 )
8 Sebastian Vettel +0.363 ( lap 27 )
9 Fernando Alonso +0.381 ( lap 26 )
10 Mark Webber +0.469 ( lap 28 )
The first thing that strikes one about that list is just how close it is between the major contenders .
Only 0.073 seconds separates the top four drivers on fuel - adjusted times .
And that makes predicting a likely winner very difficult indeed .
On paper , a two - stop strategy ( Hamilton , Sutil and Raikkonen ) is marginally faster - but in practice stopping only once is often the best way to run a race at Monza .
Heikki Kovalainen is on fuel - adjusted Monza pole but can he convert that into a win ?
That is because to make a two - stop strategy work , a driver has to run at his optimum pace nearly all the time - and it is very difficult to ensure that happens because a team whose driver is stopping early will find it very difficult to ensure he comes out in a place where he is not going to get held up by a slower car .
Hamilton needs to make the most of what is likely to be a clear track in front of him by pressing on as hard as he can in the opening stages of the race .
He needs to make up enough time to ensure that when he emerges from his first stop anyone in front of him is going fast enough , on what by then should be a lighter fuel load , not to hold him up .
If anyone is going to make a two - stop strategy work , though , it is Hamilton .
Starting from pole , in a car fitted with the Kers power - boost system , the world champion is in the perfect place to capitalise on his team 's planning .
Even so , Kovalainen is still in a very strong position .
With Kers , he is likely to get ahead of Sutil 's Force India at the start .
And even though he may not pass Raikkonen , he should not be held up by the Ferrari in the first stage of the race .
The question mark over Kovalainen is whether he has the consistency of race pace to fulfil his potential - it has been his relatively poor performances in races so far this year that has put his position in the team under threat .
The Brawn drivers are also in a potentially very strong position to score some serious points and perhaps even win , as they made clear in their interviews on the BBC immediately after qualifying .
Barrichello and Button may only be fifth and sixth on the grid but they are both fuelled heavy - and it would be a surprise if both of them are not in contention once their single stops are out of the way .
So , why make Button the favourite ?
That is because of Kovalainen 's inconsistent form in races and the fragile gearbox in Barrichello 's car .
Certainly both Brawn drivers have a golden opportunity to effectively put some serious distance between them and their Red Bull rivals in the championship .
For while Vettel and Webber are also fuelled long , they are starting far enough back that it will be difficult for them to make up the ground .
For the record , the calculated first pit stops for the rest of the field are as follows :
11 Jarno Trulli ( lap 35 )
12 Romain Grosjean ( lap 33 )
13 Robert Kubica ( lap 31 )
14 Giancarlo Fisichella ( lap 28 )
15 Nick Heidfeld ( lap 31 )
16 Timo Glock ( lap 37 )
17 Kazuki Nakajima ( lap 33 )
18 Nico Rosberg ( lap 34 )
19 Sebastien Buemi ( lap 34 )
20 Jaime Alguersuari ( lap 34 )
If team - mates are listed on the same lap , the one who is leading in the race when the stops approach tends to be given priority .
There were countrywide protests against the Orissa attacks
A US congressional body has put India on a list of countries which have failed to protect its religious minorities adequately .
The US Commission on International Religious Freedom says India was added to the list because of a " disturbing increase " in religious violence .
It mentioned the anti-Christian and anti-Muslim riots in Orissa and Gujarat in 2008 and 2002 respectively .
India has not yet commented on its inclusion on the " watch list " .
Other countries on the list include Afghanistan , Somalia and Cuba .
Leonard Leo , the chair of USCIRF , said that it was " extremely disappointing " that India has done " so little to protect and bring justice to its religious minorities under siege . "
" India 's democratic institutions charged with upholding the rule of law , most notably state and central judiciaries and police , have emerged as unwilling or unable to seek redress for victims of the violence , " he said .
" More must be done to ensure future violence does not occur and that perpetrators are held accountable . "
Last year , Kandhamal district in Orissa witnessed weeks of anti-Christian violence after a Hindu leader was shot dead .
The clashes erupted after Hindu groups blamed Christians for the killing .
And more than 1,000 people , mostly Muslims , died in the riots in Gujarat which began after 60 Hindus died in a fire on a train in 2002 .
The USCIRF says that the Obama administration should urge the Indian government to take measures to promote communal peace and protect religious minorities .
The panel issues an annual report on religious freedom every May .
But its India chapter was delayed after the Indian government declined to issue visas for the trip , the USCIRF said .
KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
Shameen 's brown eyes seem lost as she thinks about the one day she wants to forget , but it is all she can think about .
Nearly 90 percent of Afghan women suffer from domestic abuse , according to the U.N .
Still traumatized , she recounts the events that led her to a safe house in Kabul .
She was raped and nearly stabbed to death by her husband just seven days before we met her .
Her lips are quivering and her eyes full of fear .
" He forced himself on me , " she said .
" All I could do was scream . "
She was married off 15 years ago when she was a teenager .
Throughout those years she was tortured and abused , suffering daily beatings with an electrical wire or the metal end of a hammer .
This was her normal life .
" He chased after me with a hammer .
He said if I made any noise he would put holes through me , " Shameen said .
Shameen and her husband could not conceive a child .
And in Afghan society , it seems , the blame always falls on the woman .
After one severe beating , she ran from her home and to the police station .
Her husband promised the police he would not attack her anymore , so she gave in and agreed to go back home with him .
Days later , Shameen 's husband took her on a trip to visit her sister 's grave -- a 15 - year - old sister who was burned to death for displeasing her husband .
Shameen says her younger sister was 11 years old when she was forced to marry an older man .
He would beat and abuse her until one day he killed her .
As Shameen walked along the graveyard with her husband he took her near a shrine where he forced her to the ground , lifted her burqa and raped her .
He then threatened her with a knife and asked her who was going to help her now .
She was screaming as he slashed her throat and body .
A passerby saved her .
Now , she has no one to turn to -- not even her own parents .
In their eyes , she has brought them shame , an offense punishable by death .
In Afghanistan , a woman is blamed for the injustices she must live through .
Shameen says when her sister was killed , her parents turned a blind eye .
She misses her parents and siblings but knows she can never see them again .
" They 'll kill me , " she said without flinching .
She now hides in a safe house , isolated and alone .
Like most Afghan women , she has lost all hope .
Afghanistan is a country where for centuries women have been considered property -- not equals , like the constitution states .
They are often beaten , raped and even sold to the highest bidder .
There are very few places women can turn to .
Authorities brought Shameen to a shelter run by Women for Afghan Women ( WAW ) .
The organization started in New York to provide humanitarian assistance to women who do not know they have rights .
Watch Abawi's report from the shelter »
In this safe house , WAW is currently providing care , security and an education for 54 women and children .
Nearly 90 percent of Afghan women suffer from domestic abuse , according to the United Nations Development Fund for Women .
Despite that , there are less than a dozen shelters like this one in Afghanistan , usually run by non-governmental organizations .
Abusers are rarely prosecuted or convicted , and most women are afraid to say anything .
" Their mothers are beaten by their fathers .
They 're beaten by their fathers , by their brothers .
It 's a way of life , " said Manizha Naderi , director of WAW .
Naderi is an Afghan - American who grew up in New York and has returned to Afghanistan to work with other women in hopes of bringing a change , although she said it will take generations .
" They see their mothers being beaten , they see their sisters their aunts , everybody , " Naderi said .
" So that 's what they expect . "
It is not just women who suffer .
Hosnia is a smiling eight year old who likes to play with her toys and other young girls at the shelter .
She rocks her body on the mat where she sits , the rocking swaying her green plastic earrings as she talks with a muffled sweet voice .
" I have a difficulty , " she said , when asked what she is doing at the shelter .
Her smile fades as she remembers the circumstances that brought her here .
Just three years ago when Hosnia was five , she was raped and left for dead outside her home in northern Afghanistan .
Her father found her bloody body floating in a creek .
She spent a month in the hospital as her little body recovered from that brutal assault .
Out of love and fear for his daughter 's life , Hosnia 's dad brought her to this safe house .
According to WAW , her rapist was a young man from an affluent family and quickly released from jail because of bribes and family connections .
The organization forced the authorities back on the case and he was then sentenced to six years in a Kabul juvenile prison .
He has three years left in his sentence , and Hosnia 's parents fear for their daughter 's life .
So the shelter is her home now and the women and children here , her family .
" We will take care of her through adulthood , " Naderi said .
Hosnia 's father , a poor farmer , knows the only chance for his girl to have a future in a country where rape victims are punished , is if she grows up here .
This shelter has dozens of heart - wrenching stories ; it also houses dozens of women and girls who have the courage to live in a country where one of the biggest dangers is to be a woman .

Agents may begin such assessments against a target without a particular factual justification .
The basis for such an inquiry “ cannot be arbitrary or groundless speculation , ” the manual says , but the standard is “ difficult to define . ”
Assessments permit agents to use potentially intrusive techniques , like sending confidential informants to infiltrate organizations and following and photographing targets in public .
F.B.I. agents previously had similar powers when looking for potential criminal activity .
But until the recent changes , greater justification was required to use the powers in national security investigations because they receive less judicial oversight .
If agents turn up something specific to suggest wrongdoing , they can begin a “ preliminary ” or “ full ” investigation and use additional techniques , like wiretapping .
But even if agents find nothing , the personal information they collect during assessments can be retained in F.B.I. databases , the manual says .
When selecting targets , agents are permitted to consider political speech or religion as one criterion .
The manual tells agents not to engage in racial profiling , but it authorizes them to take into account “ specific and relevant ethnic behavior ” and to “ identify locations of concentrated ethnic communities . ”
Farhana Khera , president of Muslim Advocates , said the F.B.I. was harassing Muslim - Americans by singling them out for scrutiny .
Her group was among those that sued the bureau to release the manual .
“ We have seen even in recent months the revelation of the F.B.I. going into mosques  not where they have a specific reason to believe there is criminal activity , but as ‘ agent provocateurs ’ who are trying to incite young individuals to join a purported terror plot , ” Ms. Khera said .
“ We think the F.B.I. should be focused on following actual leads rather than putting entire communities under the microscope . ”
Dear President Obama ,
I know I was n’t born when this picture was taken but from what it looks like you were a pretty cool guy .
I have to tip my cap off to you for accomplishing something that no other American has in history …
You openly admitted to smoking marijuana .
Some might argue with me that Bill Clinton was the first …
Sorry Bill you did n’t inhale .
Some might argue that George W. Bush was the first ….
He never admitted it , we just all know its true .
Barack you are the man , you enjoyed the simple pleasures of life during your youth .
I understand you have a lot going on these days and I applaud the fact that you are letting states make the decisions regarding laws they have passed .
I am not the one saying that legalization is going to solve all of the economic problems that we are currently facing , but it coud n’t hurt right ?
When you go to make decisions regarding the medical marijuana polocies just take a second to look back at this picture and think about how you were feeling at that moment in time .
I guarantee you were n’t thinking you would ever be put in a position to make a difference but now you can .
As regards to the current fight regarding legalization all I have to do is take a page out of your book , YES WE CAN !!

NASA has chosen the final destination for the LCROSS lunar impacting probe : the crater Cabeus A , near the Moon 's south pole .
So why is NASA smacking a probe into the Moon at high speed , and why there ?
The idea is that over millions and billions of years , a lot of comets have hit the Moon .
The water from these comets hits the surface and sublimates away ... but if any settles at the bottoms of deep craters near the Moon 's poles , these permanently shadowed regions can act as a refrigerator , keeping the water from disappearing .
It can stay there , locked up as ice , for a long , long time .
Some estimates indicate there could be billions of tons of ice near the Moon 's south pole .
Detecting that water is tough .
Radar results have been inconclusive , with some people saying there 's lots of water , and others saying there 's none at all .
By impacting a probe there , any ice located at the impact site will be shot up above the lunar surface , where sunlight will break it up into H ^+ and OH ^- molecules , which can be detected .
Thus , LCROSS .
I have a more detailed description of all this in an earlier blog post about LCROSS .
The choice of Cabeus A for the impact site is a good one .
It 's near the south pole , it 's a likely spot for there to be ice under the surface , it's on the near side of the Moon , so people back here on Earth can observe it , but close enough to the limb that any ejected water can be seen .
Here 's a map of the area :

LCROSS is planned to impact the crater at 11:30 GMT on October 9 , which is early morning for the U.S. ( in fact , there will be two impacts ; one from the spacecraft and another by the Centaur booster )
The plume from the impact should stretch up many kilometers .
It will almost certainly be too thin to be seen by amateur instruments , but the impact itself should make a bright enough flash to be seen if you have a telescope .
The crater itself will be in shadow , making the light flash easier to spot .
It 'll only last a second or two , so if you want to observe it , be prepared !
NASA has a nice webpage with all the info you need to watch this historic event for yourself .
I hope everyone gets a chance to see this !
The old saw that “ it ’s the little things that count ” was surely coined by a typographer , and few things are littler than kerning adjustments .
Consider this : A 1/100 em kerning adjustment applied in 24 - point type results in a movement equal to the width of a human hair .
Kerning addresses a basic problem with our alphabet :
The shapes of certain character pairs create spacing problems , making them appear either more loosely or more tightly spaced than the neighboring characters around them .
To create the even and consistent spacing between characters that makes for pleasant reading , you should iron out these spacing anomalies .
The term kern comes from the French word meaning the corner of a block of type .
When type was set by hand , each character was cast on its own little metal block , and these were arranged in rows to create lines of type .
In the following illustration , l represents the point size of the type , k its cap height .
Gutenberg ’s solution to the problem of conflicting character shapes was to create lots of printing blocks that had two or more characters on them .
This allowed , for example , one character to nuzzle into the negative space that flanked another , something that was impossible when each character was on its own block .
When Gutenberg printed his famous Bibles , he used scores of these twinned characters .
It was an expensive solution .
Eventually this gave way to a casting technique that allowed parts of certain characters to extend beyond the edges of their blocks , where they could lean on the shoulders of the blocks next to them .
These so - called kerning characters were clever , fragile , and still expensive .
Kerning characters exist in computer fonts as well .
Here , the view from within a font - editing program shows how this italic f extends beyond its side bearings — the digital equivalent of a metal type block — allowing it to overlap characters set next to it .
Only with the advent of electronic typesetting could wholesale kerning get underway , as it allowed the images of characters to be positioned anywhere , even overlapped .
Kerning Tables
Built into every digital font is a list of character pairs that present spacing problems .
For each of these pairs , a kerning adjustment is prescribed , either a negative value to tighten the spacing or a positive one to open it up .
These lists are called kerning tables , and their adjustments are calibrated in thousandths of an em .
Part of the kerning table from the Adobe Garamond font .
It ’s a straightforward assignment of spacing adjustments to specific character pairs .
When your typesetting or word - processing program fills lines with type , it constantly refers to these kerning tables and adjusts inter-character spacing as it goes .
When dedicated electronic typesetting systems became widespread in the 1960s , a typical font contained perhaps 100 kerning pairs .
When the technology shifted to formats used on desktop computers , that number did n’t change much .
There are still millions of older PostScript fonts in circulation containing only 100 or so kerning pairs .
To put this figure in perspective , if you wanted a comprehensive list of all the possible character combinations in one of these old fonts , your kerning tables would contain more than 50,000 pairs .
These days , with much more powerful computers , a well - built text font typically contains kerning tables with 500 to 1,000 pairs .
But it ’s hard to know how extensive the kerning table for a specific font is .
QuarkXPress ’ Kerning Table Edit utility can display the list ( which you can add to ) and its adjustments ( which you can alter ) .
A font - editing program can do the same thing .
In general , though , fonts ’ kerning tables are hidden from view .
A Second Kind of Automatic Kerning
Adobe InDesign offers an alternative to table - based kerning , using software that analyzes the shapes of adjoining characters and assigns kerning adjustments on the fly .
Adobe calls this optical kerning .
Here ’s an illustration of how it works .
The following samples are all set using Bitstream ’s Bodoni Book , a font containing 668 kerning pairs .
In the top sample , automatic kerning is turned off , and the spacing between characters is determined solely by their side bearings , as defined in the font .
The kerning in the second sample is based on the font ’s kerning tables ; most pairs get no adjustment , as the numbers below each pair indicate .
The third setting uses Adobe InDesign ’s “ optical ” kerning scheme , and every pair gets some adjustment .
The bottom setting was kerned manually by me ; it benefits from both human vision and character - by - character adjustments .
Clearly , neither table - based nor algorithmic kerning is perfect ( nor am I , for that matter ) .
The tables ca n’t be complete enough , and algorithms have no eyes .
Best would be a system that uses a font ’s kerning tables first but applies algorithmic kerning for pairs that are n’t listed in the font .
I do n’t know of any such system available at the moment .
When Automatic Kerning Is n’t Good Enough
Considering how much we admire printed books from before the electronic typesetting era , it ’s easy to argue that fussing about kerning is much ado about nothing .
And in text type , this is often the case .
Display type is another matter .
Because spacing problems become more apparent as type size increases , the larger the type , the more important it becomes to pay attention to kerning problems .
In text , proofreaders and copy editors should keep an eye peeled for character sequences that need kerning .
But generally speaking , manual kerning is most important in display type .
In headline type , book titles , large ad type , and so on , you can spend a lot of time tweaking the spacing between characters .
It ’s a worthwhile pursuit , but you can also make yourself crazy .
One way to avoid insanity is not to use kerning increments that are too fine .
You may have noticed that all the adjustments I made in the previous sample were multiples to 10/1000 em .
Spacing changes smaller than this are very nearly undetectable at large sizes , and ineffective at small sizes .
For example , a 1/1000 em spacing change in 28 - point type can’t even be registered on a typical imagesetter because it does n’t add up to the width of a single pixel .
I use the Preferences settings in my programs to define a minimum kerning adjustment using the keyboard to be 10/1000 em .
Rarely if ever do I use anything smaller .
Manual Kerning Strategies
It ’s tempting to zoom in very close when you manually kern your type .
The increased size helps compensate for the low resolution of the screen .
But it also exaggerates the impact of the white space , because making the type bigger makes it look looser .
It ’s best to adjust the tracking of the type at a modest magnification , and then zoom in to balance the spacing of the troublesome pairs .
Accept that the zoomed type is going to look much looser than it will when printed .
Printed proofs are also important .
Screen resolution is very deceptive , and even high - resolution desktop inkjet printers may create aliasing errors , in which the printer is forced to round off an image to the nearest pixel , which can distort spacing at smaller point sizes .
The goal of tweaking kerning is to achieve even , consistent spacing .
The first rule of kerning , then , is to find the worst , nastiest , most difficult character pair in the passage and let that set the spacing feel for the rest .
In the following example , then , the kerning needed to even out the spacing has to be keyed by the loosest pair .
To ignore this and tighten all the rest will just make the bad pair stand out even more .
In the following illustration , the top sample is over - kerned .
While most of the character pairs can be tightened up snugly , the TY combination can’t .
That loose pair pokes a hole in the line .
In the bottom sample , the spacing of the entire line has been adjusted to match as well as possible that of the TY , with better overall results .
On the following CD cover , I think the designer had too much faith in the font ’s kerning tables .
The rhythm of the spacing clearly loosens as the character shapes go from round to round ( Bee ) to a series of less - compatible shapes , especially in hove , where the shapes go from flat to round to angled and back to round .
In my adjusted , “ after ” version , I used the spacing of the th combination to set the leitmotif for the rest .
This meant relaxing the spacing between the round characters and tightening most of the rest .
Before :
After :
Perhaps the most common kerning error is overdoing things , taking out space just because it ’s there .
I used to buy a brand of mayonnaise with a label designed by someone who seemed to have an obsession with squeezing out every space possible .
As a result , the brand logo looked like this :
It ’s no longer available at my local market , and since it was pretty good mayonnaise , I am left to wonder whether it was bad kerning that drove it from the shelves .
The Final Word
Kerning is not a matter of measuring , it ’s a matter of how the type looks .
There are times when the sequence of characters makes it impossible to establish that perfect spacing rhythm .
All you can do is try your best , and remember that tightening is not always the way to go .
Sometimes making spacing a bit more slack — to accommodate that pesky pair — is the way to go .

That period right after college graduation is when young people tend to think they can set the world on fire .
Careers are starting , and relationships in the broader world are forming .
It ’s exciting , and optimism is off the charts .
So the gloomy outlook that this economy is offering so many of America ’s brightest young people is not just disconcerting , it ’s a cultural shift , a harbinger .
“ Attention , ” as the wife of a fictional salesman once said , “ must be paid . ”
Maggie Mertens graduated in May from Smith College , where she was an editor of the student newspaper .
She applied for “ tons ” of jobs and internships , probably 50 or more .
“ I was totally unemployed all summer , ” she said .
She eventually landed an internship at NPR in Washington , which she described as “ awesome , ” but it is unpaid .
“ I was lucky enough , ” she said , “ to connect up with a family that let me live with them for free in exchange for watching their baby a few times a week . ”
But there was still no money coming in .
So in addition to the 40 - hour - a - week internship and the baby - sitting chores , Ms. Mertens is doing part - time seasonal work at a Whole Foods store .
In the worst of times , my father always used to say , “ A good gambler cuts his losses . ”
It ’s a formulation imprinted on my brain forever .
That no -nonsense piece of advice still seems reasonable to me , but it does n’t apply to American war policy .
Our leaders evidently never saw a war to which the word “ more ” did n’t apply .
Hence the Afghan War , where impending disaster is just an invitation to fuel the flames of an already roaring fire .
Here ’s a partial rundown of news from that devolving conflict :
In the last week , Nuristan , a province on the Pakistani border , essentially fell to the Taliban after the U.S. withdrew its forces from four key bases .
Similarly in Khost , another eastern province bordering Pakistan where U.S. forces once registered much - publicized gains ( and which Richard Holbrooke , now President Obama ’s special envoy to the region , termed “ an American success story ” ) , the Taliban is largely in control .
It is , according to Yochi Dreazen and Anand Gopal of the Wall Street Journal , now “ one of the most dangerous provinces ” in the country .
Similarly , the Taliban insurgency , once largely restricted to the Pashtun south , has recently spread fiercely to the west and north .
At the same time , neighboring Pakistan is an increasingly destabilized country amid war in its tribal borderlands , a terror campaign spreading throughout the country , escalating American drone attacks , and increasingly testy relations between American officials and the Pakistani government and military .
Meanwhile , the U.S. command in Afghanistan is considering a strategy that involves pulling back from the countryside and focusing on protecting more heavily populated areas ( which might be called , with the first U.S. Afghan War of the 1980s in mind , the Soviet strategy ) .
The underpopulated parts of the countryside would then undoubtedly be left to Hellfire missile - armed American drone aircraft .
In the last week , three U.S. helicopters – the only practical way to get around a mountainous country with a crude , heavily mined system of roads – went down under questionable circumstances ( another potential sign of an impending Soviet - style disaster ) .
Across the country , Taliban attacks are up ; deadly roadside bombs or IEDs are fast on the rise ( a 350 - percent jump since 2007 ) ; U.S. deaths are at a record high and the numbers of wounded are rising rapidly ; European allies are ever less willing to send more troops ; and Taliban raids in the capital , Kabul , are on the increase .
All this despite a theoretical 12 - 1 edge U.S. , NATO , and Afghan troops have over the Taliban insurgents and their allies .
In addition , our nation - building “ partner , ” the hopeless Afghan President Hamid Karzai – known in better times as “ the mayor of Kabul ” for his government ’s lack of reach – was the “ winner ” in an election in which , it seemed , more ballot boxes were stuffed than voters arrived at the polls .
In its wake , and in the name of having an effective “ democratic ” partner in Afghanistan , the foreigners stepped in : Sen. John Kerry , Richard Holbrooke , and other envoys appeared in Kabul or made telephone calls to whisper sweet somethings in ears and twist arms .
The result was a second round of voting slated for Nov. 7 and likely only to compound the initial injury .
No matter the result – and Abdullah Abdullah , Karzai ’s opponent , has already withdrawn in protest from the runoff – the winner will , once again , be the Taliban .
( And let ’s not forget the recent New York Times revelation that the president ’s alleged drug - kingpin brother , Ahmed Wali Karzai , whom American officials regularly and piously denounce , is , in fact , a long - term paid agent of the CIA and its literal landlord in the southern city of Kandahar .
If you were a Taliban propagandist , you could n’t make this stuff up . )
With the second round of elections already a preemptive disaster , and foreigners visibly involved in the process , all of this is a Taliban bonanza .
The words “ occupation , ” “ puppet government , ” and the like undoubtedly ring ever truer in Afghan ears .
You do n’t have to be a propaganda genius to exploit this sort of thing .
In such a situation , even good imperial gamblers would normally cut their losses .
Unfortunately , in Washington terms , what ’s happened in Afghanistan is not the definition of failure .
In the economic lingo of the moment , the war now falls into the category of “ too big to fail , ” which means upping the ante or doubling down the bet .
Think of the Afghan War , in other words , as the AIG of American foreign policy .
Playing With Dominos ,
Then and Now
Have you noticed , by the way , that the worse Afghanistan gets , the more the pundits find themselves stumbling helplessly into Vietnam ?
Analogies to that old counterinsurgency catastrophe are now a dime a dozen .
And no wonder .
Even if it ’s obvious that Vietnam and Afghanistan , as places and historical situations , have little in common , what they do have is Washington .
Our leaders , that is , seem repetitiously intent on creating analogies between the two wars .
What is it about Washington and such wars ?
How is it that American wars conducted in places most Americans once could n’t have located on a map , and gone disastrously wrong , somehow become too big to fail ?
Why is it that , facing such wars – whether the president is a Democrat or a Republican – Washington ’s response is the bailout ?
As things go from bad to worse and the odds grow grimmer , our leaders , like the worst of gamblers , wager ever more .
Why is it that , in obscure lands under obscure circumstances , American administrations somehow become convinced that everything – the fate of our country , if not the planet itself – is at stake ?
In Vietnam , this was expressed in the absurd “ domino theory ” : if Vietnam fell , Thailand , Burma , India , and finally California would follow like so many toppling dominos .
Now , Afghanistan has become the First Domino of our era , and the rest of the falling dominos in the 21st century are , of course , the terrorist attacks to come , once an emboldened al - Qaeda has its “ safe haven ” and its triumph in the backlands of that country .
In other words , first Afghanistan , then Pakistan , then a mushroom cloud over an American city .
In both the Vietnam era and today , Washington has also been mesmerized by that supposedly key currency of international stature , “ credibility . ”
To employ a strategy of “ less , ” to begin to cut our losses and pull out of Afghanistan would – they know with a certainty that passeth belief – simply embolden the terrorist ( in the Vietnam era , communist ) enemy .
It would be a victory for al - Qaeda ’s future Islamic caliphate ( as it once would have been for communist global domination ) .
By now , the urge to bail out Afghanistan , instead of bailing out of the place , has visibly become a compulsion , even for a foreign policy team that should know better , a team that is actually reading a book about how the Vietnam disaster happened .
Unfortunately , the citizenry can’t take the obvious first step and check that team , with all its attendant generals and plenipotentiaries , into some LBJ or George W. Bush Rehabilitation Center ; nor is there a 12 - step detox program to recommend to Washington ’s war addicts .
And the “ just say no ” approach , not exactly a career enhancer , has been used so far by but a single , upright foreign service officer , Matthew P. Hoh , who sent a resignation letter as senior civilian representative in Zabul province to the State Department in September .
( “ To put [ it ] simply : I fail to see the value or the worth in continued U.S. casualties or expenditures or resources in support of the Afghan government in what is , truly , a 35 - year old civil war .
…
The United States military presence in Afghanistan greatly contributes to the legitimacy and strategic message of the Pashtun insurgency .
In a like manner our backing of the Afghan government in its current form continues to distance the government from the people . ” )
More or Less More ?
In this context , despite all the media drama – Is Obama “ dithering ” or not ?
Will he or wo n’t he follow the advice of his generals ?
– we already know one thing about the president ’s upcoming Afghan War decision with a painful degree of certainty : it will involve more , not less .
It will up the ante , not cut our losses .
As the New York Times put it recently , “ [ T ] he debate [ within the administration ] is no longer over whether to send more troops , but how many more will be needed . ”
In other words , we know that , in response to a war everyone on all sides of the Afghan debate in the U.S. now agrees is little short of disastrous , he will , in some fashion , feed the flames .
Admittedly , President Obama himself has offered few indications of what exactly he plans to do ( if he even knows ) .
It ’s now being said , however , that , at the end of a highly publicized set of brainstorming sessions with his vice president , top advisors , generals , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , congressional representatives , and cabinet officers , he may ( or may not ) announce a decision before he sets out for Tokyo on Nov. 11 .
Nonetheless , thanks to an endless series of high - level Washington leaks and whispers , beginning more than a month ago with the leaking to the Washington Post ‘s Bob Woodward of Afghan War commander Stanley McChrystal ’s report to the president , we do know this :
Every option Obama is considering has the word “ more ” ( as in the Vietnam - era term “ escalation ” ) attached to it .
There is n’t a “ less ” ( a de-escalation ) option in sight .
Withdrawal of any sort has , so press reports tell us , been officially taken off the table .
The most publicity has gone , of course , to the “ counterinsurgency ” or COIN option put forward by Gen. McChrystal and clearly backed by George W. Bush ’s favorite Iraqi “ surge ” general and present CENTCOM commander , David Petraeus .
According to this option , the president would significantly increase the number of American boots on the ground to “ protect ” the Afghan people .
The actual numbers of extra troops urged on Obama have undergone a strange process of growth - by - leak over the last weeks .
Initially , as the New York Times reported , the general was supposedly recommending three possibilities : a low figure of 10,000 - 15,000 ( “ a high - risk option ” ) , an in - between figure of 25,000 ( “ a medium - risk option ” ) , and a top figure of 45,000 ( “ a low - risk option ” ) .
More recently , it ’s been suggested that McChrystal ’s three choices are : 10,000 , 40,000 , and 80,000 ( or even possibly 44,000 and 85,000 ) – his preference , for now , reportedly being 40,000 .
These new American troops would , of course , be over and above the approximately 70,000 already slated to be in - country by the end of 2009 , more than a doubling of the force in place when the Obama administration came into office .
The striking increase to almost 70,000 has , so far , led to a more intense but less successful war effort .
In a recent grimly comic episode , a meeting of NATO defense ministers put its stamp of approval on Gen.
McChrystal ’s robust COIN option – despite the fact that their governments seem unwilling to offer any extra soldiers in support of such an American surge .
( The only exception so far has been British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , who agreed to send a paltry 500 more troops – with hedges and escape clauses at that . )
Beyond Gen. McChrystal ’s ultimate “ more ” option , at least three other options are reportedly being considered , all representing “ less ” ; think of these as “ less more ” options .
They include :
* An option to significantly bulk up the training of the Afghan army and police force , so that we might hand our war off to them ASAP .
This is , in reality , another “ more ” option , since thousands of new U.S. trainers and advisers would be needed .
It has reportedly been favored by Sen. Carl Levin and other Democrats in Congress fearful of major Vietnam - style troop escalations and the ensuing fallout at home .
* An option to leave troops numbers in Afghanistan roughly at their present level and focus not on counterinsurgency , but on what ’s being called “ counterterrorism - plus . ”
This , in practical terms , means upping the use of U.S. drone aircraft and Special Forces teams , while focusing less on the Taliban in the Afghan countryside and more on taking out al - Qaeda and possibly Taliban operatives in the Pakistani tribal border regions .
This option is said to be favored by Vice President Joe Biden , who also reportedly fears ( perfectly reasonably ) that a larger American “ footprint ” in Afghanistan might only turn Afghans even more strongly against a foreign occupation .
This option is , in turn , often discussed by the U.S. media as if it were a de-escalatory approach and the next thing to an antiwar position .
It , too , however , represents more .
* An option recently put forward by John Kerry , head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , for what Jim Lobe of Inter Press Service has termed “ counterinsurgency lite . ”
This would , according to the senator , involve more training of Afghan troops and the commitment of perhaps 10,000 - 15,000 additional American troops immediately .
( In his typical way , however , Kerry managed to stop short of mentioning actual numbers . )
Meanwhile , we would wait for other factors considered crucial for a successful counterinsurgency campaign to kick in : “ enough reliable Afghan forces to partner with American troops , ” “ local leaders we can partner with , ” and “ the civilian side ready to follow swiftly with development aid that brings tangible benefits to the local population . ”
Wielding a classic image of imperial control , the senator claims to want to put an “ Afghan face ” on the Afghan War – that is , though no one ever says this , an Afghan mask over the American war .
( Since the crucial factors he lays out for a successful counterinsurgency campaign are never likely to come into being , his , too , is a “ less more ” - style option . )
Quagmires ,
Then and Now
It ’s quite possible , of course , that the president will choose a “ hybrid strategy , ” mixing and matching from this list .
He might , for instance , up drone attacks in Pakistan , raise troop levels “ modestly ” à la Kerry , and send in more U.S. trainers and advisers – a package that would surely be presented as part of a plan to pave the way for our future departure .
All we do know , based on the last year , is that “ more ” in whatever form is likely to prove a nightmare , and yet anything less than escalation of some sort is not in the cards .
No one in Washington is truly going to cut U.S. losses anytime soon .
In the Vietnam era , there was a shorthand word for this : “ quagmire . ”
We were , as the antiwar song then went , “ waist deep in the Big Muddy ” and still wading in .
If Vietnam was , in fact , a quagmire , however , it was so only because we made it so .
Similarly , in changed circumstances , Afghanistan today has become the AIG of American foreign policy and Obama ’s team so many foreign policy equivalents of Bush treasury secretary Hank Paulson .
And as with the economy , so with the expanding Af / Pak war : at the end of the day , it ’s the American taxpayer who will be left holding the bag .
Let ’s think about what this means for a moment : According to the U.S. Congressional Research Service , the cost of keeping a single American soldier in Afghanistan is $ 1.3 million per year .
According to Greg Jaffe and Karen DeYoung of the Washington Post , it costs the Pentagon about $ 1 billion per year to station 1,000 U.S. troops in that country .
It ’s fair to assume that this estimate does n’t include , among other things , long - term care for wounded soldiers or the cost of replacing destroyed or overused equipment .
Nor do these figures include any civilian funds being spent on the war effort via the State Department , nor undoubtedly the funds being spent by the Pentagon to upgrade bases and facilities throughout the country .
In other words , just about any decision by the president , including one simply focused on training Afghan soldiers and police , will involve an outlay of further multi-billions of dollars .
Whatever choice the president makes , the U.S. will bleed money .
Let ’s say that he makes the Kerry choice – “ just ” perhaps 15,000 troops .
That means at least $ 15 billion for starters .
And there ’s no reason to believe that we ’re only talking a year here .
The counterinsurgency types are talking 5 - 10 years to “ turn the tide ” of the insurgency .
Those who are actually training the Afghan military and police , when quoted , do n’t believe they will be capable of taking what ’s called “ responsibility ” in a major way for years to come , if ever .
Throw in domestic politics where a Democratic president invariably feels safer kicking the can down the road via escalation than being called “ weak ” – though Obama is already being blasted by the right for “ dithering ” – and you have about as toxic a brew as can be imagined .
If the Afghan War is already too big to fail , what in the world will it be after the escalations to come ?
As with Vietnam , so now with Afghanistan , the thick layers of mythology and fervent prediction and projection that pass for realism in Washington make clear thinking on the war impossible .
They prevent the serious consideration of any options labeled “ less ” or “ none . ”
They inflate projections of disaster based on withdrawal , even though similar lurid predictions during the Vietnam era proved hopelessly off - base .
The United States lived through all the phases of escalation , withdrawal , and defeat in Vietnam without suffering great postwar losses of any sort .
This time we may not be so lucky .
The United States is itself no longer too big to fail – and if we should do so , remind me :
Who exactly will bail us out ?

" Sometimes I put my log in information into the register fields . "
" Me too !
I hate that not only do I feel stupid , I have to retype everything again . "
For one of my side projects , Leafy Chat , we have just added the concept of user accounts .
This includes the need for registration and log in ( as well as log out and forgot password and so on ) .
Leafy
Chat only requires an email address and a password for both registration and log in , so it would be great to have some clever way to have both forms on the homepage .
Some things to consider :
Users only need to register once but will log in many times .
It 's really important to get new users and registration should be dead simple .
Users will accidentally use the wrong form and should not be punished by having to re-enter their information .
The two forms , register and log in , require different validation .
For log in , we need to check if the username / password combination is valid and for registration we need to verify that the email address is unique .
Another project that I 've designed also has an email / password registration system .
Hurl is a site for testing APIs .
At any point while using Hurl , a user can click the " Log in " link to log in or register .
A pop-up displays a single form and two buttons to choose from : " Log in " or " Sign up "
I like this design because by clicking the correct button , the user determines which validation to perform .
For example , if the user clicks " Sign up " and the email is already in use , they probably already have an account and can simply click " Log in " to correct the action .
What if the user first clicks " Log in " but does n't actually have an account ?
They simply get an error message that the account does n't exist and can click " Sign up " to create one .
The user is n't punished for picking the wrong form .
I think the Hurl design is an improvement over a two - form system but it 's far from perfect .
I do n't like that the buttons look so similar and that there 's very little guiding the user to pick one or the other .
Mike Malone suggested taking a look at Amazon 's log in / register page .
Wow .
I love this form because it is so straightforward .
If you 're an existing user , it 's only one step to log in .
For a new user , the form takes you to a second page that asks you for a little more information and also prepopulates the email you entered .
The use of radio buttons makes it clear that there are two distinct validation choices ( as opposed to the form buttons which do n't necessarily imply that you should only pick one ) .
While radio buttons are n't the trendiest HTML form input , they are the appropriate one for prompting a user to pick one option out of many ( while not obscuring the options like a select input does ) .
So after probably far too much research , I 've come up with the following single register / log in form for Leafy Chat .
Log in
Sign up
The form updates via JavaScript when the user selects a radio button .
For the log in form , notice that the submit button says " Log in " and there is a link to retrieve a forgotten password .
For the sign up form , the label for the password field prompts the user to " Choose a password " and " Sign up ! " while also accepting the terms of service .
I like this design because a user can either log in or sign up directly from the homepage and the radio buttons stand out and make the options clear to the user .
I love that the page dynamically updates to provide relevant help for the chosen form .
Also , the user can easily correct any errors without re-entering their email / password .
What do you think ?

Insurgents in Afghanistan are using heroin as a tactical weapon against US forces , hoping to emulate the drug problems that plagued US troops in Vietnam and Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s , says a new investigative report .
In a report at the Daily Beast , author Gerald Posner cites “ an internal US intelligence report ” that “ concluded [ insurgents ] are targeting American troops in an effort to undermine their effectiveness , while raising cash to pay for new recruits and weaponry . ”

The report brings up inevitable comparisons to the Vietnam War of the 1960s and 1970s and the Soviet war in Afghanistan that ended two decades ago .
It also raises the possibility that the conflict in Afghanistan will spill over into the streets of America as returning troops bring their addictions home with them .
Posner told MSNBC ’s Dylan Ratigan on Tuesday that drug addiction played a major role in the military failure of those two wars .
“ In Vietnam we ended up with a nearly 20 percent addiction rate to China White , ” Posner said .
( A 1971 report on drug addiction among US soldiers in Vietnam pegged the number closer to 15 percent . )
“ Soviet soldiers came back from Afghanistan with addictions , ” Posner continued , noting that Russia is now the world ’s largest per-capita user of heroin “ as a result of those returning Soviet fighters . ”
Posner said the Army and the Veterans Administration are “ preparing in their hospitals for what might be a deluge ” of addicted soldiers coming home from Afghanistan .

“ Today ’s Taliban are yesterday ’s mujaheddin , who fought the Soviets , ” Posner said on MSNBC ’s Morning Meeting .
“ They understand that this is an additional weapon . ”
The Daily Beast article states :
This heroin bomb then does collateral damage back home .
The returning soldiers brought home a heroin problem to Russian cities that grew exponentially during the past two decades .
This past March , Russia ’s anti-narcotics bureau announced that the country had become the planet ’s “ No. 1 heroin consumer . ”
Today ’s Taliban - fighting Americans were yesterday ’s mujahideen - fighting Soviets .
They saw how heroin helped disable a foreign fighting force more than 20 years ago .
And that lesson is n’t lost on them .
Former CIA special agent Jack Rice , who also appeared on MSNBC with Posner , said the fact that insurgents are taking military salaries from soldiers and using that money to fight the United States clearly illustrates the dilemma President Barack Obama faces as he mulls granting a request from top soldiers in Afghanistan to add ground troops to the US mission there .

“ Think of this as your biggest problem :
We have the Taliban , which are very good administrators — they ’re just drug dealers — on one side , versus the Afghan government , which are horrible administrators , and in many ways also drug dealers , ” Rice said .
“ That ’s where President Obama is right now , dead center of that point . ”
Rice described the situation as a “ disaster . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Posner also said on Morning Meeting that insurgents have developed the ability to produce smokeable heroin in their labs , making it easier for the drug to spread through society .
Ratigan noted that 90 percent of the world ’s heroin is produced in Afghanistan .
Posner is probably best known for his 1993 book Case Closed , which argued that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman who shot President John F. Kennedy .
The book proved a popular counterpoint at the time to Oliver Stone ’s movie JFK , which argued in favor of a broad conspiracy .

But the book has been severely criticized by many JFK assassination researchers , including some who agree that Oswald acted alone .
Gary Mack , curator of the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas , described Case Closed as a “ blatantly biased attempt to prove the unprovable . ”

Whilst working at the public relations department of Levi Strauss , a Mr. Art Roth received the following letter from Cary Grant in 1958 .
In it , Grant thanks Roth for the shirts delivered to his home and then politely makes it known that the designs are far too offbeat for his conservative tastes .
A great letter , brought to my attention by Lawrence Levi .

CARY GRANT
BEVERLEY HILLS , CALIFORNIA June 6 , 1958 Dear Art Roth :
It ’s about time you were thanked for those four Western shirts that greeted my return from another recent trip to Europe : if they had not been buried under the usual mess of accumulated trivia that demanded immediate attention , your kindness would have been acknowledged days ago .
Still , I am once again grateful to you , as you must know .
The shirts are , for a conservative such as myself , rather , rather …. if you dig me …. and I ’m not at all sure if I can swagger out in gold - threaded finery .
I shall await a braver mood .
My temerity is at a low ebb today , but I venture to ask that you let me know if Levi Strauss ever evolve a line of absolutely plain un-checked , un-metal - threaded , absolutely solid - colored shirts … no matter what the colors : I will rush to the nearest shop .
You have my happy and grateful thought , Art Roth ; when are you and I going to meet ?
( Signed ) Cary Grant .
Reading a book by Franz Kafka –– or watching a film by director David Lynch –– could make you smarter .
According to research by psychologists at UC Santa Barbara and the University of British Columbia , exposure to the surrealism in , say , Kafka 's " The Country Doctor " or Lynch 's " Blue Velvet " enhances the cognitive mechanisms that oversee implicit learning functions .
The researchers ' findings appear in an article published in the September issue of the journal Psychological Science .
" The idea is that when you 're exposed to a meaning threat –– something that fundamentally does not make sense –– your brain is going to respond by looking for some other kind of structure within your environment , " said Travis Proulx , a postdoctoral researcher at UCSB and co-author of the article .
" And , it turns out , that structure can be completely unrelated to the meaning threat . "
Meaning , according to Proulx , is an expected association within one 's environment .
Fire , for example , is associated with extreme heat , and putting your hand in a flame and finding it icy cold would constitute a threat to that meaning .
" It would be very disturbing to you because it would n't make sense , " he said .
As part of their research , Proulx and Steven J. Heine , a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and the article 's second co-author , asked a group of subjects to read an abridged and slightly edited version of Kafka 's " The Country Doctor , " which involves a nonsensical –– and in some ways disturbing –– series of events .
A second group read a different version of the same short story , one that had been rewritten so that the plot and literary elements made sense .
The subjects were then asked to complete an artificial - grammar learning task in which they were exposed to hidden patterns in letter strings .
They were asked to copy the individual letter strings and then to put a mark next to those that followed a similar pattern .
" People who read the nonsensical story checked off more letter strings –– clearly they were motivated to find structure , " said Proulx .
" But what 's more important is that they were actually more accurate than those who read the more normal version of the story .
They really did learn the pattern better than the other participants did . "
In a second study , the same results were evident among people who were led to feel alienated about themselves as they considered how their past actions were often contradictory .
" You get the same pattern of effects whether you 're reading Kafka or experiencing a breakdown in your sense of identity , " Proulx explained .
" People feel uncomfortable when their expected associations are violated , and that creates an unconscious desire to make sense of their surroundings .
That feeling of discomfort may come from a surreal story , or from contemplating their own contradictory behaviors , but either way , people want to get rid of it .
So they 're motivated to learn new patterns . "
Thus far , the researchers have identified the beneficial effects of unusual experiences only in implicit pattern learning .
It remains to be seen whether or not reading surreal literature would aid in the learning of studied material as well .
" It 's important to note that sitting down with a Kafka story before exam time probably would n't boost your performance on a test , " said Proulx .
" What is critical here is that our participants were not expecting to encounter this bizarre story , " he continued .
" If you expect that you 'll encounter something strange or out of the ordinary , you wo n't experience the same sense of alienation .
You may be disturbed by it , but you wo n't show the same learning ability .
The key to our study is that our participants were surprised by the series of unexpected events , and they had no way to make sense of them .
Hence , they strived to make sense of something else . "
In an ominous , one sentence disclosure just filed in Southern District Court of New York , the SEC has advised that it will demand a trial by jury for " all issues so triable . "
It appears the common man will finally have his say .
Woe to ex-CEO Ken Lewis .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Carrie Prejean has filed a lawsuit against Miss California USA officials who stripped her of her title , accusing them of libel and religious discrimination for her views on same - sex marriage .
Carrie Prejean was stripped of her Miss California USA title earlier this year .
" We will make the case that her title was taken from her solely because of her support of traditional marriage , " her attorney , Charles LiMandri , said in a news release .
Prejean stepped into controversy at the Miss USA pageant in April when , in response to a question from a judge , she declared her opposition to same - sex marriage .
Prejean finished as first runner - up .
The complaint was filed in Superior Court of California against Miss California USA officials Keith Lewis and Shanna Moakler , as well as publicist Roger Neal .
It alleges that Prejean suffered because of " libel , public disclosure of private facts , religious discrimination , intentional infliction of emotional distress , and negligent infliction of emotional distress . "
LiMandri had threatened to file a defamation lawsuit if Lewis did not retract statements he made about the former beauty queen .
LiMandri's letter to Lewis ' attorney also accused Lewis of setting Prejean up to be fired because of her statements opposing same - sex marriage .
When Prejean , 22 , was dethroned in June , Lewis said it was for " contract violations , " including missed public appearances .
He said then it was n't one thing Prejean did , but " many , many , many things . "
" She came to us and said I 'm not interested in your input ; I 'll make my own decision what I 'm going to do , " Lewis told CNN 's Larry King in June .
" You know , when you have a contract , when you 're working for someone , you have a responsibility to follow through on what that requirement is . "
Lewis said it was clear " she was not interesting in upholding the title or the responsibilities . "
After that interview , LiMandri penned a letter to Lewis ' attorney saying , " Carrie Prejean 's good name has been tarnished by your client 's false and defamatory accusations . "
" Please view this letter as a last opportunity for Mr. Lewis to retract the defamatory statements made against my client and to seek to restore her good name , " LiMandri wrote .
He denied any contract violations by Prejean , calling those claims a " complete and utter pretext " for her firing .
The list Lewis gave to reporters of Prejean 's missed appearances was " an outright fraud , " he said .
" She did not think it was appropriate for her to accept Mr. Lewis ' invitation to attend a gay documentary in Hollywood promoting same - sex marriage , " he said .
" It was not my client 's job , as Miss California , simply to help your client promote his personal or business interests as a Hollywood agent and producer , or gay activist . "
Miss USA pageant owner Donald Trump announced in May that Prejean could keep her title despite a controversy over topless photos , missed appearances and her statements against same - sex marriage .
Trump later reversed himself .
" I told Carrie she needed to get back to work and honor her contract with the Miss California USA organization , and I gave her the opportunity to do so , " Trump said .
" Unfortunately , it just does n't look like it is going to happen , and I offered Keith my full support in making this decision . "

I do n’t have a degree in science or medicine .
I am not a nutritionist .
I left school at 14 and I do recall I failed science that year .
I am here to prove that lemons alone can prevent and cure hundreds of ailments and serious diseases .
I am a self - professed lemonlogist .
I believe that lemons are THE superfood that can negate our requirement and reliance on billions of dollars in prescription drugs .
I am asking for the public ’s help to research lemons in the first global study into the healing properties of lemons .
What ailments and symptoms do you have ?
What illnesses can lemons cure for you ?
These are the answers I want to know .
I get 99 % relief from severe hay fever with one quarter fresh lemon squeezed into tap water .
The more lemon bits and pips the better .
Drink immediately and half an hour later , my symptoms are gone .
So is it just me ?
Or is there something to this ?
This got me thinking …
If lemons reverse the effects of hay fever , can lemons also reverse the effects of other allergies ( such as to cat and dog hair ) and auto - immunity illnesses such as asthma , psoriasis , neuralgia , eczema , cancer and ageing ?
The internet seems to indicate yes .
It also seems to reverse the effects of high blood pressure , heart disease and a host of other minor and serious illnesses .
How is this ?
Because when consumed , acidic lemons turn alkaline in your body .
Weird but true .
There is much disinformation about this oddity on the internet , however it is about what effect the food has on the body once consumed rather than it ’s acidity or alkalinity in its natural state .
Lemons , while containing citric acid have a very high content of the strongly alkaline minerals potassium , magnesium and sodium .
These minerals have a very alkalizing effect on the body .
Even though lemon juice is acidic , once it is processed by your body the “ ash ” is alkaline , which is what you want if you want health .
Illness does not thrive in bodies that are alkaline .
The more acidic your blood , the more prone you are to sickness and disease .
Alkaline foods REVERSE the effects of illness .
Check our links page for many studies and statements attesting to this fact – I ’ll be uploading many of these links shortly .
If you suffer from any illness , please participate in this public experiment and let us know what lemons ( i.e. alkalising your diet ) did or did n’t do for you .
In the instance of my hay fever , I was ready to try anything .
Lemons are readily available and inexpensive and you ’ve got nothing to lose .
What to do if you want to participate ?
Begin by taking notes of your illness and symptoms .
Each single day , cut at least one lemon into quarters .
Fill a glass with room - temperature water ( simple tap water will do ) and squeeze the quarter of the lemon into the glass of water .
The more lemon pips and pulp , the better .
Drink it .
Use the remaining quarters of cut lemons the same way , within the hour .
In half an hour to forty minutes after ingesting your first lemon quarter , document the reaction .
Are your symptoms gone ?
Are they reduced ?
Do you feel any better ?
Incorporate additional questions after a few days such as , Is infection reduced ?
Are your eyes clearer ?
And any other relevant questions .
After a period of time , please share your results on our IT WORKED page or IT FAILED .
Do n’t add honey and make sure the water is room temperature rather than refrigerated .
Note : in my experience , drinking lemon water will also prevent hay fever symptoms , not just relieve them .
The symptoms of hayfever and allergies , etc , should be relieved quite quickly .
With more serious symptoms or diseases , the lemons may take longer to repair and remedy , but the difference should begin to be felt as soon as you begin the lemon water treatment .
To me it feels like disinfecting the free - radicals from the inside .
Test out these simple suggestions and document the results here on this website for public dissemination .
Did you know that most prescription drugs are acidic , causing in turn more illness ( read : more business for the drug companies ) .
Did you know around 50 % of Americans are on prescription medication ?
If we tapped into the healing power of the lemon , it would be a win for the people and a big F YOU for the drug companies .
Stay tuned for results and please participate !
WASHINGTON  Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. on Wednesday defended his decision to prosecute five men accused as co-conspirators in the Sept. 11 attacks in federal court in Manhattan , declaring that while he believes “ we are at war , ” that the venue was the best place to pursue the case against them .
Despite criticism that holding such a trial presented greater risks than a military commission , Mr. Holder argued that there were fewer differences between the rules for federal court and the military panels than some critics realize .
And , he argued , the Southern District of New York has a long history of successfully prosecuting terrorism suspects .
“ We need not cower in the face of this enemy , ” Mr. Holder said , testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
“ Our institutions are strong , our infrastructure is ready , our resolve is firm , and our people are ready . ”
But Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the ranking Republican , objected to characterization of opposition as cowardice .
He argued that there were strong reasons to prosecute the accused , including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the self - described mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks , before a military court .
The film has already created a buzz throughout the United States

Over the past 70 years , Disney has given the world eight princesses .
Snow
White was the first - and this week , Disney 's latest film , The Princess And The Frog , opens in New York and Los Angeles , bringing us the ninth .
But this princess is different from those who went before .
Her name is Tiana and , for the first time in Disney 's history of animation , she is African - American .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service
The voice of Tiana is provided by Tony Award - winning singer and actress Anika Nonie Rose , who says that this new princess will have a big impact on children .
" It 's a really wonderful thing for children to be able to look at this princess and say , 'it looks just like my friend - she 's a princess too , ' " she says .
" It 's a long time coming but I 'm glad it 's here . "
The bottom line Bonnie Greer , the African - American writer and broadcaster , says that while this is an important symbolic step for Disney , it also has commercial motivations .
" Since Disney is always looking at the bottom line , they figured it 's about time , " she told the BBC World Service .
" It 's probably a combination of our new president , a feeling that change has swept the land and thinking about how they can get involved in this change .
Anika Nonie Rose says Tiana is intelligent and independent " Also there is a huge market for this type of film . "
Disney points out that films take many years to make and says the initial work on Princess And The Frog predates worldwide awareness of the then - Senator Barack Obama .
Princess Tiana is the heroine and , like her predecessors , she has to learn a few of life 's hard lessons before she can fulfil her dreams .
Born to a seamstress , Tiana is gifted with great cooking ability and dreams of owning her own restaurant .
Her story is set in New Orleans and celebrates Mardi Gras with a series of larger - than - life images - from a jazz - loving alligator to a voodoo villain .
Talk show host Oprah Winfrey even has a cameo as Tiana 's mother , Eudora .
Studio fears
But finalising the film 's tone , plot and characters has not been a simple process , says Disney .
The company says it consulted a wide range of prominent black individuals and organisations to make sure it did not offend audiences .
The consultations resulted in a change in film title and a new name for the heroine from Maddy - which some criticised as sounding similar to Mammy , with echoes of the Deep South - to Tiana .
Even before the film 's release , blogs and chat forums have been full of discussions about the film , not all of them positive .
Disney should be ashamed .
This princess story is set in New Orleans , the setting of one of the most devastating tragedies to beset a black community
William Blackburn , Columnist
On one site , someone complains that the prince 's skin is too light .
Others , such as William Blackburn , writing in the Charlotte Observer in North Carolina , criticised the setting .
" Disney should be ashamed , " he says .
" This princess story is set in New Orleans , the setting of one of the most devastating tragedies to beset a black community . "
But after having seen the film , many within America 's black community have praised it .
Leading members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People gave the film a standing ovation after seeing the film at a screening in Los Angeles last week .
Whether or not people take offence to the film , the Disney machine has already generated huge amounts of publicity .
Scott Mendelson , a film critic based in California , says this will be crucial in helping the film in the crowded pre-Christmas market .
" For better or worse this will be a film that people are going to be talking about .
" This is especially important for a film during the brutal holiday season .
Any publicity is good publicity . "
In fact , the film is also notable for rekindling the art of hand - drawn animation and hand - painted backgrounds , dropping the more contemporary reliance on computer generated imagery .
But this aspect of the movie is inevitably receiving fewer column inches .
Whatever the debate surrounding the film , for Bonnie Greer , it still sends out an important message .
" When you are a child , what you are shown does affect you and I can remember when I was growing up not wanting to play with black dolls , " she says .
" It 's a great thing and hopefully it will make some little black girls smile as well as some little white girls . "
Now get ready for Princess Tiana dolls , costumes and cards coming to shops near you .

please use your nuclear arsenal responsibly
Nuclear weapons are the most terrifying devices humanity ever invented .
And back in the day , the military explored using psychics to figure out where to aim them .
In ancient times , generals used to solicit magicians and soothsayers who would try their best to predict how a major battle will go and used fresh sheep livers or astrological manuals as a form of military intelligence .
But today , with satellites , a global computer system filled with all sorts of strategic information for those who know where to look , and unmanned drones that scour remote terrain in impressive detail , modern warfare has little use for people who think they have otherworldly powers .
That ’s a good thing since today ’s militaries have lots of really scary weapons which should really be aimed based on something more than a psychic ’s hunch .
And yet , oddly enough , that ’s exactly what the U.S. military thought of doing when it launched a remote viewing study codenamed Project Stargate .
Obviously , the generator that comes up with names for secret projects hit one of the really cool names in the system and if you were superstitious , you might just think it was a sign of great things to come .
Unfortunately for the psychics involved in the series of studies that spanned longer than two decades , it ended up as one of the many anecdotes about runaway government spending and fueled the countless gags about how military intelligence was an oxymoron .
I mean really , are we going to trust people who make a living pretending to talk to the dead , make up stories about being visited by angels and playing a set of elaborate guessing games in front of friendly and naive audiences , with guiding where the apocalyptic hail of missiles armed with multi-megaton warheards with hit in case of nuclear war ?
Still , we have to be fair and note that out of the trillions of dollars the military used during all that time , only $ 20 million were actually used to investigate whether you could get psychics to do something useful .
Well , if your definition of useful is getting the drop on an enemy base half a world away .
And it does seem like a good idea if we think about it .
After all , if psychics have a real supernatural abilities and give you the information you need to cripple an enemy nation with a single , well choreographed attack , is n’t it worth to confirm the concept ?
This is precisely what Project Stargate was supposed to do .
It provided protocols for verifying whether there ’s really such a thing as remote viewing or supernatural intelligence gathering , and sought to put the psychics through their paces in an objective , empirical way .
The result ?
Two decades worth of studies proving that psychics are utterly unable to provide any kind of useful , actionable information .
Yes , it ’s true that the best performing subjects could make predictions that were judged to be better than they would be expected if they randomly guessed .
However , when they were asked for specifics of what they saw and how they saw it , even the best remote viewers were so generic and vague in their descriptions , it quickly became very obvious that they did so well because they avoided all the details .
And details is what the military needs to carry out a strike .
For example , saying that Osama bin Laden is hiding in a string of remote villages along the Afghanistan / Pakistan border does n’t do any good .
Pointing to an exact house where he will be when the armed forces can get there because the supernatural spirits of fortune told you so and you ’ve been shown to make extremely detailed , accurate predictions ?
That would prove that psychics could actually do something more useful than playing guessing games and perfecting that constipated look they pass off as talking to the various spirits from the great beyond .
The Bible And Christianity - The Historical Origins A rational , secular , historical perspective on the history of Christianity and its scripture An essay by Scott Bidstrup " If the truth is that ugly -- which it is -- then we do have to be careful about the way that we tell the truth .
But to somehow say that telling the truth should be avoided because people may respond badly to the truth seems bizarre to me . "
-- Chuck Skoro , Deacon , St. Paul's Catholic Church
T he Bible is a lot of things to a lot of people , but to Christians , especially , it is a source of inspiration and a guide to daily living .
To others , the Bible is a historical document and a source of controversy .
To others still , the Bible is a self - contradictory mish - mash of arcane rules and proscriptions , mostly relevant to long - dead cultures in far away places .
What is the truth in all of this ?
The reality is that it is all true to an extent , and equally nonsensical at the same time .
The Bible has meaning to all its readers , but it is important to consider that the meaning it has is informed by the prejudices the reader brings to it .
To really understand the Bible and what it intends to say to present generations , it is necessary to understand who wrote it and why , and the cultural context in which it was written .
The story is an interesting one , in no small part because the story is so much messier than most of its advocates would have you to believe .
And its very messiness is why it is a story rarely told in any completeness to Christian audiences .
The overriding theme of the Bible storylines is the theme of cultural conquest .
Conquest by the Hebrews over their enemy neighbors , culturally by the Jews over the Israelites ( used here to mean members of the ten " lost " tribes ) , the Christians over the Jews , the Catholics over the Gnostics , Marcionites , and other pre-Catholic factions , and on and on .
In some cases , the conquest is recorded as a historical , often military event .
In others , it merely is recorded as a change in content and context , an alteration of the storyline and outlook and worldview .
And the story of the editing and translation of the final form of the Bible into what today is regarded as holy scripture is a story not just of cultural conquest , but of political intrigues , and not just between competing bishops , but with secular political authority itself .
It is as if the U.S. congress or president were to decide what constituted Christian doctrine and scripture , and everyone went along - at the peril of their lives - until no one even questioned the accuracy of the official viewpoint .
The effect of its origins as selected parts of whole bodies of scripture , written by at least a hundred and fifty different people in dozens of different places at different times , many centuries apart , and for different reasons , colors what its authors wrote .
Yet that simple fact is widely ignored , both by people who naively follow what they read in it as the inerrant word of God , and by more liberal scholastic theologians , who seek to understand its historical context as well as a body of doctrinal scripture , which they often blindly follow , even though they know full well its messy origins .
Origins of the Earliest Scripture Prehistory to 1850 B.C.E .
This book is an excellent survey of the current state of Old Testament archaeology .
It will be of considerable interest to both skeptic and apologist alike !

The Bible Unearthed : Archaeology 's New Vision of Ancient Israel and The Origin of Its Sacred Texts by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman , published 2001 .
This book was a best - seller on the New York Times best seller list and for good reason : it traces the fascinating origins of the Christian , Judaic and Islamic god back to its Canaanite and Mesopotamian roots .
Good read !
Get it here !
A History of God : The 4,000 Year Quest of Judaism , Christianity and Islam by Karen Armstrong , published 1994 .
Scholars have traced the roots of many of the Old Testament stories to the ancient , pagan myths of the ancient Mesopotamian cultures .
In the Fertile Crescent , the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers , in present - day Iraq , gave birth to some of the worlds first civilizations .
In this early flowering of civilization , many religious myths abounded , seeking to explain what was then unexplainable .
From this context comes the oldest complete literary work we have , the age of which we are certain , dating back at least 7,000 years .
The Epic of Gilgamesh is a lengthy narrative of heroic mythology that incorporates many of the religious myths of Mesopotamia , and it is the earliest complete literary work that has survived .
Many of the stories in that epic were eventually incorporated into the book of Genesis .
Borrowed from the Epic of Gilgamesh are stories of the creation of man in a wondrous garden , the introduction of evil into a naive world , and the story of a great flood brought on by the wickedness of man , that flooded the whole world .
In this Mesopotamian basin civilization , known to us today as the Chaldean Empire , tribal alliances that predated the amalgamation into a single empire , continued to exist and flourish .
Many were allied to the palace , many opposed , all retained elements of their pre-conquest cultures .
The patriarchs first appear in our story with the journey of one of them , Abraham , who , the story tells us , led members of his tribe from the city of Ur , west towards the Mediterranean , to the " promised land " of Canaan , sometime between the 19th and 18th centuries B.C.E .
Or so the story goes .
The problem is that we do n't really have any good archeaological evidence to support the Abraham story , and there is much archaeological evidence to contradict it .
The land where Abraham supposedly settled , the southern highlands of Palestine ( from Jerusalem south the the Valley of Beersheba ) is very sparse in archaeological evidence from this period .
It is clear from the archaeological record that its population was extremely sparse - no more than a few hundred people in the entire region , and the sole occupants of the area during this time were nomadic pastoralists , much like the Bedouin of the region today .
We know from clear archaeological evidence that the peoples known as the Phillistines never even entered the region until the 12th century B.C.E. , and the " city of Gerar " in which Isaac , the son of Abraham , had his encounter with Abimelech , the " king of the Phillistines " ( in Genesis 26:1 ) was in fact a tiny , insignificant rural village up until the 8th century B.C.E .
It could n't have been the capital of the regional king of a people who did n't yet exist !
This is n't the only problem with the account of the Age of the Patriarchs , either .
There 's the problem of the camels .
We know from archaeological evidence that camels were n't domesticated until about the late second millenium B.C.E. , and that they were n't widely used as beasts of burden until about 1000 B.C.E. - long after the Age of the Patriarchs .
And then there 's the problem of the cargo carried by the camels - " gum , balm and myrrh , " which were products of Arabia - and trade with Arabia did n't begin until the era of Assyrian hegemony in the region , beginning in the 8th century B.C.E .
Yet another problem is Jacob 's marriage with Leah and Rachel , and his relationship with his uncle , Laban , all of whom are described as being Arameans .
This ethnic group does not appear in the archeological record prior to 1100 B.C.E. , and not a significant group until the 9th century B.C.E .
Yet influences from the east must have been , because we have evidence of worship of their gods and goddesses .
The heiarchy of gods and goddesses who included Baal , the god of storms , who made the land fertile , and Lotan , the seven - headed dragon , known to Old Testament readers as Leviathan .
There is Yam Nahar , the god of the seas and rivers , and other pantheons and heiarchies of gods and goddesses .
1
Reigning over them all was El , the king of the gods , ruler of the pantheon .
Remember the name , we 'll encounter it again .
Prior to the Babylonian exile , we know that the Israelites followed a wide variety of cults , most of which were polytheistic , and the cult of Yahweh was a relatively minor cult among the Israelites during this period that has been greatly revised over time .

We know , for example , that the narrative of the Yahweh included a wife .
Her name was Asherah , though in related cults she had different names , including Astarte and Istar .
She was a powerful , important , even indispensible part of the cult , mostly related to fertility .
We know that she figured prominently throughout the pre-Roman period , as she appears frequently in inscriptions and on figurines prior to the Assyrian expulsion and to a lesser extent afterwards .
She remained a major figure in the Old Testament narratives , though as time went on , she was gradually edited out by subsequent copyists and editors , disappearing almost completely from the Old Testament narrative by about the 8th Century , though traces of this cult figure remain even today in the Old Testament .
10 The Problem of the Exodus Story and the First Great Revision of Judaism about 1200 B.C.E .
The fact is that with all that is known of Egyptian history from this time ( since scholars can now read the records the ancient Egyptians with the ease of a modern newspaper ) , and the fact that the history of Egypt in this period is well documented , there is no evidence from the records of Egypt itself that the events of Exodus ever occured , either archaeologically or documentarily in the manner in which the Bible describes the events .
The reality is that if a series of plagues had been visited upon Egypt , thousands of slaves escaped in a mass runaway , and the army of the Pharaoh were swallowed up by the Red Sea , such events would doubtless have made it into the Egyptian documentary record .
But the reality is that there is n't a single word describing any such events .
Instead , what we do have from Egyptian sources is a remarkably different story of the Exodus .
From about the beginning of the second millenium B.C.E. , through about 1200 B.C.E. , Egypt ruled the region known today as Palestine .
How do we know this ?
We know it not only from Egyptian records themselves , which talk about tribute taken from the various towns and cities in Canaan , but from archaeological evidence within the region itself , which shows a number of settlements which were clearly Egyptian military outposts .
During this time , the region which was to become the land of Israel , occupying the northern highlands between the coastal plain and the valley of the Jordan river , was sparsely populated and densly forested with stands of oak and terebinth trees .
This land was populated by one of two groups ( we 're not sure which ) , either the Apiru or Shoshu peoples .
The former were known to have originated as intinerant nomads , largely on the fringes of lowland society , who may have taken refuge in the highlands , or the Shosu , a more cohesive , well - defined group .
The linguistic association of Apiru ( sometimes Habiru ) with the word , " Hebrew " had long , in the minds of scholars , been considered good evidence that this was the group that gave rise to the Hebrews , but we now know that the association was n't quite that simple .
The name may have been from that source , but the people probably were n't .
In any event , the highlands of northern Palestine which was home to the Kingdom of Israel has a highly variable climate .
Agricultural productivity , and the ability of people to sustain trade with the lowlands , was subject to varying climatic conditions , meaning that famine was a frequent occurence .
When crops failed and trade could not be sustained , it was not uncommon for people to flee the region and head for refuge where crops were dependable .
The nearest such place was the Nile delta in Egypt .
So many of the " Hebrews " ( culturally indistinct from the Canaanites at this time ) , who were citizens of Egypt , fled to the Nile delta .
Time and again .
Every time there was a famine in Judah , Israel or Canaan , refugees headed for Egypt .
The event was so common , and the refugees so numerous , that they eventually became a substantial minority group , influential in Egypt , where they were known as the Hyksos , as is now very clear from the archaeological record .
The story of the expulsion of the Hyksos is easily the closest parallel we have from either the Egyptian record or the archaeological record to the story of the Exodus as recorded in the Bible .
There are problems , though .
Besides the Exodus story line , the biggest problem is the dates : the Bible places the Exodus at about 1200 B.C.E. , yet the story of the Hyksos culminates in 1570 B.C.E .
It is quite likely that the story of the Hyksos is the story that eventually , through generations of revisionistic retelling , became the myth of the Exodus -- another example of history being rewritten to flatter the storytellers rather than to record the unvarnished truth .
Anyway , the Hyksos grew in influence until they eventually took control of Egypt , which they ruled , with considerable cruelty and tyrrany during the Fifteenth Dynasty , beginning in 1670 B.C.E .
The Egyptians had finally had enough , though , and rebelled against the rule of the Hyksos and drove them out a century later in 1570 B.C.E .
They were n't just driven out , either ; the Egyptians pushed them back into Canaan with considerable force , driving them all the way to the Syrian frontier , sacking and burning Canaanite cities along the way .
Sometime later , the Hyksos capital in Egypt , Avaris , in the eastern Nile delta , was razed to the ground by the Pharoah Ahmose , who chased the last remnants of the Hyksos back into Canaan and even laid siege to Sharuhen , the main Canaanite citadel , destroying it and ending Canaanite influence there .
At least one historian claims ( a millenium after the fact ) that the Hyksos refugees settled in Jerusalem and built a temple there , but the archaeological record does not support the claim of either a temple or large numbers of refugees in Jerusalem from this period .
It is quite clear from the archaeological record , as well , that there never was a " wandering in the desert for 40 years , " either .
Extensive archaeological surveys of the Sanai desert have never shown any encampments dating from the time of the Exodus , either before , during or after the time of the Ramsean pharoahs .
At least two sites mentioned in the exodus story have been positively identified and carefully and extensively excavated , but no evidence of late bronze - age occupation or encampment has been found at either site .
Additionally , the Sanai Desert was literally dotted with Egyptian military outposts , and nowhere in the Sanai could the Hebrews have been more than a day 's travel from one of them .
It is inconceivable that they could have remained undetected in the Sanai for forty years .
The story of the Exodus is clearly mythmaking designed to portray a possible forced expulsion of oppressors as an escape of victims .
By the 12th century B.C.E. , the Hebrews assumed an identity unique enough in the archaeological record to become discernible for the first time .
In the mountains and plateaus of the northern highlands of Canaan , from Jerusalem north to the Jezreel Valley , the highland settlements , poor for their day , begin to show a single distinguishing feature from other , similar highland settlements in regions around them .
There is little to go on - pottery shows an impoverished lifestyle , with little decoration and use other than as storage and cooking vessels .
Yet one thing is clear - the bones of pigs become absent from the archaeological record .
The prohibition on eating pork is therefore the oldest archaeologically supported feature of Jewish culture .
It is representative of the beginnings of the transformation of the god " El " into " El- ohim , " the god of gods , the god of Israel .
We now know this Mesopotamian god as " El- ohim , " and our author " E , " one of the earliest scriptorialists writing about this time , first has El introducing himself to Abraham as " El Shaddai " ( El of the Mountain ) .
He also appears as El Elyon , or El of Bethel in other , non-canonized scripture , and his name is also preserved in such Hebrew names as Isra - El and Ishma - El .
The word Elohim was originally a plural of El.2
To the south , from Bethel to the Valley of Beersheba , a similar transformation is taking place .
In this climatically and geologically harsher place , a place with a much smaller and less settled population with greater geographical isolation , the Canaanite god Yahweh is being transformed by a culturally similar people of the land of Judah .
The unknown author known to scholars simply as " J " has his god being familiar with and comfortable with Abraham , and he casually appears to Abraham in Genesis 18 , introducing himself as Yahweh .
But " J's " contemporary , author " E " in the north can't have God being so casual , and first appears as a voice , commanding Abraham to leave his people in Mesopotamia and settle in Canaan .3
Yahweh , in his transformation from a pagan Canaanite god to the god of the Jews , becomes a cruel and vindictive god in the hands of author " J. "
He commands Abraham to sacrifice his first born son , an act which is not at all surprising given the nature of the pagan religions of the time .
Many of these pagan religions ( and remember that Yahweh got his start as a Canannite pagan god ) considered the first - born to be the seed of a god .
Because of this , they were often sacrificed to the god who presumably sired them .
Yet Elohim in the north continues to be a much more subtle god , who directs the affairs of men by revelation of the voice , hidden from the view of mere mortals .
There is a tension among these peoples , both of whom identify themselves as culturally decendants of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .
One people , perhaps , but two gods .
The people of the north , with a much more favorable geography and climate , eventually prosper and establish trading links with their neighbors .
Their wealth eventually comes to greatly exceed that of the south - to the extent that they become a nation in their own right - the nation of Israel .
Israel prospers to the extent that it becomes a significant trading nation - greatly eclipsing its poorer neighbor , Judah .
The archaeological record clearly shows Israel to be a major regional power , one that certainly attracted the interest of its neighbors .
By now , the Egyptian hegemony in the region has faded , and the geopolitical vacuum was filled by Assyria .
The Assyrians eventually assumed control of the region , with two provincial areas , Israel in the north , and Judah in the south .
Israel , vastly more prosperous and populous than Judah , had its capital at various times in Megiddo , Samaria and Seschem , and Judah had its capital at Bethel , on it 's northern frontier , or sometimes at Hebron in the south .
Jerusalem , up until this time , was a tiny agricultural village of insignificance , and , until the Assyrian deportations , was certainly not a cultural center .
By the end of the eighth century , B.C.E. , a Hebrew alphabet appears , and literacy rapidly spreads among the wealthier Hebrews .
Finally , after centuries of oral tradition , writing becomes widespread for the first time , and culturally changes everything .
The myths are written down and compared .
And the two gods come into open conflict with each other .
Widespread literacy and the geopolitical events of the day , changed everything .
Israelite rebellion against the Assyrians brought repression in the north , and with it , waves of refugees into the south .
With the arrival of waves of refugees , Jerusalem is quickly transformed from a tiny agricultural village of no particular significance into a major town , with a religious influence of its own .
The arriving Israelites with their gods with El at the helm , and the Judeans , with their single god Yahweh , are now forced to reconcile their religious differences .
It is also from this era that the myths of the Old Testament become frozen in the form in which they have come down to us - the story of Abraham and his family travelling and trading Arabian goods with the use of camels , the myth of Exodus transformed as it was from the story of the expulsion of the Hyksos , the stories of the conquest of Canaan with David slaying Goliath , which was really a story based on the forced resettlement by the Egyptian authorities , of Solomon 's great wealth and his great temple at Jerusalem ; all were myths substantially altered from the facts as they originally occured .
But writing them down now froze those myths , and it is from this time they came to us unaltered for the most part .
For the first time , the Biblical record begins to correspond with the archaeological record .
The Deuteronomist and the Second Great Revision , With the Rise of the Temple State and the Third Great Revision 742-600 B.C.E .
It is at least a century after the first books of the Pentatuch was written that the gods of the Old Testament are harmonized into a singular being , this having been done by the third major writer of the Old Testament books , a writer ( or more probably group of writers ) called by scholars , " D " the Deuteronomist .
If we are going to have a monotheistic religion here , we can't go around having two competing gods , so something must be done .
The tribes of Israel and Judah had a choice to make , and Joshua warned them that Yahweh was a jealous god .
Which god would it be ?
In essence , there was no difficulty making a choice .
Yahweh was the more powerful , having demonstrated his power by intervening on their behalf in Egypt , and in the desert at Sinai .
The choice was easy .
It was Yahweh .
So the second great revision of Judaic religion has happened .
In the original Pentatuch , written in the 8th century B.C.E. , there is n't a clearly monotheistic statement to be found , but by the time of the writings of the Deuteronomist , a century or so later , the Deuteronomist has Joshua threatening the Israelites and making sure they became monotheistic under threat of being destroyed .
The Deuteronomist pulls off this neat harmonization of two competing gods by having the Israelites reminded that their fathers had promised Yahweh that he would be their god , and so they made him their elohim , their high God .
So now , Elohim , who originally was the king of the gods of Fertile Crescent , is now Yahweh , the god of Israel .
If you have two conflicting gods , its a neat trick to just get rid of the conflict by declaring they 're the same being .
4
A god has to have a home , and the home of the god Yahweh was in heaven .
But his priests on earth had to have a place for the ritual sacrifices that were handed down as part of the ritual of the " El " pantheon , as well as the original pagan Canaanite god , Yahweh , which of course had been descended into the Hebraic monotheism .
This place was the temple , of course , whose construction was attributed to Solomon , a mythical king .
The reality is that it was built at least a century later than the period attributed to the rule of Solomon .
The whole story of Solomon , his father David and the events surrounding that dynasty were created during this era to explain the fading splendor of Jerusalem and provide a centering myth around which to rally the culture towards a monotheistic religion , under assault from the Assyrian culture that politically was hegemonous in the region .
In the year 742 B.C.E. , while the Deuteronomist writers were still busy getting rid of Elohim , a member of the Judean royal family had a vision .
In it , he saw Yahweh sitting on his throne , directly above the temple in Jerusalem .
In the vision , Isaiah is commanded to bring a new message to Israel .
Isaiah is filled with foreboding and with good reason ; King Tigleth Pilesar , who had recently ascended to the throne of Assyria had designs on Israel , and now the god of Israel had to take up the duties of defending the people of his covenant .
Isaiah was commissioned by his god to carry the message to Israel that he is the only god there is ; this comes as a great problem to the Israelites who see Isaiah 's concept of God as being the very god who had aided the Assyrians in their victories against them .
Isaiah is largely rejected with his message , and Yahweh becomes a pensive , introspective god , who invites his followers to enter into a dialogue with him .
Isaiah 's second innovation was the notion that the commandments of the god should be integrated into the very lives of those who follow him , and not just be restricted to temple observance and ritual .
Only by doing so would Yahweh be appeased and Israel saved .
This also did not have much resonance in the lives of the average Hebrew .
In punishment for disregarding the prophet 's message , Yahweh conveniently permits King Sargon II of Assyria to occupy the northern portion of Palestine and deport the population .
Suddenly , the warnings of Isaiah are taken a bit more seriously as the ten " lost " tribes of Israel are marched off into forced assimilation in Assyria and Palestine becomes the land of the Jews .
The reality of course , is that Sargon was punishing Israel for its insurrection and refusal to pay tribute .
Israel , with a wetter , more productive climate and much easier geography was much easier pickings than the dry , rocky , thinly populated and more distant Judah .
So it was only natural that Sargon would choose to occupy Israel rather than Judah .
Yet even as Sargon occupied Israel his own empire was beginning to crumble .
Assyrian power was fading , but Babylonian power was increasing .
In the south , to ensure that the people of Judah hear his message , Yahweh sends a succession of prophets to them .
They preach from the temple and ally themselves with the political power of the Jewish kings .
In so doing , the temple and the political process become allied in the fight against the military power of their neighbors .
There is no longer an Elohim cult , and the Israelites are long gone .
The Hebraic religion and culture becomes a Jewish one .
Amos and Jeremiah were the prophets of note from this period .
Jeremiah 's Failed Prophesy of Exile in Babylon and The Fourth Great Revision 586 B.C.E. to 538 B.C.E.
Jeremiah 's message was that God is dependent on man to carry out his wishes in the world , a view very much in contrast to the writers of Exodus , who had Yahweh being a powerful , independent and even capricious god .
And Jeremiah warns that only following the dictates of God would keep the newly ascendant Babylonians at bay .
But it was not enough .
He predicted that Babylon would conquer Palestine and the occupants of that land would spend 70 years in captivity by the rivers of Babylon .
Well , the captivity happened , but it did n't last 70 years .
We know from secular sources that it actually lasted from 586 to 538 B.C.E. , a period of only 48 years .
By 600 B.C.E. , the Babylonians were capturing bits of Palestine .
By 586 , Jerusalem itself was conquered and the temple destroyed .
But as conquests of the period went , it was not a bitter one , as only some of the Hebrews were taken into captivity and those who were , were not forced to assimilate .
Many were allowed to remain in Palestine .
Archaeological surveys indicate that at most , about 10 % of the population was forced into exile , most of them being the most economically and politically useful .
Among the first batch of deportees , in 597 B.C.E. was a young priest known as Ezekiel .
Ezekiel claimed to have had a great vision .
It was a typical Yahwehian affair , a great and horrible thing , in which was revealed a plan of action .
And in Ezekiel 's case , the plan of action was unique , indeed .
He first had to eat the word of God .
Yes , he was required to eat and swallow the scroll containing the word .
This was to make it a " part of " himself .
Then his wife died , and Ezekiel was forbidden to mourn .
Instead , he had to lie down on one side for 390 days and then on the other for 40 .
On another occasion , he was required to eat excrement .
For a period of five years , he spoke to no one .
Yahweh had not just become a violent and jealous god , he was also demanding and irrational at times .
No wonder Ezekiel complained about the burden of being a prophet .
It seems that Yahweh could not only allow his chosen people to be taken captive , he seemed to have made a circus performer out of his prophets .
The irrationality of all this was not lost on the Jews .
Exiled as many of them were in Babylon , it seemed that the whole world was topsy - turvy , and practice of their religion , based as it was in a destroyed temple , was impossible outside their homeland .
They resented their captivity and relished the thoughts of dashing out the brains of Babylonian babies .
But a new prophet preached tranquility .
Scholars know him as Second Isaiah , as his true name is lost to history , and his message was much like that of the first Isaiah .
Second Isaiah also preached that God was unknowable , hence the irrationality of trying to understand him as Ezekiel had gotten in trouble for .
Yet this newer incarnation of Yahweh was a more tranquil god , who transcended the pettiness of human politics , and declared himself to be the god that Egypt and Assyria would ultimately worship alongside Israel .
So Yahweh 's jurisdiction seems to be transformed once again , from the god of the Jews , then all of Israel , to the whole world , and now back to just Palestine , Egypt and Assyria .
The numerous writers of this period became known to scholars as the Priestly writers , or " P. "
They gave us the books of Numbers and Leviticus , and also gave their interpretations to the events described by " J " and " E , " including the account of the creation , taken from the Babylonian myth , Enuma Elish , a decendant from the Epic of Gilgamesh .
" P " subscribes to the Ezekielian vision that God is unknowable and unseeable ; it is from this revision that we now have Moses shielding himself from the sight of God by hiding behind a rock .
It is also from this period that we have the Levitical proscriptions , the cleanliness laws , which do not define sin , but instead define simply what is Hebraic as opposed to the hated paganism ( read : Babylonian ) religions ( it would only be the Christians centuries later who would assume the Levitical proscriptions to have been descriptions of sin ) .
All this new material was inserted into the Pentatuch about the time Cyrus conquered Babylon in 538 B.C.E. and allowed the Jews to return to Palestine .
5
The returning Jews wished to rebuild the temple and reestablish the kingdom it all its glory , but they had a problem .
Being still governed by foreigners , they were n't allowed a king .
They solved this problem by simply denying that a king was even necessary , instead heaping their veneration on the high priest of the temple , which they were allowed to have .
This would be the pattern of religious practice they would maintain , even during periods when they escaped foreign domination and were able to have their own kings , until the destruction of the Second Temple , centuries later .
It was during this period , about 400 B.C.E. , that the Torah finally became canonized as scripture .
Greek Influence and the Fifth Great Revision of Judaism 323 B.C.E. to 45 C.E.
Hellenism by now was becoming a major cultural influence throughout the middle east .
Successive waves of Greek influence , first brought by Alexander the Great , had brought with it a knowledge of the great Greek philosophers .
For several centuries running , right up to and including the time of Christ , the major cultural influence in the region was Greek .
The Roman Empire was primarily a political affair , relatively unconcerned with culture .
It brought the Roman form of government , but it was the Greeks whose ideas were spreading with the Romans , which brought to Palestine a systematic philosophy the likes of which the Jews had never seen .
And Greek philosophy , skeptical and secular in many ways , made a great deal of sense .
So again our Hebrew culture is presented with a problem .
How can the Jewish god , who by now had acquired a great deal of mythological and philosophical baggage , be reconciled with the unspeakable , unknowable god(s ) of the Greek philosophers ?
The first to sense the tension were the authors of Wisdom of Solomon and the other Wisdom books .
The author of Solomon , a Jew living in Alexandria , warned Jews to be true to Yahweh , and that it was fear of Yahweh , not Greek philosophy that constituted true wisdom .
Yet the logic and reason of Greek philosophy was too great to be ignored .
The first major attempt at a reconciliation was by Philo of Alexandria ( 30 B.C.E. to 45 C.E. ) .
Philo was a thoroughgoing
Hellene who wrote in elegant Greek , but was probably ignorant of Hebrew and Aramaic , as the Jewish lingua franca had by now become , yet he was also an observant Jew .
In his own mind there must have existed a microcosm of the conflict so evident around him .
Aristotle had considered history to be unphilosophic .
It had nothing to tell us about the nature of God , he said .
And to Plato , God was so unknowable and unreachable , it was only man 's gift of reason that made him kin to the Gods .
How then could Philo reconcile the humanist nature of Aristotelian historical interpretation with great epic of Exodus ?
And how could Plato 's unknowable , unreachable God be manifesting himself with such drama as to terrify the Exodian Hebrews at Sinai ?
Philo gets around the problem by creating a distinction between the essence of God ( ouisa ) , and God 's activities in the world ( dynameis or energeiai ) .
The essence of God , as Plato had said , is shrouded in impenetrable mystery .
But the power , and evidence of God 's existence is everywhere in evidence .
To Philo , the stories of the Pentatuch were allegorical , in keeping with the secular nature of history as Aristotle had taught .
So the great myths of Genesis and Exodus should not be taken literally .
What they had to tell us was hidden in inner meaning ; and the spirit of intuitive apprehension was the way of knowing that meaning .
It was a neat theological trick , but none of this made any sense to the Semitic Jews .
But to the enthusiastically Hellenized Romans of the era , searching as they were for a highly moralistic philosophy of living , and attracted as they were to Judaism for that very reason , it made a great deal of sense .
They did n't have to have a literally jealous , blatant , thundering God , but one of unknowable subtlety would do quite nicely .
Just give us a plan for living , they seemed to be saying , and we 'll forget about thundering avengers .
And so Jewish schools of thought based on Philo 's interpretations of the scriptures began to spring up all around the Mediterranean basin .
This dichotomy between the ethnic Jews and the converts to Philo 's school of Judaism was to have important consequences for development of Christianity a couple of centuries later .
The Christian Era and the Last Great Revision of Judaism 30 C.E. to appx .
73 C.E
The conflict between the Hellenism and the traditions of ethnic Judaism was nowhere more obvious than in the northern part of Palestine , which had been so often subject to conquest and which , being on the major trade route between Asia Minor and the Transjordan , was constantly subjected to foreign influence .
This northern region apparently did n't even consider itself to be Jewish , but rather a separate nation that had been annexed , apparently involuntarily , by the Maccabean kings of Israel .
So here you have Hellenized Semitics under the influence and control of Jewish kings , looking elsewhere for philosophical guidance .
It was a volatile mix .
Into this little region , called Galilee , was born a stubborn iconoclast .
He resented the Roman occupation but accepted its rule .
He was an intellect who understood at least the rudiments of the Cynic school of Greek philosophy and the complex theology of the Semitic Jews around him .
But he would have none of it .
He felt that there had to be a better way to live .
He grew up a suburb of the capital of Galilee , in a place called Nazareth .
His name was Jesus .
At least , that 's the mythology that has grown up around this figure .
For all his influence on the world , there 's better evidence that he never even existed than that he did .
We have absolutely no reliable evidence , from secular sources , that Jesus ever lived , or that any of the events surrounding his life as described in the four Gospels ever happened .
Indeed , when scholars apply the Negative Evidence Principle , it begins to look like the Jesus we know from the New Testament is the result of late first - century mythmaking .
The Negative Evidence Principle is , of course , not foolproof .
It is not a proof in itself , but is rather a guideline , a good rule of thumb .
How useful and reliable it is , of course , is subject to debate among logicians .
Here 's how the N.E.P. works - it states that you have good reason for not believing in a proposition if the following three principles are satisfied : First , all of the evidence supporting the proposition has been shown to be unreliable .
Second , there is no evidence supporting the proposition when the evidence should be there if the proposition is true .
And third , a thorough and exhaustive search has been made for supporting evidence where it should be found .
As for the first point , the only somewhat reliable , secular evidence we have for the life of Jesus comes from two very brief passages in the works of Josephus , a first - century Jewish historian .
And Josephus was a prolific writer - he frequently wrote several pages on the trial and execution of individual common thieves , but on Jesus , he is silent except for two paragraphs , one of which is a known interpolation , and the other is highly suspect .
Other references to Jesus in secular writings are ambiguous at best , or known to be later interpolations , or both .
The earliest references to Jesus in the rabbinical literature come from the second century , even though known historical figures such as John the Baptist merit considerable discussion , even though his impact on Judaism was minimal .
There are no references to Jesus in any of the Roman histories during his presumed lifetime .
That he should be so thoroughly ignored is unlikely given the impact the gospel writers said he had on the events and politics of the Jewish kingdom .
So we have to turn to Christian literature for help .
At this point , caution is called for in examining first century Christian literature .
This caution is made necessary by the fact that during this era , it was not considered wrong to write your own material and ascribe it to someone else , someone you consider your philosophical mentor , in whose name and style you are writing .
Indeed , not only was this a common practice , but it was actually a skill taught in the schools of the day .
This practice has made modern scholarship enormously difficult in dealing with who actually wrote the New Testament books and when .
The problem , though difficult , is not insoluble , and modern scholarship has developed techniques which have been applied to early Christian writings , to find out who is saying what , when and why .
When these techniques are applied to these early Christian writings , the results have been quite surprising .
The writings of Paul accepted as genuinely his ( Galatians I and II and Thessalonians I and II , Corinthians , Romans , Philemon , Phillipians , and possibly Colossians ) are by far the most pristine of any early Christian literature we have .
They were probably written beginning in the fifth decade of the first century - well after the events of Jesus ' life .
When the letters are examined in isolation , it becomes apparent that Paul was ignorant of the doctrine of the virgin birth , that he never spoke in terms of having lived in Jesus ' time , nor does he mention that any of his mentors were contemporaries of Jesus , nor that Jesus worked any miracles and he appparently did not associate the death of Jesus with the trial before Pilate .
Only in Galatians 1:19 does he make reference to a contemporary Jesus , and then only in terms of James being the " Lord 's brother . "
The use of the term " Lord 's " even makes that single reference somewhat questionable to scholars , as the word " Lord 's " did not have currency until the late 2nd. century .
So the Pauline letters , at least the reliably Pauline letters , are n't good witnesses for a Jesus of the first half of the first century .
What makes this particularly interesting , is that other non-Canonical early Christian pre-Gospel literature make the very same omissions .
Later Christian writings were written well after the events they describe , none earlier than at least the seventh decade at the earliest .
And none of them are known to have been written by the authors to which they are ascribed .
Most are second or third - hand accounts .
There was plenty of time for mythmaking by the time they were written , so they 're clearly not reliable witnesses .
In fact , there is very serious reason to doubt their veracity .
A great deal of scholarship , both within and outside of the Christian community has been spent on the four gospels of the canon in particular , and it is now quite clear that they were mythological .
The evidence that they are mythological , and basically fabricated out of whole cloth , comes from a wide range of evidence that academic historians use to distinguish historical narratives from myth making .
The canonical gospels fail practically every test of historicity .
The next stricture of the Negative Evidence Principle is that there is n't any sound evidence where there should be , and here again this stricture is met .
First , there are no records whatever of Jesus ' life in the Roman records of the era .
That 's surprising , since he allegedly stirred up so much unrest , at least by Biblical accounts .
There at least ought to be a record of his arrest and trial , or some of the political notoriety the gospel writers describe .
Yet the Roman histories are silent , even though they are quite thorough ( Flavius Josephus alone wrote dozens of volumes , many of which survive , and he is far from the only historian of Palestine in this period whose writings have survived in some form ) .
Second , as mentioned , there is no reliable account of Jesus to be found in Josephus , even though he goes on for pages on the individual trials of common criminals , not just notables .
Josephus was a historian who was so very thorough he would write a three page history of the trial and execution of a common thief , and wrote extensively about John the Baptist , but on Jesus , his two small references are seriously doubted by scholars as being genuine .
Unfortunately , the writings of Josephus have come down to us only through Christian sources , none earlier than the fourth century , and are known to have been revised by the Christians .
There are a number of reasons why the two references in Josephus are doubted :
As summarized by Louis Feldman , a promient Josephus scholar , they are , first , use of the Christian reference to Jesus being the Messiah is unlikely to have come from a Jewish historian , especially from one who treated other Messianic aspirants rather harshly ; second , commentators writing about Josephus earlier than Eusebius ( 4th Cent. C.E. ) do not cite the passage ; third , Origen mentions that Josephus did not believe that Jesus was the messiah .
There is a full account available on the Internet that describes the whole long list of problems with the " Testimonium Flavium " as scholars call it .
The earliest secular literary evidence for a religion based on the man we call Jesus comes from many decades after Jesus ' supposed death ( specifically , from about 70 C.E. ) .
Why , if he had as much influence , and caused as much a stir as the Bible says he did , do we not know of him at all from reliable , contemporary testimony ?
The third stricture of the N.E.P. holds that we must have conducted a thorough and exhaustive sweep for evidence where there should be evidence .
Indeed , thousands of scholars , religionists , crusaders , apologists and skeptics alike have meticulously searched for such evidence since the earliest days of the Christian era .
That they have n't found any evidence that is both interesting and reliable , that should have been there says that the third stricture has been clearly satisfied .
So based on the Negative Evidence Principle alone , we have good reason to doubt the historicity of Jesus as described in the New Testament and that lack of reliable evidence suggests no good reason to accept it .
How is it , then , that the Christian movement began ?
Why did it grow as it did ?
As discussed above , there was considerable intellectual ferment in Palestine at the time of the beginning of the Jesus movements .
Many secular scholars and scholars from non-Judeo - Christian traditions have proposed , and I tend to agree , that it is likely that the Jesus myth began as a social movement to ' reJudify ' Judaism .
Remember that at this point , the temple was thoroughly corrupt , the high priest was a Roman political appointee , and many Jews felt that their culture and religion were under threat .
An excellent survey of current scholarship on the Teacher of Righteousness theory of the origins of the Jesus myth , this slim book offers a lot of evidence for this theory , and is also an easy read !

The Jesus Movement by Ekkehard W. Stegemann and Wolfgang Stegemann , published 2001 .
The most prominent of the many movements to ' reJudaify ' Judaism was the Essene Movement .
Founded in the second century B.C.E. , the Essenes were either founded by or greatly influenced by a " Teacher of Righteousness , " to which the Dead Sea Scrolls make constant reference without ever naming .
One individual who fits the scanty evidence is a Yeishu ha Notzri , Jesus or Jesua , or Yeshua or Joshua ben Pantera or Pentera or Pandera or Pandira , who apparently had some influence with this movement , but may have been much more than that ; we simply do n't know .
Indeed , there are even several first - century Christian references to this supposed miracle worker .
If he was the Teacher of Righteousness referred to by the Dead Sea Scrolls , as some have suggested , his impact on the movement towards Jewish reform was considerable .
And if he was the Teacher of Righteousness , it would answer a lot of interesting questions , such as the scattered first century Christian and Talmudic references to a miracle worker named Yeishu ha Notzri , known to first - century Christians as Jesus or Jesua ben Pantera .
Among them are a quote from Origen , saying that his arch-rival Celsus had heard from a Jew in Jerusalem that " Jesus Ben Pantera " was born of Mary as the result of a rape by a Roman soldier named Pantera , and had borne the baby in secret ( most scholars now regard this claim to be a first - century legend resulting from misinterpretation of the facts ) .
That the first century Christians may have feared there was some truth to this rumor is evidenced by the fact of Mark 's obvious embarrassment regarding the origins of Jesus ; Mark , the first writer of a canonic gospel , never mentions Joseph as the actual husband of Mary .
Note also that it was both the Roman custom and the custom of the Jews to include a patrilineal surname as part of a person 's full name ; yet nowhere in the New Testament does the surname of Jesus , ( or Joseph , for that matter ) appear .
There is at least one Talmudic reference to Jeshu as being the illegitimate son of an adultress named Mary Magdala .
There are several interesting references to a Yeishu ha Notzri ( note the resemblance of the name to " Jesus of Nazareth " ) , who traveled around and practiced magic during the reign of Alexander Janneus , who ruled Palestine from 104 to 78 BCE .
As these references are Talmudic ( from the Baraitas and the Gemara ) , and therefore presumed by Christian scholars to be anti-Christian ; Christian apologeticists have simply dismissed them as referring to someone else or being fabricated propaganda .
But if they are genuine , and they really do refer to the Jesus of whom the Christians speak , they add evidence to the claim that the Jesus of Nazareth story is really based on the life of Yieshu ha Notzri , possibly the Essene " Teacher of Righteousness . "
Evidence points to him being the founder of the Notzri as the sects were known in first century Palestine , and as the Jesus Movements to modern scholars .
It must be noted here is that the version of the Talmud still used by most modern Christian scholars , is normally the version known to have been heavily edited by Christians by the 16th century - presumably to remove the dangerous references to Yeishu ha Notzri and his followers , the Notzrim , the account of which is absent from this version .
But the pristine version , still used by Jewish scholars , gives us some rich detail .
Yeishu ha Notzri was considered by the temple authorities of the time to be a troublemaking heretic , and when they had finally had enough of him , they put him on trial .
He was convicted of heresy , sentenced to wander the city for 40 days , with a crier going before him , shouting that if anyone had reason why he should not be executed , they should come forward .
When no did , he was stoned to death , and his body hung from a tree on the eve of passover , in 88 B.C.E .
Note the death on the eve of passover .
Note also the hanging of the body from a tree - at the time , a sign of despicability , with its resemblance to the crucifixion myth .
The Essene movement was one based on a very strict asceticism .
Followers were expected to live in monastic isolation , eating a rough diet of hard , primitive foods and living in very simple , rough accomodations , in the harsh climate and isolation of the Judean desert .
Since not a lot of people had a taste for that kind of harsh , strict living , it was not exactly a wildly popular movement , yet its social ideals had a great deal of popular appeal .
The result was that many people began to adopt the social ideals if not the religious asceticism , and began to associate with each other , much like the modern Hippie movement borrowed heavily from Eastern mysticism and spawned a social movement in our own times .
Many organized themselves into small groups for social sharing and discussion .
By the first century , these movements , known to the Jews of the time as the Notzri , and its follwers the Notzrim , had become widespread , and were found throughout the Eastern Meditteranean region .
It is of considerable importance to note here that it is also known from Talmudic sources and elsewhere that the first century Christians also referred to themselves as Notzrim - lending strong support to the Yeishu ha Notzri theory as the source of the Jesus myth .
The Notzrim , or Jesus Movements , as modern scholars refer to these groups , appeared as isolated groups in widely separated towns and villages throughout the region .
What they had in common was that they were a social reform movement , and often refered to a ' Jesus ' or ' Jeshua ' or ' Yeishu ' or ' Yeshua ' as their inspiration , but we know from contemporary descriptions that they were clearly not a religion , even though they incorporated many religious values .
Each of these Jesus Movement groups had its own ideas , often networking with others of a like mind , often disputing with others of conflicting ideas .
While we have no writings from them directly , we have many references to them by contemporary historians , so we have some awareness of what they believed and practiced , if filtered by others .
By the time of Paul , the Jesus Movements had become extraordinarily diverse and widespread .
Some were bands of iternant preachers , others were guilds of settled craftspeople .
Some were simple study groups , others were formal schools of scholastic research .
As mentioned , there was philosophical ferment in first century Palestine , and the Jesus movements were not immune .
Rather , they were very much a part of it .
While none of what they wrote has survived intact , scholars are reasonably certain of a " Sayings Gospel Q " ( subsequently revised at least three times ) , which is lost to us except where Mark quoted from it much later in " his " gospel , and one of the gospels of " Thomas , " which has survived to the modern era in at least two versions , contain if not the pristine writings of Jesus Movements , at least quotations from them .
What is interesting about the Jesus Movements as the source of Christianity and the Jesus myth , is that they were the source of Gnosticism , which for many decades , was considered by scholars to be a Christian heresy which arose in the second century .
Scholars had presumed this mostly as a result of the comments made in the screeds of Iraeneus , who railed against this widespread and threatening " heresy " endlessly .
But it is now widely accepted that Gnosticism was widespread by the time Jesus is supposed to have lived , and now , having the Nag Hammadi library as a treasure trove of new information , we now know that its mythology was Jewish , not Christian , its metaphysics was Neo-Platonic and Neo -Stoic , and it shared ideas from Egyptian , Greek , Jewish and " Hermetic " mystery religions , and was an outgrowth of the Jesus Movements .
Yet , when one reads the Nag Hammadi gospels we have today , we also read constant references to Jesus , including such stories as the Last Supper and the Crucifixion - evidence that the Gnostic gospels themselves borrowed from later Christian sources .
But the Jesus myth 's widespread popularity among the Gnostics by the first third of the first century leads to the suggestion that , unless a wholesale and dramatic conversion took place ( for which there is no evidence whatever ) , the Jesus myth was already widespread among the Gnostics by the time Jesus was supposed to have lived and died , and he died a long time ago .
He was n't a contemporary divine Messiah - figure .
At least not yet .
The destruction of the Second Temple which occurred during the Roman - Jewish war of 66 - 73 C.E. and the diaspora that followed also greatly impacted Judaism .
The destruction of the Temple - based priesthood made central authority for doctrine and ritual impossible , along with the ability to perform temple - based ritual .
So now every local rabbi was on his own .
Each had his own response to the rise of Christianity and the contemporaneous diaspora into which Judaism was forced .
In certain places at certain times , various rabbinates established local schools and influenced local movements , but as a whole , Judaism split into local factions , each struggling to maintain the tradition as best it could .
In the main , the maintenance of a Jewish identity and the basic cultural traditions was possible , but the rigid adherence to a single doctrinal viewpoint was not , since there was no central authority against which to measure local ideas against a common doctrinal standard .
So it 's not surprising that nearly as many schools of thought arose in the Judaism of the diaspora as occurred in Protestantism , a millenium and a half later .
The impact of the destruction of the temple on the Jesus Movements was to galvanize them into activism , trying to reform Judaism in order to save it from forced Romanization and the enveloping diaspora .
For most of the Jesus Movements , there was no effort to reform the religion as much as the culture , but as we will see , for one Jesus Movement , things were to be quite different .
Gnosticism , an outgrowth of the Jesus Movements , was by now and remained an inward - focused quasi-religion , based as much on personal reform as the basis of the social reform of the Jesus Movements from which it sprang , but which intended to contribute to the salvation of Jewish tradition by making Jewish religion more personal and inward - focused , and not dependent on outside authority .
The Road To Damascus And The Origins of Christianity Appx. 50 C.E. to 140 C.E. In about 50 C.E. , a remarkable event occurred , which ultimately changed the course of human history .
In Antioch , the local Jesus Movement suddenly and quickly transformed itself from a social and political reform movement into a full - blown religion .
As this occurred , a remarkable conversion happened - or maybe the transformation occurred because Saul of Tarsus was " converted " to a new religious vision of his own and evangelized the group as Paul the Apostle .
Whichever way it happened , we will probably never know .
But secular scholars are pretty much agreed that this group included the first true Christians and that Paul , a Gnostic , was one of the first if not the first convert .
And the Antioch Jesus Movement became the first of what modern scholars now refer to as the Christ Cults , the variety of Pauline - inspired cults prior to their consolidation under a single authority centuries later into the Catholic church .
That Paul was greatly influenced by Gnosticism , there is little doubt , in that many writers quote Gnostic sources as writing favorably of Paul and considering Paul to be their ally .
There is also little doubt that Paul , among his contemporary Christian writers ( Clement of Rome , Barnabas , and the author of Hebrews ) , and among the Gnostics and members of the Jesus Movements , all considered Jesus to be a long dead figure , their highly revered founder .
None of these writers directly quote people who claimed to have seen Jesus in mortal flesh .
Instead , what had changed was that with the advent of Paul , Jesus had now become available for visionary appearances , and , having been shown on the right - hand of God in Paul 's visions , was clearly a divine being , not just a great teacher and prophet , as the Gnostics had heretofore held .
By accepting Paul 's vision and taking the relatively small step of transforming Jesus from a great teacher of righteousness and great prophet into an actual divine being , Gnosticism became a form of Christianity , albeit one with a very different theology from the catholicised Christianity of later centuries .
The form of divinity they eventually accepted , however , was that Jesus was a wholly spiritual being who only " seemingly " appeared to his followers as a man , and exposed himself to persecution and death on the cross .
This lack of mortality became known to the catholic Christians as the " docetic " heresy of the Gnostics .
It would survive into the sixth century , in spite of repeated attempts by the church and the Empire to stamp it out .
Paul 's writings are among the earliest Christian writings that have survived intact , and quite probably because they were the first Christian writings in the sense that we know Christianity .
They date to within two decades of the presumed date of the crucifixion .
Of the books in the New Testament that are attributed to Paul , there are only a few that are generally agreed by scholars to be the product of his pen .
Among these are Galatians I and II and Thessalonians I and II , Corinthians , Romans , Philemon , Phillipians , and possibly Collosians .
The rest of the New Testament books attributed to him were written by later authors seeking to ride on his credibility and authority .
What 's remarkable about these writings is that when considered apart from the rest of the New Testament , they paint an interesting and very different picture of Paul himself and of very early Christianity than that accepted by most Christians .
Among the possibilities that have been presented to account for this are that Paul was ignorant of many of the important details of the life of Jesus or , more likely , those details are simply myths that were incorporated into Christianity after Paul wrote his letters .
The foremost proponent of the Paul - as - repressed - homosexual theory is none other than a Christian bishop himself !
Spong 's controversial theory is widely reviled by conservative Christians - but it certainly fits the evidence !
Get it here !
Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism by Bishop John Shelby Spong , published 1991 .
The reasons for Paul 's conversion is a question that deserves discussion here .
Saul , the pre-conversion Roman Jew , was a man with an intense self loathing .
He does n't tell us why , but time and again , he describes himself as a sinner who was far beyond any possible redemption .
A man who stood condemned in the eyes of God .
A man clearly destined for hell , and there 's nothing he himself could do about it , especially since his body 's ' member ' would not cooperate .
It 's not his persecution of the Christians that creates the self loathing ; rather it is the other way around .
Something was eating at Saul .
It clearly related to behavior , because he describes himself as being a sinner .
Over the centuries , many suggestions have been made as to what might have been the source of that self loathing .
Few of them are really convincing , they all seem to have serious problems - except for one : the suggestion that Paul was a repressed homosexual .
Homosexuality was not widely condemned in this region at the time , yet it could possibly have been a personal interpretation of Levitical proscriptions that drove him to consider himself a sinner for being a homosexual .
Yet when he experiences his conversion , he realizes that by the grace of God , his homosexuality no longer matters , for God loves him , the same as all men .
I say this after having read the references in the New Testament in which Paul speaks of his shame and his self loathing : his words have a startlingly deep resonance with every gay man who was ever brought up in a Christian environment .
This theory alone to the exclusion of all others I 've seen explains all the strange aspects of Paul 's attitudes towards sexuality - the proclivity to a monastic degree of chastity , the extreme mysogony , the fact that he remained single and urged others in his situation , whatever that was , to do likewise , and the frequent discussions of how the ' members ' of his body do not cooperate with his spiritual goals , and his despair over his inability to effect the changes he would like .
All of these evidences are consonant with the repressed - gay theory ; no other theory I know of account for them all .
I hasten to add here , that there is no factual evidence to indicate that Paul was gay .
The evidence is purely circumstantial , as is much of the evidence widely accepted in Biblical scholasticism .
It has been charged that I included this theory only because " it irks Christians " or because I am myself gay .
This is simply not true .
I have included it , because it fits the evidence better than any other theory I have seen - the evidence fits remarkably well .
On a personal note , I do n't happen to care a whit whether Paul was gay or not - I have no investment in the theory as I am not a Christian ; I 'm only trying to arrive at a theory that fits the evidence better than any other , and so far , I have yet to find another that fits it better .
If the reader can offer one , I 'd be delighted to entertain it , and I hasten to point out that I have analyzed dozens of theories .
The search for truth is a search for the best evidential fit , not the search for comfort , so whether Christians find the theory irksome , troublesome or disturbing , or whether the author of this essay is gay , is really quite irrelevant to reality .
But I digress from the story ...
If this theory is true , it may well be that the whole of the Christian edifice of sexual doctrine , and even of Christianity itself , is built on the foundation of the self - loathing of a repressed gay man , unable to change himself or find salvation within himself , but finding salvation only in the grace of God .
Again , if this theory is true , try to imagine how world history might have been different had Saul not been born gay and suffered the self - loathing that resulted from that circumstance of his birth .
Paul speaks , then , from the perspective of a self loathing , pre-mythologized Christian .
He utters the doctrines that pretty much will shape Christianity in the centuries ahead , but does not relate any of the ' faith promoting ' miracle stories or details of Jesus ' life that one would expect of an evangelist seeking converts in a first - century world hungry for the evidence of spirituality offered by miracles and magic .
This , of course , is because the miracle stories did n't yet exist .
Those stories would come from the gospel writers .

The New Testament Translation by Richard Lattimore , published 1996 .
The gospel writers were converts to the new Christ cults .
Whether any were directly converted by Paul , we do n't know , but it has been 20 years since Paul 's conversion , and the new religion has been spreading like wildfire among the Jesus Movements of the Eastern Mediteranean .
We also know that none were writing from Palestine , but were all in the Diaspora , and none had , so far as we know , even traveled to Palestine .
Mark wrote with the letters of Ignatius in hand , and each of the succeeding writers wrote with the previously written gospels , and probably Ignatius as well , in hand .
We do know that Paul traveled to Jerusalem to discuss with Peter the doctrines of his new church , and how they should be applied to gentiles as well as Jews .
We can only speculate as to the details of what was discussed during this meeting , but one thing is clear : Peter and Paul had a heated discussion as to just who this new gospel should be preached to , whether gentiles should be included with Jews .
Paul returned to Antioch apparently satisfied that he had convinced Peter and James of his point of view .
It is also quite clear that this meeting was one of several ( there was at least one other , where Peter was known to have been publicly humiliated by Paul ) that must surely have occurred among the early luminaries which took up the general outlines of how proselytizing should be done , how the church should be structured and what doctrines should be promulgated in order to appeal to as many people as possible , and whether they should include gentiles as well as Jews .
The reason why was that there was a serious problem : Judaism was under direct threat from Roman persecution of the priestly class ( seen as a political threat resulting from the uprising against Roman rule ) and a new version of Judaism had to be concocted that would be so appealing that people would want to belong to it , and so captivating that people would not want to abandon it , even in the face of persecution , and be politically inoffensive so as to hopefully escape the attentions of the Roman persecutors .
It had to abandon the temple worship since there was no temple anymore , and it had to be able to survive the onslaught of foreign ideas which were widely available , from Roman , Hellene , pagan and oriental sources , not to mention the many attractive mystery religions of the Roman Empire .
The result is that the new religion had the features of what in our day is called a meme - an idea that actually behaves like a virus - it infects , reproduces and spreads itself , and most importantly , has the ability to evolve to adapt to fluid circumstances .
As a response to Roman persecutions following the failed uprising against Rome , Paul and the other founders of Christianity seem to have set out to create a religion that was flexible enough that it could evolve in this way , so as preserve at least some form of Judaism from the Roman persecutions and do so in the absence of a highly organized priesthood .
They succeeded , of course , beyond their wildest hopes , creating a cult that not only survived the Roman persecutions and the diaspora , but would survive , evolve and grow to become one of the world 's major religions .
The ideas of Paul , with the contributions of Peter , James , and other early conversants and early bishops , including among others , Ignatius , Barnabas , the author of Hebrews , Clement of Rome and others , apparently communicated back to the local Jesus movements many of which had been converted to the members of the new Christ cult , either as Gnostics or as followers of Ignatius .
These local Christ cult converts included the gospel writers , many of whom were inspired to write , at least following in the lead of Ignatias , to take up the cause against the " docetic " heresy of the Gnostics , claiming as it did , that Jesus was a purely spiritual being who never had a physical body , and only " seemed " to be in mortal flesh .
Leading the charge against the Gnostics was the first - century bishop Ignatius of Antioch , highly regarded by the church membership and persecuted by the Romans , which of course , only increased the esteem with which he was held .
It was his letters , seven of which are widely considered genuine and all of which were written before the canonic gospels , that contain the first references to " the Gospel , " to Mary the Virgin , to the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus , to Jesus being the seed of David , and God being his father .
It is clear that the rapidly spreading popularity of the Isis cult , with it 's virgin mother of God story , was the inspiration for including a virgin birth for Jesus .
Ignatius is the first to mention the role of Pilate , giving us our first reference date for Ignatius ' physical Jesus to have lived in the first century .
It is apparent from a careful reading of Ignatius ' letters , in comparison to the canonic gospels and the first - century texts that preceeded them , that the myth of a first - century historical Jesus is quite likely to have originated with Ignatius .
Building upon the myth created by Ignatius , and to make a flesh - and - blood , historical Jesus real to believers and thereby make the docetic heresy untenable , additional myths surrounding the life of Jesus had to be and were liberally borrowed by the gospel writers from the pagan religions that surrounded them , probably because of the appeal these myths clearly had had for the followers of the pagan religions .
Everywhere were to be found religions that had as major features one or more of the myths that eventually came to be associated with Jesus .
Virtually every story surrounding Jesus , whether it be the virgin birth ( borrowed from the myth of the birth of Tammuz , a pagan god from northern Israel who was supposed to have been born of the virgin Myrrha ) , the miracle stories found in the Bacchus and Isis cults , the betrayal and crucifixion , were part of one or more of the pagan religions of the time .
The liberal plagiarizing of these stories from the mystery religions was one of the many embarrassing facts pointed out by Celsus .
Some of the myths were even the result of simple misinterpretations by gospel writers who writing from the Diaspora and who had never even been to Palestine - Nazareth , for example , was not a place name , but simply a corruption of the name " Notzri , " with the name not meaning " of the town of Nazareth , " but " of the Notzrim , " the social reform groups known by scholars today as the Jesus Movements .
Nazareth , as a place name , did not even come into existence until Emperor Constantine 's mother , searching for the holy sites in Palestine in the fourth century on which to build preservatory basilicas , simply invented the name for a pre-existing village for which only very flimsy evidence tied it to the site of the youth of Jesus .
Among the religions of the day incorporating a crucifixion myth , for example , were the mystery religions of Attis , Adonis , Dionysus , and several others .
Dionisus , for example , was depicted as being given a crown of ivy , dressed in a purple robe , and was given gall to drink before his crucifixion .
The depiction on a Greek vase from the 5th century B.C.E. even shows a communion being prepared .
The fact that these stories are today almost exclusively associated with the myth of Jesus of Nazareth , show how both myth and history is often outright expropriated - and even rewritten - by the victors , in their own way .
There were literally dozens of gospels , most of which have been lost to us , but significant numbers survive , not just those included in the canon .
Most of the non-canonical gospels are polemics and are easily dismissed , though some ( particularly those from the Nag Hammadi library ) including especially the Gospel of Thomas , are interesting mostly for what they help us learn of the early church .
But because the gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John are so important to the development of Christianity , we 'll examine each of them and the effect they have had on the Christian church .
Of particular importance is the Gospel of Thomas , having been written before any of the canonic gospels , and therefore lacking in detail regarding the life of Jesus , but giving us a good overview of some of the more important Gnostic doctrines .
By the late second century , the vast library of gospels , most of which contradicted each other to various degrees , led bishop Iraneus to angrily rail against most of them , and argue forcefully that there were only four legitimate gospels , the ones we know today as Matthew , Mark , Luke and John .
His reasoning might seem a bit obscure to us today - he argued that as there were four elements ( earth , water , wind and fire ) and there were four cardinal points of the compass ( north , south , east and west ) , so there should be considered only four gospels .
Yeah , you know the ones .
The Gospel of John was included on his list even though it was clearly a Gnostic gospel , but he included it because it argued against the docetic heresy of the Gnostics , asserting the physicality of Jesus at every possible opportunity .
Doing so was a very ecumenical move on Iraneus ' part , offering a way into the fold for the Gnostics , if they would just give up their heresy .
His successors argued that John should be dropped from the list because it was Gnostic , but they ultimately lost the debate .
The first of the canonic gospels to be written was that of Mark .
We do n't know much about the author of the Gospel According to Mark , but we do know that the author was a simple man , not highly literate in Greek ( for whom it may have been a second language ) , and not particularly well educated , but a man who was thoroughly steeped in Jewish mythology and religion .
Not being particularly well educated , his was a world of superstition , demons , of possession , of miracles and gods of the Roman world , and all these had an effect on how he wrote his gospel .
It is also clear that his gospel was greatly influenced by the stories circulating in the Christian community as to just who this Jesus was .
If Jesus existed as depicted in the New Testament , Mark never knew him , but claimed to have been a follower of Peter instead - so much so that his gospel was known for a time as the Petrine gospel .
Mark wrote his gospel in Syria for an audience of Roman Christians .
Many scholars like to claim that the date of his gospel is about 70 C.E. , but there are plenty of reasons to doubt this , mostly the fact that he is quoting many sayings that first appear in the letters of Ignatius , who began writing a bit later - and for that reason , I suspect a date early in the second century is more likely .
The Christians were suffering intense persecution at the time at the hands of Nero who was scapegoating them for the Roman fire and other problems , and so Mark wrote what he hoped would be a gospel to strengthen the Christian community and give it hope in times of trial .
In so doing , he wrote a gospel that was long on the suffering of Jesus and those who follow him , and short on temporal salvation .
Jesus was mythologized not as a carpenter , but rather as a carpenter 's son - a blatant attempt to confer social status , by not relegating him to the status of a simple craftsman , but as someone who rose far above his circumstance , as the Christians were being asked by their leaders to do .
Joseph is not mentioned in the story of Jesus ' birth , but Jesus is rather referred to as " the son of Mary , " a description ( being the " son of " a woman ) was normally reserved for the illegitimate - so it is clear that Mark is intent on telling what he regards as the truth , even if he has to tell half - truths to achieve his goal .
Mark never explains the circumstances of Jesus ' birth , but merely says that Jesus came from Nazareth - a misunderstanding of the term " Notzri " - the name by which the Jesus Movements had called themselves until the first half of the first century .
Making this mistake was easy , because Mark had doubtless heard that Jesus had been a Notzri , but had apparently not understood what it meant , and assumed it to be a geographical reference .
There is nothing in Mark about virgins or wise men or being born in a manger with angels talking to shepherds .
This is because as Mark writes , the myths surrounding Jesus ' birth had yet to be incorporated into Christian mythology , and Mark has not done so .
But other myths of the Christian community , including several of the miracle stories , were included by Mark in his gospel .
This is because Mark was a simple man and tended to accept these traditions at face value , and included them because they elevated Jesus in the minds of his readers , an important goal if his audience were to consider the hero of the story to be worth dying for .
The next of the canonized gospels to be written was Matthew .
The author of Matthew was a well - educated conservative Jew , trained in the nuances of the Levitic tradition , and was intent on showing the Hebraic world just what Jesus had to offer them .
Scholarship has traditionally held that he wrote a decade or so after the Second Temple was destroyed in the abortive Jewish uprising , but he quotes Mark , whose gospel was unlikely to have been written before the beginning of the second century .
Matthew was determined to explain to the Jewish world just who Jesus was and to show Judaism that there was an alternative to the Rabbinic tradition that was then developing in the aftermath of the destruction of the second temple ; i.e. , that salvation through Jesus was possible .
It was Matthew 's conservatism that was the source of the hellfire and damnation in Fundamentalist Christian conservatism .
Indeed , without Matthew in the canon , there would be few other biblical references to it .
Matthew had a fire and a passion about him that well outran his qualifications as a scholar of Jewish law .
Even though he was well versed in it , the attempt to prove his case by quoting Jewish law proved to be , well , disastrously badly done .
Matthew used as his primary source the gospel of Mark .
In doing so , he incorporated many of Mark 's myths and added a few of his own , changing bits of the story line here and there to better make the points for his Jewish audience that he was trying to make .
For example , to make his case that Jesus was the promised Messiah , he heightened the miraculous and altered the detail , to the point of obvious error .
A case in point is the geneology with which he begins his narrative : he deliberately left out detail in order to have seven generations each from Abraham to David and David to the Exile , and the Exile to Jesus .
This has left some to suggest that Matthew could n't count very well , as his geneology conflicts with other genealogies in the Old Testament .
If he was aware of these discrepancies , his attempt to deify Jesus for a Jewish audience certainly overruled them .
What Matthew was to the Jews , Luke was to the gentiles .
Luke , unlike Matthew , was the consummate scholar .
Fluent in Greek , almost certainly a gentile himself , Luke saw the need to write a gospel to explain the new religion to the gentile community , and so he wrote one .
Like Matthew before him , he had a copy of Mark and used it liberally , quoting long sections and adding twists of his own to suit his needs .
Above all else , Luke was an evangelist .
His mission was to make this Jewish sect a relevant religion for the gentiles who had nowhere else to turn in the search for a strict moral code by which to live .
Judaism required circumcision , an obvious disadvantage , and besides , it was a tribal religion whose members tended to view gentile converts with skepticism , if not outright racial discrimination , so all that got short shrift in Luke 's gospel .
With the ascent of Domitian to the Roman throne in 81 c.e. , the fires of persecution began to be stoked once again , and Luke saw the need to address Roman political concerns by showing that Christianity was simply a natural and harmless outgrowth of the respected Jewish tradition .
Hence his address of the document to " The most excellent Theophilus . "
Because Luke was writing for an official Roman audience as much as for an audience of prospective gentile converts , he was careful to portray Rome in as good a light as possible .
For example , Luke has Herod 's soldiers scourging Jesus , not Rome 's soldiers as does Mark .
The Kingdom of Christ being described by Jesus is proclaimed as being " not of this world , " an obvious attempt to assuage Roman suspicions of a conspiracy at work within the bowels of this new cult .
There are many other examples , which , like the above , bring this gospel into conflict with the others in Luke 's attempt to dress up the story for an official Roman audience .
The last of the four gospels is , of course , the Gospel of John .
Though a favorite of the literalists , this anti-authoritarian Gnostic gospel ironically takes great delight in poking fun at literalist authority .
Chapters 3 , 4 , 6 and 8 all have stories in which those who have taken the word literally have been made fun of .
John 's gospel is skillfully crafted , the work of a true scholar and a deeply religious man , who well understood that myth and meaning are the substance of scripture , not the literality of the words themselves .
Who " John " was we are not sure , but some scholars suggest he could have been a disciple of the two Johns of Ephesus , one of which was the John Zebedee spoken of by Mark , or John Zebedee 's son .
John wrote his gospel in the early to middle years of the second century , fully four to six generations after the events he recorded allegedly had transpired .
John , a Gnostic convert to the ecclesiastical non-docetic point of view , wrote his gospel with an eye to the growing rift between Judaism and Christianity , and sought to heal it by trying to bring the two together .
He tried to do so by fashioning a mythology that would be acceptable to both : quoting liberally from respected and appreciated Jewish literature and by incorporating a mythology of Jesus that sought to fulfil Jewish law and prophesy - a gospel that also sought to heal the rift between the Jewish Essene gnosticism , and the ecclesiastical viewpoint .
In so doing , John created a gospel that broke so completely with the gospels that proceeded it , that it is directly appealing to the Jews who found themselves uncomfortable with the tightening screws of Jewish orthodoxy that was one of the results of the destruction of the Second Temple .
The apocalypic vision of the narrative was meant to appeal to the Jewish sense of destiny as well as Essene apocalypticism while being true to the Christian ideal .
Here we have a prophetic Jewish vision in a Christian setting , completing the foundations of later fundamentalist Christian doctrine .
The result , along with the book of Acts , believed to have been written by the author of the gospel of Luke , writing this time for a Christian audience , gave us the complete set of myths that are so central to the beliefs of many Christians , particularly fundamentalist Protestants .
Unlike Mark , whose mission of Jesus as the Messiah is revealed only at the end of Mark 's narrative , here is a Jesus whose very being seems to shout , " I am the fulfilment of the Law and the Prophets made flesh . "
Both the audience and the resulting mythology could n't have been more different , and of course many factual and contextual conflicts were the result .
It made his gospel controversial from the start .
These four gospels , as well as Luke 's Acts , were the theological " best sellers " of their day , and with Iraneus ' endorsement , had pretty much assured their canonic status by the end of the second century , in spite of the protests of many bishops about the gnosticism of the Gospel of John .
One question remains : if the Essenes are really so widespread and influential as we now know they were , why do we see no references to them in the Gospels and other New Testament works ?
Good question , and one that is often asked , seldom with satisfactory answers from the apologists .
But the answer is simple - there are references to them , lots of references .
We know them from the canonic gospels as the Nazarenes - a corruption of the word " Nozrim , " by which the Jesus Movements , which sprang from the Essene movement , knew themselves early in the first century .
Not citizens of a place ( Mark 's mistake ) , but members of a movement .
By the time the gospel writers composed their gospels early in the second century , the word was no longer current , hence the mistake was an easy one for an uncultured non-scholar like Mark to make during his mythologizing .
Mark , fairly ignorant of history as he was , failed to understand it as a movement , because by the time he was writing , that movement had largely disappeared - through being subsumed into the church .
Subseqent Christian writers , knowing no better , never corrected the mistake , but compounded it by entrenching it in their own mythmaking .
Once that is understood , it all makes sense .
The Great Heresies of Gnosticism and the Revisionism of Marcion 140 C.E. to 312 C.E. Right from Paul 's time , the Christ cults grew disputatious , with new ideas and heresies spreading among them like wildfire as each local bishop had his own ideas and sought to see them accepted .
The cult became cults as the new " heresies " spread .
By the end of the first century , Romans hungry for a workable moral code began to look to the transforming Jesus movements and Christ cults for a spiritual home .
Judaism still had appeal , but required circumcision , an obvious disadvantage .
The Christ cults made no such demands .
Indeed , membership in the Christ cult was a pleasurable affair , not requiring much in the way of embarrassing ritual and offering much interesting discussion and amiable camaraderie amidst the ritual of the table fellowship , a weekly ritual of the time , involving the community gathering together for a meal and discussion and ritual worship in private among friends .
Soon Christ Cult congregations were spread throughout the Mediterranean basin .
They offered , with careful calculation , a way out for the Jews of the Diaspora , who could not accept such as the unabashed gnosticism of Philo of Alexandria , or were too distant from Jerusalem to engage in rabbinical study , or were misinclined to accept local rabbinical authority .
And this new series of cults were as open to the gentiles as Judaism was suspicious .
Here was a religion all could be a part of , without regard to ethnic origins or circumstances of social status , accidents of birth or location .
But which cult to join ?
Each local group , under the influence of local bishops had generated its own local traditions and doctrinal ideas , and even local groups splintered as doctrinal disputations arose .
Christianity had by now become a significant social force in spite of Roman efforts to stop it ; in Asia Minor especially , it had become so common that disputations between the followers of various Christ cults was as common a local pastime as discussion of football is today .
By the end of the first century , the smug confidence of the local bishops in their own ideas was about to be shattered by the very success of the Christ Cults .
The doctrinal gulf between various groups calling themselves Christian had grown too great to be ignored , especially between the Gnostic Christians and those respecting the ecclesiastical and doctrinal authority of the bishops .
So when intellectuals among these movements began to appear , it became obvious that something needed to be worked out .
Finally , Valentinus of Alexandria , Justin of Samaria , Irenaeus ( from Asia Minor , but writing from Lyons and a thoroughly loyal Roman ) , the Gnostic bishop Marcion of Sinope ( a small town in Asia Minor ) , Clement of Alexandria , and a few others all converged on Rome in 140 C.E. with ideas of what Christianity was , that could hardly have been at greater odds .
One of the most charismatic of these was Marcion , whose heretical views were supported by many other Gnostics in attendance .
Indeed , this charismatic heretic was nearly elected to the papacy .
But the doctrinal gulf was huge , the controversies enormous , and the debate uncompromising .
The church was never to be the same again .
The firebrand intellectuals brushed aside the watered down ideas of the local bishops and looked at the foundations of the church , to discover that the stones of that foundation , based as they were on the old Jesus Movements , were not sound .
So they set about revamping the entire doctrinal basis of the church .
One of the problems as Marcion saw it was that Christians were expected to be loyal to the Jewish god , even though they did not have to keep his law .
Marcion 's vision of God was as it was taught by Paul , his major influence , where grace was everything for salvation , and a personal relationship with God was the doctrinal authority .
God was a god of mercy and compassion , a god for all mankind , not proprietary to a " chosen people . "
The Jewish god , according to Marcion , was not worthy of worship .
He was to be replaced by Christ , who had revealed the law that Christians should follow , as understood and interpreted by Paul .
He was a god of justice and salvation , very unlike the Jewish concept of the angry , fiery , vengeful Jahweh .
By now , the gospels of Matthew , Mark , and Luke as well as the many others had appeared , written by followers of the new Christ cults , and Marcion brought with him an abbreviated version of Luke , together with ten letters of Paul , to form the first canon of the New Testament .
It was the first Christian scripture .
The other intellectuals rejected Marcion 's ideas , primarily because they were Gnostic and docetic , and therefore rejected the Apostolic myths of the deeply respected Ignatius outright , and because he pointed out many other unresolved problems left them by the first - century bishops .
But even more radical was his flat - out rejection of early " apostolic " writings where it was obvious that the writer did not share the current vision of the physical mission of Jesus as the savior of mankind .
One of the intellectuals , Polycarp , called Marcion " the first - born of Satan " and others , especially Tertullian and Justin wrote extensively against his views .
But that opposition did not stop Marcion .
He went on a preaching tour that was spectacularly successful , especially in the Eastern half of the empire .
Congregations of Gnostic Marcionite Christians were organized in Ephesus , Rome and Pontus in Asia Minor .
Even whole villages soon became converts .
And the Marcionite church proved to be as durable as it was popular - it survived into the fifth century , in spite of official and papal persecution .
The Marcionite appeal lay in the fact that the doctrine was simple and understandable , but more than that , doable .
Even though it had its own share of internal contradictions , it was clearly resonating with the masses , and the other bishops could see that and grew concerned .
By the dawn of the fourth century , the local bishops could no longer rely on their watered - down doctrines for support and authority , and feeling the threat from Gnosticism especially in the form of Marcionism , began to contend with each other regarding doctrine .
The bishops of the principal congregations headquartered in Rome , Constantinople , Antioch , Caesaria , Jerusalem , Alexandria and Carthage proceeded to squabble with each other incessantly .
The attempt by the Rome conference to deal with the problem a century and a half earlier , had been a complete failure .
Worse , it had spawned the development of the Marcionite church , a movement , regarded as heretical by the bishops , but with broad appeal .
There was such fierce , intractable doctrinal turmoil within the church , it appeared the church was doomed .
And with continuing Roman persecution , how could the church survive ?
An Unlikely Savior Saves The Church -- And Spawns The Greatest Revision Yet 313 C.E. to appx .
430 C.E .
In 313 , Emperor Constantine and his co-emperor Lucinius sent a series of rather flowery letters to their governors , in which they said it was " salutory and most proper " that " complete toleration " be given to anyone who has " given up his mind to the cult of the Christians " or any other cult which " he personally feels best for himself . "
The Edict of Milan , as this series of letters came to be known , had the effect of legalizing Christianity throughout the Roman Empire .
The question history has never adequately answered is why the Edict of Milan was issued in the first place , but it was probably due to the growing political power of the Christians of various stripes .
Constantine 's own wife was a convert ( if not born into the church , we do n't know for sure ) , and this was likely a contributing factor .
Emperor Constantine was a deeply superstitious man , but also a consumate politician .
He was a practitioner of several religions , trying to keep his religious bases covered , even after his ' conversion . '
He was also spectacularly arbitrary and capricious .
He sent prisoners of war to the lions , committed wholesale acts of genocide in his campaigns in North Africa , and was known for his overbearing , egotistical , ruthless and self - righteous behavior .
His nephew Julian said that his appearance was strange , with stiff effeminate garments of Eastern fashion , jewelry on his arms and it was all set off by a tiara perched on a dyed wig .
Constantine apparently viewed Christianity as just one of the many cults of his realm , and he seemed to practice them all , apparently with roughly the same depth of commitment .
He was n't actually baptized until he was on his death bed .
Emperor Constantine , for all his strangeness , was nothing if not a good politician .
He understood well the fact that the Christians were becoming so numerous as to represent a considerable political threat should they get their act together and become organized .
In 312 , a year before the Edict of Milan , he fought the battle of Milvan Bridge , against a rival claimant to the emperor 's throne .
Among his soldiers were many , if not a majority of Christians and they were already carrying on their swords and shields the Christian Chi-Rho sign .
Well , to hear the stories , the heavens opened up , and the Emperor himself had a great vision , including the famous quote from God himself , " In this sign you shall conquer . "
And he was granted victory in his battle , which proved pivotal in his struggle to consolidate the empire .
Rather than a grand vision , it 's more likely that he simply looked out on all his soldiers with the power they represented , with so many of them bearing the Chi-Rho symbol on their shields , and he saw the light .
Unfortunately , we do n't know what exactly happened at Milvan Bridge , because the dear Emperor kept changing his story and telling different versions of the events to different people .
At least six different , contradictory versions have survived from different people who all claimed to have heard it first - hand from the good emperor himself .
As he kept telling these conflicting stories , he still apparently remained personally converted to the Mithraic sun-cult common in the Empire at the time .
Besides the somewhat dismissive wording of the letters in the Edict of Milan ( see above ) , there is the small matter of the Milvan Arch .
As a monument to his victory at Milvan Bridge , some years later , he raised a triumphal arch , which survives to this day .
It still bears on it a dedication to the " Unconquered Sun " ( a reference to Mithra ) and referred to Jesus Christ " driving his [ the sun 's ] chariot across the sky . "
He commanded the Christians to hold their services on Sun-day , and to commemorate the birth of their savior on December 25 - the birthday of Mithra .
Constantine became the sole Roman emperor in 324 , amidst a period of intense squabbling by the various local bishops ( not to mention pamphleteering and widespread graffiti campaigns by both sides ) .
So intense were the feelings on both sides of the principal controversy , that civil unrest was being threatened , and Constantine wanted to put a stop to the controversies before it came to that .
So he convened the First Council of Nicea the following year .
His commandment to the bishops :
Get your act together and quit squabbling .
Come up with a consistent doctrine that would be universal , i.e.catholic - note the small " c " , and could be understood and practiced by all .
The Council of Nicea And The Emperor Dictating Doctrine 325 C.E.
Rather than risk Imperial disfavor and banishment from the Empire and almost certain death , the bishops met at Nicea , a small town in Turkey where the emperor owned a lake house on June 19th , 325 C.E .
They squabbled and squabbled some more , and were able to come to almost no agreement among themselves .
The most important of these controversies is called the " Arian Controversy , " by historians , after Arius the Preacher , a bishop who was preaching that Jesus had been real enough , but not divine - rather , merely a great preacher and prophet .
The other side of the controversy held that Jesus was the physical incarnation of God himself .
This was a dispute over the doctrinal outcome resulting from the suppression of the Docetic Heresy , which gave rise to the physical Jesus myth itself .
Basically , the Arian Controversy was a whole series of questions over the relationship of Jesus to God the Father .
Now that we have a physical Jesus , was Jesus God ?
Or was he the son of God ?
Was he divine ?
Or was he merely a divine prophet ?
Did he die and was he resurrected , or was he taken up into heaven ?
Finally , in exasperation , the emperor himself intervened , and imposed some compromises by direct imperial edict .
The principal compromise was simple : Jesus and God the father were of " the same substance " - whatever that meant ,
There is a mailbox located underwater off the coast of Susami in Wakayama prefecture .
The mailbox is not some old sunken relic , but an actual mail collection point officially recognized as part of Susami 's postal system .
Each day the contents are collected from the box , which reportedly contains as many as 200 pieces of mail at the busiest times .
