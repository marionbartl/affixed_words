Patrick Ruffini admonishes the Dems :
The most important thing about a good attack is not the attack itself .
It 's baiting your opponent to respond the way you want him to respond , because only the things that come out of his mouth will ultimately stick .
Obama seems to be falling into the trap of response - centrism .
If only they could respond the right way , they figure , all will be well .
But it wo n't be .
Because the game they are playing is reactive .
Instead of changing the subject off Palin by launching some explosive new attack on McCain , all they do is respond , respond , respond .
And the story , day after day , is Democratic Presidential nominee responds to Republican Vice Presidential nominee .
The optics of that stink for them .
Unless , in fact , this election is about Palin .
And it has to be .
She - along with the Iraq war - is the embodiment of McCain 's claim to presidential judgment and experience .
If she is a fraud , and has been proven a demonstrable liar in ways that a competent campaign would have vetted six months ago , McCain 's campaign is over , and deserves to be over .
As is the election .
I do n't see how we can know anything until she has answered a series of obvious , factual questions from the press corps about the truthfulness of her various statements in the public record .
Besides , Obama needs to respond to the insane and desperate lies being lobbed at him .
He 's not Dukakis .
And he should also keep reminding voters that , unlike the McCain camp , who do n't want to discuss the issues in this campaign , he does .
Look : we seem to be on the verge of a financial crisis of potentially severe proportions , we have a nuclear - armed rogue state with a leadership in flux in North Korea , we have a direct war between the United States and the Taliban in Pakistani territory - and John McCain wants to talk about " lipstick on a pig " and a woman who did n't know the difference between a Shiite and Sunni two weeks ago .
( I 'm sure they 've programmed her now ) .
They can not be serious .
I do n't believe the McCain campaign is serious about anything any more , except bullying the press and running out the clock .
This is the most shambolic campaign I have ever witnessed in a general election .
If he runs his campaign this badly , how would he run the country ?

The key to a successful Agile migration is having the change driven from within .
The change needs to be driven by key players throughout the company .
Once this team is created they will be evangelists to the entire company .

Cargo Cult Methodology : How Agile Can Go Terribly , Terribly Wrong
7 Agile Leadership Lessons for the Suits
OppenheimerFunds Gets Return on Investment from Agile and SOA
The role of this group , which I call the Agile Core Team , is to learn as much as they can about Agile and use this knowledge to outline a custom Agile methodology for the company .
The team will collaborate and reach consensus on new processes , then mentor project teams as they use the Agile techniques .
This core team is powerful and influential for three reasons :
They are not a part of line management .
There will be very few members from the management ranks but the majority of the team will be " doers . "
The people that actually design , build , create , and test the code .
This will add to the credibility as the methodology is rolled out to the company .
It is not a management initiative being forced upon everyone ; it is coming from real people who will be a part of the project teams .
Since the team is composed of doers they actually know the ins and outs of developing in your environment .
This is different than when consultants come in suggesting standard practices and disregarding the realities of a specific company .
The Agile Core Team has experience with your company and they will use that experience to develop a methodology that knows what to keep and what to discard within the existing practices .
Remember our earlier discussion of awareness , buy - in , and ownership ?
What better way to create awareness than to have Agile Core Team members come from each functional area .
Imagine a member being from quality and going back to the quality team and telling them what is going on with the new methodology , or a developer doing the same with the development team .
Having team members from all areas will initialize awareness across the company .
Many companies use outside consulting to get their methodology going .
I have seen several companies choose to go with Agile methods such as Scrum , and then have a third party come in and train , design , and deploy the methodology .
In my opinion this approach is not as effective as growing the methodology from within .
Creating it from within the organization addresses all of the issues with ownership .
It is hard to get a team to buy into a process that was forced upon them .
Note that there are occasions when an organization is so dysfunctional that it needs to have a methodology forced upon it .
This is the exception , not the norm .
Obtain Team Members From All Areas
Once you obtain executive support you can pursue creation of the Agile Core Team .
Your sponsor will probably suggest managers for the team , but you need to remind him that part of the power and influence of the core team is they are " doers . "
You might also find yourself pursuing the best and brightest people from each area .
People with a positive attitude and a pro-Agile mentality .
People that are open minded to change .
These would be excellent attributes to list on a job opening , but would they be reflective of your current employee mix , the people that you want to embrace the new methodology ?
Probably not .
If your company is like most you probably have some mix of the following :
Brilliant and collaborative people
People that are brilliant but difficult to work with
People who challenge ever initiative
People who loathe change and avoid it at all costs
You need to make sure the makeup of the core team is similar to the makeup of the company .
This will help you obtain buy - in from all types when you begin roll - out .
After determining types of folks for the team , you need to determine team size .
A group large enough to capture a diverse set of perspectives but small enough to be , yes , " Agile . " I suggest a number somewhere between 5 and 10 people .
Note that if the team is larger you can still make progress when a team member is pulled for a production issue or is out due to vacation or illness .
To give you a feel for creating your own team , let 's return to Acme Media .
We find that Wendy Johnson has obtained the CIO , Steve Winters , as the executive sponsor for the Agile migration .
Amazingly Steve has asked to be on the core team and he says he can participate in the 6 hours per week requested of team members .
Wendy and Steve have also identified their Agile Core Team and they have received approval from the managers of the people selected .
Wendy and Steve worked hard to get a diverse group of people on the team to allow many perspectives to be considered in creation of the methodology .
Their team member list is can be seen in Table 1 .
You will notice that members are from various functional areas and they all have different points of view on what a methodology should do , just like your team will .
Table 1 : Acme Media 's Core Team .
Core teams are composed of cross functional team members with various levels of Agile knowledge .
The diversity of the team works well for scrutinizing the new process .
Functional Area / Role Name Background Sponsor / CIO
Steve Winters Six Sigma enthusiast .
Does not believe in change for the sake of change .
Willing to pilot Agile and see if the benefits manifest .
Project Management Wendy Johnson Frustrated with the status quo .
Lately quoting Dr. Phil
" If it ai n't working you 've got to try something else " .
Wants a methodology that reflects the reality of how software is developed .
Development Roy Williams Familiar with XP development techniques , but very comfortable with the waterfall process that Acme has used the last few years .
Quality Assurance Vijay Kumar Concerned that Agile will bypass or minimize the need for testing .
Experience working in an ISO environment .
Frequently says " document what you do , do what you document " .
Operations Matt Shiler Lives in a stressful world of managing production issues and deployment of new functionality .
Worried that he will not have enough time to work with the core team .
Requirements Wes Hunter An Agile zealot .
Been looking forward to this day for a long time .
Dedicated to making Agile work at Acme. Works with Product Management to refine feature design for customers .
Architecture Keith Gastineau
Wants to make sure that an Agile methodology does not bypass good architecture practices , and there is enough time to build the infrastructure needed for projects .
Product Management Peggy Romani Unfamiliar with Agile but excited of the promise to embrace the customer and changing requirements .
Identifies target markets and strategic needs of the products .
Just like Acme , you will need to get manager approval for the employees you select for your team .
The managers will probably be looking for a time estimate from you .
The first few weeks I like to see the core team meet twice a week for two hours each meeting .
You can also assume each team member will get a couple of hours of Agile homework a week ( researching existing development methods , etc. ) .
A good number to give the managers is 6 hours a week for three months .
The duration will decrease over the three months .
You may see the weekly meetings reduced to one hour , but to be safe still ask for 6 hours per week for three months .
Better to promise late and deliver early .
After team selection you need to meet with the members and set expectations .

WASHINGTON  Does a messy neighborhood make a difference on how people act ?
It sure does !
Graffiti on the walls , trash in the street , bicycles chained to a fence , all resulted in a decline in how people behaved in a series of experiments .
A bit of litter or graffiti did n't lead to predatory crime , but actions ranging from littering to trespassing and minor stealing all increased when people saw evidence of others ignoring the rules of good behavior , Dutch researchers report in Thursday 's online edition of the journal Science .
In normal behavior most people try to act appropriately to the circumstances , explained lead author Kees Keizer of the faculty of behavioral and social sciences at the University of Groningen , Netherlands .
But some tend to avoid effort or seek ways to gain for themselves .
Things like littering an area or applying graffiti change the circumstances by indicating that others are not behaving correctly , which weakens the incentive for people to do the right thing .
So the researchers were not surprised that people littered more in messy area , for example .
But , added Keizer : " We were , however , surprised by the size of the effect . "
Here 's an example .
The researchers found a tidy alley in a shopping area where people parked their bicycles .
There was a no-littering sign on the wall .
The researchers attached flyers for a nonexistent store to the bike handlebars and observed behavior .
Under normal circumstances , 33 % of riders littered the alley with the flyer .
But after researchers defaced the alley wall with graffiti , the share of riders who littered with the flyers jumped to 69 % .
They did a half - dozen similar experiments , all with similar results .
While the study seems to deliver a negative message , Keizer pointed out that " it also shows that municipal officials and the public can have a significant impact on the influence of norms and rules on behavior . "
In other words , keep public areas neat and people will be less likely to make a mess .
The work is related to the " Broken Window Theory , " which suggests that urban disorder such as broken windows and graffiti encourage petty crime .
This research does n't go that far , said Robert J. Sampson , chairman of Harvard University 's department of sociology .
" It 's an interesting study , it 's very clever .
And the results are believable within the limited bounds set by their design , " said Sampson , who was not part of the research team .
But the results do n't show that disorder spreads to predatory crime , he said , what they show is that disorder increases people 's likelihood of committing ( similar ) acts . "
In addition to the alley with graffiti , here 's how the experiments worked : Test Two : A fence partly closed off the main entrance to a parking lot .
There was a narrow gap and a no-admittance sign that pointed out a new entry , 200 yards away .
A second sign prohibited locking bikes to the fence .
When the fence was clear , 27 % of people heading for their cars ignored the no-admittance sign and squeezed through the gap in the fence .
But after several bikes were locked to the fence in defiance of that ban , 82 % of people going to their cars squeezed through the prohibited entry .
Test Three : Flyers were placed under the windshield wipers of cars in a parking garage next to a market .
A sign on the wall asked people to return their shopping carts to the market .
When the lot was clear of shopping carts , 30 % of drivers littered the lot with the flyers .
But when a few carts were left in a disorderly state around the garage , 58 % of people littered .
Test Four :
Two weeks before New Year 's Day researchers visited a bicycle parking shed near a train station and attached flyers to the handlebars .
Under normal conditions 52 % of the riders littered the shed with the flyers .
Then the researchers set off fireworks outside the shed — which residents know is illegal in the period before New Year .
Hearing the fireworks , 80 % of riders littered the shed .
Tests Five and Six :
An envelope with money visible through the address window was placed sticking out of a mailbox .
Under ordinary conditions 13 % of passersby stole the envelope .
When the same mailbox was defaced with graffiti the percentage taking the money jumped to 27 % .
After researchers cleaned the mailbox , but messed up the area around it with litter , 25 % stole the money .

Kasab had months of training before the attack where he was instructed in the use of military weapons and explosives .
He and his fellow attackers , aged between 18 and 28 , were also drilled in close quarter combat .
An Australian witness , Ray Lacey , who saw the attackers in the foyer of the Taj Mahal , said they were highly disciplined and did not waste bullets .
Kasab told investigators they were instructed to conserve their ammunition so they could sustain their attack for as long as possible .
" I have done right .
I have no regrets . "
Kasab told interrogators that most of the volunteers for the suicide mission spoke Punjabi .
They were given false identities and were discouraged from interacting with each other beyond what was barely necessary .
The meticulous planning for the terrorist mission took more than a year , investigators say .
The preparations for the atrocity began in a remote mountain camp in Muzaffarabad , in Pakistan - administered Kashmir .
Associates of the terrorists are understood to have carried out a detailed reconnaissance four months ago .
The mission included the covert acquisition of ships and speed boats and careful study of the tides to allow some of the attackers to enter the city from the Arabian Sea under the cover of darkness .
Kasab told police the attackers had spent time memorising the various targets .
According to the Telegraph newspaper in London , the terrorists were taught marine commando techniques such as beach landings at another camp at the Mangla Dam , located on the border between Pakistan - administered Kashmir and India 's Punjab province .
Kasab was quoted as saying that once their training was complete his team of four travelled to the garrison town of Rawalpindi , where they were joined by another six terrorists , who had been trained at other camps close by .
It was in Rawalpindi that the 10 - man team were briefed in detail with digitised images of their prospective targets - the Taj Mahal and Oberoi Hotels , the Jewish Centre and Victoria Terminus railway station .
Each member of the team memorised street names and routes to each location .
Kasab told his interrogators that most of the targeting information came from a reconnaissance team that had selected the targets earlier in the year .
From Rawalpindi the team moved to the eastern port of Karachi , where they chartered the merchant ship MV Alpha and headed for Mumbai .
It was during this crucial phase , as the cargo ship headed into the Arabian Sea , the terrorists appeared to almost lose their nerve .
The Indian Navy was very active , Kasab was quoted as saying , boarding foreign vessels and searching their holds .
The terrorists thought their plan might be compromised , so on November 15 or 16 the teams used their inflatable speed boats to hijack a fishing boat , the Kuber .
Indian media reported Kasab was one of four terrorists who entered Mumbai with fake identities , posing as overseas students .
They booked into the Taj Mahal hotel four days before the attack and allegedly stockpiled weapons and explosives .
There is great anger in India that a small group of terrorists could mount a siege that paralysed the city for nearly three days .
Yesterday the politician responsible for counter - terrorism , the Home Minister , Shivraj Patel , resigned .
He has been under pressure for months following a spate of attacks in big Indian cities since May .
He resigned amid allegations that authorities received recent warnings that Mumbai was vulnerable to attack from the sea .
Police believe attacks at the Leopold cafe , popular with tourists , and at CST station may have been diversions to provide cover as other members of the gang stormed their two main targets : Mumbai's two luxury Hotels , the Taj Mahel and Trident - Oberoi .
Kasab was pictured , with assault rifle in hand , entering the CST railway terminal where he and another terrorist fired indiscriminately into the packed terminal .
Kasab and his accomplice , Abu Dera Ismail Khan , also shot dead three of Mumbai's top policeman including Anti-terrorism chief , Hemant Karkare .
Kasab was captured at the Girgaum Chowpatty Naka in Mumbai while he was trying to escape in a car he had taken from its owner .
Kasab , understood to speak fluent English , told police he was trained to " kill to the last breath " .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates could approve plans for a major build - up of U.S. forces in Afghanistan before President - elect Barack Obama takes office on January 20 , officials say .

Faced with an intensifying Taliban insurgency , U.S. military planners are working to identify a prospective force of more than 20,000 combat and support troops requested by commanders in Afghanistan , mainly for duty in the poppy - growing South , where the need for more Western forces is greatest .
Some estimates have called for a U.S. force as large as 30,000 troops , officials say , similar in size to the 2007 surge of U.S. forces in Iraq that is credited with helping drive violence levels there down sharply .
Meanwhile , Obama ’s repeated call for more U.S. forces for the war has led the Pentagon to expect little resistance from the incoming administration , officials said .
“ The president - elect has already indicated that he wants to put additional troops in Afghanistan , ” said a senior defense official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not yet been finalized .
By making the decision soon , Gates could begin preparing to deploy forces without actually having to move troops before January 20 , the official said .
That would let the new president move quickly to send additional troops once he takes office , or halt the deployments if he prefers , the official said .
Defense officials say a main obstacle to approval is the ability of planners to locate the desired forces at a time when the military structure remains under strain with 146,000 U.S. troops still in Iraq .
“ Final approval comes when we tell the secretary : ‘ Yeah , we can provide them , ’ ” said another official .
As in Iraq , the force ’s main task would be to enhance security to make way for reconstruction and development projects including the building of local governing institutions capable of resisting the Taliban .
WILL SURGE WORK ?
But current and former U.S. officials have warned that a surge of forces into Afghanistan will not necessarily meet with the same success as the troop build - up in Iraq .
“ Additional troops in Afghanistan may be necessary but they will not , by themselves , be sufficient to lead to the results we saw in Iraq .
A similar confluence of events that contributed to success in Iraq does not appear to exist in Afghanistan , ” former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in a recent newspaper opinion piece .
The addition of 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. forces would expand the current 70,000 - strong Western military presence in Afghanistan to more than 90,000 troops .
The United States now has 32,000 troops in Afghanistan , with 14,000 under NATO command and 18,000 under U.S. command .
But some analysts believe the United States ultimately will need more than 100,000 troops to stabilize Afghanistan before the Afghan army is ready to take over security .
“ I suspect that to succeed in Afghanistan , we ’re eventually going to have to swing a sizable fraction of what we now have in Iraq into Afghanistan , ” said Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations .
“ The scale of the shift will be large , and the time needed to pull it off will be long , ” he said .
The Bush administration has announced plans to send an Army combat brigade to Afghanistan in January .
Gates said last week he wants to send another three brigades of combat ground forces and an aviation brigade , beginning as early as next spring .
A main Pentagon objective is to insert enough U.S. forces into Afghanistan to safeguard elections late in the year .
Analysts said the plan provides enough U.S. , NATO and Afghan forces to secure polling sites and establish checkpoints against suicide bombers in the volatile East and South .
Seth Jones of RAND Corp. , said Afghan and U.S. officials would also need the security cooperation of local tribes and Afghanistan ’s neighbors if the election is to succeed .
“ This has to be done in cooperation with Pakistan and Iran in trying to ensure that those countries are supporting the elections , because both have provided support to the Taliban and a few other insurgent groups , ” Jones said .
Afghanistan ’s lack of infrastructure means the U.S. military must build bases , landing strips , supply depots and other infrastructure necessary to support a larger force .
Look closely .

Comment
Have you ever had the nagging sense that there 's something not quite right with the adulation that follows Malcolm Gladwell - the author of Tipping Point ?
But you could n't quite put your finger on it ?
We 're here to help , dear reader .
Gladwell gave two vanity " performances " in the West End - prompting fevered adulation from the posh papers - the most amazing being this Guardian editorial , titled In Praise of Malcolm Gladwell .
It appears that we have a paradox here .
A substantial subclass of white collar " knowledge workers " hails this successful nonfiction author as fantastically intelligent and full of insight - and yet he causes an outbreak of infantalisation .
He 's better known for his Afro than any big idea , or bold conclusion - and his insights have all the depth and originality of Readers Digest or a Hallmark greeting card .
That 's pretty odd .
So what 's really going on here ?
Who is Malcolm Gladwell ?
What 's he really saying ?
Who are these people who lap it all up ?
And what is it that he 's saying that hold so much appeal ?
Let 's start with the first two first .
The Master at Work
Gladwell is a walking Readers Digest 2.0 : a compendium of pop science anecdotes which boil down very simply to homespun homilies .
Like the Digest , it promises more than it delivers , and like the Digest too , it 's reassuringly predictable .
The most famous book Tipping Point , takes an epidemiological view of social trends and throws in a bit of network theory .
You wo n't draw anything more profound from this than " we 're all connected " - gee ! - and you certainly wo n't get the drawbacks of epidemiology - much of which is now indistinguishable from junk science .
A good book to write would be about how how epidemiology became so debased so quickly : it 's now merely a computer modeling factory for producing health scares , or in the case of British foot - and - mouth disease , catastrophic policy responses that cost billions of pounds .
John Brignell 's
The Epidemiologists [ Amazon reviews / author 's site ] does just that .
( For good measure , Milgram 's Six Degrees theory , has subsequently been debunked since Tipping Point appeared .
Gladwell could have done that himself using a bit of investigative research of his own - but he probably would n't have liked the conclusion . )
The next book , Blink published in 2004 , asks ( in his own words ) - " What is going on inside our heads when we engage in rapid cognition ?
When are snap judgments good and when are they not ?
What kinds of things can we do to make our powers of rapid cognition better ? "
But he ends up pursuing the idea that rationality is overrated - and with only speculative cognitive science to go with , it is n't suprising that this book , too , does n't get to any conclusion .
And the message of the new one ?
Genius takes hard work .
Again , it 's something bleedingly obvious , but which leaves deeper questions unanswered .
Take two geniuses : George Best and Tesla .
What did they offer ?
Why do we admire them so much ?
There 's obviously much more to each of them than perspiration - but we do n't find out , and the book is as flattening and reductive as the others .
Perhaps it 's Gladwell 's stunning oratory that draws the crowds ?
Perhaps he 's such a magnetic performer , that you go for the ride , not the destination ?
But when we see a example of the Master at Work - the evidence seems to suggest otherwise .
( Bear with me - it also sheds some light on the other half of the Gladwell puzzle - the adulation , which begins to look quite creepy . ) .
Treading the bores
Here 's an excerpt of the master strolling the stage at Ted - a presentation called Malcolm Gladwell on Spaghetti Sauce .
Gladwell blathers at great length about an obscure market researcher called Howard Moskowitz .
Who ?
On his own website , Howie calls himself " a well - known experimental psychologist in the field of psychophysics " .
Yet Gladwell describes Moskowitz ' market testing of varieties of soup as if he was an unsung genius of the 20th century .
All this takes up 15 minutes , but it 's so repetitious and predictable , it seems to take about three times as long .
( So much for the dazzling oratory Guardian leader writers admire . )
From this Gladwell draws four lessons .
Firstly , people do n't know what they want - or can't express it .
( And need marketing geniuses to figure this out .
Funny , that . )
Secondly , Gladwell then asserts that horizontal segmentation " democratizes taste " .
This is a very grand claim .
It needs us to assume that there was very little diversity before - or that if it existed , producers and distributors did n't offer it .
Yet step into an old sweet shop , an Italian deli , or a traditional pub serving Scotch malts , and incredible diversity abounds : these are very old recipes too .
You could equally explain consumer diversity because we enjoy greatly increased trade and affluence , combined with the new and cheaper technologies of production , all of which mean that things that were once exotic and exclusive are now available cheaply to us plebs .
The Deli and malts examples suggest that where less - perishable goods could be brought to market in diversity , they were .
No marketing segmentation specialists were needed .
So what Gladwell calls " horizontal segmentation " is a consequence not a cause of increasing trade and affluence , and technologies of storage and distribution .
But hey , that would mean you were using the power of thinking , not Blinking ! - so let 's press on .
Gladwell 's third point promotes a pleasurable brain spasm in the audience - and it introduces his narrative trademark .
He adds a sloppy science generalisation to go with the sloppy marketing generalisation he 's just made .
" Science is not about universals but about variability : genetics has opened the door to understanding of variability , " Gladwell declares .
This is so breathtakingly dumb we 'll have to return to it another day .
It 's a muddled moron 's version of science .
( For the time being , try Anton Wylie 's potted history here ) .
But note the self - serving aspect .
A hundred years ago , Freud 's nephew Louis Bernays came to America and by selling corporate America a cartoon version of his uncle 's ideas , invented modern public relations .
Surely a Gladwell role model , and similar to what he 's doing - only there are n't any covered in his books , and the audience is " democratized " , now : there are tens of thousands of people who can create an Excel pivot table !
And while the Marketing and Media types are still reeling from Point Three , he ends with a little liberal feelgood bromide :
" When we pursue universals in food we 're doing ourselves a disservice ... "
( I think we 've already knocked down that straw man . )
" ... In embracing the diversity of human beings we will find the true way to human happiness . "
So there you 've got Gladwell in essence : he always ends with a Hallmark style greeting telling you something sweet , bland and uplifting - that you already knew .
What does this tell us about the Gladwell fanbase ?
How can we explain the demand ?
Could there be a link between high levels of air pollution and the risk of appendicitis ?
New research presented at the 73rd Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology in Orlando , suggests a novel connection .
" Adult onset appendicitis is a common condition whose cause is unclear and almost universally requires surgery , " explained Dr. Gilaad G. Kaplan of the University of Calgary .
Dr. Kaplan and his colleagues identified more than 5,000 adults who were hospitalized for appendicitis in Calgary between 1999 and 2006 .
The team used data from Environment Canada 's National Air Pollution Surveillance ( NAPS ) monitors that collect hourly levels of ozone , nitrogen dioxide , sulfur dioxide , carbon monoxide , and particulate matter of varying sizes .
Regression analysis was used to evaluate whether short - term daily changes in air pollution levels were related to the development of appendicitis .
More Appendicitis Hospitalizations on " High Ozone " Days
When researchers compared the 5 - day average of ozone concentrations prior to admission to the hospital , patients were approximately 15 percent more likely to be hospitalized for appendicitis on days of highest ozone concentrations compared to days of lowest ozone concentrations .
Similar findings were seen for sulfur dioxide , nitrogen dioxide , and particulate matter , though with lower effect .
Notably , the effect of air pollution was strongest during the summer months , when people were more likely to be outside .
Exposure to air pollutants , particularly ozone , was associated with a modest increased risk of developing appendicitis .
Previous studies have shown that air pollution may promote other disease states through inflammation , and this may be the mechanism by which air pollution increases the risk of appendicitis .
" If the relationship between air pollution and appendicitis is confirmed , then improving air quality may prevent the occurrence of appendicitis in some individuals , " said Dr. Kaplan .

Published : Wednesday October 29 , 2008
Print This Email This Vice presidential contender Sarah Palin told ABC in an interview to air Thursday that she 's not going to leave national politics if she does n't enter the White House in January , fueling speculation that she 's considering running for President in 2012 .
" I think that , if I were to give up and wave a white flag of surrender against some of the political shots that we 've taken ... I 'm not doin ' this for naught , " Palin told ABC 's Elizabeth Vargas on being asked .
CNN 's Dana Bash told cohort Wolf Blitzer that a senior McCain advisor was rendered " speechless " by Palin 's comment .
" There was a long pause , and then I just heard a ' Huh. ' on the other end of the phone .
I mean , this is certainly not a surprise to anybody who has watched Sarah Palin that she is interested in potentially ... a future national run .
Certainly she is being urged to by a lot of people inside the Republican Party if they do lose . "
Gov. Palin has already been called a " diva " and " rogue " by people within the McCain campaign who see her straying from prescribed narrative in her speeches , having " lost confidence in most of the people on the plane . "
" When two mavericks join up they do n't agree on everything but that 's a lot of fun , " Senator McCain said of the differing viewpoints between himself and his running mate .

MTA police detain activist for refusing to show ID at anti-bailout demonstration

The 4th Amendment States :
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .
The Court Case that is THE CORNERSTONE for any dealings with the police is Terry vs Ohio
I think everyone knows what a SEARCH is but what is a SEIZURE , well the court said ,
“ whenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away , he has ‘ seized ’ that person . ”
Popular Police Reasons They Will Use for Detaining You : CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION , OFFICER SAFETY , ID CHECK , SUSPECTED TERRORIST
For their own protection , police may perform a quick surface search of the person ’s outer clothing for weapons if they have reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is armed .
This reasonable suspicion must be based on “ specific and articulable facts ” and not merely upon an officer ’s hunch .
So the officer must state the reason to a judge and if he can’t , he has violated your constitutional rights and is subject to a lawsuit .
The same proof necessary to obtain a warrant from a judge is the same proof necessary to detain you !
And simple “ ‘ good faith on the part of the arresting officer is not enough . ’ …
If subjective good faith alone were the test , the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate , and the people would be ‘ secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , ’ only in the discretion of the police . ” — quoting Beck v. Ohio , 379 U.S. 89 ( 1964 )
Therefore Officer Discretion is Out The Window
ID Checks are not a lawful detainment excuse , remember you are being SEIZED !!
The officer has to state “ specific and articulable facts ” as to what crime he reasonably believes you are engaging in at that moment .
The answer to an ID request or any other detainment is that you are committing no crime and unless under Terry vs Ohio he can articulate specific facts to a judge that you are engaging in a crime at that moment , the officer needs to stop seizing you under the 4th amendment .
Failure to produce ID on Demand , is no crime .
And by the way , filming in a public place or “ Public Domain ” is allowed unless otherwise posted .
Filming an officer is not unlawful unless it interferes with his work .
For police to use that excuse of course requires them to defend their actions in court with the very footage you are shooting .
Do n’t stop filming and ask if you are no longer in the way or interfering .
If an officer does n’t want to be filmed by you , fine , tell him he has the option to walk away .

Why a Speeding Shark is Like a Golf Ball Scientists discover why sharks can swim so fast .
Nov. 10 , 2008  --
Shortfin mako sharks can shoot through the ocean at up to 50 miles per hour ( 80 kilometres an hour ) .
Now a trick that helps them to reach such speeds has been discovered – the sharks can raise their scales to create tiny wells across the surface of their skin , reducing drag like the dimples on a golf ball .
The minute scales – just 200 micrometers long – are made from tough enamel , such as that found on teeth , giving the skin a rough texture like sandpaper .
Lying flat , they had previously been found to reduce drag as the shark swims .
Some reports had also suggested that sharks can bristle their scales , causing them to stand up on end , so Amy Lang from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and colleagues decided to investigate whether this too could help sharks travel at high speeds .
The team created artificial shark skin with a 16 x 24 array of synthetic scales , each 2 centimetres in length and angled at 90° to the surface of the " skin " .
They then placed the arrangement in a stream of water travelling at a steady 20 centimetres per second .
The water contained silver - coated nanospheres , which a laser illuminated to reveal the nature of the flow around the scales .
Golf - ball effect
The experiments revealed that tiny vortices or whirlpools formed within the cavities between the scales .
These vortices form a kind of " buffer layer " between the skin 's surface and the fast moving fluid , preventing a turbulent wake from forming behind the shark .
Since a wake has a lower pressure than the rest of the fluid , it exerts a backwards pull on an object , decreasing its speed and making it harder to change direction .
Eliminating this wake decreases the overall drag on the shark , allowing it to travel faster and move more easily without the thick , syrupy feeling humans get as they try to move through water .
" It 's like the difference between pushing a box over ball bearings instead of dragging it along the floor , " says Lang .
The same principle explains the dimples on golf balls , which also create mini vortices to reduce drag in this way , she says .
Ultimately , the team hope further investigations could be used to design torpedoes , underwater vehicles , and even aircraft inspired by shark skin that can move more quickly through water and change direction more easily .
Sergei Chernyshenko , an aeronautical engineer from Imperial College London , UK , describes the research as fascinating .
However , he points out that while the team have shown the existence of vortices , they have n't yet quantified the extent of the effect on the shark 's drag , which he thinks could be minimal .
It 's looking more likely that convicted Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) may not be able to hang onto his Senate seat after all .
With about 35,000 ballots left to be counted , Democrat Mark Begich now leads Stevens by 814.votes .
“ I ’ve always said that this would be a close race .
After watching the votes today , I remain cautiously optimistic .
As I have said before , we ran an aggressive campaign , especially when it came to early voting and absentee , " Begich said in a statement .
" From what we ’re seeing , thousands of Alaskans , like me , did come out and vote early .
I ’m confident that Alaskans , like the rest of the country , want a new direction in Washington , and ultimately that will be reflected in the results . ”
More , from the Anchorage Daily News :
Mark Begich made a dramatic comeback Wednesday to overtake Ted Stevens for the lead in Alaska 's U.S. Senate race .
Begich , who was losing after election night , now leads Stevens by 814 votes -- 132,196 to 131,382 -- with the state still to count roughly 35,000 more ballots over the next week .
The state Division of Elections tallied some 60,000 absentee , early and questioned ballots on Wednesday .
The ballots broke heavily in the Democrat 's favor , erasing the 3,000 - vote lead Stevens held after election night Nov. 4 .
Stevens , a 40 - year incumbent , is trying to become the first person ever elected to the U.S. Senate after a being found guilty of felony crimes .
The state still needs to count at least 15,000 questioned ballots and an estimated 20,000 absentee ballots that made it to the Division of Elections after election day last Tuesday .
Most regional elections headquarters will count their remaining ballots on Friday .
But the most populous region , based in Anchorage , wo n't count its ballots until either Monday or Wednesday , state elections chief Gail Fenumiai said .
Begich pushed hard in the campaign for people to vote early , a factor both Democrats and Republicans said contributed to his surge .
More than 9,000 of those early ballots were n't counted until Wednesday in order to give the state time to double check and make sure people did n't vote early and then come back and vote election day as well .
If Begich hangs on , it will be the seventh GOP - held Senate seat the Democrats pick up .

You would think that before people make the largest financial decision in their lives , they would do a monthly budget first .
Yet during this past decade budgets were hardly brought to the forefront and were pushed to the back of any financial decisions .
The new definition of housing affordability should include the idea of maintaining a sustainable long - term budget .
Of course many can afford a two year teaser rate but what happens when the payment jumps up ?
How secure is your employment ?
Do you have enough to save for retirement after you pay for your home each month ?
These are all factors that need to be considered to purchase a home .
I ’ve gotten a few e-mails about buying a home in California .
Of course many people that have been sitting on the fence are now thinking seriously about purchasing a home in the state .
Let us take a look at some numbers first :
California Median Home Price
April 2007 : $ 597,640
July 2008 : $ 350,760
Decline : $ 246,880
Price decline from peak : 41.3 %
* Source : California Association of Realtors
A 41.3 % year over year decline is stunning for a state that is so large .
A year ago 341,130 homes were sold in the entire state .
That works out to a monthly average of 28,427 homes sold per month .
Last month 39,507 homes sold in the state .
Keep in mind that this is a jump but data for the summer is always high .
You can expect this number to decrease .
In addition , most of the sales were foreclosure properties which are pushing prices even lower .
We are going to hypothetically see if you can afford that $ 350,706 median priced home .
The budget below is for a married couple with a $ 75,000 household income :
The first thing we need to figure out is the monthly net income .
The monthly gross income is $ 6,250 but after taxes it will be $ 4,870 .
A rule of thumb that is very generous by most bankers and lenders is your home payment should not be more than one - third of your gross take home pay .
So let us first find out our threshold :
$ 6,250 / 3 = $ 2,083 per month
Above , the family will be purchasing the median priced California home with a 5 percent down payment ( $ 17,535 ) .
As you can see in the budget , the monthly home payment will workout to $ 2,470 which is higher than our threshold figure .
We ’ll go ahead and assume that this couple goes ahead with this move .
You need to realize that it costs money to upkeep your home .
That is lawn care , roof , plumbing , and other things come up throughout the year .
I am simply setting aside $ 100 a month for this but this can jump radically if you need major service like a roof replacement .
In the budget we also have only one car payment at $ 300 per month and we ’ll also assume that this car is highly fuel efficient .
Maybe a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla .
So to a certain extent , this family is living modestly and not extravagantly .
We are also setting aside 10 % into a Roth IRA for retirement and putting away $ 300 a month into an emergency fund .
For a married couple $ 500 a month in groceries is doable .
I know some will argue that this is too low / high but this can be done .
We are also assuming this couple is n’t eating out during the work week and brown bagging their lunch .
So can this couple afford the home ?
The answer is no at least if we follow our initial definition .
Yes , a lender may give you a loan especially it they use a home to income ratio ( HTI ) and do n’t look at a debt to income ratio which will include the car and any other credit cards they may have .
At this level , your monthly home payment is consuming 50 % of your monthly net take home pay .
I would argue that you should use your net monthly pay to calculate what you can safely afford .
That is for this couple , they can afford a home with a monthly payment no larger than :
$ 4,870 / 3 = $ 1,623 per month
This works out to a home priced around $ 250,000 .
This may seem like a boring figure but keep in mind the median household income for California is $ 55,734 .
In inflation adjusted terms , Californians are actually poorer than in 2000 when the median income was $ 56,638 .
In fact there are very few counties that have a median household income that comes close to $ 75,000 .
Orange County which is viewed as a more affluent Southern California county has a median household income of approximately $ 70,000 .
The current median home price in Orange County is $ 461,000 .
The trend in California is unmistakable .
Prices are still coming down and if you really dig deep in to a budget like the above , which I imagine is on the conservative side you can understand why so few families can afford homes in the state even after a stunning 41.3 % drop .
Hopefully this article allows you to plug in your own numbers to determine whether you can afford a home .
If you cannot , there really is n’t a rush to do so .
Prices are still trending lower .

OSLO ( Reuters ) - The Yangtze River dolphin , the Christmas Island shrew and the Venezuelan skunk frog are all victims in an alarming flood of extinctions , but how do scientists decide when such “ possibly extinct ” creatures no longer exist ?

The United Nations says the world faces the worst spate of extinctions since the dinosaurs vanished 65 million years ago , with man -made threats such as rising populations , felling of forests , hunting , pollution and climate change .
Yet proving that any individual species has gone the way of the dodo necessarily demands long , fruitless searching .
“ If there ’s one thing in my career I ’d like to be proved wrong about , it ’s the baiji , ” said Sam Turvey of the Zoological Society of London , using another name for the Yangtze River dolphin .
Turvey spent almost 3 months this year interviewing Chinese fishermen in vain for sightings of the long - snouted dolphin , which has not been seen since 2002 .
Some colleagues in China are still looking .
The baiji was almost declared extinct in 2006 after an acoustic and visual survey of the river turned up nothing .
Then , a blurry video gave experts pause , and it was rated “ possibly extinct . ”
About 300 plant and animal species , including the Christmas Island shrew and the Venezuelan skunk frog are also “ possibly extinct , ” the worst category short of extinction , according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ’s ( IUCN ) Red List .
If Turvey ’s study turns up no firm evidence , it will likely push the Yangtze River dolphin into the “ extinct ” column , said Mike Hoffmann , who manages a global project to assess species for the IUCN and Conservation International .
It would be the first “ megafauna ” mammal -- one weighing more than 100 kg ( 220 lb ) -- to die out since the Caribbean monk seal in the 1950s .
“ To say something is extinct requires quite a lot of proof , of negative evidence , and may take many years to collect , ” said Craig Hilton - Taylor , who manages Red List .
Scientists working on the “ possibly extinct ” list rummage in the undergrowth for rare plants , frogs or rats , set up night - time traps for bats or moths , or scour the seabed for corals .
Some experts liken the difficulties to “ proving ” that the mythical Loch Ness Monster does not exist .
The Christmas Island shrew has not been seen on its Australian island since 1985 .
The Venezuelan skunk frog , known from a cloud forest habitat of 10 sq km ( 3.9 sq mile ) , has not been spotted despite repeated searches .
Despite the difficulties of proof , scientists say species are disappearing at an ever faster rate .
Some 76 mammals have gone extinct since 1500 , a much faster rate than in previous centuries , and 29 are “ possibly extinct ” on the 2008 Red List .
BACK FROM THE DEAD
Extinct species have often unknown economic value , such as the Australian gastric brooding frog , which incubated its young in its stomach and might have pointed to ways to treat ulcers .
Or South Africa ’s bluebuck antelope , which could have boosted tourism .
While most news is bleak , a few “ Lazarus ” species give cause for celebration -- last year , a lizard presumed extinct turned up on La Palma in Spain ’s Canary Islands after no sightings in 500 years .
Australian scientists were even delighted to find two dead night parrots in 2006 and 1990 , taken as signs the reclusive species survives .
A few years ago the fabulous green sphinx moth , known from one Hawaiian island , was written off as extinct but then experts on another island were flabbergasted to catch one in a net .
Nevertheless , Hoffmann said Red List ’s demands for evidence meant that it probably underestimated the pace of extinctions .
Searches have to be rigorous , at the right seasons , and in nearby habitats , with the correct equipment .
“ Scientists want to be cautious ” because of the finality of extinction , Hoffman said .
“ Possibly extinct ” is a category so bleak that it does not even include the critically endangered ivory - billed woodpecker -- subject of speculation about a U.S. comeback after reported sightings in Arkansas in 2004 .
“ It has never been listed as ‘ possibly extinct ’ because there were sightings 20 to 30 years ago in Cuba , ” Hilton - Taylor said .
“ There is still good habitat there . ”
One result of declaring a species extinct is that it inevitably ends cash for conservation -- lending agencies such as the Global Environment Facility use Red List data .
And , when one species goes extinct , new ones become endangered , as is happening on the Yangtze River , where the finless porpoise and the Chinese paddlefish , reported to grow up to 7 meters ( 23 feet ) , are also in danger .
“ The problem with the Yangtze is that the threats are still there and they are escalating , ” Turvey said .
And there are wider threats .
The U.N. Climate Panel said in 2007 that up to 30 percent of species will face increasing risks of extinction if temperatures rise by another 1 degree Celsius ( 1.8 Fahrenheit ) .
The panel , which says temperatures rose 0.7 C in the 20th century , also forecasts more droughts , heatwaves and rising seas linked to human emissions of greenhouse gases spurred mainly by burning fossil fuels .
In a 2006 report , Birdlife expert Stuart Butchart wrote that 150 bird species had gone extinct since 1500 , or 0.3 a year .
That was 30 -300 times the background rate of extinctions -- a natural process deduced from fossil records .
And no one knows the number of species on earth -- one U.N. - backed study estimated 5 - 30 million against about 2 million documented so far .
The U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity estimates they may be vanishing faster than they are found , at a rate of three per hour , the fastest in millions of years .

The development of highly secure , low defect software will be dramatically helped by the release of the Tokeneer research project to the open source community by the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) .
The Tokeneer project was commissioned by the NSA from Praxis High Integrity Systems as a demonstrator of high - assurance software engineering .
Developed using Praxis’ Correctness by Construction ( CbyC ) methodology it uses the SPARK Ada language and AdaCore ’s GNAT Pro environment .
The project has demonstrated how to meet or exceed Evaluation Assurance Level ( EAL ) 5 in the Common Criteria thus demonstrating a path towards the highest levels of security assurance .
The unprecedented release of the project into the open source community aims to demonstrate how highly secure software can be developed cost - effectively , improving industrial practice and providing a starting point for teaching and academic research .
Originally showcased in a conference paper in 2006 , it has the long - term aim of improving the development practices of NSA ’s contractors .
Tokeneer was created as a fixed - price project , taking just 260 person days to create nearly 10,000 lines of high - assurance code , achieving lower development costs than traditional methods per line of code .
Tokeneer has been written in SPARK Ada , a high level programming language designed for high - assurance applications .
Originally a subset of the Ada language , it is designed in such a way that all SPARK programs are legal Ada programs .
Ada is the natural choice for mission - critical , high - integrity systems due to its combination of flexibility , reliability and ease of use , and SPARK further adds a static verification toolset that combines depth , soundness , efficiency and formal guarantees .
The project is aimed at both the industrial and academic communities , forming an ideal base for further research in program verification and as a high level teaching aid for educators .
It will also be contributed to the Verified Software Repository under the auspices of the current “ Grand Challenge ” in Dependable Systems Evolution .
The project materials , including requirements , security target , specifications , designs , source code , and proofs are now available here .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President - elect Barack Obama has promised broad changes to U.S. health care , pledging to bring health insurance to millions of Americans and to spend $ 50 billion to take American health records electronic , but he must struggle to find the money to do it .

Polls show more than 80 percent of Americans want health care reform .
But even with a Democratic - controlled Congress , Obama , who won a solid victory in Tuesday ’s U.S. election and takes power in January , has hard work ahead of him , health experts agree .
“ This is n’t the classic crisis that lets someone show his greatness , ” said Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Henry Aaron .
Aaron noted that Congress will be wary of spending money on anything , having just given a $ 700 billion stimulus package to the financial industry and struggling with a $ 455 billion budget deficit .
“ It is a bunch of messy problems that really are political minefields , ” Aaron said in a telephone interview .
Voters put health care reform as their third biggest concern , after the economy and the war in Iraq .
Some 47 million people in the United States do not have health insurance .
Obama wants to create a National Health Insurance Exchange to help individuals and small businesses buy private insurance .
He promised to require health care for all children , and expand Medicaid , the government - run health program for the poor , and the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program or SCHIP .
“ I do think that health reform will be a major priority in the new administration , ” Commonwealth Fund president Karen Davis said in a telephone interview .
“ It ’s something that he personally feels needs to be addressed , ” added Davis , whose private foundation advocates better U.S. health care .
“ It ’s a campaign that has set up the conditions for action on health reform .
It would be very hard for him to run for re-election in four years not having acted on that commitment . ”
Although not all congressional races have been finally decided , Democrats do not appear to have a filibuster - proof 60 - seat majority in the Senate and in any case , some new members of Congress will be keenly aware that they do not have strongly Democratic bases .
“ Some of those newly elected members will be from marginal districts and consequently they are going to have to be very careful , ” Aaron said .
He noted that money would be very tight with a widely predicted recession cutting into revenues .
RECESSION AND ALLIGATORS
But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid predicted the momentum for change would be there .
“ We have no alternative , ” Reid told National Public Radio on Wednesday morning .
“ A wave of hope has swept the country . ”
Reid said Republicans would not dare to block legislation , given Tuesday ’s voter mandate .
Former U.S. surgeon general Dr. Richard Carmona said he did not see much trouble ahead for health care legislation .
“ We feel that it is truly a bipartisan agenda , ” he said .
The work may have to be done one bit at a time , however , experts agreed .
“ If the health care reform issue is White House driven , my guess is it is going to be piecemeal , step by step , ” Aaron said .
“ But it could be led from the Senate because Senator ( Edward ) Kennedy is reliably reported to be working on developing a major bill .
He will have a lot of support , ” Aaron added .
The Massachusetts Democrat will have backing not only because of his seniority but because such legislation is likely to be the “ last major action from one of the more highly regarded and respected members of the U.S. Senate . ”
Kennedy , 76 , was diagnosed with a brain tumor in May .
SCHIP might offer a first opportunity for Obama to take a bite at health care , Davis and Aaron agreed .
“ Congress passed a very extensive expansion of the program this year -- twice it was vetoed by President ( George W. ) Bush , ” Davis said .
“ That is going to be the first health policy debate , ” he said .
SCHIP must be reauthorized in March 2009 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Poverty in the United States is spreading from rural and inner-city areas to the suburbs , according to a study , a situation that can worsen as the economy confronts what may be a protracted recession .
A sign reading ' Foreclosure For Sale ' is posted on a house in the Boston suburb of Dedham , Massachusetts March 15 , 2007 .

The study by the Federal Reserve ’s Community Affairs department and the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program found that poverty levels in the world ’s richest nation were on the rise .
“ It shows that concentrated poverty is still very much with us , and that it can be found among a much more diverse set of communities and families than previous research has emphasized , ” said Bruce Katz , a director Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program .
“ Poverty is spreading and may be re-clustering in suburbs , where a majority of America ’s metropolitan poor now live . ”
The study was released ahead of next week ’s conference on concentrated poverty at the Fed .
It shied away from explaining the causes of poverty , but past research have linked the phenomenon to loss of jobs in manufacturing , agriculture and mining .
With the U.S. economic outlook rapidly deteriorating , poverty could get worse .
The U.S. housing market collapse has unleashed the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , forcing business to scale back on investments and driving the unemployment rate to a 14 - year high .
Data on Tuesday showed the U.S. economy contracted 0.5 percent in the third quarter , its fastest pace in seven - years , with consumer spending dropping to a 28 - year low .
Many analysts believe the United States already has joined Europe in recession , though it will take another quarter of contraction to meet a widely used definition for it -- back - to - back quarters of declining output .
The study noted that a strong economy had helped to reduce the incidence of concentrated poverty across the United States , but the process might have stalled during the current decade .
“ Not only does concentrated poverty affect the big , older inner cities in the North , but it also exists within smaller cities in the South and West , ” said Katz .
“ While the case studies in this report point to unique factors that accompanied rising poverty in each of these communities , the negative consequences ring familiar across places , big and small ... African American , white , Latino and Native American .
Ron Paul : Republican brand is ' in big trouble ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday October 24 , 2008
Print This Email This CNN's John Roberts spoke to Rep. Ron Paul on Thursday about the upcoming presidential election and the possibility that the Republicans could take a beating at the polls .
However , he started off with a question about former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , asking , " Do you even listen to him any more ? "
" I have to , because somebody like you might ask me a question about him ! "
Paul joked .
" I used to listen to him when he was writing back in the 60s , " Paul continued , " because he agreed with free market economics and no respect for the Federal Reserve .
Lately though , he 's been part of it -- and right now , he 's really gotten bad , because what he was saying yesterday was that the only place where he might have made a mistake is he did n't advocate more regulations . "
In the 1960s Greenspan was a prominent follower of Ayn Rand and contributed articles to her Objectivist Newsletter .
Paul has stated that he was also strongly influenced by Rand 's ideas at that time , although " she did n't like libertarians . "
Roberts then asked , " If Republicans really take a beating ... where does that leave the Republican brand ? "
" I think they 're in big trouble , " Paul replied .
" They 've sort of lost their way . "
He added that whichever candidate wins the election , " The country 's in a mess regardless .
But I think the Republican Party 's really in a mess . "
However , Paul implied that it would n't bother him greatly even if the Republican Party takes 20 years to recover , as it did after Watergate , because " if both parties have bad ideas , it does n't matter a lot . "
Roberts also asked Paul about his presence on the presidential ballot in Montana , where he is polling 4 % and some Republicans worry he might tip the state to Barack Obama .
" I think it would be a pretty far stretch , if McCain loses the election , to blame me , " Paul replied .
" I have n't been campaigning in Montana .
People who are supporting me out there are spontaneous , they 're enthusiastic , they do n't like either candidate . "
" I do n't think the person whose name they picked is the one that does the spoiling , " Paul concluded .
" I think there 's something else that is wrong . "

If you asked me , what ’s the one thing you do well , I would say : Hire people .
Not every hire I ’ve ever made has worked out ( I can think of two that have n’t out of about 15 I ’ve made ) , but I ’ve learned from my mistakes .
Today , I ’m quite confident that I have the best people in the business working for me .
If I can be allowed to brag : I ’ve hired very well over the past two years .
What ’s my secret ?
It ’s a book : First , Break All the Rules .
It taught me an important lesson :
Ask interview questions designed to elicit specific answers , and design your questions to uncover the talents needed for the job you need to fill .
The key word there is talents .
Hire for talents , not for skills .
Skills can be taught , but talent is something either a person has on day one of a new job , or they do n’t .
You ca n’t hope that a new hire will at some later date develop the talent you want .
People can improve in any number of ways , but there ’s no guarantee , so do n’t bet the future of your company on the hope that somebody will develop some hidden talent .
This post is not an endorsement of Barack Obama , but in watching CBS evening news tonight , I noticed that Barack Obama and John McCain answered a question from Katie Couric very differently .
The answers illustrate perfectly the difference between answering a question with specificity versus answering with wiggle words designed to hide the fact the person being interviewed really does n’t have a good answer to the question .
People with the talent related to the question can readily offer up specifics , while people who are trying to bull shit you retreat to broad , general language .
The question Katie asked was simple and maybe not a great political interview question , but it ’s also the kind of question that can elicit very revealing answers .
Katie asked , “ When is the last time you cried ? ”
From a job interview perspective , it ’s a great question ( merely , I mean in construction ; I ’m not suggesting you use this specific question in a job interview … not in the least ! ) , because an honest answer can lead to only a single , specific answer , and anybody who ca n’t give a specific answer really does n’t have an answer .
Here ’s the start of Obama ’s answer :
Barack Obama :
This one is actually easy .
It was Malia , my 10 - year - old daughter ’s , birthday party .
We were in Montana .
And you know , she ’s a Fourth of July baby .
So often times , during this campaign , we ’d be traveling during birthdays .
And so we were in this small hotel , I think a Holiday Inn , and we had this big public thing .
The staff organized for a smaller family party .
And we were in this little , non-descript conference room , with Malia and Sasha , Michelle , me , my sister , my brother - in - law and my niece .
Read the rest , but take note of the clear memory , the specificity .
Obama is talking about a clear event that answers the question exactly as asked .
It tells a lot about his values .
Here ’s McCain ’s answer :
John McCain : I cry regularly .
Couric :
You do ?
McCain : Aw , yeah .
You know , I ’m very sentimental .
When I see these young people who are serving .
I met a woman at a town hall meeting the other day who had lost her son in Iraq .
And , I was so touched , because she talked about how proud she was of his service .
And what a fine young person he was .
And whenever you have that experience , obviously you think , how could I ever – how could I cope with such a tragedy , you know ?
And so you know , when I say cry , I get – my eyes well up , as they are right now thinking about these brave Americans and their families who have sacrificed so much for their country , especially recently .
Notice how McCain buys time with a very non-specific proclamation he believes is what the interviewer wants to hear , and then offers up an example that is neither all that specific and certainly not specific to him , but could be any body ’s experience .
He is telling you what he wants you to believe he values , not necessarily what he really values .
If you put this in “ talent ” terms , the talent Couric ’s question would likely uncover would be related to emotional capacity .
If that was a talent you needed for a job — maybe you ’re hiring a sob - sister reporter — then this would be a good question to ask .
It ’s well constructed for that purpose because it asks a questioned with only one correct answer :
An answer that offers a specific and very real example .
I ’m not so sure “ emotional capacity ” is a required talent for president of the United States — it could be a good thing or bad thing , depending on your view point .
At least , the question was designed to elicit an explicit , revealing answer .
Again , I ’m not endorsing Obama ( I ’m most likely to vote third party , if you must know ) , but if this were a job interview , with more questions to come , Obama would still be in the running and I ’d be looking for a polite way to wrap up my meeting with McCain because there is no way I would hire him after that answer .

Photography aficionados can be just as fussy and impossible - to - please as audio geeks .
Only the most expensive , elite gear is good enough , and even then there are endless debates over which is the elitest .
Consequently , you do n't find much information on Linux as a high - quality digital photography platform .
In fact if you can find anything that is n't Adobe Photoshop - centric that means you have mighty searching powers because the digital photography world worships at the Photoshop altar .
Books , articles , and training courses mostly teach Photoshop as though it were photography itself .
Me , I think giving so much as one devalued red cent to Adobe is equivalent to saying " Why yes , I am for corrupt corporate control of everything and vandalism of fundamental civil rights " because of what they did to Dmitry Sklyarov .
To this day no one at Adobe has apologized or admitted error ; they stubbornly cling to the " we must protect our precious IP " party line .
Call me a moldy old hippie , but in my world due process , fairness , and civil rights trump Adobe 's precious IP .
Which was n't so precious at all , but closer to laughable .
Which is why we have the fun lovin ' abomination called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , the bought - and - paid - for refuge of greedy incompetent thieving rights - holder everywhere .
( Everywhere in the US , that is . )
Linux Digital Photography Studio
Digikam is an awesome all - in - one photo archiving and management , editing , and printing application .
It 's not an advanced editor like Gimp and Krita , but its feature set is comprehensive enough that you wo n't need Gimp or Krita for every editing job .
It includes dcraw for high - quality RAW file manipulation , all kinds of handy batch processes , tags for organizing vast quantities of photos , and a super - nice composition and cropping editor .
Even though Gimp still lags behind the resolution of modern digital cameras and supports only 8 - bit RGB , it 's still more than good enough for Web images and darned good printed photos .
You 'll have to compare to very high - end color printing to see the differences that higher resolution and more accurate color management make .
It 's just a matter of time until Gimp delivers 24 - and 32 - bit depths and CMYK ; the current release incorporates the GEGL image - processing framework for the first time , which supports these higher resolutions and more color spaces .
It 's still buggy , but it 's on its way .
I gave Krita my vote as the real " Photoshop killer " , and I still feel that way .
It supports more color spaces than any other Linux application , and it was designed from the ground up to meet the needs of professionals .
Though now that Gimp is moving to GEGL , I can say that Linux will someday have two " Photoshop killers " .
The biggest difference will be the sheer numbers of plugins available for Photoshop ; everyone in the world writes Photoshop plugins .
Color management is a big issue for professional - quality work .
Everything in your toolchain must have accurate ICC ( International Color Consortium ) profiles : camera , monitor , scanner , and printer .
This is how you get predictable , accurate colors without a lot of trial - and - error .
For Linux try the ColorVision Spyder2 with the ArgyllCMS software .
Printer drivers are still the big PITA for Linux users .
Here we are eight years into the new millennium and Linux is still the unwanted stepchild .
Even when we get good - quality drivers we usually do n't get the nice management and fine - tweakage software that Windows gets .
Canon and Epson rule the roost for high - quality photo printing , though beware of Epson 's dye - based inks -- they clog the printer heads and drive you crazy and waste your money .
If CUPS does n't include good drivers for your color photo printer , try the TurboPrint drivers .
And now , the obligatory photos : Stash cat on the fence , and Pups .

A Bit of History
When Adobe learned that Mr. Sklyarov was coming to DefCon in Las Vegas in July 2001 to give a talk on this , corporate officials pressured the FBI into arresting him on the grounds that he was committing a flagrant DMCA violation .
To their discredit the FBI went along with it .
To make a long story short , Mr. Sklyarov spent about three weeks first in jail and then a federal lockup , and after his release on bail he was not allowed to return home until mid-December , and then only after agreeing to testify against ElcomSoft .
So he was detained and kept from his family and home for five months .
In December 2002 ElcomSoft was put on trial in San Jose , California , and after two weeks of testimony found not guilty .
Which was a good verdict considering that what Mr. Sklyarov and ElcomSoft did is not illegal in Russia , and until the DMCA was n't illegal in the US either .
Hurrah for freedom and democracy .
There is still a lot of information about the case online , so anyone wanting more details can easily find them .
Budweiser is the most popular beer in the US
Belgium - based brewer InBev has said it had closed its $ 52bn ( £ 35 bn ) takeover of the US 's Anheuser - Busch to create the world 's largest brewer .
" Effective today , InBev has changed its name to Anheuser - Busch InBev , " InBev said in a statement .
The new company will be one of the leading consumer products firms in the world .
Anheuser makes Budweiser - the most popular beer in the US - while InBev produces Stella Artois and Beck's .
InBev agreed to sell its Labatt USA business and associated licenses to get approval from the US Justice Department on anti-trust grounds .
46 billion litres of beer
Some US politicians had expressed anger at the prospect of Anheuser - Busch being taken over by a foreign company .
COMBINED BEER BRAND MENU Stella , Budweiser , Beck's , Hoegaarden , Leffe , Brahma , Staropramen , Michelob , Rolling Rock
InBev , itself formed by a giant merger of Brazil 's AmBev and Belgium 's Interbrew several years ago , has promised that Budweiser 's headquarters would remain in St Louis , Missouri while none of Anheuser - Busch 's US breweries will be closed .
The combined business will have annual sales of $ 36.4bn , equivalent to 46 billion litres of beer a year .
The two firms have said the deal will generate annual savings of $ 1.5 bn but have suggested that job losses will be kept to a minimum because there is little current overlap between the two businesses .
Anheuser - Busch controls nearly half of the US market , while InBev is strong in Western European and Latin American markets .
It also owns stakes in Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo and Chinese brewer Tsingtao .
The deal should give Budweiser a platform to boost its growth in Europe where , apart from a number of markets like the UK , it has been relatively weak .
We are often told that there is a consensus that global warming is real and human caused .
Because of this , a group of global warming skeptics put together a petition to sign that indicates there is a consensus that the evidence is weak or nonexistent for anthropogenic global warming .
So , here we have competing consensus claims on the same issue .
What is a skeptic to think ?
To find out , read on …
Misleading by Petition
Just What is the Consensus on Global Warming ?
by Gary J. Whittenberger Ph.D .
Is global warming a real phenomenon , and if so , are humans causing or contributing to it by burning fossil fuels and will it lead to an increased frequency and / or severity of natural disasters ?
The American public looks to science or scientists to help answer these questions .
A petition circulated by a small group of scientists is creating quite a stir , arousing considerable praise and disdain from groups on different sides of the global warming issue .
The petition drive was begun by Dr. Frederick Seitz , now deceased , and is now led by Dr. Arthur Robinson and his son , Dr. Noah Robinson , both members of the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine ( OISM ) , who remain the chief organizers and expositors of the petition project .
Seitz was a physicist and past president of both the National Academy of Sciences and Rockefeller University .
The two Robinsons are both chemists and Arthur Robinson is the current director of OISM .
According to the website which reports the details of the petition and is presumably authored by Arthur Robinson , “ the purpose of the Petition Project is to demonstrate that the claim of “ settled science ” and an overwhelming “ consensus ” in favor of the hypothesis of humancaused global warming and consequent climatological damage is wrong . ” 1 Robinson asserts not just that his collection of 31,072 signatures on a petition has refuted the claim of “ settled science ” and “ overwhelming consensus ” among scientists with regard to global warming , but that “ The very large number of petition signers demonstrates that , if there is a consensus among American scientists , it is in opposition to the humancaused global warming hypothesis rather than in favor of it . ” 2
Not only has Robinson failed to substantiate either of his assertions , he is misleading the American public by implying that his petition fairly represents relevant expert opinion .
To understand the problems with Robinson ’s “ Global Warming Petition Project ” , we must first examine how the petition itself was distributed and how signatures were collected .
To a sample of persons on the mailing list of American Men and Women of Science , 3 Robinson sent a petition packet consisting of a petition card , a return envelope , a cover letter from Seitz , and a 12 - page review of the literature on the human - caused global warming hypothesis authored by the two Robinsons and Willie Soon .
4
The two main assertions stated on the petition card were that there is no convincing scientific evidence that the human release of carbon dioxide and other gases is causing harmful atmospheric heating and climate change and that the U.S. government should reject the Kyoto Agreement and any other similar proposals .
Arthur Robinson not only requested that recipients return the signed petition card , if they agreed with its assertions , but also arranged for the recipients to distribute petition packets to their colleagues .
He also enabled other persons to obtain petition packets by simply requesting them through his website , and this procedure ultimately produced five percent of the returned petition cards .
Thus , signed petitions were solicited in three different ways .
Although the website for the petition indicates that checks of credentials and identity were performed for signatories of the returned petitions , and invalid petitions were excluded , how the checks were performed is not described .
Signed petition cards were accepted only if they came from persons who had “ obtained formal educational degrees at the level of Bachelor of Science or higher in appropriate scientific fields ” .5
In the end , “ valid ” and signed petition cards were obtained from 31,072 persons with degrees in the following fields : Earth science ( 3,697 persons or 12 % of the total ) ; computer science and mathematics ( 903 or 3 % ) ; physics and aerospace sciences ( 5,691 or 18 % ) ; chemistry ( 4,796 or 15 % ) ; biology and agriculture ( 2,924 or 9 % ) ; medicine ( 3,069 or 10 % ) ; and engineering and general science ( 9,992 or 32 % ) .
The breakdown according to educational level was : PhD ( 9,021 or 29 % ) ; MS ( 6,961 or 22 % ) ; MD and DVM ( 2,240 or 7 % ) ; and BS or equivalent ( 12,850 or 41 % ) .5
On his website Robinson fails to report the cross-tabulations of fields of expertise and levels of education for his petition respondents .
For example , we are n’t told what percentage of the persons with Earth science expertise had Ph.D. degrees .
Although in one interview Robinson called his petition project a “ survey ” 6 , it is definitely not a survey , and because it is not a well - designed scientific survey of the views of a group of relevant experts , its results cannot be used to reach the conclusions about “ consensus ” that are asserted and hoped for by Robinson .
In the first place , Robinson presents neither a dictionary nor an operational definition of “ consensus ” .
He wants to reach conclusions about a consensus , but he spends no time telling us what he thinks a consensus is .
According to Merriam - Webster ’s Eleventh Collegiate Dictionary , a “ consensus ” may refer to general agreement , unanimity , judgment by most of those concerned , or group solidarity .
Of course if we use the “ unanimity ” definition of “ consensus ” , then Robinson ’s Global Warming Petition Project shows that a consensus of persons with science degrees , even those with relevant degrees , does not support the hypothesis of human - caused global warming .
But this is a trivial conclusion ; we knew this before the petition drive !
The “ unanimity ” definition of “ consensus ” , however , is not the one in which the American public is interested .
If Robinson had been conducting a true survey , he would have offered an operational definition of “ consensus ” before he started his inquiry .
Robinson misleads the public to think that a consensus is defined by some large absolute number of persons .
It is not .
It is determined by a large percentage of persons in a relevant sample .
Does Robinson , or the general public , think of a consensus as agreement within a given group at a level of 75 % , 90 % , or some other percentage ?
He does not tell us .
He reports only the number of persons who sent back signed petition cards , but he reports neither the total number of persons to whom he sent petition cards in the first place nor the number of persons to whom he sent petition cards who subsequently returned only messages of disagreement .
Since Robinson chose to conduct a petition project rather than a well - designed scientific survey , he cannot reach valid conclusions about any consensus , and he should not have attempted to do so .
Had Robinson been interested in finding out the truth about the views of relevant scientists rather than pursuing his own political agenda , he would have given a great deal more consideration to sample selection .
Who is a relevant scientific expert when it comes to evaluating the human - caused global warning hypothesis ?
Robinson seems to have very lenient inclusion criteria .
He even seems to think that persons with Bachelors degrees in mathematics and engineering are relevant and qualified experts on the issue .
This seems to make about as much sense as considering electricians to be experts on plumbing because they have certificates from trade school just as plumbers do .
In a recent e-mail communication with an acquaintance of mine in which he defended his broad inclusion criteria , Robinson said “ In fact , climate science is a very simple discipline .
The data is [ are ] very limited and very easily understood — as is illustrated in our review article … ” 7
I wonder what percentage of climatologists or Earth scientists would agree with Robinson about this .
Robinson does n’t seem to have much respect for their area of specialization .
What reaction might Robinson have if scientists who are not chemists called his area of research on “ deamidation of peptides and proteins ” 8 a “ very simple discipline with very limited data which are very easily understood ” .
I think that the American public would be interested in knowing the views of a more restricted sample than the one used by Robinson .
For the main hypothesis concerning human - caused global warming , it would be desirable to know the opinions of scientists with doctoral degrees in climatology or Earth science who had spent most of their lives studying the relevant phenomena .
A survey of a large random sample of these scientists would be illuminating and helpful .
There are other flaws in Robinson ’s project .
If Robinson had been conducting a real survey rather than a petition drive , he would not have allowed three different ways for persons to participate in his project .
Instead he would have arranged for persons to participate in only one way ; he would have randomly selected participants from a well - defined , qualified and relevant population of scientific experts .
Furthermore , in his petition project Robinson simply asked persons with science degrees to sign the petition if they agreed with its content .
But did they agree with all 20 overlapping propositions embedded in the four sentences of the petition ?
Did they agree with most of them ?
Did they agree with at least 50 % of them ?
We do n’t know .
In a real survey , Robinson would have constructed a questionnaire in which his respondents could have addressed each of the 20 propositions in which he was interested or possibly each of the main propositions actually stated in Al Gore ’s popular book , An Inconvenient Truth , for which Robinson expresses great disdain .9
At the least , in a survey Robinson would have provided five response options for each proposition , something like “ strongly disagree , moderately disagree , neither disagree nor agree , moderately agree , and strongly agree ” .
Or he might have provided a similar scale using anchors such as : “ definitely false , probably false , uncertain if false or true , probably true , definitely true ” .
These response options would have allowed participants the opportunity to more fully express the subtlety and variety of their positions .
Robinson may be a brilliant chemist , but he seems to know almost nothing about the behavioral sciences , especially about conducting sound scientific surveys .
Finally , the petition drive can be viewed as an “ attempt to persuade ” since it included the article reviewing the literature on global warming written by Robinson himself and two others , and it included the cover letter of endorsement from Seitz .
The article and cover letter are bound to be biased towards Robinson ’s point of view .
If Robinson had been interested in finding the truth about expert opinion instead of manipulating that opinion , he would have done one of the following : 1 ) Sent a questionnaire with no accompanying review article or endorsement letter .
( Probably the best option . )
2 ) Sent a review article not written by himself but by an independent expert representative of qualified climatologists .
Or 3 ) Sent two review articles by two qualified climatologists from different perspectives , reaching different conclusions about humancaused global warming .
In conclusion , through his Global Warming Petition Project , Arthur Robinson has solicited the opinions of the wrong group of people in the wrong way and drawn the wrong conclusions about any possible consensus among relevant and qualified scientists regarding the hypothesis of human - caused global warming .
His petition is unqualified to deliver answers about a consensus in which the public is interested .
He has a right to conduct any kind of petition drive he wishes , but he is not ethically entitled to misrepresent his petition as a fair reflection of relevant scientific opinion .
He has confused his political with his scientific aims and misled the public in the process .

Footnotes
There are signs that in the western world ( including the US ) religion is , indeed , beginning a long , slow – although accelerating – decline .
All the statistics show that congregations are falling , mass attendance is diminishing and Christian knowledge is passing inexorably from our culture .
There have been two , or in some cases , three generations of people in this country who have had no connection with church at all .
It plays no part in their life or their thinking .
They are what I term " the religiously indifferent " – they could n't care less whether religion is there or not , just so long as it does n't interfere with their lives .
Such people make up a vast and increasing swath of the population of Britain .
Why is this ?
In order to survive , a religion 's mythology must be imbued into the next generation at an early age , before critical faculties that might prompt resistance develop .
This is Richard Dawkins ' meme theory .
It is also the reason that most Church of England schools are primary schools and that madrassas start the process so early on in children 's lives .
Evangelists know that it takes only three or four generations of unchurched people for the mythology to fall from consciousness , to disappear from the culture .
People find that actually they can manage perfectly well without it .
Religious leaders may despair about how difficult it is to reach " Generation Y " ( roughly , 16 - 25 year olds ) , but if children have reached adolescence and they have not been infected with the religious meme , they will be mainly immune to it .
The only way is to get gentle Jesus into their heads when they 're four or five .
In the developing world we are told that religion is strong and , apparently , unassailable .
We see people in great crowds passionately defending their beliefs from insult , or walking round a giant stone in Mecca .
But one needs to ask : do they really believe what they purport to believe ?
Or is the religious meme so strong in poor countries that it is inescapable ?
Does religion control so much of the culture that it is simply not possible to function as anything other than a religious adherent , whether sincere or not ?
I ask this because I 've noticed recently how many people are telling me : " I 'm not a religious person , but I am spiritual . "
This is rapidly followed by a defensive : " You do n't have to go to church to believe in God . "
And this is what religious leaders should fear far more than the atheism or secularism they like to rail against .
The spiritual - but - not - religious brigade represents a creeping disease that can eventually kill religion .
It 's a way of leaving the church without having the guilt of declaring yourself an atheist .
The founder of the National Secular Society , Charles Bradlaugh , said : " No man sees a religion die " .
That may be so , but religions do eventually die .
History is littered with their corpses .
Until now they have always been replaced .
But one day the human race 's growing indifference to the gods will prove more lethal than any anti-clericalist dagger .
Religion will die .
I am sorry I wo n't be around to see it .

Why Christo Buckley endorses Obama
Christopher Buckley 's endorsement of Barack Obama - followed by his abrupt departure from the back page of the magazine his father founded , National Review - has caused a ripple of contempt from the conservative right .
Nay , make that a tsunami of hostility .
An avalanche of venom .
A cataclysm of ... well , you get the idea .
People are mad .
Good riddance , they say , and do n't let the door hit you on the way out .
Let us proceed , gingerly .
I am not a passive bystander to these events .
Buckley is a friend , as are other members of his family , especially Uncle Reid , with whom I have worked for several years .
National Review is home to many friends , and its online editor , Kathryn Jean Lopez , kindly subscribes to my column .
Like Buckley , I have enjoyed a decent fragging for suggesting that Sarah Palin excuse herself from the Republican ticket .
What gives here ?
What does it mean that the right cannot politely entertain dissenting opinions within its ranks ?
What , if anything , does it portend that Buckley the Younger has bolted from the right , even resigning ( with enthusiastic editorial approval ) from the family flagship ?
Some have opined , ridiculously , that Buckley - son of the famous William F. Buckley - was merely seeking attention .
Christo , as family and friends call him , has written more than a dozen acclaimed books , one of which , " Thank You for Smoking , " became a movie .
In 2004 , he won the Thurber Prize for American Humor for " No Way to Treat a First Lady . "
For 18 years , he edited a magazine , Forbes Life , and otherwise seems to be doing all right .
Other critics have surmised that Buckley 's " betrayal " was a publicity stunt for his newest novel , " Supreme Courtship " ( which I reviewed for National Review ) .
When you 're as funny and write as well as Buckley , you do n't have to resort to stunts .
You are the stunt .
So why did he do it ?
Because he had to .
It 's in his genes .
True believers of whatever stripe too often forget that the men and women who create movements are first and foremost radicals .
Great movements are not the result of relaxing afternoons musing along the Seine but emerge from flames of passion ignited by injustice .
When William F. Buckley created the modern conservative movement , he did n't call a neighborhood meeting and whisper , " Come along now . "
He stood athwart history and yelled , " Stop ! "
His son , though he customarily takes the more circuitous route to the revolution via satire , is now merely answering his father 's original call to political activism .
Paraphrasing Ronald Reagan , the younger Buckley said : " I have n't left the Republican Party .
It left me . "
In 1955 , when William F. Buckley announced his new magazine and explained the reasons for it , he described conservatives as " non-licensed nonconformists " : " Radical conservatives in this country have an interesting time of it , for when they are not being suppressed or mutilated by Liberals , they are being ignored or humiliated by a great many of those of the well - fed Right , whose ignorance and amorality have never been exaggerated for the same reason that one cannot exaggerate infinity . "
Fast - forward half a century , and the old is the new .
Radical conservatives are still having an interesting time of it , though these days they are being mutilated by fellow " conservatives . "
The well - fed Right now cultivates ignorance as a political strategy and humiliates itself when its brightest sons seek sanctuary in the solitude of personal honor .
The truth few wish to utter is that the GOP has abandoned many conservatives , who mostly nurse their angst in private .
Those chickens we keep hearing about have indeed come home to roost .
Years of pandering to the extreme wing - the " kooks " the senior Buckley tried to separate from the right - have created a party no longer attentive to its principles .
Instead , as Christopher Buckley pointed out in a blog post on thedailybeast.com explaining his departure from National Review , eight years of " conservatism " have brought us " a doubled national debt , ruinous expansion of entitlement programs , bridges to nowhere , poster boy Jack Abramoff and an ill - premised , ill - waged war conducted by politicians of breathtaking arrogance . "
Republicans are not short on brainpower - or pride - but they have strayed off course .
They do not , in fact , deserve to win this time , and someone had to remind them why .
Christopher Buckley , ever the swashbuckling heir to his father 's defiant spirit , walked the plank so that the sinking mother ship might right itself .
No doubt his seafaring father is cheering from heaven : " Ahoy there , Christo !
Well done , my son . "
NAIROBI , Kenya ( CNN ) --
Pirates who hijacked a crude oil tanker off the coast of Kenya are approaching a Somali port , the U.S. Navy says .
The Sirius Star -- a crude " super tanker " flagged in Liberia and owned by the Saudi Arabian - based Saudi Aramco company -- was attacked on Saturday more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa , Kenya .
The crew of 25 , including British , Croatian , Polish , Filipino and Saudi nationals , are reported to be safe .
U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet Cmdr. Jane Campbell said the super tanker weighs more than 300,000 metric tons and " is more than three times the size of a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier . "
Oil industry insiders say a tanker of this size can carry up to 2 million barrels of oil , and the ship 's operator , Dubai - based Vela International Marine Ltd , says it is fully laden .
A U.S. Navy spokesman said the tanker is approaching Eyl , Somalia , on the Indian Ocean coast .
It is routine procedure for pirates to take hijacked ships to shore , where they will keep them while they discuss negotiations .
A multinational naval force including vessels from the U.S. , the UK and Russia has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters seas near the Gulf of Aden , which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea , following a sharp increase in pirate attacks in the region .
" It was attacked more than 450 nautical offshore of Mombasa .
This means that the pirates are now operating in an area of over 1.1 million square miles .
This is a measure of the determination of the pirates and ... a measure of how lucrative piracy could become , " Campbell said .
Campbell said the Navy does not expect to dispatch a vessel to aide the super tanker because it does not have dangerous weapons aboard like the MV Faina , a Ukrainian ship loaded with arms that was seized by pirates on September 25 .
The UK Foreign Office confirmed two Britons were aboard and said it was seeking more information about the incident .
South Korean officials said on Sunday that armed gunmen hijacked a Japanese freighter and its 23 - member crew off the coast of Somalia .
The hijacking came as the Korean government was considering sending a warship to join those of other countries to combat piracy in the area .
A Russian patrol ship also thwarted an attack on a Saudi vessel .
Eleven vessels are currently being held by pirates hoping to secure ransoms for their release , according to The Associated Press .
They include the MV Faina , which was hijacked along with 20 crew and a cargo of weapons and T - 72 tanks .
Ninety percent of ships transiting the perilous seas are using a guarded corridor and there have been no hijackings inside the zone since it was set up on August 22 , Danish Commodore Per Bigum Christensen told AP last week .
Around 20,000 oil tankers , freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year .
" Our presence in the region is helping deter and disrupt criminal attacks off the Somali coast , but the situation with the Sirius Star clearly indicates the pirates ' ability to adapt their tactics and methods of attack " said U.S. Vice Admiral Bill Gortney , commander of the Combined Maritime Forces .
" Piracy is an international crime that threatens global commerce .
Shipping companies have to understand that naval forces can not be everywhere .
Self protection measures are the best way to protect their vessels , their crews , and their cargo . "

Over the next couple of years the 3 - light traffic light system as we know it today may come to an end .
Enter the 4 - light traffic light system introducing the new " Orange " light .
Not only will the new lights have 4 colors , but the traditional green to yellow to red order ( which will now be green to yellow to orange to red ) will also be reversed .
" It 's like being at the start line of a drag race ! " said one excited driver .
" I 'm not one for speeding off the start line , but it actually adds excitement to waiting at the red light . "
What he is referring to is the new reverse light sequence .
While waiting at the red light the stopped traffic will see the orange light appear , then the yellow and then the green .
The green light traffic will show green then yellow then orange then red .
" In our test cities we have already noticed a decrease in traffic light accidents . " says the experiments founder , Sharon A. Burger .
" If this new light structure passes I think we will see a significant change in how we drive not just around the country but maybe the world ! "
Economic Activity Shifts Campaigns ' Focus to Wall Street New developments force the campaigns to address the economy from the trail .
PUEBLO , Colo .
Sept. 15 , 2008  -- Calling Monday 's economic climate the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression , Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama attacked Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , for supporting what Obama called a failing economic philosophy .
On Sunday , the federal government declined to bail out Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers , another financial institution choked by the credit crisis .
The ailing firm filed for bankruptcy this morning .
Another Wall Street giant , Merrill Lynch &
Co , narrowly avoided suffering the same fate by offering itself to Bank of America for sale .
While addressing a crowd in his first solo rally since adding Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to the ticket , McCain acknowledged problems caused by the nation 's economic state , but claimed the economy 's " fundamentals " were sound .
" There 's been tremendous turmoil in our financial markets in Wall Street and it is , people are frightened by these events , " he said .
" Our economy , I think , still , the fundamentals of our economy are strong , but these are very , very difficult times and I promise you we will never put America in this position again , " McCain continued , in an attempt to reassure the crowd .
During a campaign event in Grand Junction , Colo. , Monday afternoon , Obama said that the news about Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers " offers more evidence that too many folks in Washington and on Wall Street were n't minding the store . "
Obama said news of the Wall Street failures reminded him of the savings and loan crisis of the 1990s , when several of those financial institutions failed and thousands of businesses and families were financially ruined in the process .
Obama told voters that , if they are comfortable with the current state of the U.S. economy , they would appreciate the position of his political rival , McCain .
" I certainly do n't fault Sen. John McCain for these problems , " the Illinois senator said .
" But I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to , because it 's the same philosophy we 've had for the last eight years , " he added .
Obama accused McCain of having a hands - off approach to the financial crisis and maintaining a philosophy that says , " Even common sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise ; one that says we should just stick our heads in the sand and ignore economic problems until they spiral into crisis . "
Obama then seized upon remarks McCain made in Jacksonville , Fla. , that same morning , to paint his opponent as out of touch .
The Republican presidential nominee admitted the difficulty caused by the nation 's economic state , but claimed the economy 's " fundamentals " were sound .
" Sen. McCain -- what economy are you talking about ? "
Obama asked the audience .
" What 's more fundamental than the ability to find a job that pays the bills and can raise a family ? "
Obama asked , his voice rising .
" What 's more fundamental than knowing that your life savings is secure , and that you can retire with dignity ?
What 's more fundamental than knowing that you 'll have a roof over your head at the end of the day ? "
Running Mates Weigh In
At a " Road to Victory " rally , Republican running mate Palin delivered her standard stump speech , but also acknowledged the recent news from Wall Street .
" This is an issue of real concern , " Palin told the large crowd gathered in Golden , Colo .
But , she then pointed out , " I 'm glad to see the Federal Reserve has said no to using taxpayer money for a bailout . "
The self - professed " Hockey Mom " also discussed her family 's small business experience , saying that she had , too , experienced the stresses of the current economy .
" My family has faced the same challenges that many of you have and many across America today , " she said .
" We 've all built small businesses and worked hard to earn a living .
We know the struggles out there , " she continued .
In Michigan , Obama 's running mate Sen. Joe Biden , D - Del. , took the opportunity to pounce on McCain , as well .
" Ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , I could walk from here to Lansing , and I would n't run into a single person who thought our economy was doing well , unless I ran into John McCain , " he said .
" John McCain just does n't seem to understand what middle - class people are going through today , " Biden asserted .
At a later rally in Orlando , McCain tried to amend his earlier statement , which Obama has been mocking for months .
" Those fundamentals are being threatened today because of greed and corruption that some indulged in on Wall Street , " he said .
McCain has been making similar arguments about the economy for months , earlier this summer telling radio host Laura Ingraham , " I still believe the fundamentals of our economy are strong .
We 've got terribly big challenges now , whether it be housing or employment or so many of the other -- health care .
It 's very , very tough times .
It 's very tough .
But we 're still the most innovative , the most productive , the greatest exporter , the greatest importer .
Every new advancement , literally , in technology that has created this new economy throughout the world , has come from the United States economy .
Do we have a lot of things to fix , do we have big challenges ?
Yes .
But I also believe America 's best days are ahead of us . "

Outgoing New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark has stepped down as Labour Party leader following her defeat in yesterday 's general election .
The new government will be a conservative coalition led by the National Party .
The National Party ended up with 45 per cent of the votes compared to Labour 's 33 per cent , and its leader , John Key , expects to finalise arrangements for a coalition with two , possibly three , of the minor parties in the next few days .
" New Zealanders have voted for a safer , more prosperous and more ambitious New Zealand , " he said .
" They voted for hope , they voted for action and they voted for results . "
Prime Minister Helen Clark says the deteriorating global economic situation meant New Zealanders faced significant challenges no matter who they elected .
She is standing down as Labour leader but staying on in Parliament for the time being .
The conservatives have swept back to power in New Zealand with a decisive victory in the general election .
Miss Clark says she accepts responsibility for the defeat and is standing down as the Labour Party 's leader .
She says there is much to be proud about Labour 's last nine years in government .
" I do hope that all that we 've worked to put in place does n't go up in flames on a bonfire created by the right wing of politics , " she said .
She told supporters that her time as the head of New Zealand 's government was not wasted .
" I 'll be looking back on these last nine years with an incredible amount of pride , pride in years of economic growth , years of higher employment , years of of huge advances in public health and education , " she said .
' Gutsy ' Clark
On ABC1's Insiders program , Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith congratulated Mr Keys on his election victory .
" We value very much our relationship with NZ , it 's a very important [ one ] , " he said .
" We worked very closely with Helen Clark 's government ... so we expect that very close cooperation and working together to continue [ with Mr Keys ] . "
Mr Smith says that in the end , time caught up with the " gutsy " Miss Clark .
" I think she 's held in very high regard and very high respect , " he said .
" She 's been a fighter in good times and bad times , and I think it 's that that 's earned her respect . "
Mr Smith says Miss Clark also worked on sucessfully rebuilding New Zealand 's relationship with the United States .
Police provocateur infiltrates political and protest groups in Australia
By Margaret Rees
15 November 2008
In a series of articles published last month , Melbourne 's
Age newspaper revealed that a covert police agent recently infiltrated several left - wing political and activist groups , including Socialist Alternative , Stop the War Coalition , Unity for Peace , and Animal Liberation Victoria .
Beginning in 2006 , the agent provocateur was involved in anti-Iraq war demonstrations — including last year 's Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) protests in Sydney — animal liberation actions , and participated in planning meetings for a protest to be held against a weapons fair in South Australia .
The two - year operation represents an extraordinary abrogation by the state of the right of citizens to participate in public activities and join political organisations without fear of police harassment .
It underscores the extent to which basic democratic rights and established legal norms have been torn up under the banner of the so - called war on terror .
Political dissent — any form of disagreement with the existing social and political order — is now being effectively criminalised .
The police agent who infiltrated the various political organisations was working with the Victorian Security Intelligence Group ( SIG ) — the police counter - terrorism unit .
The SIG is also responsible for protection of dignitaries , strategic threat assessments , and monitoring so - called " issue - motivated groups " .
Formerly operating as the Operations Intelligence Unit , then re-badged as the SIG , the unit has been expanding its operations in line with increasingly draconian federal and state anti-terror legislation .
The activities of another SIG provocateur were critical in securing the recent convictions of seven men on terror charges in Victoria 's Supreme Court .
The prosecution 's case revolved around the evidence of " Security Intelligence Operative 39 " who befriended Muslim cleric Abdul Nacer Benbrika .
The covert agent then offered Benbrika cheap ammonium nitrate , and took him to a remote hilltop to demonstrate how to detonate a small container containing the explosive .
As the World Socialist Web Site noted : " [ T ] he only explosion presented as evidence in the trial was one conducted by a police provocateur for the clear purpose of entrapping the cleric . "
( See " Contradictory verdicts in Australia 's largest terrorism trial " )
While details of the SIG agent 's activities in Socialist Alternative and the other protest organisations remain scant , there is no reason to believe that the modus operandi was any different to that of Security Intelligence Operative 39 — infiltrate and gain influence in pursuit of a prosecution and conviction based on provocation and entrapment .
According to the Age , Socialist Alternative was " the first group [ the cop ] targeted in 2006 " .
In September 2007 he travelled with Socialist Alternative to Sydney for antiwar protests timed to coincide with US President George Bush 's visit for the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit .
The agent also reportedly posed as a vegan and participated in Animal Liberation meetings from February 2007 .
In June 2008 he took part in an illegal raid on a battery hen farm outside Melbourne .
Earlier this year he was a member of the organising committee for an annual antiwar event known as the Palm Sunday rally , organised by church and pacifist groups .
The police agent took the minutes during meetings held in the lead - up to the rally .
From February this year he also participated in planning for demonstrations in Adelaide against a proposed arms fair , the Asia Pacific Defence and Security exhibition , that was to be held on November 11 .
According to media reports , information gathered by the agent on the planned protests was passed on to the South Australian Labor government and led to the cancellation of the arms fair .
The Age reported that earlier this year : " In the face of increasing suspicions from several community groups about who he really worked for , it was time for the Victoria Police Security Intelligence Group undercover officer to disappear .
So he invented one last lie ; a sick relative in Cambodia whom he needed to visit .
And then he was gone ; his phone in his flat in Melbourne 's south disconnected , his mobile numbers no longer working , his chair at numerous Victorian activist groups unfilled . "
The state Labor government responded to the Age revelations by rejecting out of hand any investigation or reform to covert police activities .
Police Minister Bob Cameron simply insisted that there was " appropriate oversight " over the Security Intelligence Group .
Cameron also rejected criticisms of the government 's 2006 amendments to the Freedom of Information Act , which protect intelligence documents at police request .
Documents , including intelligence reports on people who may not have committed any crime , can now be stored for an indefinite period .
Liberal response
The media has quickly dropped its coverage of the issue .
In an editorial on October 20 , the Age made clear that its central concern was not the threat to civil liberties but rather that the SIG might not only discredit itself but the broader " war on terror " as well .
" There is no doubt that the SIG has conducted legitimate infiltration and surveillance operations , " it declared .
" The recent conviction of several members of an Islamic jihadist terrorist cell , which resulted from an SIG operation , is a notable instance ...
In this time of heightened anxieties , there has always been a danger that civil liberties would be undermined by those notionally trying to protect them .
When a police security intelligence unit starts infiltrating the organising committees of peace marches rather than suspected terrorist cells , that danger has become very real indeed . "
The Age 's description of the SIG 's setup of the Benbrika group as a " legitimate " operation dovetails with its claim that the police unit 's work is aimed at " trying to protect " civil liberties .
This mouthpiece of the Victorian liberal establishment is demonstrating its support for the sweeping assault underway on democratic rights and the authoritarian logic underlying the anti-terror legislation .
The so - called war on terror has been promoted by ruling elites in Australia and around the world as a means to legitimise their predatory , neo - colonial operations abroad and their attacks on democratic rights at home .
It has nothing whatsoever to do with protecting ordinary people from the threat of harm from terrorist attack .
The question can be raised : if it is regarded as legitimate " anti- terror " police work for the agents provocateurs who infiltrated a group of disoriented men , influenced by religious fundamentalist ideas , to actively encourage their disorientation , incite discussions about violence , and provide them with the illegal material that triggered their arrest and prosecution , then on what grounds can one oppose the same methods being applied to other citizens , including members of political parties and protest organisations ?
Once the framework of the " war on terror " is accepted then the issue is no longer the democratic rights of the people but the rights of police to wage this " war " and the efficacy of police tactics .
A clear demonstration of this was provided by Julian Burnside , president of the civil liberties group Liberty Victoria , who responded to the Age reports by suggesting that police infiltration activities might require " greater oversight " by an external body .
" I wonder how many people would feel comfortable that they were referred to in a police document , however innocuous , " he said .
" I do n't think the police have asked : to what extent are we invading people 's privacy ?
And what are we gaining from doing so ? "
But since when has it been up to the police to weigh up the costs and benefits of potential provocations ?
The real issue is not the judgement of the police agents involved , but whether or not citizens have recognised rights that the state may not legally violate .
The SIG 's infiltration of political organisations is no accident or aberration .
In 2003 , after the government bolstered the SIG 's powers through the Terrorism ( Community Protection ) Act , the World Socialist Web Site presciently warned : " The new laws strengthen the hand of the SIG and the entire police force to spy on political opponents of the government , operate as agents provocateurs and carry out entrapment exercises . "
( See " Australia : State Labor government hands police unprecedented powers " )
Outstanding questions
There are many outstanding questions about the SIG agent's two - year activities within the different political groups .
The Age provided only a broad outline and chose not to name him .
And none of the affected organisations has issued a public statement providing a full account of their knowledge of the agent and his activity in their groups .
Leading Socialist Alternative member Mick Armstrong was quoted in the Age saying : " On the one hand you 've got police saying ‘ we will be open and co-operate with you ' if you tell them what you are doing ahead of a rally or some sort of action , but then you learn they are still spying on you .
It 's completely unjustified . "
The WSWS made several phone calls to Socialist Alternative requesting to speak with Armstrong or any other available senior member in order to get further details on the agent 's activities .
None of these phone calls was returned .
Instead , the organisation posted an article on its web site on November 10 ( also published in the latest version of their printed magazine ) , titled " Nothing new about cops spying on the left " — their first independent acknowledgement of the Age 's revelations .
Aside from an admission that the agent had " signed up as a member of Socialist Alternative " ( something the Age had not made clear ) , there is no additional information regarding the cop and his actions .
The article , appearing under the by - line of Jerome Small , amounts to a criminally irresponsible underestimation of the seriousness of the police infiltration and the danger posed to left - wing organisations by state provocation .
The essential argument is that police infiltration is as old as the socialist movement itself , that nothing can be done to prevent it or to minimise its impact ( " So long as we 're out to change the world , people paid to lie and spy will never be far away " ) , and that it is not that much of a problem anyway — " [ D]espite the activities of the latest wannabe James Bond outed by the Age , Socialist Alternative has continued to grow . "
This dismissive attitude and flippant tone reflect the organisation 's entirely unserious and opportunist petty bourgeois protest politics .
The Socialist Alternative leadership nevertheless has a responsibility to the working class — not to mention to its own membership — to make public all it knows regarding the identity and activities of the agent provocateur formerly working within its ranks .
Among the questions that need to be addressed are the following :
* What is the agent 's name ?
Are photographs of him available ?
* When and how did he first approach Socialist Alternative ?
How did he become a member ?
Did he hold any elected or leading positions within the organisation ?
* Did he engage in any provocative behaviour ?
How did he conduct himself at the APEC demonstrations ?
* Are there any grounds for believing that the agent 's activities assisted the series of raids by anti-terror police on students ' homes in the lead up to APEC ?
Or that his activities during the demonstration contributed to the police targeting and arresting of protestors that day ?
* When and why did the agent cease his membership with Socialist Alternative ?
Did anyone have any suspicions about him ?
If so , were these raised with any of the other organisations subsequently infiltrated ?
I spent most of the day getting to know Cappuccino and developing a simple but slightly interesting application with it .
First I 'll quickly skim over the application I developed , and then I 'll discuss my experience developing with Cappuccino .
I put together Mahou , using Vik Singh 's adaptation of the Yahoo !
Boss Mashup Framework to Google App Engine and Cappuccino to create a somewhat featureful image search .
There are two particularly interesting features in Mahou :
If you scroll down ( using the mouse wheel ) , as you get near the end of the results , additional results will be retrieved and appended to the existing results .
If you click on an image it will open up a small window ( not a browser window , but a virtual window within the frame ) with the image 's meta data .
If you click on the image 's title ( the white text ) , it will open the fullsize image in the browser .
Although it has a few rough spots , its a fairly useful image search , and the automatic loading of additional images ( while retaining the previous images as well ) makes it quicker to browse ( and backtrack between pages of ) images than in conventional search engines .
Anyway , on to the content .
Developing with Cappuccino
I have spent a considerable amount of time developing in both Objective - C and in JavaScript , and Cappuccino 's feel leans very strongly towards the former .
It 's not just the syntax , but Cappuccino has captured the feeling of Cocoa development as well .
You rarely hack in Cocoa development .
Instead , you software develop like the good little software developer you are .
This same sense of grinding out code can be felt in Objective - J development .
That is n't to say that its a bad experience , but programming in Objective -?
rarely feels like a matter of ingenuity , instead it is a matter of correctly matching premade patterns to problems .
Sometimes you jiggle the pattern a bit to make it fit correctly , but its rare to get particularly meta or to pull new tricks out of your bag /
At the same time , there are a few places in Cocoa - - and in Cappuccino as well -- where there is no premade solution , and improvising new solutions tends to involve all manner of trickery and disregard for propriety .
Essentially , you meticulously design the first 97 % of the application , and then beat the hell out of it for the final three percent until it works exactly how you want .
Another similarity in the Objective -?
languages is the long but not - particularly steep learning curve .
Early on , after every Cocoa program I would write I would figure out how I had poorly designed it to take advantage of all the Cocoa goodness .
Then you throw your application out and redesign it , and the code is half as long , cleaner , and more intuitive .
After finishing Mahou , I had the same damn feeling : I could rewrite it in half the time , with a more extensible design , and less hackery .
This is the frustration of using a heavy framework , which are inherently heavily opinionated , and will subtly punish you for making the wrong choices until you learn the framework well enough to anticipate its quirks .
Ah well .
Advantages of Cappuccino Development
Developing an application with Cappuccino wo n't always be faster than developing a comparable application in another JavaScript framework , but it 'll be hard to beat Cappuccino 's unit - of - quality - per - unit - of - time ratio .
Because the framework makes so many choices for you , and provides high quality widgets to grow familiarity with , many vectors of failure fade away .
Particularly the perils of cross - browser development are largely erased with Cappuccino .
That is a big win .
You write web applications in a single unified language , instead of a medley of html/css/JavaScript/a-server-side-language .
This decreases the minutiae to memorize .
In particular , the pointless difficulty of writing cross - browser CSS is removed .
Now , I tend to enjoy getting to write in four ( three and a quarter , really , since we 're discussing html ) languages , but I think there is merit to this approach .
Regardless of which most developers decide upon , having both options is better than having only one or the other .
Cappuccino supports well segmented and reusable code with support for code importing , and also its ease of subclassing widgets and classes .
While writing Mahou I put together a WLURLLabel class which subclassed CPText Field to allow specifying a URL to open when clicked .
I also subclassed CPText Field to support displaying placeholder text when there is n't any content in a textfield and it is n't selected .
Both of these things are easy enough to do , but once you get into the habit you can save a considerable amount of time by making the extra five minute effort to create reusable classes .
Although you can subclass and extend in other JavaScript libraries , Cappuccino 's being modeled after Cocoa puts it in rarified air as far as the versatility and ease of subclassing to customize behavior .
In Cocoa , subclassing and delegates are the two solutions to all customized logic .
The first step of every solution is figuring out the class to subclass -- not the function to write or library to create -- and you end up reusing a tremendous amount of code with that mentality .
Its fun .
Learning new things is always fun , right ?
Problems with Cappuccino Development
The most difficult issue I ran into with Cappuccino development is that it explicitly does n't play well with html and css .
This is one of its purported strengths , but is also quite awkward when trying to -- for example - - display html retrieved from another web service .
Even displaying a small attribution link at the bottom of the screen involved subclassing a CPText Field to open a window with a specific URL when clicked .
That said , this issue can be alleviated by developing a handful of new UI widgets .
Specifically a textfield that rendered html and css would be excellent .
Something akin to NSAttributed String in Cocoa development .
Actually , I suppose it 's most similar to the WebKit view , which would be a slightly ironic addition .
A limited debugging toolkit .
I developed with WebKit , and had my fair share of generic error messages from Cappuccino .
Particularly ones letting me know that it can't parse something somewhere , or that there was a syntax error .
Somewhere .
I imagine some people will get pretty caustic while complaining about this , and I agree that it 's fair from perfect .
But it 's workable as is , and some automated acceptance testing ( something like what Peter Burns discussed in this blog post a while back ) would make it much easier to detect problems as they arise .
There is a limited amount of documentation and tutorials thus far .
It was released a day ago , so that is n't particularly surprising , but you have to be willing to browse through the docs .
The overall patterns and documentation style of Cappuccino is sufficiently Cocoa - like that Cocoa developers will be ready to dive right in , but someone more from the JavaScript side of things might have a bit of trouble getting started right away .
Ending Thoughts
Although I was occasionally stymied along the way , I tremendously enjoyed developing my first Cappuccino application today .
I really got into the flow of it , and the overlap with Cocoa programming is remarkably high .
There were a few places where JavaScript knowledge was helpful , but my personal impression was that an experienced Cocoa programmer would be more at home than an experienced JQuery programmer .
Both would certainly pick it up with a bit of effort .
In all fairness , the current iteration of my app is not an application that plays particularly well to Cappuccino 's strengths , but Cappuccino helped facilitate some fun functionality , and when I have time to implement the entire Mahou vision , I believe it 'll be a slightly more worthy project .
Head over to Cappuccino.org and give it a whirl .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Lawmakers investigating Gov. Sarah Palin's firing of her public safety commissioner accused the McCain - Palin campaign on Thursday of stonewalling the probe by helping witnesses refuse to comply with subpoenas .
Investigators want to know if Gov. Sarah Palin fired a state employee for improper reasons .
A state Senate committee subpoenaed Palin 's husband , several top aides and other advisers earlier this month , but none of those served with demands for testimony appeared before the panel when it met last week .
The panel is scheduled to meet again Friday .
A member of the committee said Thursday that he expects more no -shows .
In court filings , lawyers for Hollis French , the Democratic state senator overseeing the probe , and Stephen Branchflower , the attorney hired to conduct it , say Sen .
John McCain 's presidential campaign has moved " on many fronts " to kill the investigation since Palin became the Republican vice presidential nominee .
" Indeed , recent events demonstrate that witnesses or participants who want to stonewall Mr. Branchflower 's fact - finding inquiry can count on plenty of assistance from lawyers and McCain campaign operatives , " the filings state .
The filings came in response to lawsuits that Palin 's allies filed last week seeking to stop the probe .
The suits name as defendants the Alaska Legislative Council , the Republican - dominated committee that authorized the investigation in July , and its chairman , Democratic state Sen. Kim Elton .
The response calls the suits " clearly meritless " and " political , not legal " documents .
The McCain campaign has said that Palin will cooperate with a state Personnel Board investigation instead of the legislative probe , which the campaign has described as being " tainted " with partisan politics .
" Since Gov. Palin was named the Republican [ vice ] presidential nominee , it comes as little surprise that the Obama supporters leading the legislative investigation would attempt to use the proceedings to the political advantage of their candidate , " said Taylor Griffin , a McCain - Palin campaign spokesman .
" All Gov. Palin is asking for is a fair and impartial review of the facts outside of the taint of partisan politics , " Griffin said .
" That 's why she 's cooperating with the Personnel Board . "
Earlier this week , Democratic state Rep. Les Gara asked the state police to investigate whether state laws against witness tampering have been violated .
Gara did not level allegations against a specific person , but said Republican operatives had been sent to Alaska to undermine the legislative probe .
" I think probably the McCain folks think this was just politics , " Gara said Thursday .
But he added , " All we know is they want to stop the investigation and suddenly the witnesses are n't talking .
That 's indisputable . "
Ex -Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan says he was sacked in July after he refused to fire the governor 's ex-brother - in - law , a state trooper who was involved in an acrimonious divorce from Palin 's sister .
Palin has denied any wrongdoing , arguing that Monegan was fired for insubordination after he continued to press for funding for projects the governor opposed .
Palin initially agreed to cooperate with the legislative probe and have her staff testify .
But since she became McCain 's running mate , she and her advisers have argued that the state Personnel Board is the proper agency to investigate .
Campaign aides have repeatedly attacked French for a September 2 interview in which he said the investigation could lead to an " October surprise " for the GOP ticket .
The aides have called the probe " a politicized kangaroo court . "
French 's committee issued the subpoenas September 12 .
State Sen. Bill Wielechowski , a member of the Judiciary Committee , said none of the seven people ordered to testify since last week have filed requests to quash the subpoenas with a state court -- but he did not expect them to show for Friday 's hearing .
" They should all be there , or they 're breaking the law , " Wielechowski , a Democrat , said .
The full Senate would have to vote on any sanctions against witnesses who refuse to appear .
It does not convene again until January .
Palin 's husband , Todd , was among the people who refused to appear last week .
The couple 's attorney , Thomas Van Flein , filed papers arguing the Legislature had no authority to investigate Monegan 's firing , and that state law prevents ethics investigations of candidates for state office .
The vice presidency is a federal office , however .
The legislative inquiry is scheduled to be completed by October 10 .
There is no deadline for the investigator hired by the Personnel Board to look into Monegan 's firing .
On Tuesday , a Palin spokeswoman said the Personnel Board 's investigator has requested confidentiality .
The spokeswoman indicated the campaign would no longer answer questions about the probe .
Monegan has vehemently denied charges of insubordination and has told CNN he was a " team player " who never did anything without approval .

On the Conceivability of Zombies By BRENT SILBY Department Of Philosophy , University of Canterbury , New Zealand Copyright ( c ) Brent Silby 1998 www.def-logic.com/articles
Introduction Consciousness lies at the very heart of the mind / body problem .
So far it has been resistant to scientific analysis and explanation .
Essentially , the mind / body problem consists in the realisation that while it may be possible to discover physical principles by which the mind works , the phenomenon of consciousness may escape the physical story .
It seems that we have what the literature refers to as an explanatory gap , and that consciousness , by its very nature , cannot be accounted for by physical theories of the mind / brain .
This type of thinking suggests a metaphysical dualism between the body and the mind .
Anti-physicalist arguments have taken a similar form since Descartes , and often involve conceivability arguments .
In other words , the anti-physicalist puts forward thought experiments that involve the conceptual possibility of certain scenarios ( Levine 1993 : p543 ) .
These thought experiments involve imagining situations in which a complete physical knowledge of the world ( including the brain ) fails to provide an account of conscious experience .
For example , it is claimed that we can imagine a situation in which there exist creatures who are physically and behaviourally identical to us , yet who have no conscious experience .
The conceivability of such creatures is supposed to show that consciousness is not logically supervenient on the physical .
It is something of an irony that while our minds are the one thing of which we are directly aware , the existence and nature of our minds is one of the most puzzling mysteries that we have ever grappled with .
Being a part of the physical world , we would like to be able to explain the workings of our minds in scientific terms and there has been a great deal of success in this area .
Neuroscientists are working hard to provide us with neural models of the brain and progress is being made in understanding the way the brain works .
However , despite the progress being made , philosophers such as David Chalmers believe that consciousness escapes reductive explanations .
In his book ` The Conscious Mind ' , Chalmers makes significant use of thought experiments involving zombies .
These thought experiments are supposed to show that consciousness is not logically supervenient on the physical and that conscious states , or the properties of those states , called qualia , are resistant to physical and functional analysis .
In this paper I will first explain the concept of supervenience , then describe the problem of qualia and explain why qualia are a problem for physical theories of mind .
I will then describe the zombie argument and will explain Chalmers ' attempts to use it as an argument for the conclusion that qualia do not logically supervene on the physical .
My goal will be to show that the supposed conceivability of zombies does not offer any serious refutation of physical or functional theories of the mind .
1 : Supervenience
The notion of supervenience is an important part of Chalmers ' argument .
The concept of supervenience allows us to formally locate relations of dependence between sets of properties .
If A - properties supervene on B - properties , then whenever you find B - properties , you will find A - properties .
Now , there is an important distinction to be made between two types of supervenience - logical supervenience and natural supervenience .
When we say that B - facts are naturally supervenient on A - facts , we are making a claim about the empirical world .
For example , in our world the facts and laws of gravity supervene on the facts and laws relating to the mass of objects .
There is a law - like correlation between how massive objects are and the gravitational forces that they give rise to .
So , in this world ( or universe ) , whatever object we choose to examine , that object will be surrounded by a gravitational field that is proportional to its total mass .
There are no exceptions to this law .
Gravity naturally supervenes on mass .
However , we can imagine a possible universe in which the laws of physics are vastly different to the laws in our universe .
Perhaps in our imagined universe there is no gravity .
In our imagined universe gravity would not supervene on mass because in that universe gravity does not exist .
Our ability to imagine such a universe shows us that gravity is not logically supervenient on mass .
For B- properties to be logically supervenient on A - properties there must be no logically possible situations that share identical A - properties and yet remain distinct with regard their B - properties ( Chalmers 1996 : p35 ) .
Logical supervenience is defined in terms of logically possible worlds .
For example , we could say that biological properties supervene logically on physical properties , because it would be logically impossible for a world to exist that was physically identical to ours and yet was biologically distinct ( Chalmers 1996 : p35 ) .
When all the physical properties of our world are in place , the biological properties come along at no extra charge .
Even God could not create a universe that was physically identical to ours ( including the position of every particle ) , while keeping it biologically distinct .
If penguins exist in our world , then any world that is physically identical to ours also contains penguins .
Biology is logically supervenient on the physical .
Now , Chalmers has made the claim that consciousness is not logically supervenient on the physical .
So , for Chalmers , there is a possible world that is identical to our world in all physical respects , but is distinct in the fact that consciousness ( in humans ) does not exist .
But what is Chalmers referring to when he speaks of consciousness ?
The word `consciousness ' can be used to refer to a number of different aspects of human life , but Chalmers has a specific aspect of consciousness in mind .
He is concerned with the existence of qualia .
2 : Qualia
One of the central problems in the contemporary philosophy of mind is the problem of qualia .
The word `qualia ' refers to the intrinsic properties of our experience , including phenomenal properties such as colours , sounds and sensations of pains .
These `raw feels ' seem to be intrinsic properties of our experience and yet cannot be found in the non-mental world .
According to tradition , qualia are defined as ineffable , intrinsic , private and directly apprehensible in consciousness ( Dennett 1988 : p622 ) .
Sensations of colours , pains and sounds seem very real to us and yet when we turn to science for an explanation of the colour blue , all we learn is that there are certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that are being reflected from the surfaces of various objects .
There is no blue , just radiation .
The question we are left with is : where is the blueness if it is not in the outside world ?
An intuitive answer to this question could go like this :
When light enters our eyes , various frequencies of radiation cause the retina 's cones to activate .
This initiates an electrochemical cascade by which signals are sent to the visual cortex and a neural state is set up .
The visual cortex is connected to a `box ' that is filled with `an instance of ' the colour , which can then be examined by other parts of the brain in order to produce behavioural output .
This story answers the question badly .
It may feel as if the blue colour is there , in experience , but seeming like something is the case does not show that it is the case .
Daniel Dennett suggests that it would be a waste of resources for the brain to work in this fashion .
Once a sensory discrimination has been made , there is no need for it to be made again by other parts of the brain .
In other words , the process from the retina to the visual cortex is the process by which the colour is discriminated so there is no need for a `colour box ' .
The process would have been wasted if it simply supplied its data to a box where the colour to be discriminated was reproduced .
But this brings us back to the question :
Where is the blue that we experience ?
There is nothing but wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation in the non-mental world , and there is no box filled with blue colour inside our heads so why do we have the blue sensation ?
Will it ever be possible to use physicalist functionalism to account for qualia ?
Leibniz said : Supposing that there were a machine whose structure produced thought , sensation , and perception ; we could conceive it as increased in size with the same proportions until one was able to enter into its interior as he would into a mill .
Now , on going into it he would find only pieces working on one another , but never would he find anything to explain perception ( Leibniz , quoted in Rey 1997 : p313 ) .
In this passage , Leibniz is pointing to the mysteriousness of consciousness and the idea that the mere physical and functional organisation of a brain cannot explain the qualities of experience .
This leads us to wonder if qualia supervene on the physical and functional organisation of the brain .
If qualia do not supervene on the physical and functional states of the brain , this would mean that even if we had a complete understanding of the brain 's physical composition and functional organisation , we would not be able to account for qualia because they cannot be captured by a physicalist account of the mind .
So we could imagine a situation in which the brain 's physical and functional structures remain the same and yet qualia do not exist .
There are many thought experiments to show the conceivability of an entity functionally the same as us yet being devoid of qualia .
Such thought experiments imply that consciousness is a property that cannot be accounted for by physicalism .
David Chalmers is a supporter of this view and believes that consciousness cannot be reductively explained .
In ` The Conscious Mind ' , Chalmers attempts to show that no physical explanation of the brain can account for consciousness and for this reason , he holds that consciousness escapes any attempt at a reductive explanation ( Chalmers 1996 : p93 ) .
Chalmers claims that the logical possibility of entities that are functionally the same as us but devoid of consciousness , is one way of showing that consciousness is not logically supervenient on the physical composition or functional structure of the brain .
The entities that Chalmers refers to are known as zombies .
3 : ZOMBIES A philosopher 's zombie is a hypothetical entity that is both physically and functionally identical to a normal human being .
Zombies are molecule for molecule copies of humans and yet they are totally devoid of conscious experiences .
My zombie twin is physically identical to me and is therefore functionally identical to me .
We can imagine that he lives on a duplicate planet Earth and has led a life that is exactly the same as the life that I have lived .
The important point to note is that for Chalmers , my zombie twin is also identical to me with regards his behaviour and psychology .
Psychology , for Chalmers , refers to the functional organisation of the mind .
This includes behavioural links and issuing verbal reports .
A psychological state is defined by the role it plays in the collective cognitive system and the behaviour that it gives rise to .
For example , if my zombie twin looks at the blue sky , he will make the same comments about his experience as I would .
He may state that he enjoys eating chocolate but is hesitant to do so because of the pain he experiences from a hole in one of his teeth .
The fact that my zombie twin is functionally and psychologically identical to me follows from the fact that he is physically identical to me .
Our brain states play exactly the same functional roles and give rise to an identical psychology .
If a certain brain state has the functional role of making me wince in pain , then my zombie twin will behave in exactly the same way when his brain is in that state .
But what about conscious experiences ?
This is where my zombie twin and I differ .
My zombie twin is similar to me in all respects except that his life contains no phenomenal feel .
There is nothing it is like to be a zombie .
As David Chalmers puts it ` All is dark inside ' ( Chalmers 1996 : p96 ) .
Accepting the possibility such zombies leads to the view that consciousness is not logically supervenient on the physical .
This view is closely related to the doctrine of epiphenomenalism , which claims that consciousness has no causal powers and has no effect on the world ( Guzeldere 1997 : p41 ) .
If we were to accept the epiphenomenalist view of qualia , we would have to accept that qualia cannot be defined in terms of a role that they play in the formation of beliefs and the production of behaviour .
Qualia would seem to be nothing more than a needless feature of human experience , which nature has provided us with for no reason whatsoever .
But if qualia serve no purpose , why would nature provide us with them ?
Before accepting epiphenomenalism , we should explore Chalmers ' claims and decide whether or not zombies are possible .
3.1 : The Logical Possibility of Zombies For Chalmers ' argument , the crucial point is that zombies are logically possible and there is no contradiction or conceptual problem with imagining their existence .
Chalmers admits that in the natural world it is likely that anything physically identical to us would have conscious experience just as we do and if a creature was devoid of qualia , it would probably differ from us in some important physical respects .
However , even if zombies are naturally impossible , their logical possibility can still be used to argue for the logical non-supervenience of qualia on the physical .
Examining the logical possibility of zombies can also be used to establish physicalist conclusions about qualia .
If it could be shown that zombies are not logically possible , we would then be able to pursue reductive functional explanations of consciousness .
It seems that establishing logical possibility is a simple task .
For example , we can easily conceive of starships that can traverse the galaxy in just a few hours by imagining a possible world in which humans have developed the technology to make this possible .
In the natural world travelling across the galaxy in such a short space of time would not be possible because to do so we would need to violate Einstein 's mass / energy equations .
In order to travel across the galaxy in just a few hours , a starship would need to travel faster than light and as such would require an infinite amount of energy .
Nevertheless , it is possible to imagine a world in which the laws of physics are different in such a way as to allow such starships to exist .
We can use the same technique to establish the logical possibility of many things that do not exist in the natural world .
It certainly seems conceivable that there is a possible world in which zombies exist just as it is conceivable that a world exists in which starships can travel faster than light .
Chalmers believes that there is nothing incoherent in imagining such a world and he maintains that the burden of proof lies on those who claim that zombies are not logically conceivable ( Chalmers 1996 : p96 ) .
Someone who states that zombies are not logically possible must show that the concept of a creature being both physically and psychologically identical to us but lacking in conscious experience is contradictory .
If no such contradiction can be found , we must conclude that consciousness does not logically supervene on the physical .
3.2 : Assessing the Imaginability of Zombies Chalmers often characterises the zombies ' lack of conscious experience by using the phrase `all is dark inside ' .
Humans in this world , on the otherhand , have a full and rich conscious life and experience sounds , smells , touches and colours .
Given the distinction between zombies and humans , would it be correct to say that for humans `all is colourful inside ' ?
Probably not .
As I stated earlier , according to Dennett , there does not appear to be any place in the brain that contains colour or any other quale .
The human brain , like a zombies brain , is dark inside .
This , of course , expresses scepticism about the very existence of qualia .
Chalmers believes that for humans , there is a `mental ' box that contains instances of qualia but in zombies , this box does not exist .
When Chalmers speaks of darkness inside a zombie , he is using the term darkness to represents the zombies ' total lack of qualia .
But this is misleading in some ways and betrays some fundamental problems in imagining the possibility of zombies .
Can we really imagine zombies as being all dark inside ?
Surely the experience of darkness or lack of qualia is a quale in itself ( Cottrell 1996 ) .
Attempting to imagine a zombie involves imagining `what it would be like ' to be a zombie and have no conscious experiences .
But thinking of a zombie in these terms cannot work because according to the zombie hypothesis `there is nothing it is like to be a zombie ' .
How can we imagine what it is like to be something when there is nothing it is like to be it ?
There is no conception of darkness or of a lack of experience for a zombie - there is nothing at all going on in there .
Imagining what it would be like to be a zombie is not at all like imagining being blind or deaf because presumably there is `something it is like ' to be blind or deaf .
Trying to imagine what it is like to be a zombie is like trying to imagine what it is like to not exist , and I maintain that this is an impossible task .
The obvious reply to this would be to ask why it is necessary to imagine what it is like to be a zombie .
People can imagine unicorns as being logically possible without having to imagine what it is like to be a unicorn , so why can't the same be true of zombies ?
I would respond to this by suggesting that there is a difference between imagining a unicorn and imagining a zombie .
To imagine a unicorn , one simply has to take two naturally existing things in the world and join them together - a horse and a horn .
We can imagine a world in which evolution gave horses horns because we see creatures with horns in our world all the time .
But imagining our zombie twins is more difficult .
We can imagine our twins as being identical to us easily enough , but we also have to imagine that they have no conscious experiences .
To accomplish this , we have to imagine ourselves as having no conscious experiences and this is where the problem lies .
We cannot imagine what it is like to have absolutely no conscious experiences .
This is why philosophers such as Daniel Dennett believe that people inevitably fail at the task of imagining zombies .
Often the assumptions people make about the zombies ' lack of an internal life is incompatible with the statements they make about the zombies ' external behaviour .
Their description of zombies often contradicts the idea that zombies are behaviourally and functionally identical to us ( Dennett 1995a : p172 ) .
Indeed , as I have already explained , it seems to be impossible to imagine completely normal external behaviour at the same time as imagining a total internal absence of experience .
So it would seem that one of the major problems with imagining zombies is that people underestimate exactly what is involved and they often include facts that are not really imaginable .
Many of the properties ascribed to zombies are stipulated rather than imagined .
The problem here is that it is possible to make any stipulation or assertion that we feel is necessary to make a thought experiment work even though these stipulations may be totally unimaginable ( Horgan 1987 : pp496-500 ) .
For example : Imagine a creature that is totally identical to yourself in every physical and psychological respect .
Imagine also that this creature has a full conscious experience that is identical to your own conscious experience .
Now imagine that this creature is not alive ( Dennett 1995a : p176 ) .
Given that this creature is physically , psychologically and behaviourally identical to us , we may think that we have discovered a mysterious property that cannot be explained .
Life !
We are alive but our imagined twins are not alive so what is this thing called life ?
Dennett suggests that this mystery would only arise if we thought that life was some extra property that could be removed or added to the totality of a normally functional human ( Dennett 1995a : p176 ) .
But regardless of what we think , life is not this sort of property .
Perhaps we should not think of consciousness as some property that could be removed from the totality of human function .
Some people may claim to able to imagine such a creature as described above , but I suspect that their imaginations would fail to fully conceive of such a scenario .
I believe that if people claim to have imagined duplicates of themselves that are not alive , they have not actually imagined the situation , they have only made stipulations about what the creature should be like .
Perhaps the same is true when we attempt to imagine zombies .
Shoemaker has pointed to another problem with the conceivability of zombies and has used the zombie type argument to argue for reductive explanations of consciousness .
As humans , we make judgements and form beliefs about our experiences and qualia .
We can do this through introspection .
If this is true , it would seem that our experiences cause our introspective beliefs .
Now , remember that zombies are physically , functionally , psychologically , and behaviourally identical to humans .
This means that zombies and humans share identical introspective mechanisms .
Of course , since zombies exhibit the same behaviour as humans , it follows that they make the same claims about their experiences as we do .
They talk about enjoying a rich and full conscious life in exactly the same way as humans do .
Zombies form beliefs about their experiences through their introspective mechanisms , and since they have no qualia , we must accept that qualia do not play a role in the formation of their beliefs .
But , if we have the same introspective mechanisms , then it would seem that qualia do not play any causal role in our formation of beliefs .
Zombies insist that they are not zombies , just as we do .
But if we are forming those beliefs by using exactly the same mechanisms as zombies , then we should not be able to tell whether or not we are zombies ( Shoemaker 1975 : pp291-315 ) .
Qualia , for humans , seems to be accessible to introspection and therefore seems to play a role in our formation of beliefs and subsequent behaviour .
If zombies have the same mechanisms as we do , then given that they have no qualia , they should behave in a different way .
But according to the argument , zombies behave in exactly the same way as humans .
This is a contradiction , and as such , highlights a very important problem with the logical possibility of zombies .
Chalmers suggests that a response to this problem would be to argue that causal theories of knowledge and belief acquisition are not appropriate for accounting for our knowledge of consciousness ( Chalmers 1996 : p193 ) .
By taking a dualist stance , we could claim that knowledge of conscious experience is fundamentally different to other forms of knowledge , and that our knowledge of conscious experience is not brought about by any sort of causal relationship between knowledge and experience .
Our knowledge of conscious experience consists in another sort of relationship .
But Chalmers does not offer this alternative .
" ... there is good reason to believe that the epistemology and semantics of experience cannot be essentially causal , and should instead be understood in other terms .
... A full understanding of these issues would require a lengthy separate investigation ... "
( Chalmers 1996 : p209 )
So the mystery remains .
Chalmers has replied to Shoemaker 's objection by claiming that causal theories cannot account for our knowledge of experience , but he offers us no alternative theory .
He merely suggests that we might go about accounting for knowledge by appealing to a dualist point of view .
At this stage I see no reason to reject the causal accounts of knowledge acquisition .
Shoemaker 's objection should therefore be taken very seriously .
Despite the problems associated with the conceivability of zombies , philosophers such as Chalmers maintain that the concept of zombies is perfectly coherent and leads to no logical contradiction .
But why do people think it is so easy to imagine zombies ?
Allin Cottrell suggests that the attraction in thinking of zombies as conceivable lies in our view of human cognition as an information processing system ( Cottrell 1996 ) .
Many contemporary theories of mind make the claim that the brain is an information processing system and is in essence some sort of biological computer .
These theories assume that our mental states should be understood as functional states , which are to be understood as connectionist or symbolic computational states .
If the brain is to be thought of as a computer , it is very easy to imagine the brain carrying out its computational tasks without any qualia or subjective experience , just as it is natural for us to assume that computers have no internal experiences .
In fact , it would be difficult to conceive of a present day computer as having subjective experiences and enjoying the raw feels we experience .
Computational theories of mind may offer some insight into why some believe it is easy to imagine zombies , but I think that imagining zombies in this fashion falls short of capturing the complexity of the human brain .
It is probably true that the brain is nothing more than a sophisticated information processing device , but appealing to the computational nature of human cognition should not make it any easier to imagine zombies .
We assume that computers have no qualia , but zombies are more sophisticated than electronic computers .
Zombie brains are identical to humans brains in every respect .
Human brains do not work in the same way as the other computers we come into contact with .
Imagining desktop PC's as being devoid of qualia does not help us imagine creatures with human brains who lack qualia because they are totally different types of systems .
On the otherhand , imagine that a computer is constructed that works in exactly the same fashion as a human brain .
If this system was designed as a copy of an existing biological brain and was installed in an android body , it would be hard to imagine that it did not have qualia because like a zombie , it would have the same psychology and behaviour as us .
If it could be shown that such a device was devoid of qualia , we would then have to discover how to add qualia to the system that was already complete .
This would lead us to an epiphenomenal position , which implies that it would be possible to remove the qualia from a human subject while keeping all of her physical and psychological functions in place .
Given the difficulties in adequately imagining the possibility of zombies it would seem that zombie supporters cannot be justified in stating that zombies are logically possible .
If , however , a zombie supporter could find an existing case of zombiehood , the case for zombies would become convincing .
As we have seen there would be difficulties in classifying an entity as a zombie because we only have access to its verbal claims about consciousness and these claims would lead us to believe that it was conscious in the full human sense .
But all is not lost for the zombie supporter yet .
Examples have been found of people who could be considered to be partial zombies .
These people are missing the subjective conscious experience associated with a particular aspect of cognition and can verbally report upon its absence .
In the literature , the most cited example of this type of deficit involves the curious phenomenon known as `blindsight ' .
4 : Blindsight !
Visual Zombies on Earth Lesions to the visual cortex can cause a neurological condition known as a scotoma ( a loss of vision in the corresponding area of the visual field ) .
People who have this condition retain most of their normal vision , but are aware of a blind spot in their visual field .
The interesting feature of this disorder is that in some cases , there is evidence that some visual processing is going on within the blind area of the visual field .
Experiments have been carried out in which patients have had a stimulus ( a flash of light ) presented to their blind region and were asked if they had seen anything .
Obviously , because they are blind in that area , the patients reported that they were unaware of the flash of light .
However , when forced to take a guess and point to where the flash occurred , many subjects exhibit surprising accuracy .
Somehow these people are detecting stimuli that are presented to their visual field .
These experiments have been carried out many times and there is now little doubt that these subjects are performing much better than chance .
It seems that in these cases , the visual system is carrying out some of its normal information processing tasks without the patient 's conscious awareness .
There is vision without qualia .
This phenomenon is known as blindsight and has been used , by many , as a natural example of partial zombiehood ( Block 1995 : p385 ) .
The fact that blindsight can be used to show that it is possible for people to see things without the phenomenal feel associated with sight makes the phenomenon very attractive to many zombie supporters .
Blindsight cases certainly seem to show that ( in the case of vision at least ) consciousness is not an essential part of the cognitive process that goes on within the brain .
However , despite its intuitive appeal , the phenomenon of blindsight has not convinced everyone that partial zombiehood is possible .
The first problem with using blindsight as an example of partial zombiehood should be obvious .
One of the zombie argument 's main premises states that zombies should be physically and functionally identical to human beings .
But blindsighted patients have suffered physical damage to part of their cortex and their brains are no longer physically identical to their `predamaged ' brains .
Using the impaired visual processing systems of a blindsight patient to count as an example of partial zombiehood constitutes a failure in recognising the implications of such an exercise .
One may think that one has found an example of partial zombiehood , but this would be failing to take into account the difference between a blindsighted person and a fully functional human .
This in itself does not refute Chalmers ' claim that experience is not logically supervenient on the physical .
It does , however , show that experience is naturally supervenient on cortical activity .
Gerald Vision ( 1998 : p137 ) claims that arguments that use blindsight as evidence of vision without phenomenology usually rely on misconceptions about blindsight .
Daniel Dennett ( 1993 : p331 ) makes similar claims .
He suggests that philosophers who are reliant on blindsight as an example of visual perception without consciousness are overlooking certain basic facts about the phenomena .
In some cases , it could be possible that the blindsight subjects are receiving unintended hints from the experimenter and this could explain the fact that sometimes subjects do better in the experiments than other times .
Of course , in an experimental setting , these things are carefully controlled , but we can never fully dismiss the possibility of unknown cues from the experimenter .
Dennett has suggested that the blindsight phenomenon does not show that blindsighted people lack visual consciousness .
For Dennett , blindsighted people have an impoverished visual content within their blind region , and as such , information contained in that region has a very low degree of influence on behaviour ( Dennett 1995b : p417 ) .
This would explain why blindsighted patients do not spontaneously offer reports about the content of their blind spot .
The visual content is not strong enough to have that type of influence on their behaviour .
They have to be cued from an external source .
Dennett claims , however , that it would be possible for a blindsighted patient to be trained to guess correctly when to make a guess about the contents of her blindspot .
If she still performed above chance in the experiments , she would qualify as being visually conscious .
Such a person could treat her visual stimuli in the same way as we treat conscious experience .
She could think about and report on the stimuli within her visual field and for all intents and purposes be conscious in the sense that consciousness consists in reportability or an availability for deliberation .
Presumably in this scenario , the content of the blind region would have a strong enough influence on behaviour to allow the blindsighted patient to respond to cues from other centres in the brain .
But would this count as visual consciousness ?
What about the phenomenal feel of visual experience ?
Gerald Vision has suggested that blindsighted patients would not be able to become visually conscious as Dennett suggests .
Blindsight patients have lesions that block crucial inputs to the ventral system , which is involved in object recognition .
It is unlikely that the neural pathways supporting visual recognition could be regrown by simply training a patient to recognise when to guess ( Vision 1998 : p153 ) .
This point is obvious .
Training a patient to guess when to guess about the content of their blind region would not be sufficient to repair damage to neural pathways .
If a patient was successfully trained to recognise when to guess , visual consciousness would still be missing .
Such training would probably involve recognising non-visual cues such as muscle readiness .
Vision claims that arguments from blindsight usually involve misconceptions about the phenomenon .
It is often assumed that blindsight patients have some sort of visual beliefs about the features of the objects within their blindspot and that these beliefs can be discovered through verbal reports of blindsight patients .
This assumption is misguided , however , because evidence has shown that the success rate of verbal responses to stimuli presented to the blind region is only slightly above chance .
In experiments carried out by Zihl and Von Cramon , blindsight subjects had a light flashed in their blind regions and were asked to respond in three different ways : by pressing a button , blinking or saying " yes " .
While the success rate for pressing the button or blinking was well above chance , the subjects performed significantly worse with the verbal response ( Vision 1998 : p146 ) .
Blindsight patients can reach and grasp at objects and can even rotate their hand in relation to the orientation of an object , however they usually cannot issue any verbal report about the object .
In a simplified account of the visual process , Gerald Vision draws a distinction between two functionally discrete streams of visual processing - the ventral stream and the dorsal stream .
The ventral stream is responsible for computing object features such as colour , shape and motion , while the dorsal stream processes information with regards to location .
The dorsal stream is used for immediate responses to stimuli such as grasping for food or avoiding obstacles while the ventral stream is responsible for object recognition and classification .
This distinction may provide an explanation of why blindsight patients retain visuomotor skills , such as reaching , while higher level aspects of vision that may be responsible for verbal reportability are lacking .
Vision suggests that in cases where blindsight patients manage to achieve higher than chance success in verbal response , patients may be relying on clues from premotor readiness in their muscles ( Vision 1998 : p151 ) .
This would imply that the verbal reports of blindsight patients relate only to muscle readiness rather than what is being visually perceived .
For Vision , blindsight is not the result of dissociations within a single unified visual system , its occurrence can be explained more adequately by considering the interactions between distinct self contained systems .
An understanding of blindsight shows us that the phenomenon cannot easily be used as an example of partial zombiehood .
Zombie arguments are supposed to convince us that normal behaviour is possible without qualia and that consciousness is not logically supervenient on the physical .
Blindsight , on the otherhand , shows us that physical changes to the brain can affect certain aspects of vision and that in humans , the visual process probably consists of interactions between several separate systems , some of which continue to function normally after damage has occurred to the brain .
The point is that blindsight , while an interesting phenomenon , does not provide an example of physical and behavioural sameness without qualia .
It is true that in blindsight , the visual qualia are missing , but this is the result of physical and psychological changes within the brain and so the blindsight phenomenon cannot be used to argue for the logical non-supervenience of qualia on the physical .
If anything , blindsight shows that the physical state of the brain is an essential condition for visual qualia .
This , however , is not sufficient to show that the qualia themselves are physical , it merely shows us that there is a causal link between physical processes and mental states .
4.1 : The Absent Minded Truck Driver - A Part - time Zombie
There is an example , which we may all be familiar with , that can serve as an instance in which consciousness seems to be missing for short periods of normal waking time .
Imagine that you are a long distance truck driver .
After driving for long periods of time , it is quite common to suddenly become aware of the fact that for some time you have been driving without being aware of what you have been doing ( Armstrong 1981 : p723 ) .
You may have been on a long trip and suddenly realise that you have no recollection of events that have taken place during the last part of the trip .
It is a sobering experience that most drivers have had .
It even happens on short trips .
You find yourself arriving home without any memory of your actions during the trip .
But during the trip , you were engaged in high level control operations including motor control and decision making .
You were negotiating traffic signals , avoiding cars , and changing gears , but lacked consciousness of these actions and events .
Would it be correct to say that this is an example of part - time zombiehood ?
David Armstrong believes that the driver in this scenario had minimal consciousness .
This is to say that the truck driver was perceptually conscious of the road , and that there was mental activity involved in guiding the driver 's actions .
For Armstrong , what the driver lacked was introspective awareness - an awareness of the activities going on in her mind during the trip .
In this sense , the driver 's actions were driven by a primitive level of mental functioning .
This mental functioning could be considered to be `unconscious ' ( Armstrong 1981 : p724 ) .
Fred Dretske disagrees with this claim and believes that the only sense in which the driver 's mental states were unconscious , is that the driver was not conscious of having those states .
This does not mean that the states themselves were unconscious ( Dretske 1993 : p778 ) .
Dretske makes a distinction between consciousness of objects and consciousness of facts .
For Dretske , the driver could have had conscious experiences of objects - for example green traffic lights - without having any consciousness of the facts about those objects .
We can have a conscious experience of a green light without having a conscious belief that it is a green light .
I think Dretske is correct and this shows that the case of the absent minded truck driver cannot be used as an example of zombiehood .
Another way of explaining the case of the absent minded truck driver involves memory .
It could be the case that the experiences of the truck driver were not encoded in long term memory , and that is why she cannot introspect and make claims about the long journey .
It may seem to the truck driver that `there was nothing it was like ' to be on the long drive , but that thought occurs after the event .
If we were to probe the driver at any point during the trip , we would probably get reports of a rich and full conscious experience .
The point is that if the truck driver cannot remember conscious experiences , it does not follow that they did not exist .
I cannot remember any of my conscious experiences from Wednesday the 1st of October 1997 , but that does not mean that I was a zombie on that day .
Zombies are defined as being identical to humans in every respect , except that they lack qualia .
In the case of the absent minded truck driver it is far from clear that the driver lacked qualia .
I think the alternative ways of describing what happens in this case are more convincing than the claims that the driver had no conscious experience of her trip .
What has Become of the Zombies ?
The possibility of zombies has been asserted by philosophers in an attempt to show that consciousness is not logically supervenient on the physical structure of the brain .
Zombies are physically , functionally , behaviourally and psychologically identical to humans and yet they have no qualia .
In order to construct arguments that appeal to the possibility of zombies , the zombie supporter must first show that zombies are logically possible .
For David Chalmers , that simply involves imagining a possible world in which zombies exist .
He claims that the burden of proof lies with those who wish to deny the logical possibility of zombies .
But , we have seen that imagining zombies is not as easy as Chalmers has lead us to believe .
Our imaginations inevitably fail at the task .
We can not imagine a zombie .
We can only make stipulations about what features a zombie might have ( or lack ) .
Furthermore , Shoemaker 's argument has shown us that the definition of a zombie leads us into a contradiction .
Qualia , for humans , are accessible to introspection and therefore seem to play a role in our behaviour .
If zombies have the same introspective mechanisms as we do , then given that they have no qualia , they should behave in a different way .
But according to the argument , zombies behave in exactly the same way as humans .
An option for the zombie supporter might have been to find a case of zombiehood in the real world .
If this could be done , the zombie arguments would still work .
The problem is that there does not seem to be a clear cut case of zombiehood in our world .
For both the case of blindsight and the absent minded truck driver , we could easily find alternative explanations for the phenomena without resorting to the conclusion that they provide us with true examples of zombiehood .
With no existing examples of zombiehood , the zombie supporter must appeal solely to conceivability arguments .
But after highlighting the problems with imagining zombies , it would seem that the zombie supporter has a lot of work to do .
I cannot show that consciousness is logically supervenient on the physical , though I think it is .
I have , however , provided reasons for which arguments involving zombies cannot show that consciousness is not logically supervenient on the physical .
The zombie arguments remain unconvincing and do not offer any serious challenge to physicalist descriptions of the mind .

Anyone who has ever had a run-in with a crow knows that they are quite intelligent .
But a new study released in Science proves that they may be even smarter than we think .
According to researchers , crows and other corvids possess primary consciousness — something that , until now , only humans and some primates were thought to have .

LIKE so much else in science fiction , the ray gun was invented by H.G. Wells .
In the tentacles of Wells 's Martians it was a weapon as unanswerable by earthlings as the Maxim gun in the hands of British troops was unanswerable by Africans .
Science fiction , though , it has remained .
Neither hand - held pistols nor giant , orbiting anti-missile versions of the weapon have worked .
But that is about to change .
The first serious battlefield ray gun is now being deployed .
And the next generation , now in the laboratory , is coming soon .
The deployed ray gun ( or “ directed - energy weapon ” , in the tedious jargon that military men seem compelled to use to describe technology ) is known as Zeus .
It is not designed to kill .
Rather , its purpose is to allow you to remain at a safe distance when you detonate unexploded ordnance , such as the homemade roadside bombs that plague foreign troops in Iraq .
This task now calls for explosives .
In practice , that often means using a rocket - propelled grenade , so as not to expose troops to snipers .
But rockets are expensive , and sometimes miss their targets .
Zeus is effective at a distance of 300 metres , and a laser beam , unlike a rocket , always goes exactly where you point it .
At the moment , there is only one Zeus in the field .
It is sitting in the back of a Humvee in an undisclosed theatre of war .
But if it proves successful it will , according to Scott McPheeters of the American army 's Cruise Missile Defence Systems Project Office for Directed Energy Applications , be joined by a dozen more within a year .
You fight with light ?
If Zeus works , it will make soldiers ' lives noticeably safer .
But what would really make a difference would be the ability to destroy incoming artillery rounds .
The Laser Area Defence System , LADS , being developed by Raytheon , is intended to do just that — blowing incoming shells and small rockets apart with laser beams .
The targets are tracked by radar and ( if they are rockets ) by infrared sensors .
When they come within range , they are zapped .
If it works , LADS will be a disruptive technology in more senses than one .
It will probably supersede Raytheon 's Phalanx system , which uses mortars to do the same thing .
Phalanx and its competitors require lots of ammunition , and can be overwhelmed by heavy barrages .
By contrast , Mike Booen , vice - president of Advanced Missile Defence and Directed Energy Weapons at Raytheon , observes , as long as LADS is supplied with electricity it has “ an infinite magazine ” .
And LADS is merely the most advanced of a group of anti-artillery lasers under development .
Though Raytheon is convinced it is on to a winner and is paying for most of the development costs out of its own pocket , it has received some money from the Directed Energy Weapons Programme Office of the American navy .
In August , inter - service rivalry reared its head , when the army handed Boeing a $ 36 m contract to develop a similar weapon , known at the moment as the High Energy Laser Technology Demonstrator .
The army 's Space and Missile Defence Command is also in the game .
Its Joint High Power Solid State Laser , a prototype of which should be ready next summer , is meant to destroy rockets the size of the Katyushas used by insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq , and by Hizbullah in Lebanon .
The most ambitious laser project of all , though , is the Airborne Laser , or ABL , being developed by the American Missile Defence Agency and Boeing , Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman .
The beam is generated by mixing chemicals in a reactor known as a COIL ( chemical oxygen iodine laser ) and packs a far bigger punch than the electrically generated beams emitted by systems such as LADS .
When mounted in the nose - cone of a specially converted Boeing 747 , an ABL should be capable of disabling a missile from a distance of several hundred kilometres .
The aim is to hit large ballistic missiles , including ICBMs , just after they are launched — in the boost phase .
The ABL is therefore a son of Ronald Reagan 's Star Wars scheme , although in that programme , which dates back to the 1980s , the lasers would have operated from space .
There are many advantages to attacking a missile during its boost phase .
First , it is still travelling slowly , so it is easier to hit .
Second , it is easy to detect because of its exhaust plume ( once the boost phase is over , the engine switches off and the missile follows Newton 's law of gravity to its target ) .
Third , if it has boosters that are designed to be jettisoned , it will be a larger target when it is launched .
Fourth , any debris will fall on those who launched it , rather than those at whom it was aimed .
Getting the system to work in practice will be hard , though .
A missile launch is observed using an infrared detector .
Then the missile must be tracked .
When the beam fires , the control system must compensate both for aircraft jitter and for distortions in the beam 's path caused by atmospheric conditions .
And ABL - carrying planes must be in the right place at the right time in the first place .
Even so , a number of tests have been carried out , and according to Colonel Robert McMurry , the head of the Airborne Laser Programme Office at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico , there will be a full - scale attempt to shoot down a boost - phase missile off the coast of California next summer .
All of which is good news , at least for countries able to deploy the new hardware .
But wars are not won by defence alone .
What people in the business are more coy about discussing is the offensive use of lasers .
At least one such system is under development , though .
The aeroplane - mounted Advanced Tactical Laser , or ATL , another chemical laser being put together by Boeing and the American air force , is designed to “ neutralise ” targets on the ground from a distance of several kilometres .
Targeting data will be provided by telescopic cameras on the aircraft , by pictures from satellites and unmanned aerial drones , and by human target - spotters on the ground .
The question is : what targets ?
The ATL 's supporters discuss such possibilities as disabling vehicles by destroying their wheels and disrupting enemy communications by severing telephone lines .
Killing troops is rarely mentioned .
However , John Pike , the director of GlobalSecurity.org , a military think - tank in Alexandria , Virginia , who is an expert on ATL , says its main goal is , indeed , to kill enemy combatants .
Surely this is forbidden ?
Boeing is unwilling to discuss the matter and John Wachs , the head of the Space and Missile Defence Command 's Directed Energy Division , observes that it is “ politically sensitive ” .
The public may have misgivings about a silent and invisible weapon that would boil the body 's fluids before tearing it apart in a burst of vapour .
That seems oddly squeamish , though .
War is not a pleasant business .
It is doubtful that being burst by a laser is worse than being hit by a burst from a machine gun .
As the Sudanese found out at the Battle of Omdurman in 1898 , the year that “ The War of the Worlds ” was published , that is pretty nasty too .
After hours of debating , lawmakers have made a tentative plan .
But will everyone be on board ?
The bailout : Will the center hold ?
Proofreading and some heavy - duty political marketing are the next big steps for Treasury ’s $ 700 billion rescue plan as House and Senate leaders take their agreement back to their restless caucuses — split on the left and right .
House Republicans are the biggest test , with conservatives still rebellious .
But Democrats have their own problems and moved quickly to emphasize Wall Street reforms , new protections for homeowners and an elaborate financing scheme that would allow a future Congress to cut off the funding after the first $ 350 billion commitment .

“ If we do n’t pass it , we should n’t be in Congress , ” snapped Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , the lead negotiator for Senate Republicans .
But from the moment House Speaker Nancy Pelosi brought down the gavel Sunday , a parade of conservatives and liberals were on their feet bashing the deal .
And the political center may be defined by the two major presidential candidates , John McCain and Barack Obama , who both signaled support for the package .
As sitting senators from Arizona and Illinois , McCain and Obama will be asked to vote themselves when that chamber takes up the legislation later this week .
But the House , which hopes to act as early as Monday , will be the true test of their influence in their parties .
“ The breakthrough between Congress and the administration is the culmination of a sorry period in our history , in which reckless speculation and greed on Wall Street and lax oversight from Washington led to a meltdown of our financial markets , ” Obama said .
“ But regardless of how we got here , a failure to deal with the current crisis would have devastating consequences for our economy , costing millions of Americans their jobs and retirement security . ”
McCain , appearing later on ABC News ’
“ This Week , ” said he wanted still to see details , but “ hopefully , yes ” would back the bill .
“ This is something that all of us will swallow hard and go forward with , ” McCain said .
Following marathon negotiations that ran past midnight , the agreement now is taking shape in the form of an estimated 106 - page bill that the leadership hopes to finalize and post on the House Web site Sunday afternoon .
Treasury would like to see prompt Senate action as well , but given the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah beginning at sundown Monday , a final vote could very well wait until Wednesday or Thursday .
Republican Whip Roy Blunt , the chief negotiator for the House GOP , said he wanted to first see the final text before committing himself , but the Missouri Republican said he was optimistic that it will be something his party can support .
All indications early Sunday were that Blunt and House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , both of whom were praised by McCain , were working to tamp down the opposition among conservatives .
“ I ’m not sure yet we can sell it to our conference , but I ’m 100 percent sure that this is the best deal we could get , ” said a Republican aide .
Business lobbies stepped up their pressure in anticipation of a party meeting on the bill late Sunday .
“ Main Street and Wall Street are inextricably linked , ” wrote the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a vote alert Sunday , urging passage and warning it may count the House vote in its annual scorecard .
“ This proposal addresses the needs of both and will not only begin the process of righting the financial markets , but help to return the economy to robust growth , which will create jobs across America . ”
“ We ’ve still got more to do to finalize it , but I think we ’re there , ” Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in announcing the verbal agreement at 12:30 Sunday morning – the cap on a remarkable week of intense activity for both lawmakers and himself .
By Paulson ’s side , Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , joked that no solution to a problem could be “ more elegant ” than the problem itself , and certainly the huge credit crisis facing the American economy is brutal in its scope .
The massive government intervention , like the crisis itself , takes everyone into uncharted waters .
And in crafting the bill , lawmakers found themselves scared by what they were asked to do , even as they were trying to calm frightened markets .
“ There is some tension between the needs of the members and the needs of the markets , ” Frank said of his partnership with Paulson “ He thinks neurosis on the part of the markets deserves more credibility that neurosis on the part of elected officials and getting a bill past . ”
The final bill reflects this tension , and while final details have not yet been released , following is a brief summary as described by the administration and lawmakers :
• The full $ 700 billion is authorized , but the money will be parsed out in a series of installments that give Paulson a relatively free hand in accessing the first $ 350 billion .
The White House must notify Congress when Treasury wants the second half , and lawmakers would then have 15 days in which to cut off funds .
But this must be done in the form of a joint resolution , subject to a veto by the president and therefore requiring a two - thirds majority in both houses to be effective .
• Paulson ’s free hand on spending is matched by substantially greater oversight of the program than Treasury first envisioned , as well as demands for greater transparency , including the posting of transactions on line .
Apart from a new oversight board appointed by the bipartisan leadership in Congress , the GAO will have a presence in Treasury , and an independent inspector general will monitor the secretary ’s decisions .
• Lawmakers won the promise of new restrictions on executive pay and severance packages for Wall Street executives whose companies are helped by the rescue plan .
And the bill reflects a more aggressive approach toward Treasury also claiming an equity interest — on behalf of taxpayers — through warrants giving the government options for non-voting stock shares that could turn a profit once the economy improves .
The precise language of the executive pay provision was one of the most hotly contested issues , and the final deal rests on Paulson being more aggressive than he first wanted , but also on lawmakers ’ giving him some discretion so that these reforms do n’t cripple his ability to draw a wide selection of companies into the program .
The bill takes a hybrid approach , and in the case of assets bought at auction , the most severe penalties kick in only when Treasury has bought more than $ 300 million in assets .
At that juncture , a 20 percent surtax would be imposed on rich severance packages , and in the case of highly paid executives , the company would lose its deduction for salaries above $ 500,000 .
• There is a joint commitment by Democrats and Paulson to use the government ’s increased leverage in the mortgage market to help homeowners facing foreclosure .
Democrats stepped back from their demands for a change in law allowing bankruptcy judges to restructure residential mortgage payments , but the bill extends a popular tax provision to protect individuals from tax liability on their foreclosures .
• On two key points , final compromises were required for competing priorities between House Democrats and Republicans .
In the first case , Democrats had proposed that the Treasury be required to impose a fee on Wall Street transactions to help cover the cost of any government losses as a result of the rescue plan .
But Republicans and Treasury resisted , and the final compromise calls for the next president to submit a legislative proposal to Congress in five years , after some assessment can be made of the costs to the government .
The second compromise dealt with a Republican proposal that the government intervene in the markets , not by buying up bad assets but by providing a federally backed insurance program that might make the same mortgage - related securities more salable .
The compromise reached would require Paulson to “ establish ” such an insurance alternative if he goes ahead with his plan , but he is not compelled to use the insurance option .
• Early Republican demands for added tax cuts were not successful , but the bill includes an estimated $ 3 billion provisions to help small community banks take a deduction for losses from their investments in the two mortgage giants , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , since taken over the government this summer .
House GOP leaders had warned Saturday evening that they would need to take any deal to their rank - and - file members before committing to back it .
Racing to reach a deal before the markets open Monday , lawmakers met late into the night in Pelosi ’s Capitol office .
Paulson set up a sort of command center in Boehner ’s office , with legislators and staffers criss - crossing Statuary Hall as they shuttled back and forth .
As the talks neared 10 p.m. , Paulson could be seen through the windows of Boehner ’s second - floor office , sitting on a sofa flanked by aides in chairs around the room .
Pelosi passed through a hallway with her son .
Asked if a deal would come together before the night was over , she said , “ I hope so . ”
Just before 11 p.m. , Paulson , the two principal GOP negotiators – Blunt and Gregg – Emanuel , Pelosi chief of staff John Lawrence and White House legislative affairs aide Dan Meyer walked into Pelosi ’s office .
In a sign that negotiations were growing serious earlier in the evening , a Pelosi aide collected BlackBerrys from the staffers meeting in her office so that no details would leak out .
Just after 8 p.m. , pizzas arrived at Paulson ’s HQ in Boehner ’s office .
Democratic staffers ordered in burgers from Five Guys .
" This is Saturday night , ” said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. )
“ You have the secretary of Treasury .
You have congressional leaders .
You have committee chairmen of all the committees of jurisdiction .
And we are here .
There ’s a reason we ’re here — because there ’s a great feeling of responsibility to get a package as quickly as we can while doing it as well as we can . "
While the meeting in Pelosi ’s office was supposed to include just Paulson and the principal negotiators – Blunt , Gregg , Frank and Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) — a substantial number of Senate Democrats were there as well .
Republicans complained that the presence of the additional Democrats was making the process more difficult ; by setting up shop in Boehner ’s office , Paulson was able to get some breathing room after spending hours in close quarters , where at times he was hectored by some of the Senate Democrats .
Earlier in the day Saturday , Boehner had gone before the TV cameras to say that House Republicans would not agree to a bill “ that bails out Wall Street at the expense of American taxpayers . ”
" Somebody , maybe it was Einstein , said things should be done as quickly as possible , but no quicker than possible , " said Blunt , who added : " We 're not moving on any kind of artificial timeline .
We 're moving toward the very best solution in the shortest period of time . "
But there was also a new sense of urgency to the negotiations Saturday – and increasing pressure on the House GOP .
President Bush pushed for a deal in his weekly radio address .
The editorial page of the Wall Street Journal — influential with conservative Republicans — said a bailout was needed “ to avoid a deeper downturn . ”
Sen. Bob Bennett ( R - Utah ) warned publicly that another major U.S. bank was “ teetering ” on the edge of failure , and Republican Senate leaders — plus GOP Sens .
Pete Domenici ( N.M. ) , John Sununu ( N.H. ) and Gregg — laid out doomsday scenarios in a Republican Senate Conference meeting .
Sources said Saturday afternoon that as many as 40 Republican senators were prepared to vote for the emerging bailout deal if bankruptcy and social spending provisions are dropped .
And while McConnell was not yet ready to abandon House Republicans — or McCain — sources said his views might change if there were still no deal by Sunday evening .
For his part , McCain – fresh off his debate with Obama in Mississippi – spent Saturday calling House Republicans to test support for the rescue plan , according to one lawmaker who was contacted .
In addition to President Bush and Paulson , the McCain campaign said the Arizona senator had been in touch with McConnell , Gregg , Sen. Jon Kyl , Boehner , Blunt and nine other House Republicans .
As his colleagues worked on the deal at the Capitol Saturday night , McCain and his wife , Cindy , dined with Sen .
Joe Lieberman and his wife , Hadassah , at Cafe Mozu inside Washington ’s Mandarin Oriental Hotel .
Obama was at a dinner in Washington for the Congressional Black Caucus .
Earlier in the day , his campaign said , he had talked by phone four times with Paulson and had made calls to Pelosi , Reid , Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) and others involved in the negotiations .
Correction : Based on an erroneous pool report , an earlier version of this story said that the McCains and the Liebermans dined at CityZen Saturday night .
In fact , they ate at Café Mozu , a less formal restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel .

In theory I should now be dead .
Not from disease or an accident but because of the simple fact that my head was set to be severed from my body with a sharp sword in a public square in Riyadh , the Saudi Arabian capital .
In 2001 , I was condemned to die in this brutal archaic fashion after being caught up in what became known as the " Saudi Brits " affair .
Along with eight others , I was rounded up by the panicked Saudi authorities after a series of attacks on foreigners in the kingdom suddenly started to make this expat country of choice seem distinctly unsafe .
Desperate to pin a nascent anti-government insurgency on squabbling " bootlegger " foreigners ( anything rather than concede that ultra- safe Saudi Arabia had an internal terrorism problem ) , we were to be the sacrificial lambs .
Remember those bizarre , wooden " confessions " , haltingly delivered by scared looking men on national Saudi television ?
One of those came from me .
If I looked petrified it may have been because I 'd been dragged to prison , threatened , sleep - deprived and beaten so severely that I almost died from heart attacks .
In a numbed state of shock , I would have confessed to anything .
As it was , I said I 'd committed a series of laughably implausible " turf war " crimes that never even existed .
The farce continued .
I was subjected to two perfunctory , completely scripted trials at which I was told to plead guilty and beg for mercy .
I was sentenced to death , tried again twice without even being in the courtroom at all , and again sentenced to death by beheading .
This , remember , is what happened just a handful of years ago in a justice system of an influential Middle Eastern country that enjoys excellent diplomatic relations with most of the world 's powerful countries , including Britain .
It was only this time last year , for example , that we were rolling out the red carpet for King Abdullah 's state visit .
So , how did I come to be alive to write this for the Guardian today ?
Simple .
Belonging to a wealthy " client " nation like the United Kingdom means that while you can be tortured and falsely imprisoned in Saudi Arabia , in practice you are not going to suffer a brutal demise in " chop chop " square in this execution - addicted country .
At the time of my ordeal there was much talk of " diplomatic efforts " to secure our release .
This was mostly UK government spin – they had to put it about that they were trying hard to get us out .
Yes , they will have exerted pressure on the Riyadh authorities but I later learnt that I and my fellow detainees had been released as part of a " prisoner exchange " involving five Saudis being held by the US at Guantánamo Bay .
Finally released in August 2003 , after 964 days of solitary confinement , torture and dehumanising terror , I harbour no illusions about what saved me : my passport .
There was no apology , no official pardon , just a perfunctory granting of " clemency " and immediate expulsion from the country .
An accident of birth had preserved me and eventually my release became a political expediency .
Ironically , even the manner of my release further confirmed the politically corrupt nature of the Saudi system of justice .
Foreign workers like me , subject to bogus trials and languishing in miserable jails , can only hope that the Saudi lottery of false mercy will save them .
Meanwhile , of course , Saudi 's poor migrant workers from Somalia , Bangladesh , the Philippines or Pakistan are virtually doomed if they face a capital charge ( not all for lethal crimes , incidentally ) .
Anyone who might somehow think that Saudi justice is harsh but fair should read a new Amnesty International report ( pdf ) which shows that the legal system is heavily rigged , with well - connected Saudi nationals up to eight times more likely to negotiate " blood money " pay - offs to victims ' families that lead to commutation .
Certainly one should n't forget that ordinary Saudis without the right connections are also going to their deaths in this lethal lottery of a justice system .
The latest figures show that this blood - soaked country is on average executing at least two people every single week .
In my experience what passes for a judicial system in Saudi Arabia has less to do with investigating crime and punishing criminals , and far more to do with maintaining control and compliance among both its own citizens and its community of ex-patriot workers .
Why should we care ?
Well , apart from the fact that thousands of British people go to work in this country every year and that Britain continues to maintain extremely cordial relations with the Saudi royals , this wretched system is simply an affront , not only to justice but to our common humanity .
If ever there was an advertisement for the abolition of the death penalty and for all that is wrong with its application , Saudi ( in ) justice provides it .
I can only ask : when are western governments going to stop pandering to the Saudi princes ?
Or could it be that they prefer to go on burying their heads in the sand ?
Django development on OS X using a local media server
Update : Eric Moritz has pointed out to me that Django provides an easy way to do this already .
See How to serve static files .
For a long time now , I ’ve been uploading CSS and image changes to an FTP server every time I wanted to change the look and feel of a locally developed Django app , and used an HTTP path in my MEDIA_URL setting .
It was n’t until this week that I found an effective way to host static media from outside of Django while developing locally .
For some , this solution will be rather obvious .
For anyone else , I hope this helps your workflow like it helped mine .
Step 1 : Turn on OS X ’s built - in Apache server
Open your System Preferences , and select the “ Sharing ” preferences .
Click the check box next to “ Web Sharing ” to turn on the built - in Apache web server .
When this box is checked , visiting http://localhost/~yourusername/ in a web browser will show the files from the “ Sites ” folder inside your user ’s home folder .
Step 2 : Set your Django project to use your local URL for media
In your projects settings.py file , create a folder called ( yourprojectname ) , then set :
1 MEDIA_URL = " http://localhost/~yourusername/yourprojectname "
Step 3 : Use MEDIA_URL in your templates instead of full paths
When MEDIA_URL is set in your settings.py file , Django provides adds a {{ MEDIA_URL }} variable to the context for each request on your site :
1 2 3 < link href= " {{ MEDIA_URL }}/css/base.css " rel= " stylesheet " type= " text/css " /> <img src= " {{ MEDIA_URL }}/img/picture.jpg " alt= " Picture " />
Step 4 : Make a folder for media inside your project
Create a folder named ‘ media ’ inside your project folder , then use dynamic paths in your settings.py to make deployment easier
1 2 3 4 5 6 # Store the path to the project folder in a variable for repeated use import os project_path = os .
path .
dirname ( __file__ ) #
Set the media root as the folder named ' media ' inside the project folder MEDIA_ROOT = os .
path .
join ( project_path , ' media ' )
Step 5 : Point MEDIA_URL to MEDIA_ROOT
Since OS X’s Apache server looks in ~ / Sites / for files , but media is hosted elsewhere inside the Django project , the two need to be connected .
In your terminal , make a symbolic link ( also known as an alias ) from ~/ Sites / yourprojectname / to the Django project :
1 ln -s / path/to/your / project ~/Sites/yourprojectname
To confirm this has worked , open your ~/ Sites in the Finder and you should see a folder with an arrow , indicating an alias , labeled with your project name .
Click on the alias and you ’ll see the contents of the media folder inside your project .
Fire up your Django development server , and you ’re ready to go .

When the election is over and the people have spoken , it 's time to get behind the incoming commander - in - chief to signal to our children and the world that we are a country united in democracy .
But Sean Hannity has continued his faux - panic , planting doubt and implying Obama has radical , extremist loyalties even after the argument fell flat and drew wide criticism .
Hannity can now be considered anti-American by his own measure - for years he 's criticized anti-war activists of not supporting the President .
Now it is he who is undermining the authority of the incoming President .
The people heard the smears on Hannity 's top-rated radio and TV shows and felt there was not enough basis in fact , calling for a loftier conversation of issues .
Following the historic election , Hannity continued to make the same accusations : Obama is not to be trusted , an evil side of him will emerge .
The back up ?
Hannity specifies nothing , flailing at undefined evil , doubting the electorate 's ability to decide and discern .
Without tangible evidence for these claims , who is the extremist now ?
Perhaps Sean Hannity 's father never had that talk with him .
You know , the one fathers and sons have when the kid , just learning how American politics works , sees his preferred candidate has lost and continues to bad - mouth the winner .
That 's when the grown - up explains the American tradition to the child .
My father told me plainly , when the election is called , it 's time for the whole country to get behind the new leader and give the benefit of the doubt , because we are a representative democracy .
Some call it grace , being a gentleman , sportsmanship , or showing character - but elections in America and Zimbabwe are vastly different because win or lose , Americans defer to majority rule and established laws in peaceful transitions of power between administrations , especially given our diversity and established history of party pendulum swings .
But times may be changing .
Sean Hannity 's post-election broadcasts continue the same impugning of the incoming President 's character McCain himself hesitated to use , because it was based more on conjecture than the concrete .
Hannity 's arguments ignore or distort Obama 's policy proposals , for example telling listeners Obama wants to raise their taxes when most would receive a net tax cut under the new structure .
Hannity also condemns a trillion in new spending without factoring in the stimulative effect of domestic reinvestment and burying the dire necessity of the inherited economic crisis .
Throughout the campaign , Sean 's tactics were almost exclusively unsubstantive and negative , hinging on indeterminate musings and speculation .
Hannity 's plan was to plant suspicion based on radical theories - Obama as terrorist , Muslim , Marxist , racist , anti-American , election cheat , you name it .
The suggestion that democracy did not work here exposes Sean Hannity 's prioritization of his personal causes : tax advantages for the very wealthiest , deregulation , and a free hand for the most aggressive war - hawks .
Along with # 1 juggernaut Rush Limbaugh , the talk radio industry is a daily infomercial for the neoconservative movement and military - industrial complex we were warned about by President Eisenhower in 1961 .
In other words , this is not your father 's Conservative , calling for small government and strong ethics and fiscal responsibility .
Sean is combining the unethical campaign tactics used by Nixon with cowboy foreign policy and deficit - be - damned defense spending seen under Reagan .
This is not to say the incoming President should not be questioned or criticized - just the opposite , he should be engaged in continuous dialogue with the American people .
The selection of Rahm Emanuel as Chief of Staff has already been heavily questioned from the left , but the Obama administration 's first email blast just went out this week , asking for the input of ordinary people in shaping the future of America at change.gov .
Having the President enjoin the millions on his email list in two - way conversation is a refreshing use of technology to push democracy forward .
Hannity , by contrast , seems to be facing several dead ends , trying to claim voters rejected " Republicanism " while they still love Conservatism .
Hannity is playing games with nomenclature to defend himself after supporting President Bush and Dick Cheney throughout both terms , praising their economic and security policies daily .
The public has overwhelmingly rejected Bush , but it does n't erase that Hannity called him one of " our greatest modern presidents " , a " masterful crisis president " and a " defender of our liberties " .
In fact , Hannity 's broadcasts have run so closely parallel to the Bush 's daily talking points , many questioned whether Hannity was in direct contact with the White House .
When Bush 's former Press Secretary Scott McClellan confirmed Karl Rove did in fact have a " massive operation " running from the White House to supply comprehensive talking points to friendly talk show personalities , Fox 's Bill O'Reilly bent over backwards to make clear he was not involved in this violation of domestic anti-propaganda laws .
Hannity has not yet denied whether he has been in direct contact without disclosure , but as soon as Karl Rove left his White House post , he began appearing on Hannity 's TV and radio shows in heavy rotation .
In full - on panic today , Hannity complains that a larger Democratic majority will enact some version of the Fairness Doctrine to silence him , cleverly painting himself as a victim .
In fact , the Fairness Doctrine was never used to censor anyone , rather to compel them to provide responsible journalistic balance to the best of their ability .
For example , Hannity would n't be able to state that Obama sat in Rev .
Wright 's pews for twenty years listening to hate - filled diatribes without also giving the fuller picture that the vitriolic rantings of Rev.
Wright made up only a very tiny portion of the known sermons he 's delivered over the decades and nothing available proves Obama was present during any such controversial speeches .
Before 1987 , it was the broadcasting corporations who chose not to air lopsided political arguments because it was cheaper and easier to avoid back and forth debate .
Enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine was difficult and inconsistent .
Today , those who suggest reviving some version of the law are concerned about a serious issue - wholesale ignorance .
The U.S. has been long ridiculed internationally for wrongly believing Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11 and it's no news to anyone who our top rated " news " sources are - Fox on TV and Limbaugh / Hannity on radio .
Our founding fathers created public education so our voters could not only discern candidate choices intelligently , but could keep an informed eye out for shenanigans .
Are not call - in talk shows better for their controversy and difference of opinion ?
Not on The Sean Hannity Show , where the guests are predominantly on the same page as the host , the make - up of aired calls does n't approach real - world diversity , and the news items cited exclude altogether events like the filing of Articles of Impeachment in Congress against the President and Vice President , the removal of Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General , or the polls showing national disapproval of continuing the Iraq War .

( CNN ) -- Nine of 10 American workers are losing sleep over financial worries , according to a survey released Monday by a company that helps workers deal with wellness issues .
Keeping up with the rising cost of living and credit card debt were top concerns preventing people from falling asleep , according to the results from ComPsych Corporation , which surveyed employees of companies it serves .
Thirty percent of respondents reported worrying about the cost of living while 29 percent cited credit - card debt .
Making mortgage payments and building retirement accounts also kept people awake , with 14 percent and 13 percent , respectively , listing those as their main concerns , the survey said .
How to afford childrens ' school tuition and health care costs robbed just three percent of sleep , the survey said .
Only eight percent of respondents said they are not worried and have no trouble sleeping .
The study was compiled and released by ComPsych Corporation , which contracts with companies to provide employee assistance programs .
" As the largest EAP , our increased call volume has been a reflection of the financial stressors faced by U.S. employees , " said Richard Chaifetz , ComPsych 's chief executive officer .

A while ago I had an on -site job interview at Google .
The position I was interviewing for was a Google SRE .
SRE stands for Site Reliability Engineering .
Site reliability engineers ( SREs ) are both software engineers and systems administrators , responsible for Google 's production services from end - to - end .
I interviewed with eight separate people .
The first three were over the phone and the remaining five were on - site .
The first interview was with the recruiter and was not very technical but the other seven were technical .
Unfortunately , I just learned that I 'm not getting hired .
The recruiter said that " the morning interviews were not that great " and " I should get more experience to work in their mission critical team . "
Update :
This article has been translated to Japanese .
Update :
This article has been translated to German .
Here is how it all happened .
Shortly after I published the Code Reuse in Google Chrome post , I was contacted by a recruiter at Google .
The email said :
I recruit top notch Software Engineering talent at Google .
I recently came across your name as a possible world class Engineer and am intrigued to know more about you .
I promise to exchange some detailed info about us as well .
Interested to hear more ?
Want to be an impact player at Google ?
Then please respond with a current ( English ) copy of your resume and I 'll be happy to call you and discuss .
At first I thought I would be applying for a software developer position but after we went through my skillset , the recruiter concluded that I would better fit as an SRE .
I agreed with him .
This seemed like a perfect position for me .
I love system administration as much as I love programming .
First Interview ( phone )
The first interview was on 10th of September with the recruiter .
He explained the Google recruitment process to me and we went through my skill set .
I had to rank myself from 0 - 10 in a bunch of areas .
Here is how I ranked myself :
C programming – 8
C++ programming – 7
Python programming – 6
Networking – 6
Algorithms and data structures – 6
Distributed systems – 5
Linux systems administration – 9
Based on my answers , we concluded that SRE was the best position for me .
An SRE has to know everything : algorithms , data structures , programming , networking , distributed systems , scalable architecture , troubleshooting .
It 's a great hacker position !
The second half of the interview had some basic technical questions to make sure I was n't bluffing .
The questions were about Linux systems administration , algorithms , computer architecture and C programming .
You can find all questions from all interviews at the bottom of this post .
I made a couple of mistakes but he was satisfied and we scheduled the next phone interview .
He warned me that it will be very technical and I should do a really good preparation .
I asked him to give me a plenty of time for the preparation and we scheduled the next interview on 22nd of September .
He also told me that each phone interview is going to be 45 minutes to 1 hour long .
I created a daily schedule and started preparing .
I found three presentations on what SRE is all about :
Then I read all other blog posts about Google interviews , including typical qustions :
I printed and read four Google research papers :
I also went through several books :
As I did not know which programming language I will use in the next interviews , I went through dozens of recipes in C++ Cookbook , Python Cookbook , and Perl Cookbook .
Second Interview ( phone )
The second phone interview was with an engineer from Google .
He worked on the Ads team which is responsible for running AdSense , AdWords , and other advertisement stuff .
The interview was very technical and started with an algorithmic problem which was too large to fit in computer memory .
I had to tell him precisely how I would get around this problem and what data structures and algorithms I would use .
He also asked me to think out loudly .
The interview continued with questions about data structures , DNS , TCP protocol , a security vulnerability associated with TCP , networking in general , and Google itself .
The questions where :
You 've 100 GB file but only 1GB of memory .
How would you sort it ?
Tell me about your favorite data structure .
How does DNS work ?
Can DNS work over TCP ?
How do DNS root servers work ?
How does BGP work ?
How does TCP work and what is 3 - way handshake ?
How does TCP session spoofing works and how is it prevented ?
What would you change at Google ?
After the interview the engineer had to write feedback to the recruiter .
It was positive and I could move on with the interview .
Third Interview ( phone )
I gave myself more time to prepare and the third interview was on the 1st of October .
It was with an engineer from the Google traffic team .
In this interview , I had a very simple programming question and I had to do coding over phone .
I was free to choose the language and I chose Perl as it is my most favorite programming language .
It was impossible to dictate Perl syntax over phone " for my dollar sign element open paren at data close paren open curly brace ... close curly brace " so I submitted my Perl program over the email .
The question was : Write a program to find the set difference .
Given two sets A and B , find elements in A - B , or in other words , find elements in set A that are not in B .
Then the same problem was taken to the next level , what if the data we are working on is gigabytes in size , terabytes in size .
How would my program / solution change ?
Finally I had a question about DNS again , then HTTP protocol , routing , and TCP data transfer .
The questions were :
How does DNS work ?
How does HTTP work ?
What happens when you type www.google.com in the browser ?
If a HTTP request fails , does the operating system retry it , or the browser ?
The feedback was again positive and I could prepare for the on -site interviews .
In my conversation with my recruiter I got to know that there will be five on - site interviews , each exactly 45 minutes long .
One on my previous work experience , one on algorithms and data structures , one on troubleshooting and networking , and two on software development with the focus on C and C ++.
My recruiter suggested that I read a few more documents :
Fourth Interview ( on- site )
The fourth interview was finally at Googleplex in Mountain View .
At 10 am I met my recruiter and we had a 15 minute discussion about the interviews .
He told me I would have two interviews now , then one of Google engineers would take me to lunch in one of Google 's restaurants and then I would have three other interviews .
At 10:15 am the first on - site interview began .
It was about my previous job experience .
I have had a lot of job experience in the past and I decided to tell about a physical security notification system that I coded in C on Linux a few years ago .
The system received messages through the serial port , send out emails through SMTP , and text messages through a GSM modem .
In the last minutes of the interview he asked me some basic Unix filesystem questions , such as , what is an inode ?
In all the on - site interviews I was writing and drawing on two big whiteboards .
Fifth Interview ( on- site )
The fifth interview began at 11 am .
It was a coding session and began with a trick question and not a real coding problem .
The trick question was this : " What 's the angle between clock hands when it 's 3:15 ? "
Then I was asked to implement the solution in C for arbitrary time ( hour / minute ) .
The solution was a mathematical expression that was a one - line return statement .
Then I was asked to write an implementation of a binary tree on the whiteboard .
While coding , I forgot to initialize a data structure that I had mallow ( ) 'ed .
The program would have segfault 'ed in real life and I would have noticed the error .
I said there were no errors here but the Google engineer pointed out I had n't initialized data .
After this interview I was taken to lunch by the engineer who interviewed me on the second phone interview .
She told me she was working at Google for two years and was very happy about it .
We went to Asian food restaurant in Googleplex .
Then she showed me around Googleplex .
Sixth Interview ( on- site )
The sixth interview began at 12:45 pm .
It was a troubleshooting and networking interview .
The interviewer drew a network diagram on the whiteboard and had imagined a problem in there .
I had to ask a bunch of specific networking questions to locate the problem .
He was satisfied and in the last few minutes of the interview he asked me some specific networking device questions , like what 's the difference between a router and a switch , and what 's OSI model .
Seventh Interview ( on- site )
The seventh interview began at 1:30 pm .
It was a coding session .
I was asked to implement a simple string manipulation subroutine that finds common characters in two C strings .
I could use either C or C ++. I chose C. I made an off - by - one mistake there .
The whole interview focused on this one problem .
Eighth Interview ( on- site )
The last , eight , interview began at 2:15 pm .
It was algorithms and data structures interview .
The problem presented here was similar to the problem in the 2nd interview .
Not only was it a problem too large to fit in computer memory but it also was distributed .
How to sort data that does n't fit in memory and you 've got 100 computers to sort it .
I had to do all kinds of trickery to solve it .
The interview was very free - style and we talked back and forth about the problem .
I arrived at the correct solution near the end of the interview and he said that not many candidates got that far .
I was also asked if I knew map - reduce and of course I knew map - reduce as I just had read the Google paper .
This was a map - reduce problem .
After the interview the engineer escorted me out to the lobby and I went back home .
The End
Overall , the Google interview was super fun .
I love trivia questions like this .
The questions were technical but not very challenging or difficult .
Here are all the questions that I can remember :
Tell me about one of the projects on your resume .
What technologies did you use to get this project going ?
What if your project had 5000 or 50000 or 5000000 users ?
What 's an inode ?
What 's the angle between clock hands when it 's 3:15 ?
Write a C function that returns angle between clock hands for any ( hour , minute ) .
Write a binary tree .
How would you troubleshoot this problem - network diagram presented .
What 's the difference between a router and switch ?
Implement a routine in C that counts number of characters in a string .
Given 100GB file and a computer with 1GB of memory , how would you sort it .
Can you make it parallel and solve it on 100 computers ?
What 's a priority queue ?
How does BGP work ?
Can DNS use TCP ?
In which cases DNS uses TCP ?
Implement set difference in any language you like .
How does HTTP work ?
How does 3 way handshake work in TCP ?
What 's void * ?
?
What 's the sticky bit ?
What 's the system call for creating files ?
Order by execution time : reading disk , accessing memory , context switch , writing a cpu register .
How would you count the number of set bits in a very huge number ?
See you all next time !
Air crew had to forcibly remove the pilot of a plane carrying 155 passengers when he suffered a breakdown mid-flight over the Atlantic .
An air steward then had to help pilot the jet in an emergency landing at Shannon .
Another steward was hurt as the crew forced the co-pilot out of the cockpit .
Yesterday , the Dublin - based Air Accident Investigation Unit released a report into the Air Canada Boeing 767 drama .
The report reveals how the cabin crew were called on by the captain to forcibly remove his second - in - command who had cracked up .
The co-pilot had been rambling on and was in danger of causing danger at the flight controls .
His First Officer ’s behaviour on the Toronto to Heathrow flight had become “ belligerent and unco-operative ” .
One cabin attendant suffered a wrist injury carrying the co pilot to a seat in the body of the plane , the report says .
The twin -engined plane was half way over the Atlantic on January 28 last when the 58 - year - old commander noticed his First Officer ’s behaviour .
The plane had climbed to 36,000 feet and as the aircraft proceeded on track , the Commander became increasingly concerned with the officer ’s condition .
“ The First Officer had left the flight deck several times for short periods , and on attempting to re-enter the flight deck , standard procedure was not followed , ” the report said .
“ In conversation he remarked several times that he was very tired .
With the workload now light in the cruise , the Commander suggested that the First Officer take a controlled rest break on the flight deck .
“ The First Officer took the break as suggested on the flight deck , and was later brought some food from the galley .
“ Following the meal he continued on the controlled rest break , about one hour later the aircraft approached the mid-ocean point at 30 degrees West ( 30 W ) .
At this point the First Officer began a conversation which was rambling and disjointed in nature and not at all in character , as the Commander knew him to be an outgoing and talkative person . ”
“ Past the mid-ocean point the First Officer took another extended break after which his attempt to re-enter the flight deck was contrary to procedures .
The Commander again briefed his colleague on correct procedures .
The First Officer re-occupied his seat but did not fasten his seat belt as is normally done .
“ The First Officers behaviour then became belligerent and uncooperative which convinced the Commander he was now dealing with a crew member who was effectively incapacitated . ”
“ The Commander called the Incharge Flight Attendant 4 to the Flight deck to witness what was occurring and told him that he was now of the opinion that he was dealing with a flight crew incapacitation .
“ The First Officer was informed by the Commander that he was to secure his seat belt and become co-operative or he would have to consider him incapacitated and with the resulting repercussions .
The First Officer was unresponsive to this communication .
“ The Commander then directed the Incharge Flight Attendant to ‘ secure the First Officer away from the flight controls , then with the help of other crew members , remove him from the cockpit .
“ The crew then checked if medical assistance was available on board .
One Cabin Attendant sustained a wrist injury bringing the First Officer to his seat .
Two doctors on board attended the patient .
The Commander decided to divert the plane to Shannon .
The First Officer was taken to Ennis Regional Hospital for treatment .
He was later joined by his wife and remained under hospital care for 11 days where a gradual improvement in his condition was made .
The First Officer was an experienced pilot , with 6,581 hours flying time , the report noted .

In this issue :
Recently I published an essay arguing that two - factor authentication is an ineffective defense against identity theft .
For example , issuing tokens to online banking customers wo n’t reduce fraud , because new attack techniques simply ignore the countermeasure .
Unfortunately , some took my essay as a condemnation of two - factor authentication in general .
This is not true .
It ’s simply a matter of understanding the threats and the attacks .
Passwords just do n’t work anymore .
As computers have gotten faster , password guessing has gotten easier .
Ever-more - complicated passwords are required to evade password - guessing software .
At the same time , there ’s an upper limit to how complex a password users can be expected to remember .
About five years ago , these two lines crossed :
It is no longer reasonable to expect users to have passwords that ca n’t be guessed .
For anything that requires reasonable security , the era of passwords is over .
Two - factor authentication solves this problem .
It works against passive attacks : eavesdropping and password guessing .
It protects against users choosing weak passwords , telling their passwords to their colleagues or writing their passwords on pieces of paper taped to their monitors .
For an organization trying to improve access control for its employees , two - factor authentication is a great idea .
Microsoft is integrating two - factor authentication into its operating system , another great idea .
What two - factor authentication wo n’t do is prevent identity theft and fraud .
It ’ll prevent certain tactics of identity theft and fraud , but criminals simply will switch tactics .
We ’re already seeing fraud tactics that completely ignore two - factor authentication .
As banks roll out two - factor authentication , criminals simply will switch to these new tactics .
One way to think about this is that two - factor authentication solves security problems involving authentication .
The current wave of attacks against financial systems are not exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication system , so two - factor authentication does n’t help .
Security is always an arms race , and you could argue that this situation is simply the cost of treading water .
The problem with this reasoning is it ignores countermeasures that permanently reduce fraud .
By concentrating on authenticating the individual rather than authenticating the transaction , banks are forced to defend against criminal tactics rather than the crime itself .
Credit cards are a perfect example .
Notice how little attention is paid to cardholder authentication .
Clerks barely check signatures .
People use their cards over the phone and on the Internet , where the card ’s existence is n’t even verified .
The credit card companies spend their security dollar authenticating the transaction , not the cardholder .
Two - factor authentication is a long - overdue solution to the problem of passwords .
I welcome its increasing popularity , but identity theft and bank fraud are not results of password problems ; they stem from poorly authenticated transactions .
The sooner people realize that , the sooner they ’ll stop advocating stronger authentication measures and the sooner security will actually improve .

My original essay :
< http://www.schneier.com/essay-083.html>
Identity theft is the new crime of the information age .
A criminal collects enough personal data on someone to impersonate a victim to banks , credit card companies , and other financial institutions .
Then he racks up debt in the person ’s name , collects the cash , and disappears .
The victim is left holding the bag .
While some of the losses are absorbed by financial institutions — credit card companies in particular — the credit - rating damage is borne by the victim .
It can take years for the victim to clear his name .
Unfortunately , the solutions being proposed in Congress wo n’t help .
To see why , we need to start with the basics .
The very term “ identity theft ” is an oxymoron .
Identity is not a possession that can be acquired or lost ; it ’s not a thing at all .
Someone ’s identity is the one thing about a person that can not be stolen .
The real crime here is fraud ; more specifically , impersonation leading to fraud .
Impersonation is an ancient crime , but the rise of information - based credentials gives it a modern spin .
A criminal impersonates a victim online and steals money from his account .
He impersonates a victim in order to deceive financial institutions into granting credit to the criminal in the victim ’s name .
He impersonates a victim to the Post Office and gets the victim ’s address changed .
He impersonates a victim in order to fool the police into arresting the wrong man .
No one ’s identity is stolen ; identity information is being misused to commit fraud .
The crime involves two very separate issues .
The first is the privacy of personal data .
Personal privacy is important for many reasons , one of which is impersonation and fraud .
As more information about us is collected , correlated , and sold , it becomes easier for criminals to get their hands on the data they need to commit fraud .
This is what ’s been in the news recently : ChoicePoint , LexisNexis , Bank of America , and so on .
But data privacy is more than just fraud .
Whether it is the books we take out of the library , the websites we visit , or the contents of our text messages , most of us have personal data on third - party computers that we do n’t want made public .
The posting of Paris Hilton ’s phone book on the Internet is a celebrity example of this .
The second issue is the ease with which a criminal can use personal data to commit fraud .
It does n’t take much personal information to apply for a credit card in someone else ’s name .
It does n’t take much to submit fraudulent bank transactions in someone else ’s name .
It ’s surprisingly easy to get an identification card in someone else ’s name .
Our current culture , where identity is verified simply and sloppily , makes it easier for a criminal to impersonate his victim .
Proposed fixes tend to concentrate on the first issue — making personal data harder to steal — whereas the real problem is the second .
If we ’re ever going to manage the risks and effects of electronic impersonation , we must concentrate on preventing and detecting fraudulent transactions .
Fraudulent transactions have nothing to do with the legitimate account holders .
Criminals impersonate legitimate users to financial institutions .
That means that any solution ca n’t involve the account holders .
That leaves only one reasonable answer : financial institutions need to be liable for fraudulent transactions .
They need to be liable for sending erroneous information to credit bureaus based on fraudulent transactions .
They ca n’t claim that the user must keep his password secure or his machine virus free .
They ca n’t require the user to monitor his accounts for fraudulent activity , or his credit reports for fraudulently obtained credit cards .
Those are n’t reasonable requirements for most users .
The bank must be made responsible , regardless of what the user does .
If you think this wo n’t work , look at credit cards .
Credit card companies are liable for all but the first $ 50 of fraudulent transactions .
They ’re not hurting for business ; and they ’re not drowning in fraud , either .
They ’ve developed and fielded an array of security technologies designed to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions .
They ’ve pushed most of the actual costs onto the merchants .
And almost no security centers around trying to authenticate the cardholder .
That ’s an important lesson .
Identity theft solutions focus much too much on authenticating the person .
Whether it ’s two - factor authentication , ID cards , biometrics , or whatever , there ’s a widespread myth that authenticating the person is the way to prevent these crimes .
But once you understand that the problem is fraudulent transactions , you quickly realize that authenticating the person is n’t the way to proceed .
Again , think about credit cards .
Store clerks barely verify signatures when people use cards .
People can use credit cards to buy things by mail , phone , or Internet , where no one verifies the signature or even that you have possession of the card .
Even worse , no credit card company mandates secure storage requirements for credit cards .
They do n’t demand that cardholders secure their wallets in any particular way .
Credit card companies simply do n’t worry about verifying the cardholder or putting requirements on what he does .
They concentrate on verifying the transaction .
This same sort of thinking needs to be applied to other areas where criminals use impersonation to commit fraud .
I do n’t know what the final solutions will look like , but I do know that once financial institutions are liable for losses due to these types of fraud , they will find solutions .
Maybe there ’ll be a daily withdrawal limit , like there is on ATMs .
Maybe large transactions will be delayed for a period of time , or will require a call - back from the bank or brokerage company .
Maybe people will no longer be able to open a credit card account by simply filling out a bunch of information on a form .
Likely the solution will be a combination of solutions that reduces fraudulent transactions to a manageable level , but we ’ll never know until the financial institutions have the financial incentive to put them in place .
Right now , the economic incentives result in financial institutions that are so eager to allow transactions — new credit cards , cash transfers , whatever — that they ’re not paying enough attention to fraudulent transactions .
They ’ve pushed the costs for fraud onto the merchants .
But if they ’re liable for losses and damages to legitimate users , they ’ll pay more attention .
And they ’ll mitigate the risks .
Security can do all sorts of things , once the economic incentives to apply them are there .
By focusing on the fraudulent use of personal data , I do not mean to minimize the harm caused by third - party data and violations of privacy .
I believe that the U.S. would be well - served by a comprehensive Data Protection Act like the European Union .
However , I do not believe that a law of this type would significantly reduce the risk of fraudulent impersonation .
To mitigate that risk , we need to concentrate on detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions .
We need to make the entity that is in the best position to mitigate the risk to be responsible for that risk .
And that means making the financial institutions liable for fraudulent transactions .
Doing anything less simply wo n’t work .

It ’s the kind of attack we ’ve been talking about since the advent of biometrics .
In Malaysia , criminals cut off man ’s finger to open the biometric lock on his Mercedes car .
What interests me about this story is the interplay between attacker and defender .
The defender implements a countermeasure that causes the attacker to change his tactics .
Sometimes the new tactics are more harmful , and it ’s not obvious whether or not the countermeasure was worth it .
I wrote about something similar in Beyond Fear ( p. 113 ) : “ Someone might think : ‘ I am worried about car theft , so I will buy an expensive security device that makes ignitions impossible to hot - wire . ’
That seems like a reasonable thought , but countries such as Russia , where these security devices are commonplace , have seen an increase in carjackings .
A carjacking puts the driver at a much greater risk ; here the security countermeasure has caused the weakest link to move from the ignition switch to the driver .
Total car thefts may have declined , but drivers ’ safety did , too . ”
It ’s certainly possible to design fingerprint readers that test for “ liveness ” : pulse , body temperature , etc .
But these new security countermeasures will result in new criminal tactics , and the cycle will continue .

But there ’s a backup system , so that faculty who forget their password can reset it using their Social Security number and date of birth .
A student worked for an insurance company , and she was able to obtain SSN and DOB for two faculty members .
She used that information to reset their passwords and change grades for herself and several fellow students .
According to the news report : “ Police , university officials and campus computer specialists said Ramirez ’s alleged illegal access to the computer grading system was not the result of a deficiency or flaw in the program . ”

Last month researchers released a video of an octopus camouflaging itself with coral and shells , and then walking across the ocean floor .
I have a fondness for security countermeasures in the natural world .
As people , we try to figure out the most effective countermeasure for a given attack .
Evolution works differently .
A species tries different countermeasures at random , and stops at the first one that just barely works .
The result is that the natural world illustrates an amazing variety of security countermeasures .
< http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050321/full/…>
As the College of Cardinals prepares to elect a new pope , people like me wonder about the election process .
How does it work , and just how hard is it to hack the vote ?
Of course I ’m not advocating voter fraud in the papal election .
Nor am I insinuating that a cardinal might perpetrate fraud .
But people who work in security can’t look at a system without trying to figure out how to break it ; it ’s an occupational hazard .
The rules for papal elections are steeped in tradition , and were last codified on 22 Feb 1996 : “ Universi Dominici Gregis on the Vacancy of the Apostolic See and the Election of the Roman Pontiff . ”
The document is well - thought - out , and filled with details .
The election takes place in the Sistine Chapel , directed by the Church Chamberlain .
The ballot is entirely paper - based , and all ballot counting is done by hand .
Votes are secret , but everything else is done in public .
First there ’s the “ pre-scrutiny ” phase .
“ At least two or three ” paper ballots are given to each cardinal ( 115 will be voting ) , presumably so that a cardinal has extras in case he makes a mistake .
Then nine election officials are randomly selected : three “ Scrutineers ” who count the votes , three “ Revisers , ” who verify the results of the Scrutineers , and three “ Infirmarii ” who collect the votes from those too sick to be in the room .
( These officials are chosen randomly for each ballot . )
Each cardinal writes his selection for Pope on a rectangular ballot paper “ as far as possible in handwriting that cannot be identified as his . ”
He then folds the paper lengthwise and holds it aloft for everyone to see .
When everyone is done voting , the “ scrutiny ” phase of the election begins .
The cardinals proceed to the altar one by one .
On the altar is a large chalice with a paten ( the shallow metal plate used to hold communion wafers during mass ) resting on top of it .
Each cardinal places his folded ballot on the paten .
Then he picks up the paten and slides his ballot into the chalice .
If a cardinal cannot walk to the altar , one of the Scrutineers — in full view of everyone — does this for him .
If any cardinals are too sick to be in the chapel , the Scrutineers give the Infirmarii a locked empty box with a slot , and the three Infirmarii together collect those votes .
( If a cardinal is too sick to write , he asks one of the Infirmarii to do it for him )
The box is opened and the ballots are placed onto the paten and into the chalice , one at a time .
When all the ballots are in the chalice , the first Scrutineer shakes it several times in order to mix them .
Then the third Scrutineer transfers the ballots , one by one , from one chalice to another , counting them in the process .
If the total number of ballots is not correct , the ballots are burned and everyone votes again .
To count the votes , each ballot is opened and the vote is read by each Scrutineer in turn , the third one aloud .
Each Scrutineer writes the vote on a tally sheet .
This is all done in full view of the cardinals .
The total number of votes cast for each person is written on a separate sheet of paper .
Then there ’s the “ post - scrutiny ” phase .
The Scrutineers tally the votes and determine if there ’s a winner .
Then the Revisers verify the entire process : ballots , tallies , everything .
And then the ballots are burned .
( That ’s where the smoke comes from : white if a Pope has been elected , black if not . )
How hard is this to hack ?
The first observation is that the system is entirely manual , making it immune to the sorts of technological attacks that make modern voting systems so risky .
The second observation is that the small group of voters — all of whom know each other — makes it impossible for an outsider to affect the voting in any way .
The chapel is cleared and locked before voting .
No one is going to dress up as a cardinal and sneak into the Sistine Chapel .
In effect , the voter verification process is about as perfect as you ’re ever going to find .
Eavesdropping on the process is certainly possible , although the rules explicitly state that the chapel is to be checked for recording and transmission devices “ with the help of trustworthy individuals of proven technical ability . ”
I read that the Vatican is worried about laser microphones , as there are windows near the chapel ’s roof .
That leaves us with insider attacks .
Can a cardinal influence the election ?
Certainly the Scrutineers could potentially modify votes , but it ’s difficult .
The counting is conducted in public , and there are multiple people checking every step .
It ’s possible for the first Scrutineer , if he ’s good at sleight of hand , to swap one ballot paper for another before recording it .
Or for the third Scrutineer to swap ballots during the counting process .
A cardinal ca n’t stuff ballots when he votes .
The complicated paten - and - chalice ritual ensures that each cardinal votes once — his ballot is visible — and also keeps his hand out of the chalice holding the other votes .
Making the ballots large would make these attacks harder .
So would controlling the blank ballots better , and only distributing one to each cardinal per vote .
Presumably cardinals change their mind more often during the voting process , so distributing extra blank ballots makes sense .
Ballots from previous votes are burned , which makes it harder to use one to stuff the ballot box .
But there ’s one wrinkle : “ If however a second vote is to take place immediately , the ballots from the first vote will be burned only at the end , together with those from the second vote . ”
I assume that ’s done so there ’s only one plume of smoke for the two elections , but it would be more secure to burn each set of ballots before the next round of voting .
( Although the stack of ballots are pierced with a needle and thread and tied together , which 1 ) marks them as used , and 2 ) makes them harder to reuse . )
And lastly , the cardinals are in “ choir dress ” during the voting , which has translucent lace sleeves under a short red cape ; much harder for sleight - of - hand tricks .
It ’s possible for one Scrutineer to misrecord the votes , but with three Scrutineers , the discrepancy would be quickly detected .
I presume a recount would take place , and the correct tally would be verified .
Two or three Scrutineers in cahoots with each other could do more mischief , but since the Scrutineers are chosen randomly , the probability of a cabal being selected is very low .
And then the Revisers check everything .
More interesting is to try and attack the system of selecting Scrutineers , which is n’t well - defined in the document .
Influencing the selection of Scrutineers and Revisers seems a necessary first step towards influencing the election .
Ballots with more than one name ( overvotes ) are void , and I assume the same is true for ballots with no name written on them ( undervotes ) .
Illegible or ambiguous ballots are much more likely , and I presume they are discarded .
The rules do have a provision for multiple ballots by the same cardinal : “ If during the opening of the ballots the Scrutineers should discover two ballots folded in such a way that they appear to have been completed by one elector , if these ballots bear the same name they are counted as one vote ; if however they bear two different names , neither vote will be valid ; however , in neither of the two cases is the voting session annulled . ”
This surprises me , although I suppose it has happened by accident .
If there ’s a weak step , it ’s the counting of the ballots .
There ’s no real reason to do a pre-count , and it gives the Scrutineer doing the transfer a chance to swap legitimate ballots with others he previously stuffed up his sleeve .
I like the idea of randomizing the ballots , but putting the ballots in a wire cage and spinning it around would accomplish the same thing more securely , albeit with less reverence .
And if I were improving the process , I would add some kind of white - glove treatment to prevent a Scrutineer from hiding a pencil lead or pen tip under his fingernails .
Although the requirement to write out the candidate ’s name in full gives more resistance against this sort of attack .
The recent change in the process that lets the cardinals go back and forth from the chapel into their dorm rooms — instead of being locked in the chapel the whole time as was done previously — makes the process slightly less secure .
But I ’m sure it makes it a lot more comfortable .
Lastly , there ’s the potential for one of the Infirmarii to do what he wants when transcribing the vote of an infirm cardinal , but there ’s no way to prevent that .
If the cardinal is concerned , he could ask all three Infirmarii to witness the ballot .
There ’s also enormous social — religious , actually — disincentives to hacking the vote .
The election takes place in a chapel , and at an altar .
They also swear an oath as they are casting their ballot — further discouragement .
And the Scrutineers are explicitly exhorted not to form any sort of cabal or make any plans to sway the election under pain of excommunication : “ The Cardinal electors shall further abstain from any form of pact , agreement , promise or other commitment of any kind which could oblige them to give or deny their vote to a person or persons . ”
I ’m sure there are negotiations and deals and influencing — cardinals are mortal men , after all , and such things are part of how humans come to agreement .
What are the lessons here ?
First , open systems conducted within a known group make voting fraud much harder .
Every step of the election process is observed by everyone , and everyone knows everyone , which makes it harder for someone to get away with anything .
Second , small and simple elections are easier to secure .
This kind of process works to elect a Pope or a club president , but quickly becomes unwieldy for a large - scale election .
The only way manual systems work is through a pyramid - like scheme , with small groups reporting their manually obtained results up the chain to more central tabulating authorities .
And a third and final lesson : when an election process is left to develop over the course of a couple thousand years , you end up with something surprisingly good .

Report # 1 : There ’s a report from the Department of Homeland Security ’s Inspector General that the TSA lied about its role in obtaining personal information about 12 million airline passengers to test Secure Flight .
The report does n’t explicitly say that the TSA lied , but the TSA lied .
The details are worth reading .
And when you read it , keep in mind that it ’s written by the DHS ’s own Inspector General .
I presume a more independent investigator would be even more severe .
Not that the report is n’t severe , mind you .
Here are some highlights from an AP story :
“ The report cites several occasions where TSA officials made inaccurate statements about passenger data :
“ In September 2003 , the agency ’s Freedom of Information Act staff received hundreds of requests from Jet Blue passengers asking if the TSA had their records .
After a cursory search , the FOIA staff posted a notice on the TSA Web site that it had no JetBlue passenger data .
Though the FOIA staff found JetBlue passenger records in TSA ’s possession in May , the notice stayed on the Web site for more than a year .
“ In November 2003 , TSA chief James Loy incorrectly told the Governmental Affairs Committee that certain kinds of passenger data were not being used to test passenger prescreening .
“ In September 2003 , a technology magazine reporter asked a TSA spokesman whether real data were used to test the passenger prescreening system .
The spokesman said only fake data were used ; the responses “ were not accurate , ” the report said . ”
There ’s much more .
The report reveals that TSA ordered Delta Air Lines to turn over passenger data in February 2002 to help the Secret Service determine whether terrorists or their associates were traveling in the vicinity of the Salt Lake City Olympics .
It also reveals that TSA used passenger data from JetBlue in the spring of 2003 to figure out how to change the number of people who would be selected for more screening under the existing system .
The report says that one of the TSA ’s contractors working on passenger prescreening , Lockheed Martin , used a data sample from ChoicePoint .
The report also details how outside contractors used the data for their own purposes .
And that “ the agency neglected to inquire whether airline passenger data used by the vendors had been returned or destroyed . ”
And that “ TSA did not consistently apply privacy protections in the course of its involvement in airline passenger data transfers . ”
This is major stuff .
It shows that the TSA lied to the public about its use of personal data again and again and again .
Report # 2 : The GAO ( Government Accountability Office ) issued its own report about Secure Flight .
Last year , Congress passed a law that said that the TSA could n’t implement Secure Flight until it met ten conditions : privacy protections , accuracy of data , oversight , cost and safeguards to ensure the system wo n’t be abused or accessed by unauthorized people , etc .
The GAO report found nine of the ten conditions had n’t yet been met and questioned whether Secure Flight would ultimately work .
Some tidbits : TSA plans to include the capability for criminal checks within Secure Flight ( p. 12 ) .
The timetable has slipped by four months ( p. 17 ) .
TSA might not be able to get personally identifiable passenger data in PNRs because of costs to the industry and lack of money ( p.18 ) .
TSA plans to have intelligence analysts staffed within TSA to identify false positives ( p.33 ) .
The DHS Investment Review Board has withheld approval from the “ Transportation Vetting Platform ” ( p.39 ) .
TSA does n’t know how much the program will cost ( p.51 ) .
Final privacy rule to be issued in April ( p. 56 ) .
These two reports put the TSA in a bind .
It is prohibited by Congress from fielding Secure Flight until it meets a series of criteria .
On the other hand , I ’m not sure the TSA cares .
It ’s already announced plans to roll out Secure Flight .
In August they ’re going to implement the program nationwide with two still - unnamed airlines .
My own opinions of Secure Flight are well - known .
I am a member of a working group to help evaluate the privacy of Secure Flight .
While I believe that a program to match airline passengers against terrorist watch lists is a colossal waste of money that is n’t going to make us any safer , I said “ … assuming that we need to implement a program of matching airline passengers with names on terrorism watch lists , Secure Flight is a major improvement — in almost every way — over what is currently in place . ”
I still believe that , but unfortunately I am prohibited by NDA from describing the improvements .
I wish someone at TSA would get himself in front of reporters and do so .

From : Jonathan Tuliani < Jonathan.Tuliani cryptomathic.com >
Subject : The Failure of Two - Factor Authentication
I agree completely with your analysis that two - factor * user * authentication will not solve the problem of phishing attacks .
Indeed , the situation is worse than you describe : the attacker does not need to resort to technically - advanced man - in - the - middle or virus / Trojan attacks ; they simply need to ask the victim for a one - time password from their authentication token via a conventional spoof website , and to use it before it expires .
In the case of counter - based rather than time - based schemes in particular , the time window available may be quite large .
The only solution to this problem is to migrate banking applications to explicit transaction authentication rather than user authentication .
For example , a token with a calculator - style keyboard can prompt the user to enter the payee account number and amount to be paid directly into the token itself , and produce a one - time password that acts as a kind of MAC of these details .
The problem is that transaction authentication is less user - friendly and the authentication tokens required tend to be larger and more costly .
Nevertheless , such schemes are under consideration , most notably within the MasterCard Chip Authentication Program , which allows consumers to use their normal banking chip - card ( more common in Europe than the US ) together with a self - contained card reader to provide two - factor authentication for both user and transaction authentication .
SMS offers not only a separate channel to the consumer , but also an independent user interface to the PC screen which is invulnerable to both Trojan and man - in - the - middle attacks .
SMS one time passwords can therefore be used not only for user authentication , but also for transaction authentication , using messages such as “ Pay $ 100 to account 12345 ?
Confirm Code : AGEWN ”
All this was described in my article ‘ The Future of Phishing , ’ published nearly a full year ago and still available , e.g. , at < http://www.net-security.org/article.php?id=672>
From : Ernst Jan Plugge < rmc dds.nl >
Subject : The Failure of Two - Factor Authentication
I just read your interesting piece on two - factor authentication .
You describe a system where a bank sends an SMS message for authentication , and the weakness inherent in it .
My bank does something similar , but sidesteps some of these issues rather elegantly .
Authentication to the web application for my bank is done using just a password .
I can prepare a batch of transactions within the application , without any further authentication .
However , to confirm the batch , I have to provide a TAN , a transaction number .
This is delivered by SMS to my mobile at the moment I initiate the final phase of the process , and the message includes a statement of the total amount of the transactions in the batch , and an ordinal TAN index , which bumps by one for each batch .
I type in the number , and the batch is processed .
SMS is , by the way , just one of the delivery mechanisms supported by the bank .
You can also get a list of TANs printed on paper sent by snail mail .
The options are mutually exclusive .
Someone who steals both my password and my mobile can , of course , rip me off .
But a Trojan will have a much more difficult time of it .
First of all , merely eavesdropping and replaying will not work , because the TAN is only valid for one transaction .
A man - in - the - middle will have to monitor and divert my work in the application in real time , and substitute his own fraudulent details .
The MitM will have to submit his batch for processing at almost the same time as me , and the amounts have to match exactly .
So even if the MitM succeeds , the damage is quite limited .
This scheme still has its weaknesses , but it ’s sufficiently secure for me to trust my personal online banking affairs to it .

The CHADSEA method , which stands for CHAotic Digital Signature , Encryption and Authentication , is a symmetric encryption method generating block ciphers .
The chaos generator is based on the chaos function of the Logistic Equation , which is implemented in its recursive form and within a certain range of bifurcation factors well known to produce chaotic number series .

The recursive application of the logistic equation produces very quickly very high non-linear functions of arbitrary and unknown polynomial order .
Together with the so called self - similar nature of the logistic equation , which produces functional values absolutely chaotically within a well - limited solution interval , but containing an infinite number of solutions , it is by its mathematical nature impossible to reconstruct a starting value from a functional value , especially when not knowing the number of iterations nor the exact bifurcation factor used .
CHADSEA implements this chaotic behavior so that it is a perfect pseudo - random number generator in the sense of a cryptographic strong pseudorandom bit generator forming poly - random collections , a perfect one - way ( hash ) function , and a perfect document signature algorithm .
Several statistical tests have been performed in order to validate that the CHADSEA method cannot be broken by statistical means .
These tests are quite comprehensive and are described in detail in the following papers : the Signal - Noise Tests < http://www.xavety.com/Validation_SN_Test.htm>, the ENT Test Suite < http://www.xavety.com/Validation_ENT_Test.htm>, and the NIST Statistical Test Suite , < http://www.xavety.com/Validation_NIST_Test.htm>.
The CHADSEA method passes all these tests , especially also all of the 189 statistical tests of the National Institute of Standard and Technology ( NIST ) .

The election has n't even been lost yet .
But as John McCain slides towards likely defeat , the sniping between Republican factions has degenerated into something close to outright civil war – one that presages a wrenching struggle for the future of the party .
In the past few days , the feuding has reached to the very top of the campaign , with the McCain camp accusing Sarah Palin , his own vice - presidential running mate , of acting like a " rogue " candidate , going her own way and defying the instructions of her boss 's top advisers .
" She 's a diva , " one unidentified McCain aide told CNN .
" She takes no advice from anyone ... she does not have any relationships of trust with any of us , her family or anyone else . "
Mutual recrimination is the norm in a losing presidential campaign , as aides position themselves for the blame game after defeat .
A week before the election , the McCain campaign seems headed in that direction , trailing Barack Obama by between 7 and 10 points in most national polls , and behind in the major swing states that will decide the outcome on 4 November .
But the backbiting this time is of rare ferocity .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" How did we get into this mess ? "
Newt Gingrich , former House speaker and a driving force behind the Republican dominance for most of the past 20 years , says of the disarray .
" It 's not where we should be and it 's not where we had to be .
This was not bad luck . "
For the second time this month , Bill Kristol , a leading voice on the party 's conservative wing , used his column in The New York Times yesterday to urge the struggling candidate to throw his advisers to the winds .
" He might as well muzzle the campaign , " Mr Kristol wrote .
Senior McCain staffers were now " spending more time criticising one another than Obama , and more time defending their own reputations than pursuing a McCain - Palin victory . "
As Mr Kristol would be the first to admit , 2008 was never going to be easy for Republicans .
To win , Mr McCain had to unite and energise the party and , in effect , run against the Republican President of the past eight years , more unpopular over an extended period than any US leader in half a century .
In some ways , the Republican predicament mirrors that of the Tories at the 1997 election – in power for too long and exhausted of ideas .
Complicating matters have been Mr McCain 's fragile relations with the social conservative Republican base , with which he has clashed frequently in the past .
Another problem has been his age .
At 72 , he would be the oldest incoming president in history ( a factor that weighs more heavily with voters , pollsters have found , than Mr Obama 's skin colour ) .
If he loses , Mr McCain will never run for the White House again .
The leadership of the party is up for grabs – not a situation that lends itself to harmony .
Finally , he has been unable to find a consistent message .
One moment , strategists complain , he has presented himself as hero and patriot with experience , unlike his untested " celebrity " opponent .
Then he metamorphosed into an agent of radical change , in improbable contrast to " insider " Obama .
Next , the man who made a virtue of playing clean politics waded in , low and dirty , against the Illinois senator .
Finally , it was a ticket of " two mavericks " to overturn Washington politics .
Unfortunately the mavericks – or their teams – are criticising not so much Mr Obama as each other .
The lightning rod is Ms Palin .
As initial excitement at her nomination subsided , party elders began to criticise the choice .
The Alaska governor was too inexperienced , they complained , her conservative views would alienate independents .
As the debacle of her interview with Katie Couric proved , Mr McCain had blundered in picking her .
To which the Palin camp responds that the McCain team made a mess of her " roll - out " and had not " let Sarah be Sarah . "
Now she is increasingly speaking out for herself .
Hence the whispers that she is a " rogue " candidate .
But the dispute also reflects a struggle for the future .
Ms Palin is an emblem of the social conservatives , of how that base can be mobilised to win elections , as George Bush did in 2004 .
" She is playing for her own future , " the unnamed McCain aide added , " she sees herself as the next leader of the party . "
At his most effective , Mr McCain has taken the opposite tack , as a unifier who appeals across party lines .
The battle lines have been drawn .

But how big is it really ?
Turkmenistan is in the news this week after confirming that its South Yolotan - Osman natural - gas field is among the five biggest in the world .
That assertion is based on a survey done by an independent British firm .
Such estimates are of vital importance to energy - rich countries , as they cannot plan their national strategies without some idea of what resources they have .
So how do surveyors determine how much wealth lies under their feet ?
And just how accurate are these estimations anyway ?
Knowing you have crude oil or natural gas on your territory is one thing , calculating how big your reserves are is quite another .
Suppose that your geologists have used seismic imaging to pinpoint the likelihood of oil .
That 's a technique in which sound waves are fired into the ground , and the reflected waves allow the geologists to build a picture of the rock types underground .
Oil will usually be found trapped in porous rock formations covered by impenetrable rocks .
So your seismic imaging has indicated promising geological conditions , and you drill an exploratory well .
That produces oil , and you think you might have a real bonanza .
Manochehr Takin , an analyst with the Center for Global Energy Studies in London , cautions that this is where things start to get complicated .
" It is important to know what is the size of the oil and gas deposit you have discovered , because when you drill a well into the subsurface and find oil , it 's as though you have this huge mass of [ material , like a haystack , ] and you have one needle , one long needle which goes down and gives you some information , but how do you know the size of this haystack ? "
Takin says .
Governments can unwittingly or knowingly exaggerate the extent of their resources .
The bigger the resources , the more clout the nation has in the world , and the greater the chance of attracting investment .
The experts , according to Takin , have learned to interpret signs .
For instance , how thick is the rock layer where the oil or gas was found ?
What is the pressure of the rising oil , at the bottom of the drill shaft , compared with at the top of the shaft ?
Does the flow decrease in the hours and days following the strike ?
" All these things have to be interpreted , and then you can come up with estimates , and in the end you still only have one well , so other wells have to be drilled , so it is a complicated process , and one can be a long way off [ in terms of accuracy ] , " Takin says .
" Sometimes the second and third wells do not show anything , although the first well has been promising , so you do n't know the real extent of the oil and gas you have found . "
Proven Reserves
The classic way to estimate the size of an oil or gas field is to create a circle of drills around the first well , and move these drills ever outwards into larger circles , until the extent of the field is gauged .
But accurately estimating the volume of the reservoir remains difficult .
The resources are not lying neatly underground in a " lake , " with defined boundaries , but instead follow the haphazard distribution of the rock formations .
The investment bank Simmonds and Company explains it this way : " Despite an oil - field technology revolution , estimating reserves is still akin to actuarial estimates of [ the ] remaining years in a human life -- a scientific guess . "
In any event , in oilman 's language the term " proven reserves " has a somewhat elastic meaning .
Under the scale known as OOIP -- original oil in place -- proven reserves are those estimates with a 90 percent probability of being correct .
And this category only applies to oil fields that are already producing .
The next category below that are estimates with an 80 percent probability of being correct , in cases where the field is known but not yet developed .
And so on , downward , to the high - risk estimates that give only a 20 percent probability of being correct .
And difficulties of geology apart , politics can enter into the equation , too .
Governments can unwittingly or knowingly exaggerate the extent of their resources .
The bigger the resources , the more clout the nation has in the world , and the greater the chance of attracting investment .
Take Mexico as an example .
" For many years its reserves were reported as being 50 to 60 billion barrels , and then they had auditors and others from outside , and they reduced that to 20 to 30 billion , " Takin says .
" And then , in order to attract investment they had to go to an even more restricted and definitive evaluation of reserves , [ namely the standard ] according to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission . "
The result was that Mexico 's reserves were in the end estimated at below 20 billion barrels -- only one - third of the Mexican government 's original evaluation .
' Bad ' Estimates
Another case where estimating appears to have gone badly wrong for some reason is at Ghawar , the world 's largest oil field in Saudi Arabia .
In 1975 , international oil majors Exxon , Mobile , Chevron , and Texaco estimated that the 60 - year - old field at most still had some 60 billion barrels to recover .
But almost 30 years later , after producing millions of barrels every day , Ghawar was estimated by the Saudi ARAMCO company as still containing 125 billion barrels .
Who is right ?
It 's not that the oil giants do n't make mistakes .
Royal Dutch - Shell caused a stir in business circles in 2004 by reducing estimates of its proven oil reserves by a total of 20 percent , or nearly 4 billion barrels .
After the Shell revelation , many industry analysts questioned whether the overestimation of reserves is common among corporations and governments .
This , of course , would mean that the world has less oil and natural gas than most people think .

The Pakistani Government yesterday denied involvement in the terror plot and has promised to help in the investigation .
However , Asif Ali Zardari , the President , pledged yesterday that he would act swiftly if given any evidence of involvement by Pakistani nationals .
" As president of Pakistan , if any evidence comes of any individual or group in any part of my country , I shall take the swiftest of action in the light of evidence and in front of the world , " he said .
ATTLEBORO , Mass . ( AP )  A 74 - year - old blind woman was shocked when her daughter found a letter from the city saying a lien would be placed on her home unless she paid an overdue water bill .
The amount ?
1 cent .
Eileen Wilbur told The Sun Chronicle of Attleboro the letter sent her blood pressure soaring , and pointed out that stamps cost 42 cents .
City Collector Debora Marcoccio said the letter was among 2,000 sent out .
A computer automatically prints letters for accounts with an overdue balance , and they are not reviewed by staff before being mailed , she said .
ON DEADLINE : City collector says " fiscally irresponsible " to go through all bills
The letter warned of a lien and a $ 48 penalty if the overdue bill is not paid by Dec. 10 .
The charge was from the previous fiscal year , which ran from July 2007 to July 2008 .
" My question is , how come it was n't paid when the ( original ) bills went out ? "
Marcoccio said .
Wilbur 's daughter , Rose Brederson , who discovered the bill in her mother 's mail , called the situation " ridiculous . "
But she said her mother , who has lived in the home since 1959 , would likely end up paying the penny .

( Seriously , though .
Stamp out that butt and flush the pack , already . )
Tobacco use , namely cigarette smoking , is the chief cause of preventable death in the United States .
Left unbridled , smoking could kill more than a billion people this century , according to the World Health Organization .
That equals the number who would die if a Titanic sank every 24 minutes for the next 100 years , as former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop so starkly put it at a March press conference .
Still , it may be harder than ever to quit :
Three quarters of today 's smokers trying to shed the habit are heavily hooked on nicotine , up 32 percent from almost two decades ago , according to research presented at the American College of Chest Physicians ' annual meeting in October .
So quitting , for most , is not merely a matter of willpower .
Nonetheless , the reasons to do so keep amassing — and they 're not all about heart disease , lung cancer , or respiratory problems .
Here 's a few downsides you might not have considered .
1 . It fogs the mind .
Smoking may cloud the mind , according to accumulating research .
A June study in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that smoking in middle age is linked to memory problems and to a slide in reasoning abilities , though these risks appeared lessened for those who'd long quit ; this is important , the authors wrote , because other research has shown that people with mild cognitive impairment in midlife develop dementia at an accelerated rate .
Their report piggybacks on several focused on the older set : A 2007 analysis of 19 prior studies concluded that elderly smokers face a heightened risk of dementia and cognitive decline , compared with lifelong nonsmokers .
And in 2004 , researchers reported in Neurology that smoking appeared to hasten cognitive decline in dementia - free elderly smokers , bringing it on several times faster than in their nonsmoking peers .
2 . It may bring on diabetes .
As if we need any more risk factors for diabetes , an analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last year found that across 25 prior studies , current smokers have a 44 percent greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes than nonsmokers do , and the risk was strongest for those with the heaviest habit , who clocked 20 or more cigarettes per day .
In an accompanying editorial , researchers made a striking estimation :
That some 12 percent of all type 2 diabetes cases nationwide might be attributable to smoking .
3 . It invites infections .
In October , the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made its first ever recommendation that all smokers ages 19 to 64 be added to a short list of candidates for the pneumococcal vaccine .
That 's because there are very strong data showing that the risk of infection by pneumonia - causing bacteria is substantially greater for smokers than for nonsmokers , says Pekka Nuorti , a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Exactly why is unclear , though there 's evidence that smoking may damage the respiratory system 's protective mucous membranes , making it easier for infectious organisms to latch on and cause disease , says Nuorti .
Other research suggests that smoking may interfere with immunity , compromising people 's ability to fight infections , he adds .
Heightened susceptibility to infections , it appears , is n't limited just to those who do the smoking : A May study in Tobacco Control found that children exposed to secondhand smoke at home during early infancy ( especially those born prematurely or with a low birth weight ) are more prone to a throng of severe illnesses that may land them in the hospital at some point during childhood .
The findings were based on an analysis of more than 7,000 Chinese children from 1997 to 2005 .
4 . It may stultify a sex life .
If men want to hop aboard the Viagra bandwagon , mounting evidence suggests that puffing cigarettes might be just their ticket .
Smokers are more apt to experience erectile dysfunction than nonsmokers are , and this risk climbs as the number of cigarettes smoked increases .
A study in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 2007 tracked more than 7,500 Chinese men with low risk for artherosclerosis , a chief underlying cause of erectile dysfunction , and found that smoking could independently hike a man 's chance of wrangling with the sexual condition .
Preventing smoking is an " important approach " for cutting the risk of ED , the researchers concluded .
5 . It may lead to wrinkles ... everywhere .
Not only does smoking contribute to premature facial wrinkles , but a 2007 study in the Archives of Dermatology found that it may also lead to wrinkling of skin that rarely sees the light of day — in areas such as the inner arm and perhaps the buttocks .
6 . It may hasten menopause .
Women who smoke face an increased risk of infertility , and they may experience natural menopause at a younger age than do nonsmokers , according to the 2004 and the 2001 Surgeon General 's Reports , respectively .
Further evidence : A 2001 animal study in Nature Genetics found that chemicals in cigarette smoke can hurry menopause by killing off egg cells made by ovaries , thereby dwindling the egg cell reserve .
Since the timing of menopause is dictated by the size of a woman 's egg cell reserve — which is stocked with about a million eggs at birth and vanishes by menopause — anything that speeds up its loss could logically lead to a much earlier onset of fertility troubles , notes Jonathan Tilly , one of the study 's authors and director of the Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital .
More worrisome : Women who smoke during pregnancy may be compromising not only their own future fertility but the fertility of their unborn daughters .
In studies testing that idea , mice exposed to chemicals in cigarette smoke during gestation were born with shrunken egg reserves .
" Even under the best - chance scenario — you 're a nonsmoker , you 're healthy , you 're young , you eat well , you 're in shape — human fertility is n't 100 percent , " says Tilly .
" Anything you can do to make it better is certainly worth your while . "
7 . It may dull vision .
Several studies have found a robust link between smoking and eye disease , specifically age - related macular degeneration , which can permanently blur vision or cause blindness .
A 2005 review of 17 studies in the journal Eye reported that active smokers may face two to three times the risk for developing the disease experienced by those who have never smoked .
8 . It hurts bones .
Smoking weakens the body 's scaffolding and is a serious risk factor for osteoporosis , according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases .
It 's been shown to fritter away bone density in postmenopausal women and to hike the risk of hip fractures in both sexes , according to the 2004 Surgeon General 's Report .
( People who endure hip fractures are 12 to 20 percent more likely to die than those who do n't , the Report notes , though there are ways osteoporosis sufferers can protect themselves . )
Smokers may also experience slower healing of broken bones and wounded tissues than do nonsmokers .
9 . It may injure the insides .
Sure , cigarettes may be smooth to inhale , but they can rough up the digestive system , leading to heartburn , peptic ulcers , and possibly gallstones , according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases .
What 's more , current and former smokers have an elevated risk of developing Crohn 's disease , a condition characterized by inflammation in the digestive tract and causing pain and diarrhea , says NIDDK .
10 .
It may stifle sleep .
Feeling groggy despite a night 's slumber might be a problem for those who light up : A February study in Chest found that smokers are four times more likely to get nonrestorative sleep than those who do n't smoke , and researchers deemed nicotine the likely culprit .
They theorized that its stimulant properties deal smokers a double blow , making it difficult to fall asleep and also potentially sending the body into nicotine withdrawal during the night .
( Half of the chemical 's effect wears off within two hours . )
Since inadequate shut - eye can invite health problems , consider forgoing cigarettes for the sake of your sleep .
11 . It shaves years — and quality — off life .
Men who have never smoked live on average 10 years longer than their peers who smoke heavily , according to an October report in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
Moreover , they enjoyed a higher quality of life throughout those extra years , throwing sand in the face of the old smokers ' defense that an early death is a small price to pay for a lifetime of pleasure .
The study 's Finnish authors drew their conclusion after scrutinizing data on more than 1,600 men tracked for nearly 30 years .
12 . It 's tied to lots of cancers !
Not to belabor the point , but tobacco use and smoking have been linked to much more than lung cancer .
In September , the CDC released a report estimating that more than 2 million cases of tobacco - related cancers were diagnosed nationwide between 1999 and 2004 .
Lung and bronchial cancer topped the list , naturally , but other types included stomach , pancreatic , kidney , urinary bladder , and cervical cancer .
" We knew this was a big problem and a preventable problem , " says Sherri Stewart , the epidemiologist at CDC who led the research .
" But when you present the hard numbers , you start to see the profoundness of the problem . "
Her message :
To protect your health , do everything you can to quit .
Dear Straight Dope :
Why does my computer keyboard have this " Scroll Lock " key that seems to serve no purpose whatsoever ?
In 15 years I do n't remember ever pushing that button .
I 'm almost scared to touch it Insanegrey , Lawrence , KS
Una Persson replies :
Although your mother told you that there are many things to avoid touching ( like downed electric lines , scorpions , and the " naughty place " ) , do n’t be afraid to touch the Scroll Lock key .
Nothing bad will happen – in fact , probably nothing at all will happen .
Once upon a time , however , something did .
The Scroll Lock key has appeared on the keyboards of IBM personal computers since the original 83 - key PC / XT and the 84 - key AT layouts , and remains on the 101 - key and greater " enhanced " keyboards currently in use .
The Scroll Lock key was n’t on the original Macintosh keyboards but appears on the Mac ’s " enhanced " keyboard .
The main intent of the Scroll Lock key was to allow scrolling of screen text up , down and presumably sideways using the arrow keys in the days before large displays and graphical scroll bars .
You can see where this might have been handy in the DOS era , when screen output typically was limited to 80 characters wide by 25 rows deep .
For some types of programs , spreadsheets being the obvious example , it ’s still handy now .
In Microsoft Excel , Scroll Lock allows you to scroll a spreadsheet with the arrow keys without moving the active cell pointer from the currently highlighted cell .
In Quattro Pro , another spreadsheet program , Scroll Lock works in a similar manner , although in contrast to Excel it ’s not possible to scroll the active cell pointer completely off the screen .
Other programs use Scroll Lock for special functions .
It ’s said ( although I have n’t personally verified this ) that the Linux operating system as well as some early mainframe and minicomputer terminals employed Scroll Lock to stop text from scrolling on your screen in command - line sessions – pausing the scrolling , in effect .
The ancient DOS adventure game “ Rogue ” ( one of my all - time favorites ) used Scroll Lock to scroll your character ’s movement through the ASCII dungeons on the display .
I ’m told some computers in the late 1980s used the Scroll Lock key to halt the scrolling of the boot - up messages that appeared when you started the computer .
This last use may be apocryphal , as I could find no examples of computers that displayed this behavior .
The point is , Scroll Lock sometimes does something besides make that little light light up .
Other odd keys worthy of note on your keyboard include the SysRq key ( sometimes appearing as SysReq ) , which shares the same key as the “ Print Screen ” key .
( Historical sidelight – SysRq was the “ 84th key ” added when the 83 - key PC / XT keyboard became the 84 - key AT keyboard . )
Unless programmed by a particular application , the SysRq key does nothing in most operating systems , including DOS , Windows , and OS / 2 .
The SysRq key has different " hooks " into the system BIOS ( basic input / output system , the interface between the software and the low - level functions of the computer ) from the other keys on the keyboard .
IBM evidently included this key to facilitate task switching in future operating systems – that is , to allow either switching from one task to another ( as on a mainframe computer ) , or interrupting all tasks and returning control to the keyboard .
Advanced MS - DOS
Programming , second edition , Microsoft Press , states :
A multitasking program manager would be expected to capture INT 15 H so that it can be notified when the user strikes the SysReq key .
In layman ’s terms that means , " You can make a multitasking program manager monitor a specific location in your computer ’s hardware so it can do something cool , such as letting the user switch tasks , when the SysReq key is pressed . "
As it turned out , the developers of Windows did n’t use SysReq when implementing task switching .
Some new keyboards no longer feature this key , and its days seem numbered .
The Pause / Break key was used in the DOS command line environment to pause scrolling of text on the screen , which could , depending on the program and its method of text output to the screen , have the effect of pausing program execution .
I have several old DOS power plant analysis programs that run under OS / 2 , Windows NT , and Windows XP , and I can attest that the Pause key effectively pauses execution of all of these programs by halting display of their screen output .
Other programs may be unaffected by the Pause key , though , depending on how they are written and whether or not they output text to the screen .
The Break key , when combined with the Ctrl key , is used to terminate DOS applications – and still does today , even in the DOS window of Windows XP .
Some DOS communication programs used the Break key as a shortcut to terminate a modem connection , but that was really a function of the program , not the operating system .
The < ` > key is called many names .
According to the " Hacker ’s Jargon FAQ , " these include :
backquote , left quote , left single quote , open quote , ( grave accent ) , grave .
Rare : backprime , [ backspark ] , unapostrophe , birk , blugle , back tick , back glitch , push , ( opening single quotation mark ) , quasiquote .
That ’s nice , but what is the symbol used for ?
It has no operating system function in DOS or Windows ( although it does find use in the UNIX operating system ) , and in most type fonts does n’t match the appearance of an ordinary single quote ( apostrophe ) , so it ca n’t really be used as an open quote mark .
However , programmers , being loath to let extraneous keys sit unused on a keyboard , have found use for it as an operator in the LISP and Python programming languages .
The pipe key < | > , also known as the bar key or vertical bar , is found above the backslash key <>.
It sees frequent use in C , C++ , C# and other programming languages where it serves as the " OR " symbol .
A single pipe indicates " bitwise OR , " and two pipes together ( || ) signify " logical OR . "
For example :
C = ( A | B )
means " apply bit operations to A and B and put the result in C . "
That is , if A is 0000 0110 , and B is 1111 0000 , then the result is :
A 0000 0110
B 1111 0000
— — — —
–
C 1111 0110
which is bit - level arithmetic .
If you ’re not a programmer , do n’t worry about it .
The use of double pipes , such as :
if ( A > 0 || B >0 )
is a logical statement that means , " If variable A is greater than 0 , or variable B is greater than 0 , then do something . "
In command - line environments such as DOS , the pipe symbol can add functionality to a DOS command .
The way I most frequently use it is when doing a directory listing ( DIR ) on a large directory with hundreds of files .
Say I type “ DIR ” at the command prompt like so :
C:UnaLesbian Porn > DIR
. . . then the 22,000 files in that directory scroll past so fast I ca n’t see their names .
However , if I apply the pipe function at the command prompt like this :
C:UnaLesbian Porn > DIR | more
. . . then the display will show me one screen of files at a time , with a " More " at the bottom .
To display the next screen of files , I hit any key to continue , until all of the files in the directory have been listed ( or I break , by pressing Ctrl - C ) .
What ’s happening is that the pipe symbol causes the output of the DIR command to be " piped " to the " More " ( paging ) command .
You get pretty much the same result by using the " / p " modifier , such as " DIR / p , " to display directory information a page at a time .
One suspects that some oddball keys were put on the PC keyboard ( or to be more precise , included in the ASCII character set , most of which found its way onto the PC keyboard ) because the developers figured they ’d come in handy for something .
On the whole that has turned out to be the case –programmers and developers have found a use for nearly every key on the keyboard , even if that use is n’t obvious to the general computing public .
Witness the tilde < ~ > , which , whatever use it may have as a diacritical mark , now can mean " home directory " or " text omitted , " among other things .
Given the pace of change in information technology , there ’s a lot to be said for designing your user interface for maximum flexibility .

We ’ve had an interesting new development here in the Last Frontier , as we approach election day .
A few days ago , I found out that a rash of robocalls and push - polls were going out in the state of Alaska .
When I heard about this , I was irritated for the same reason that other progressives are irritated at this tactic – spurious accusations of Obama being a terrorist sympathizer , a socialist , a Marxist , an elitist , and someone with blatant anti-plumber tax policies .
All nonsense , but some people actually listen to nonsense .
Then the bigger picture hit me like a ton of bricks .
Why on Earth would the Republican National Committee , or any Republican group have to robocall and push - poll Alaskans about the presidential race !?
With only slightly more than hours to go , surely they have better things to do than preach to the choir .
Well , apparently , the choir has stopped singing .
They ’re kind of standing around , staring at the hymnal and looking at each other thinking , “ Do we really want to sing this ? ”
The fact that the Republicans are robocalling Alaskans means they are worried .
They may or may not be worried about actually losing the presidential race in the state , but they are worried about the margin of victory .
At this point , it ’s all about saving face for the party , and for Sarah Palin .
Yes , the Sarah Palin who said that robocalls were “ annoying ” .
So , where are these calls happening ?
Ted Stevens ’ neighbors in the sleepy chalet - filled hamlet of Girdwood , have been getting them .
Summarized by one one Girdwood resident , the call reiterated Stevens ’ assertion that he is not a crook , and threw in a few fun facts about how Barack Obama is a “ terrorist who will run this country into the ground . ”
But my favorite was a push - poll to Ketchikan .
Ketchikan is the infamous “ Nowhere , Alaska , ” where that bridge was supposed to go .
And yes , Ketchikan residents are rightfully miffed that they got labeled with that nickname , and then got thrown under the bus so Sarah Palin could have a talking point .
You can hear the real story of the bridge from Bob Weinstein , mayor of Ketchikan , when he spoke to Rachel Maddow way back on September 2nd .
Back to the push - poll .
One resident of Ketchikan was the recipient of a fairly sophisticated interactive push - poll from americansincontact.org .
After identifying himself as an Obama supporter , there were two main pushes .
First , Obama ’s association with , and acceptance of funds from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – Would it make a difference “ if you knew that ? ”
Second , “ If you knew Obama supported the biggest tax increase in history , averaging more than $ 2000 for an average family , would that make a difference ? ”
This is the standard leading misinformation we have come to expect .
So , why do I love this call ?
The Obama supporter they called was the aforementioned mayor of Ketchikan himself , Bob Weinstein !
( A big hat - tip to Mayor Weinstein for bringing this to my attention , and a shout out to all the wonderful Mudflatters in Ketchikan ! )
COLLEGE PARK , Md. ( UPI ) - The Central Intelligence Agency has for the first time confirmed that a high - ranking Nazi general placed his anti-Soviet spy ring at the disposal of the United States during the early days of the Cold War .
The National Archives said in a release Wednesday that the CIA had filed an affidavit in U.S. District Court " acknowledging an intelligence relationship with German General Reinhard Gehlen that it has kept secret for 50 years . "
" The CIA 's announcement marks the first acknowledgement by that agency that it had any relationship with Gehlen and opens the way for declassification of records about the relationship , " the National Archives said .
Gehlen was Hitler 's senior intelligence officer on the Eastern Front during the war and transferred his expertise and contacts to the U.S. as World War II reached its climax .
While Gehlen 's relationship with U.S. intelligence during the 1940s and 1950s has been the topic of some five books over the years , the eventual release of CIA documents pertaining to the development of his European spy ring could shed new light on the origins of the Cold War and early U.S. espionage efforts against Moscow .
Gehlen 's network of agents in Europe - including many with Nazi backgrounds who were bailed out of prisoner of war camps by U.S. intelligence officers - was known as the Gehlen Organization and received millions of dollars in funding from the U.S. until 1956 .
The CIA 's acknowledgement of its dealings with Gehlen came in a response to an appeal of a Freedom of Information Act request by researcher Carl Oglesby , the National Archives said .
The agency pledged to release its records on the general in accordance with the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act .
The Act established the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group ( IWG ) , which for more than two years has been declassifying documents related to World War II war crimes and releasing them through the National Archives .
" This shows that the law is working , " said former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman , a member of the IWG .
" We now must work closely with the Agency to follow through with the release of these records . "

US Supreme Court denies Mumia Abu - Jamal ’s appeal for new trial
By Hiram Lee
20 October 2008
The US Supreme Court has denied Mumia Abu - Jamal 's appeal for a new trial .
A well - respected journalist and political activist , Abu -Jamal was convicted in 1982 of murdering Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner .
The trial that resulted in Abu - Jamal 's death sentence has since become infamous for its racist and anti-democratic character .
Abu - Jamal , now 53 , continues to profess his innocence , as he has since his arrest nearly three decades ago .
His case has won widespread international support .
The high court justices rejected Abu - Jamal 's case without comment on October 6 , the first day of the Supreme Court term .
His was among more than 2,000 appeals rejected in the first days of the new term , including those of other death row inmates .
On October 14 , the court refused to hear the case of Georgia death row inmate Troy Davis , widely assumed innocent of the murder he was convicted of committing .
( See " US Supreme Court clears way for execution of likely innocent death row inmate " )
In 1981 , Mumia Abu - Jamal , already an established journalist , had taken a second job working as a cab driver .
On December 9 of that year , he was driving his cab through downtown Philadelphia in the early hours of the morning when he happened upon an altercation between his brother , William Cook , and police officer Faulkner .
Seeing that his brother was in distress , Abu - Jamal rushed to his aid .
During the confrontation which followed , both Abu - Jamal and Faulkner were shot .
The police officer died from his wounds ; Abu -Jamal survived and was taken into custody .
Before the shooting of Daniel Faulkner had occurred , Abu - Jamal , who had been a founding member of the Philadelphia chapter of the Black Panther Party , had already drawn the wrath of the FBI and the Philadelphia police department for his political activism .
He had worked for years as a journalist in radio , where his political reporting earned him the nickname " Voice of the Voiceless . "
In the late 1970s , Abu -Jamal was an outspoken supporter of John Africa 's MOVE organization , a political group that was locked in a bitter struggle with police .
During a 1978 raid on MOVE's west Philadelphia commune , police officer James Ramp was killed and six other officers injured .
In 1985 , just three years after Abu - Jamal 's conviction , Philadelphia police dropped a bomb on the commune which had since moved to a new location .
Eleven people were killed in the resulting fire , including the group 's leader John Africa , and five children .
Abu - Jamal 's defense of MOVE during this time earned him the wrath of the Philadelphia police force and there is ever - increasing evidence that the journalist has been the victim of a police frame - up .
Of the latest appeal to the Supreme Court , Robert R. Bryan , lead attorney for Abu - Jamal , had previously explained in a legal update for the journalist 's supporters , " The basis of the current litigation is that the prosecution persuaded witnesses to lie in order to obtain a conviction and death judgment against my client . "
The appeal centered on two recent affidavits by new witnesses who have challenged the testimony of key witnesses in the 1982 prosecution .
The first affidavit was from Yvette Williams , who came forward to refute the story of Cynthia White , an essential player in the original prosecution who claimed she saw Abu - Jamal shoot Faulkner .
Williams ' affidavit , recorded January 28 , 2002 , begins , " I was in jail with Cynthia White in December of 1981 after Police Officer Daniel Faulkner was shot and killed .
Cynthia
White told me the police were making her lie and say she saw Mr. Jamal shoot Officer Faulkner when she really did not see who did it .
She said she knew Mumia from seeing him drive a cab . "
Williams goes on to say , " I asked her why she was ‘ lying on that man [ Abu - Jamal ] . '
She told me it was because the police and vice threatened her life . "
The second affidavit , recorded April 18 , 2003 , by Kenneth Pate , an inmate at SCI Greene prison in Pennsylvania , challenges the testimony of Priscilla Durham .
Durham was a security guard at the hospital where Abu - Jamal was treated on the night Faulkner was killed .
Durham had testified in 1982 that she heard Abu - Jamal confess to Faulkner 's murder .
Pate , who is a relative of Ms. Durham , states in his affidavit that " She [ Ms. Durham ] said that when the police brought him [ Abu - Jamal ] in that night she was working at the hospital .
Mumia was all bloody and the police were interfering with his treatment , saying ‘ let him die . ' "
Pate goes on , " Priscilla said that the police told her that she was part of the ‘ brotherhood ' of police since she was a security guard and that she had to stick with them and say that she heard Mumia say that he killed the police officer , when they brought Mumia in on a stretcher . "
Pate says that when he asked Durham if she had really heard such a confession , she replied , " All I heard him say was : ‘ Get off me , get off me , they 're trying to kill me . ' "
The Supreme Court Justices did not comment on their October 6 ruling against the appeal containing the sworn statements of these new witnesses , remarkable considering Abu - Jamal 's case is likely the most high - profile death penalty case in the United States in decades .
While Abu - Jamal 's appeal for a new trial has been rejected , there are further legal battles ahead , including another appeal to the Supreme Court that will specifically address the more racist elements of the 1982 trial .
An earlier federal appeals court ruling denied a new trial for Abu - Jamal , but ordered a new sentencing hearing .
If the Supreme Court does not grant him a new trial on the basis of his new appeal , federal prosecutors may appeal the federal appeals court ruling that ordered the new sentencing hearing .
While his initial death sentence was overturned in 2001 , Abu - Jamal could face the death penalty once again should a new sentencing hearing take place .
He remains incarcerated on death row during the appeals process .
The only legal options open for Abu - Jamal are life in prison or a new death sentence .
8:01 CT : The Brokaw neck jerk leads off the night .
8:02 CT : Obama with the coin flip win .
8:05 CT : McCain probably should have gotten either a shorter stool or a taller stool .
It does n't matter but he should have made a decision , he looks pained .
8:06 CT : Apparently keeping taxes low fixes the bad loans that are crushing the economy .
8:07 CT : " We need to stabilize home values , " says John McCain .
That is excellent , how do we do this Mr. McCain ?
" I know how we can fix this economy , " John rhetorically responds , but never actually tells us how he will do it .
8:11 CT : What was that Brokaw rant about .
8:12 CT : Anybody who owns a home has heard of either Fannie May or Freddie Mac , John .
Their logo is all over mortage documents .
8:13 CT : Obama looks very comfortable in his bar stool .
8:14 CT : " I have to correct some of John McCain 's history , not surprising , " marks Obama first zinger of the night .
8:19 CT : Section " F , " what a segue Mr. Brokaw .
8:20 CT : Nothing has happened so far .
8:20 CT : " The system in washing is broken , I have been a consistent reformer ... Senator Obama has never taken on the leaders of his party . "
Senator Obama has not been in a position during a period in time where the Democratic leadership was wrong .
8:22 CT : McCain agreed that he would not go into the audience , and he just walked between the seating divisions .
Clearly against the rules .
8:24 CT : Apparently McCain thinks he can conquer the three biggest issues of our election but yet he cannot campaign and help push the bailout bill .
Sounds like a contradiction .
8:26 CT : Some of the " 700 Billion that goes overseas is going to terrorists , " I have no idea where McCain is getting this number from .
8:28 CT : Why does McCain want a spending freeze on everything but defense ?
8:33 CT : I do not want to another image of McCain sitting awkwardly in his chair .
I 'm glad he 's standing now .
8:36 CT : To bad health insurance costs more than $ 5,000 .
8:37 CT : The Social Security question is now out in the open .
8:38 CT : Brokaw says Obama cannot talk about taxes , so Obama takes the next question and responds to the tax question anyway .
8:39 CT : If a small business is useful to society it becomes a big business .
A small business should not get tax breaks , unless they contribute to society .
You are not special because you have a small business .
8:40 CT : " Social Security is not that tough , " what is your plan then Mr. McCain .
I do not care about Tip O'Neil .
If you want us to have a commission to solve social security with the smartest people in America , while you be in that Commission Mr. McCain .
8:42 CT : I do not care what section the question is coming from Tom Brokaw .
8:44 CT : McCain is trying to distance himself from the Bush Administration on the environment , nobody cares .
Apparently John thinks Japan is an example of reusing Nuclear Fuel but Japan is not allowed to have Nuclear fuel .
That was part of the Geneva convention .
The people who tried to take over the world are not allowed to have Nuclear .
8:48 CT : McCain simply does not understand the concept of the Manhattan Project reference in the question .
It has nothing to do with Nuclear it has to do with funding a purely scientific project to conquer the energy problem .
8:50 CT : Why is McCain just pacing in the background .
In 2000 Gore startled Bush in a debate so they have no set aside a specific region in which the candidate can be .
McCain is all over the place .
8:53 CT : " Obama keeps talking about what the government will do , " that is correct Mr. McCain .
The reason he believes in the government achieving these objectives is because the private sector has not adequately provided for the citizens , in Obama 's opinion .
8:55 CT : McCain 's joke fell entirely flat .
I know the crowd is allowed to make noise , but there was definitely laughter in the VP debate .
8:55 CT : " With the plan I have that will do that . "
Thanks , what is your plan Mr. McCain ?
8:56 CT : " Health care should be a right , " Barack Obama .
8:57 CT : " McCain voted against expanding health care for children , " Barack Obama .
8:59 CT : " Did we hear the size of the fine ? " I have no idea what McCain was referring to .
9:00 CT : I 'm glad McCain understands the concept of Universal Instantiation .
9:05 CT : " We 're not going to be able to be everywhere at anytime , " is the essence of the Obama Doctrine on humanitarian combat operations .
9:08 CT : " We ended up having to withdrawn in humiliation . "
Wow John , sounds an awful lot like the current situation .
Lebanon seems to have turned out okay .
9:10 CT : " The young men and women in our military our my number one priority , after our country , " sounds fairly fascist to me .
You have two cows , the government kills you and takes them .
9:12 CT : McCain just blamed the current Afghanistan mess on the 1980s Afghan war with Russia .
Who was president during the Afghan war , your boy Reagan .
9:15 CT : McCain just made the leap from " I was joking with a veteran about bombing Iran " to " I know how to handle these crises . "
9:21 CT : What is Russia going to do us ?
The USA has bigger issues at the moment .
9:22 CT : " Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia , " Barack Obama on Russia .
9:23 CT : " Maybe , " the biggest moment in the debate .
McCain failed to take a stance , Obama did as well , but he talked through the question instead of entirely dodging the question .
9:25 CT : Nothing in the question about Israel asked by Terry Shirey had anything to do with Nuclear weapons .
9:33 CT : Senator McCain invokes an indirect use of the POW card .
" When times are tough we need a steady hand on the tiller . "
Interesting farming reference to concluded the debate .
Byrd glacier has one of the largest catchment basins in Antarctica and funnels 20 gigatonnes of ice to the Ross ice shelf ( bottom left ) each year ( Image : Stearns )
A hidden network of glacial lakes far below the Antarctic surface regulates the motion of the continent ’s ice rivers , a study has found .
When the subglacial lakes overflow , the ice above accelerates towards the ocean .
“ It ’s like putting in a squirt of oil , ” says Andy Smith of the British Antarctic Survey , who was not involved in this latest study .
“ The water lubricates the base of the glacier . ”
What causes the lakes to flood is not known , but researchers watching the movement of ice in satellite images have noticed that the ice appeared to “ breathe ” in some places , apparently linked to the ebb and flow of water underneath .
Now , for the first time , evidence has emerged sub - surface floods can indeed act like a “ turbo lubricant ” for glaciers .
Advertisement
By tracking both the ocean - bound movement of East Antarctica ’s Byrd glacier and the events in two lakes that lie beneath it , Leigh Stearns of the University of Maine and colleagues showed that the glacier sped up between late 2005 and mid 2007 – precisely when ice - penetrating radar imagery from satellites showed that both lakes were overflowing .
Conversely , the movement of the glacier slowed when the flood ceased and the lakes began to refill .
Slow melt
Smith says that similar events have been seen in Greenland , but since the lakes there lie at the surface of the ice , the mechanism must be different .
Temperatures in Greenland vary more than they do in Antarctica , where the summers are not warm enough to generate significant melt ponds at the surface .
“ In Antarctica , it appears that the ice at the very bottom of the glacier melts slowly and accumulates in hollows in the rock , ” says Smith .
He says the temperature at the bottom of the ice sheet stays very close to melting point : geothermal energy and friction warm it slightly and the kilometres of ice insulate the area keeping it at a relatively stable temperature .
When the hollows overflow , a flood of water spreads beneath Byrd Glacier , says Stearns .
“ The extra water overwhelms the subglacial drainage system .
It ca n’t escape fast enough , so spreads out beneath the glacier bed and reduces the friction between the ice and the rock , allowing the glacier to slide faster . ”
Smith emphasises that there is no reason to believe the Antarctic floods are in any way linked to climate change .
“ It is hard to see how anthropogenic global warming would affect the base of the ice sheet , ” he says .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has accepted an offer from President - elect Barack Obama to become U.S. secretary of state , joining her former Democratic rival to help guide U.S. foreign policy , the New York Times said on Friday .
The newspaper quoted two Clinton associates who said she came to her decision after additional discussions with Obama about the nature of her role as the top U.S. diplomat and his foreign policy plans .
“ She ’s ready , ” one of the sources told the newspaper , which posted the report on its website .
Clinton emerged as a frontrunner for the secretary of state job late last week , transfixing a country which had seen her compete hard against Obama to win the Democratic nomination for the presidency .
Obama clinched that nomination in June and then beat Republican John McCain in the November 4 election .
Democratic Party sources have recently said Clinton , was on track to be nominated , with an official announcement expected after the November 27 Thanksgiving holiday .
NBC news meanwhile also reported two other key Obama appointments : New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner as treasury secretary , and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson as commerce secretary .
NBC said official announcements on the appointments were expected on Monday .
Officials with the Obama transition team had no immediate comment .
Clinton has a global profile both as a political leader in her own right and as the wife of former U.S. President Bill Clinton .
Policy analysts say her selection as secretary of state could mean a more hawkish U.S. stance , noting that she has been more reluctant than Obama to commit to a firm timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq .
“ Joe the Plumber , ” who rose from anonymity to the national spotlight when Arizona Sen .
John McCain made him a cause at Wednesday ’s presidential debate , left a trail of tax liens and court records in connection with minor infractions in Ohio and Arizona , including Mesa .
His real name is Samuel Wurzelbacher , he lived in a west Mesa apartment and was summoned to appear in South Mesa Justice Court twice , the first time in November 2000 on a notice forcible detainer , a written demand to vacate an apartment he was renting .
The second case , dismissed in November 2001 , involved an issue between Wurzelbacher and Montgomery Ward Credit Corp .
Court officials said files of both cases were destroyed because of their age and connection with minor issues .
In addition to Arizona , records show that Wurzelbacher faced liens and judgments in Holland and Toledo , Ohio in 2007 .
The states are among four he has lived in , records show .
Wurzelbacher also lived in Tucson for awhile .
#########
NOTE :
Well , here ’s another funny coincidence : Joe the Plumber lived in Arizona from 1997 - 2000 .
He lived at 1960 W. Keating Ave in Mesa , Arizona .
There ’s that name again– KEATING .
It turns out that Keating Ave is named after– you guessed it– CHARLES KEATING , who developed the real estate in the 1970s .
A reader writes :
If I were as big a Palin fan as you have admitted to being , I 'd be pretty upset with John McCain right now .
Fallows put it best this morning ; there 's just no way anyone , even someone of considerable intellect and political skill , can come out looking good after being slingshot into the international spotlight so quickly .
The intricacies of national and international politics are just way too overwhelming , it takes months to years of careful study to be able to operate on that big a stage without making huge , potentially game changing gaffes .
John McCain just took one of the Republican party 's top prospects ( if not the top prospect ) and shot her into a situation in which she ( or anyone ) is all but bound to fail , all for his own selfish hope that it might help him win this election .
I 'm about as big an Obama fan as you are for Palin , and if John Kerry had tapped him as his running mate following Obama 's 04 convention speech , I 'd have been furious .
I would n't say I have quite the same Palin - love that progressives had for Obama in ' 04 ... but yeah , I 'm sure this is part of the reason I 'm pulling so hard for her to succeed :
She 's a politician I 've liked for a while who 's been thrust onto the national stage perhaps before her time , and there 's a chance she 'll crash and burn in service to a losing Presidential campaign .
But I can't say I did n't ask for it !
As far back as the winter - in a post responding to Josh Patashnik 's argument that in veep - picking , " far and away the most important question is :
Is this somebody you want closely identified with your party brand for the next two decades ? " - I had this to say :
As far as the GOP 's ( rather thin ) roster of rising stars goes , I think this argument would militate against picking Bobby Jindal and in favor of picking Sarah Palin .
Jindal already has a national profile ( and a movement - conservative cheering section ) , and having him as the whiz - kid Republican Governor of post - Katrina Louisiana is arguably better - both for the party and for him - than having him as the ( very ) junior partner in a weak Republican administration that 's facing off against an ascendant Democratic Party .
Palin , on the other hand , has no such national profile , and absent unforeseen developments is unlikely to obtain one so long as she 's occupying a governor 's mansion that 's just south of Yellowknife .
Like Jindal , she 's a great political story , but it's hard to see how that story gets told unless the Palin brand gets taken national somehow - and it might be worth risking subjecting her to the " losing veep 's curse " to give her a place on the national stage .
Be careful what you wish for , huh ?
And yes , if it turns out that the next two months transform Palin into a national laughingstock with no future outside Alaska , I wo n't be terribly happy with John McCain 's decision - making process .
I intend to wait slightly longer than 48 hours , though , before I pass judgment on that question .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
She is now officially the dumbest politician on the national stage .
It ’s dangerous for her to be anywhere close to any public office in the US .
Mayor is too much for an idiot of this magnitude .
Product Parenting
The genesis of this article happened back in May when I posted a blog entry containing the following snippet :
And finally , for something completely different , do n't miss the Jam Session at Tech - Ed on June 3rd .
Several of us minions from SourceGear are planning to take the stage and give our rendition of Pinball Wizard .
It 'll be me on acoustic guitar , our development manager Jeremy Sheeley on bass , and our product manager Paul Roub playing the Evil Mastermind Schecter PT that will be given away later that week .
BTW , I 'm not a very good guitar player , but the jam turned out OK .
Anyway , the first comment on that blog post was from a reader who said :
3 managers .
Wow .
Your company must be growing and / or is fairly large .
The person who made that comment was probably using the word " manager " to refer to " someone who manages people " .
If so , then yes , our company has more than 3 managers , but not all of the 3 people playing Pinball Wizard qualify :
Jeremy Sheeley is actually a manager .
He runs the development team that builds Vault and Fortress .
Strictly speaking , I suppose I am a manager .
But people who know me would say that referring to me as a manager is an undeserved compliment .
But Paul Roub is a " product manager " .
Here at SourceGear ( and in most other companies I know ) , a product manager is not [ necessarily ] someone who manages people .
So when I saw that comment , I told myself I should write an article about the role of a product manager .
This is that article .
( BTW , the content of this article was my presentation ( video ) at the Business of Software conference in September .
For more information about this event , keep an eye on the Business of Software conference blog . )
What is a product manager ?
In short , a product manager is a marketing person who focuses on strategic stuff and stuff that is specific to the product .
When people think of marketing , their thoughts often run to things like logos , graphic design , and advertising .
This is the communications side of marketing .
We call it " marcomm " .
The other side of marketing is the stuff that is more focused on the product itself :
Positioning
Differentiation
Features
Competition
Market research
These activities are the domain of the product manager .
I still remember the moment when I first started to learn this distinction .
Back when I worked at Spyglass , one of my peers asked , " Why do n't we have any product marketing people ? "
I said , " What do you mean ?
We 've got marketing people .
Marc and his team just spent six months deciding which Pantone shade of red we 're going to use for our logo .
That 's marketing , right ? "
The discussion that followed my clueless remark was very enlightening .
Managing Products vs. Managing People
There is a confusion caused by the word " manager " .
As noted before , a product manager does n't necessarily manage people .
To highlight the differences between product management and people management , I 'm going to start by offering a brief but reasonably complete lecture on managing people in a software company .
A Brief but Reasonably Complete Lecture on Managing People in a Software Company
Stop treating them like children .
That 's it ?
Yep , that 's it .
Stop treating them like children .
If you follow this rule and all of its corollaries , you will be a competent manager , thus placing you in the top one percent of all managers in the software industry .
Software professionals are grownups .
They do not deserve to be treated like children .
On the other hand ...
Unlike your coworkers , software products deserve to be treated very much like children .
They 're rebellious and wayward .
They need to be given strict boundaries and lots of guidance .
Like children , products go through stages .
Joel Spolsky said that " good software takes ten years " .
Those ten years are not all the same .
The life of a growing software product has six different stages .
And the progression of those stages is a lot like the stages of parenting a child .
Each stage requires a different approach .
There is a gradual progression from " high control " to " letting go " .
Stage 1 : Prepare
In parenting , the first stage is conception and pregnancy .
In software , this stage covers all the time before your first product release .
The key concept for this stage is " prepare " .
This is the stage where you find a product idea and dream about what it might be when it grows up .
Product managers in stage 1 tend to make the same mistake that a new father makes :
He believes that since the mother ( the development team ) is carrying the baby ( writing the code ) , he does n't have anything to do .
All he has to do is wait until the kid is old enough to throw a baseball around , right ?
Prepare
As a product manager , stage 1 is perhaps your most important stage .
You have a lot of preparation to do if you want your product to be successful .
You need to figure out your positioning .
You need to clearly define your differentiation .
And you need to figure out how those two things are going to express themselves in every other aspect of the product .
This is challenging stuff , and you have to do it now .
Later it will be too late .
Fail
Anybody else remember the Apple Pippin ?
When I speak at conferences , they sometimes introduce me as " the person who led the team at Spyglass who built the browser that Microsoft licensed to become Internet Explorer " .
That 's true , but it is an incomplete rendition of the truth .
Spyglass licensed its browser to around 120 different companies who released products based entirely or partially on our code .
All but one of those products crashed and burned .
So it would be equally accurate ( albeit far less flattering ) to introduce me as " the person who has been affiliated with more failed web browser products than anyone else on the planet " . :-)
One of those products was the Apple Pippin ( although I would hasten to say that my code was not the reason why the Pippin failed ) . :-)
The Pippin was a disastrous example of product marketing .
And it failed because somebody did a terrible job in stage 1 .
The positioning of this product was never clear .
Is it a game machine ?
Is it a computer ?
Is it a set top box ?
The answer to all of these questions was " yes " .
By trying to fit in every category , the Pippin ended up fitting in none of them .
Predictably , the primary differentiation for the Pippin was that it was lame in every category .
Yes , it was a game machine , but it was insanely expensive and incompatible with 100 % of the popular games in the world .
Yes , it was a computer , but it was slow and underpowered .
Stage 2 : Care
In parenting , the second stage is birth and infancy .
In software , this stage covers the 1.0 release and the time thereafter .
The key concept for this stage is " care " .
This is the stage where you endure the final pain of getting the product out the door .
The product manager has a very important role in the first release of a new product .
The labor pains are endured by the development team , but the product manager is responsible for the launch .
It is important to get the messaging just right .
Shipping release 1.0 is a lot like the birth of a new baby : Lots and lots of pain , followed by a brief period of pure happiness , and then no sleep for quite a while .
In most B2B software products , shipping the 1.0 release is more like a beginning than an end .
Care
After a baby is born , the parents are overwhelmed with the responsibility of its care .
A newborn is completely dependent , unable to do anything for itself .
When it wants to be fed at 3 o'clock in the morning , that 's what has to be done .
Many version 1.0 products have similar needs .
Users need tech support , sometimes urgently and at very inconvenient times .
That 's what has to be done .
Like the husband of a breast - feeding mother , the product manager may not have primary responsibility for all this care that needs to be provided .
But he can be involved , and both he and the product will benefit from his choice to do so .
Product managers and new fathers typically share one other task in common during stage 2 : Soul searching .
Every father I know has held his new baby and wondered if he was really prepared for the responsibility .
Product managers in stage 2 need to be asking themselves questions about the quality of their preparation :
Is the positioning right ?
Is the differentiation sufficient ?
Is the messaging clear ?
Stage 2 is not the time to start doing the stuff you should have done in stage 1 .
But it is time to review .
It 's not too late to make changes .
Fail
Around ten years ago , my company shipped version 1.0 of a product called SourceSurf .
It was a web - based application for browsing source code repositories .
If you were to travel back in time and ask SourceSurf what it wants to be when it grows up , it would look into the future and say , " I want to be sort of like Atlassian FishEye " .
But SourceSurf never got the chance to grow up .
Version 1.0 was its first and last major release .
What we should have done was tweak the strategy and keep going .
Instead , we looked at the initial results and gave up .
SourceSurf 1.0 did n't do very well , but the product concept was generally good .
We failed to make the minor course corrections this product needed to be successful .
Stage 3 : Listen
In parenting , the third stage is the so - called " terrible twos " , ( which , as all parents know , actually lasts until the child is almost four ) .
In software , this stage typically covers the 2.0 release cycle .
The key concept for this stage is " listen " .
This is the stage of defiance and rebellion , where the product begins to exhibit its own will .
One day when my oldest daughter was in this stage , we called her to dinner .
She sauntered up to the table , glanced at the food we had prepared , and gasped in horror , " There 's nothing here I like except butter ! " :-)
Obviously children need correction during these years .
But they also need to be heard .
This is the stage when " kids say the darndest things " , some of which are cute , and some of which are annoying or embarrassing .
Either way , this process is an important stage of growth .
Parents need to provide correction without crushing the child 's spirit .
Often that means listening to the weird things the child says .
Listen
The product manager also needs to spend stage 3 listening .
Customers ask for a lot of stuff , and that feedback needs to be heard and incorporated into the next release of the product .
There is still time to tweak the strategy before the product goes mainstream .
Fail
Stage 3 is the most common place where products fail .
There are plenty of examples .
Almost any product that died at the bottom of the chasm was a failure in stage 3 .
My favorite two examples are BeOS and Wingz .
BeOS was a new operating system released in the late '90s .
Technologically , BeOS was very cool , but it fell into the chasm because it never found a niche on the other side .
Wingz was a new spreadsheet released in the late ' 80s .
Wingz had features that Excel does n't have today .
But to survive , it needed to get popular with a small group of users and spread from there .
I liked Wingz a lot , but I think most people thought it was just too weird .
I often wonder if these products might have succeeded if they had been more willing to listen to the very early user feedback and change course accordingly .
This might have meant allowing the product to become something its parents never dreamed it would be .
Digression : Looking across the chasm
Since I am employed by a version control vendor , the chasm situation that is most interesting to me today is the Decentralized Version Control System ( DVCS ) .
Notable examples in this category include open source tools such as Git , Mercurial , and Bazaar .
Today , these products are not yet mainstream .
They have a lot of buzz in certain communities , but the vast majority of all companies doing software development are still using centralized tools .
Will the DVCS tools make it across the chasm ?
Stage 4 : Talk
In parenting , the fourth stage is the time from elementary school to adolescence .
In software , this stage typically covers version 3.0 , which is often the first release where the product can be considered mainstream .
The key concept for this stage is " talk " .
Parents at this stage often express amazement at what their child can do .
" Little Bobby is just amazing !
Seven years ago we made this baby and now I can carry on an actual conversation with it ! "
Stage 4 arrives , and quite suddenly the parent realizes that their baby has become a little person .
Similarly , software products in stage 4 have reached the point where most people can actually use them .
They 're mainstream now .
Previous releases were really only popular with early adopters and people who have lots of patience .
But release 3.0 is polished enough to be a productive solution for more than half of its target market .
Stage 4 is when products and children begin to develop an unhealthy level of focus on the competition .
When kids go to school , they begin to learn that they can make themselves feel better by making others feel worse .
It will take them many years to unlearn this lesson , to learn that mental health and personal peace come from the disciplined choice to not worry so much about others and take care of yourself .
Similarly , stage 4 products should probably not be terribly focused on the competition .
If you do n't have good differentiation by now , you 're not gonna get it .
Take care of your own customers .
Talk
The most important thing for parents and product managers in stage 4 is talking .
This is the stage where kids need information , and it is the last stage when they are actually willing to listen to anything you have to say : Parents need to talk to their kids about the risks ahead .
Tell them about the heartache and consequences that can come from poor decisions about smoking and sex and drugs and being a fan of the Chicago Cubs .
Similarly , stage 4 is the time when a product manager 's primary job is providing information .
Your product is mainstream now .
People want it .
But to help them realize they want it , you have to give prospective customers lots of information .
You need whitepapers .
You need demo videos .
You need product comparison documents .
And so on .
Fail
As an example of a product that did n't do so well in stage 4 , I cite my own company 's flagship product , SourceGear Vault .
Vault is very popular and has been a success for our company .
But when it comes to providing all the different kinds of information that a mainstream product needs , we dropped the ball .
Right around the release of Vault 3.0 , the product started to get lots buzz through " word of mouth " .
People would come to our website to get product information , but the stuff we had there was just too anemic .
To our credit , we realized our mistake and took steps to fix it .
We hired a product manager to focus on this kind of thing .
But still , we got a late start , so even now Vault is still catching up to where it should be .
Stage 5 : Balance
In parenting , the fifth stage is the teenage years , from adolescence through high school .
In software , this stage typically covers the post - 3.0 releases .
The key concept for this stage is " balance " .
This is the stage where a child wants you to stop calling them a child .
It is a time of transition to adulthood , defined by rebellion .
No stage is more trying and difficult for a parent than stage 5 .
Every parent wants their children to eventually become independent , but few realize just how painful the journey will be .
The teenage years are a lot like the terrible twos .
When the child does n't get his way , his anger can be quite explosive .
However , instead of lying on the ground kicking and screaming , he shouts " I hate you ! " and slams his bedroom door .
Balance
But just like the terrible twos , this stage is a critical part of growing up .
The parent must strike a balance .
This stage is the time to start steering a bit less .
Let the teenager take a bit more control over her own life .
Stage 5 is when children and products spend a lot of their time asking for things they do n't need :
But Dad , every other teenager on the planet has unlimited text messaging !
But Mom , I can't wear a dress that I already wore once !
I have to get a new one !
But Dad , ALL of the other word processors have a grammar checker !
As product manager in stage 5 , you need to give your product some slack .
It 's time to let customers have some of the features you have been resisting for years .
Even if you do n't think the feature is a good idea , as long as it wo n't destroy the product , you should seriously consider letting it happen .
But you still need some boundaries :
A parent must begin to let the teenager be what he wants to be .
But do n't let the kid ruin his life .
Leave enough boundaries in place to ensure that he can finish the journey to adulthood safely and without doing something he 'll regret for decades .
Similarly , a software product can ruin its life in stage 5 by shipping a bad release .
A product manager needs to be a champion for quality .
It does n't matter how great version 3.0 was .
If version 4.0 is buggy and unreliable , the product 's reputation will probably never fully recover .
Fail
The perfect example of a product that ruined its life with poor quality is Microsoft Visual SourceSafe .
Today , SourceSafe is the punch line to almost every joke about version control .
It is widely despised and generally regarded to be unreliable .
Before Microsoft acquired SourceSafe , it was an outstanding and highly respected product .
This product did n't become the mostly widely used proprietary version control tool for no reason at all .
SourceSafe redefined the industry by bringing more ease of use than any of its predecessors .
But under Microsoft 's parenting , SourceSafe ruined its life .
Versions 5.0 and 6.0 were disastrous .
I would bet that SourceSafe has more disdain per user than any other profitable product in history .
My company has made megabucks from the world 's dissatisfaction with SourceSafe .
Ironically , the latest version of SourceSafe probably does n't deserve quite the level of scorn that it receives .
I have n't used SourceSafe 2005 , but I understand that it 's not actually that bad .
They fixed a lot of problems .
But the product has become something that people love to hate .
Now it 's too late .
The world will never trust SourceSafe again .
Stage 6 : Let Go
In parenting , the sixth stage is adulthood .
In software , this stage covers the time when the product is considered mature .
The key concept for this stage is " let go " .
This is the stage where your work as a parent is basically done .
From now on , any mistake your child makes is their own fault .
You have to let go .
Similarly , a product manager does n't have much to do anymore when a product reaches maturity .
For both parent and product manager , this is a time to celebrate the successful end of a long and sometimes difficult journey .
Let Go
Both parents and product managers often find it difficult to let go .
But it is important that you do .
You 're a product manager .
Your job is to help define and shape the identity of this product .
Once the child is " all grown up " , you need to stop trying to help it figure out what it wants to be .
It already is .
Let the folks in marcomm , sales and support handle everything from now .
This product is done .
Go find the next one .
Epic Fail
The two most obvious examples where product managers refused to let go :
Microsoft Windows
Microsoft Office
These products are done .
They 've been done for years .
Unfortunately , Microsoft has largely failed to find its next product .
So , because Microsoft has nothing better to do , they continue to sell us new releases we do n't need and create contrived reasons to force us to buy them .
Naturally somebody is going to gripe at me for saying that the two highest - revenue software products in history are a failure .
I 'm not saying that .
What I 'm saying is that these two products were stunningly successful in stages one through five , and that does n't change the fact that their execution of stage 6 has been awful .
Final Remarks
The product manager and the parent both suffer from an abundance of diverse opinions .
Your local bookstore has hundreds of titles on each topic , many of them offering conflicting advice .
This article contains lots of my opinions about parenting and product marketing .
Some of my readers will agree with me .
Others will think I am wrong .
( The ones in the latter group will send me email . )
The problem with both parenting and product marketing is that everybody knows how to do it , but nobody really knows how to do it .
You read everything you can , and then you do your best .
And in parenting , your best is probably good enough .
This is one very important way that product management is completely different from parenting :
Most parents are successful .
Very few parents completely fail .
We spend many sleepless hours worrying , but in the end , stuff tends to work out .
If you love your kids and give them your best effort , they 're probably going to turn out OK .
In contrast , most products fail .
Marketing is field where effort and " doing your best " are not usually sufficient .
The Pippin did n't fail because there was no product manager -- it failed because its product manager was a nitwit .
Microsoft is n't flogging us with Windows Vista because they do n't care about finding new products .
Microsoft tried to find their next product .
They tried very hard .
They assigned their smartest people to the challenge .
They spent many millions of dollars searching for it .
But they never found it .
Google did .
Does the traffic coming to your site come in a Yo- Yo like cycle of ups and downs that never really seems to go anywhere in the long run ?
Yesterday I wrote about a common problem that many bloggers face – spikes of traffic followed by flat - lines and promised a follow up post today on how to break this cycle by building ‘ sticky ’ sites .
My point yesterday was to encourage readers not to see spikes in traffic as the ultimate goal but as a stepping stone to ongoing growth .
What is a ‘ Sticky ’ Site ?
A sticky website is one where a first time reader arrives and finds it difficult to leave .
Not because the site owner captures them in a ‘ RickRoll ’ or a series of windows asking them if they REALLY want to leave – but because something about the site motivates them to explore it further – and more importantly to make a decision to ( and takes some steps to ensure that they ) return again to it .
21 Techniques to Make Your Site Sticky
The following 21 techniques are ways that you can make your blog or website more sticky .
They come from my own experience of blogging over the last 5 years .
As a result of basing this on personal experience I ’m going to show you quite a few examples of what I ’ve done ( after all i know my own sites best ) .
I ’d love you to add your tips and show examples of what you ’ve done in comments below to make it a more useful resource for readers .
1. Make Your Invitations to Subscribe to your blog Prominent
One of the most important things to do is to have a prominent call to action for readers coming to your blog to subscribe to it .
In fact I ’d recommend having more than one invitation – one prominent one above the fold and prominent in your sidebar or navigation area and then a second one below your post .
This means that people are triggered to subscribe whether they have just arrived on your blog or if they ’ve just finished reading a post ( a ‘ pause point ‘ ) .
This is what I do on my blogs and my tracking shows that both get a fairly even number of people using the two options .
By the way – if you ’re not already subscribed to ProBlogger ’s RSS feed – here it is !
2. Educate Readers about Your Subscription Methods
One of the most read posts here on ProBlogger is my ‘ what is RSS ‘ post which I have below my Subscription link .
It ’s there simply to educate readers on what RSS is and in doing so sell them a way to connect with my blog .
Interestingly enough – quite a few other bloggers around the web now link to the page to educate their readers too .
Similarly – I occasionally will write a post on my blogs that invites new readers to subscribe .
Sometimes I think we mistakenly assume that all of our readers have been with us for a long time and all know how to use our site – however many of your newer readers might not know the full story .
Here ’s one of these posts that I ran on DPS last year .
The day after I did this my RSS subscribers jumped considerably .
It was just a matter of educating my newer readers of the blog on how they could connect better with it .
You ’ll also note that at the end of the post I asked readers to let me know how they follow the blog .
This was for two reasons :
Firstly I wanted to involve older readers who already knew all the information in the post .
It somehow seemed to make the post more relevant for them as it invited them to participate .
Secondly it was about social proof and showing newer readers how others used the site .
I think the comments section reflected some of this .
3. Good Blog Design
I ’ve always believed that a good blog design is an important part of helping readers to decide whether they ’re going to hang around and track with your site over the long haul .
Readers make judgements about your site within seconds of arriving at it – if they see something cluttered and confusing they ’ll be less likely to want to return .
Good design highlights your content , helps people navigate your site well and creates a good impression – and first impressions matter !
Keep your design simple , familiar and obvious and you ’ll be on the road to a sticky site .
PS : A common mistake that I see bloggers making is to crowd out their content with too many ads above the fold .
If a reader arrives at your site and has to scroll to see the content you ’ll increase the numbers of people who simply hit the ‘ back ’ button on their browser .
4. On Site Branding
Work hard at building a brand that is attractive and draws people in .
First time readers should know what your blog is about at a first glance .
Use your blog ’s title , it ’s design , taglines , post titles , about pages , logo and navigational elements to communicate what your blog is about .
Also – do something to differentiate the brand of your blog .
It could be a logo , image , color scheme , blog name … .
5. Make Your Blog Personal
One thing that I ’ve seen a number of bloggers do really well over the last year or two is brand themselves well on their blog .
While it ’s not essential to have a blog that is centered around your personal brand I find that when you do add a personal touch to your blog that it can connect with readers in a powerful way .
The fact is that some readers are more interested in connecting with a person than a collection of content .
Adding your photo , writing in a personal tone , using video / audio and including personal details and stories of how you engage with your topic can give your blog personality which will draw some of your readers into a relationship with you .
6 . When you get a rush of traffic to one particular post … .
When the spikes in traffic come along you need to be ready to act ( and act fast – because they can be momentary ) .
Add invitations to subscribe to your feed within your post .
Something along the lines of ‘ enjoy this post ?
Get more like it by subscribing to ….’ can work really well .
It can also be worthwhile adding links at the end of your post to ‘ further reading ’ on posts that are getting lots of reader to them .
Sometimes when you get a spike it can even be worth writing a ‘ welcome ’ post .
For example if I get a mention in a mainstream media publication that sends significant traffic I ’ll often do a post that welcomes people but also gives them a ‘ tour ’ of the site ( example ) .
Another clever move is to quickly write up a followup article to the one that is getting all the traffic .
For example – if this post suddenly got a burst of traffic I could quickly write a post ’ 10 more ways to make your blog sticky ’ and then add a link to that post at the end of this one ( update : actually I wrote one called 7 more ways to make your blog sticky ) .
This shows readers that you ’ve got more to say on your topic than just one post .
Every extra page view is a step closer to them subscribing ( if the pages they view are good quality ) .
These ‘ hot posts ’ are really important to optimize ( learn how to optimize popular posts ) .
7. Get Interactive
Getting someone to DO something on your blog means that they ’ve invested something into your blog and increases the likelihood that they ’ll return .
Interactive blogs are often also sticky ones .
Interaction could include
Comments
Competitions
Polls
Projects and Memes
As a result it ’s worth spending some time Learning how to get readers to comment on your blog – and exploring other ways to make your blog more interactive .
Get your readers involved as much as you can !
The other bonus for ‘ giveaways ’ , ‘ special offers ’ and ‘ competitions ’ is that when you do them regularly some readers will subscribe because they do n’t want to miss out on future giveaways .
The current competition might not interest them but they sure want to know when you do one in future .
8 . Add a ‘ subscribe to comments ’ feature to your blog
This draws those who comment back to continue the conversation and increases the chances of them becoming loyal readers .
You ’ll find that only some readers will ever use this – but even if just a few do you ’ve had a win .
I have this enabled here at ProBlogger ( I do n’t have it on by default – those leaving comments have to choose to subscribe because I do n’t want to inundate them with comments ) and at any given time there are several hundred people subscribed to comments on posts .
I use this subscribe to comments plugin to run mine .
PS : just be aware that if you get a lot of unmoderated comment spam it can be a little embarrassing to have this feature – I learned the hard way .
9. Respond to Comments
This is a particularly effective way to draw readers back to your blog – particularly in the early days when you do n’t have a lot of readers commenting to follow up .
There are two main ways you can do this :
respond to comments with comments
respond to comments with emails to the comment leaver
Showing those that comment on your blog that you ’re interacting with them can make a real impression and will often draw them back time and time again .
10 .
Offer alternative ways to subscribe
Some readers will respond well to your prominent invitation to subscribe via RSS ( see # 1 above ) but others will be more open to connecting in other ways .
I generally offer three subscription methods :
RSS
Daily email updates ( RSS to Email )
Weekly newsletter ( summary of the blog from the last week plus some exclusive content )
More recently I ’ve also been offering readers the ability to track with my blogs via Twitter and send my latest posts to my Twitter account via TweetBurner .
Why so many options ?
The answer is simply that each reader has their own systems in place to consume content and connect with websites – so offering a variety of methods increases the chances that you ’ll be doing something that they are familiar with .
11 . Promote social media connecting points
Similarly – some of your readers will respond very well to your invitations to connect on other social media sites .
For example I have some readers on DPS who are Facebook junkies .
They refuse to subscribe via RSS or email but religiously read my blog by following my Facebook profile which pulls in my latest posts .
Another small group of readers here at ProBlogger follow this blog through Technorati ’s favorites feature .
While I prefer to read blogs using an rss reader like Google Reader – their rhythm of reading content revolves around Technorati .
As a result I ’m happy that I promoted my Technorati profile ( you can favorite ProBlogger here ) .
While you might not see the sense in people following your blog in some of these social media sites others do and at the very least promoting them can potentially reinforce your brand .
12 . Highlight Your Best Content
A great way to convince readers to become loyal is to get them reading more than one of your posts ( especially if they are your best posts ) .
You can do this by linking to other posts within your content but also suggesting further reading and ‘ best of ’ posts around your blog .
For example – here at ProBlogger on my front page the ‘ best of ProBlogger ’ section is one of the most clicked upon parts of my site .
This small section of the site sends people deep within the blog to some of my best work – hopefully resulting in quite a few new loyal readers .
At DPS I have a small section on my sidebar called ‘ Digital Photography Tips ’ which is a list of ‘ sneeze pages ‘ ( or compilation pages of my best posts in certain categories ) .
Again – these are there simply to draw people deep into the site and get them viewing some of the best the site has to offer ( and hopefully to convince them to subscribe ) .
13 . Create Momentum With Your Content
When you give readers a sense that you ’re creating more content that they ’ll want to read you give them a reason to subscribe .
For example when a reader reads the first part of a series of posts on a topic that they find useful you can count on them wanting to read the rest .
I wrote about this in a post on creating a sense of anticipation on your blog .
14 . Consider Removing Dates on Old Posts
This one could be a little controversial but I find that when old posts are not dated that it does n’t create a ‘ oh this is old ’ type reaction in your readers .
I ’ve seen this numerous times here on ProBlogger where posts written back in 2005 have attracted comments like ‘ this is old ’ or ‘ out of date tips ’ – even when the content has been of a ‘ timeless ’ or evergreen nature .
Personally I think that you should consider the type of blog you have before doing this .
For me it works on DPS where I ’ve never had dates on posts – but not here at ProBlogger where I have a topic that is more time specific ( I ’ll write more on this topic in coming days ) .
15 . Give Incentive to Subscribe
Over the last few days I ’ve had a small competition going on Digital Photography School where I ’m giving 3 subscribers to my newsletter there a copy of a great photography book .
1500 new subscribers later ( and counting that small incentive is one of the best $ 50 I ’ve ever spent .
Give away a book , free ebook or report , download or some other incentive to those subscribing to your blog ’s feed or newsletter and you could give some readers the little extra incentive to connect that they needed .
It need not be anything expensive ( or that costs you anything at all ) – just make it a small bonus and see what impact that might have .
16 . Keep Posting Frequency Up
One thing that I do as a blog reader deciding whether I ’ll subscribe to a blog or not is to head to the home page and see how often they ’ve updated recently .
There ’s nothing more frustrating as a reader than to find some great content and be hungry for more only to find that the blogger has n’t update in 3 months .
I do n’t think you need to update every day – but something in the last week shows that your blog is up to date .
You can also highlight this by showing your most recent posts somewhere in your sidebar .
17 . Create an Engaging About Page
Another thing that I often do when I go to a new blog is to look at it ’s ‘ about page ‘ .
I like to know who is behind a blog , what their goals for it are , how it started and other information about what the blogger is on about .
This is an opportunity to sell your blog to and make a connection with prospective readers who are going out of their way to find out more about you – so use it to tell your story and draw readers in to journey with you .
PS : whatever you do – do n’t let your about page be the default about page that comes with your blog .
18 . Add a Community Area or Forum
One of the best things that I ever did with my photography site was to add a forum .
I cannot express to you just how sticky that area of DPS is !
While readers come to the blog once a day to read new content – some of them come to the forum ALL DAY – racking up literally hundreds of page views a week .
Forums wo n’t attract all of your readers ( I suspect they attract some personality types and not others ) – but they will connect with some and help make your site a lot stickier .
19 . Social Proof
Does your blog have readers already ?
If so ( and even if it ’s just a few ) highlight this in any way that you can and you ’ll show other first timers that they ’re not the only one reading your blog .
People attract people and a site that is obviously being read by others will draw others into it .
This can be difficult in the early days of a blog when you do n’t have a lot of activity – but as it builds show it off .
Highlight new comments , show subscriber numbers when you have them , quote readers comments , find a way to slip your stats into a post occassionally etc .
It ’s a bit of a snowball effect – once you have readers they ’ll bring others in .
One thing that I occassionally do at DPS on my subscribe page ( a page dedicated to talking readers through 3 subscription options ) is to not only highlight the options but to tell people how many people are using them .
In this way those considering subscribing get a sense that they ’re actually becoming a part of something that has momentum and thousands of others joining .
20 . Target Readers with Specific Messages
Here are a few tools and plugins out there that enable you to present specific messages to certain readers coming to your blog based upon where they ’ve arrived from and if they ’ve been to your blog before .
LandingSites is a WP plugin that shows readers arriving from search engines related posts on the search term that they ’ve searched for .
What Would Seth Godin
Do is a plugin that welcomes new readers to your blog with a special message and invitation to subcribe .
Got any other plugins and tools for targeting readers with specific messages ?
Feel free to share them in comments below .
21 . Sticky Content
Lastly ( and most importantly in my mind ) – the key to sticky sites is sticky content .
You can have the best designed site in the world with lots of the above features – but unless readers who come to it find something that connects and brings them life in some way – you ’re unlikely to get them back tomorrow .
Writing engaging content needs to be your number one Priority .
What Have I Missed ?
As I wrote this list the ideas just kept coming ( I originally set out to write a list of 10 points … then 20 …. then I just had to slip in one more ) – but I ’m sure there is more to say on the topic of sticky sites .
What would you add ?
What have you done on your site to add stickiness ?
Looking forward to hearing your ideas in comments below .
PS : Welcome to StumbleUpon readers

Lastly – this post has led to some great conversation in comments below which has triggered a lot of other ideas for creating sticky blogs in my mind – so I ’ve written a followup post – 7
More ways to make your blog sticky .
US Army recruiting offices are reporting increased interest in signing up as the economic crisis worsens .
Atlanta recruiting offices are the most recent to see an increase in numbers , and potential recruits are smarter as well .
The Army reported that 83 % of its recruits in the year ending Sept. 30 had high school diplomas , up from 79 % the previous year .
The percentage of young people who said they would probably join the military increased from 9 % to 11 % in the first half of this year , according to a Pentagon - sponsored survey .
According to WBSRadio , Sgt. 1st Class Fabian Byrd at the Smyrna Army Recruiting office ( Atlanta ) says it ’s easy to see why the Army is attractive : “ you have a guaranteed job , a guaranteed medical benefits , a guaranteed paycheck and you have 30 days of vacation every year . ”
While we honor the service of any person in the army , Byrd seems to forget a few other things , like you could get sent to a shit hole and get killed , but hey , it ’s a pay packet right :-)
In day one of this trial , a witness came forward with strong testimony that landed a crushing blow for the defense and celebration for the prosecution .
Ashley Grills , 20 , told jurors Thursday she helped Lori Drew set up a fake MySpace profile of a 16 - year - old boy to lure Megan Meier into an online relationship .
Testifying for the prosecution under a grant of immunity , Grills also said she sent the last message from the fictitious “ Josh Evans ” to Megan in October 2006 on the day the girl hanged herself .
When she learned of Megan ’s death , Grills said Drew told her , “ We could have pushed her overboard because she was suicidal and depressed . ' ”
The statement by Ashley Grills could be the beginning of the end for the cyber bullying mom .
Prosecutors say Drew , 49 , her then - 13 - year - old daughter , Sarah , and Grills created the MySpace alias in September 2006 to befriend Megan to find out if she was spreading rumors about Sarah .
This is the nation ’s first cyber bullying trial and it could set a legal precedent for dealing with the issue of online harassment .
In my opinion , if Drew is found guilty I think she will serve jail time , but not the 20 year term in which the law could give her .
I think she will be sentenced around 5 to 10 years and paroled in 3 years .
Colin Powell endorses Barack Obama RAW STORY

Print This Email This Former secretary of state and military supremo Colin Powell on Sunday endorsed Democrat Barack Obama 's White House bid , in a stinging rebuff to Republican candidate John McCain .
The former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff expressed disquiet over the rightward shift the Republican Party has taken under McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin -- who he said was not ready to be president .
Powell , on NBC program " Meet the Press , " said Obama had " met the standard " to lead " because of his ability to inspire , because of the inclusive nature of his campaign , because he is reaching out all across America " .
" I think he would be a transformational president .
For that reason I will be voting for Senator Barack Obama , " said Powell , who was the first African - American to occupy the top US military post .
Should the mixed - race Obama win on November 4 , " all Americans should be proud , not just African - Americans , " he added .
" It would not just electrify our country , it would electrify the world . "
Colin Powell spoke to reporters after leaving NBC 's studio where he appeared on Meet the Press and endorsed Barack Obama .

Whether Jarek Molski is a crusader for the disabled or an extortionist who abused the law for personal gain , the vexatious litigant has filed his last lawsuit .
The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear the case of Molski vs. Evergreen Dynasty Corp. , owner of a Chinese restaurant in Solvang , Calif. , in a legal Waterloo for the 38 - year - old Woodland Hills man .
Molski filed more than 400 suits under the Americans With Disabilities
Act before a federal judge barred him from future litigation .
In a highly unusual action in 2004 , U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie , who has since died , branded Molski a “ hit - and - run plaintiff , ” accusing him of systematic extortion of businesses across California .
Molski , who has used a wheelchair since a motorcycle accident two decades ago , sued restaurants , bowling alleys , wineries and other retail outlets for insufficient handicapped parking , misplaced handrails and other violations of the disabilities act , demanding that business owners be fined $ 4,000 for every day their facilities failed to meet exacting federal standards .

Fear of adverse judgments compelled many to settle out of court , earning the Polish - born plaintiff hundreds of thousands of dollars in less than two years .
Molski was traveling abroad and could n’t be reached for comment , said a secretary at the San Francisco office of his attorney , Thomas E. Frankovich .
The Frankovich firm also was accused by Rafeedie of misusing the courts and barred from filing more suits without the judge ’s permission .
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in April denied a rehearing of the Evergreen case by the full court .
But nine of the court ’s 28 judges , including Chief Judge Alex Kozinski , dissented , arguing that the 1st Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances is “ one of the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights . ”
Courts have the right to shield their dockets from abuse by frivolous litigation , said Peter Eliasberg , managing attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California .
“ But this is a remedy that should be used very sparingly , especially with regard to a statute that is disobeyed a lot , ” he said of the disabilities act .

A sketch from MoD files by someone who claimed to have seen a UFO
A passenger jet coming in to land at Heathrow Airport had a near miss with a UFO , newly - released Ministry of Defence files reveal today .
The captain of the Alitalia airliner was so concerned he shouted “ look out ” to his co-pilot after seeing a brown missile - shaped object shoot past them overhead .
The mysterious incident near Lydd in Kent in 1991 was thoroughly investigated by the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) and the military .
But having ruled out the object being a missile , weather balloon or space rocket , the MoD closed the inquiry and left the matter unsolved .
The unexplained close encounter is one of many recounted in military UFO documents made available online today by the National Archives .
Covering sightings from between 1986 and 1992 , the 19 files include :
a US Air Force pilot ’s account of being ordered to shoot down a UFO that appeared on his radar while he flew over East Anglia ;
an MoD request that Army and Navy helicopters should not take photographs of crop circles for fear of undermining the official line that the military did not investigate unexplained phenomena ;
a letter from a woman claiming to be from the Sirius system who said her spacecraft — also containing two “ Spectrans ” with “ Mr Spock ears ” — crashed in Britain during the Second World War .
But one of the most intriguing episodes is the near - miss involving the Alitalia airliner at about 8 pm on April 21 1991 .
The McDonnell Douglas MD80 aircraft was en route from Milan to Heathrow at 22,000ft with 57 people on board when pilot Achille Zaghetti saw the strange object some 1,000 ft above him .
He recounted : “ At once I said , ‘ Look out , look out , ’ to my co-pilot , who looked out and saw what I had seen .
“ As soon as the object crossed us I asked to the ACC ( area control centre ) operator if he saw something on his screen and he answered , ‘ I see an unknown target 10nm ( nautical miles ) behind you ’ . ”
A CAA document notes that Southern TV broadcast a story about a 14 - year - old boy who reported seeing a missile flying at low level before climbing through the cloud and disappearing on the same evening .
Radar images showing the UFO were initial labelled “ cruise missile ? ? ” but it was quickly established that it was not a military weapon .
An Alitalia pilot ’s report on the 1991 ‘ near miss ’
By July 2 the MoD had concluded that the object had not come from the Army firing ranges in the Lydd area and that there was no known “ space - related activity ” that night .
An unnamed Whitehall official wrote : “ It is our intention to treat this sighting like that of any other Unidentified Flying Object and therefore we will not be undertaking any further investigation . ”
There were , however , a number of other similar incidents recorded the same year .
The files can be accessed at www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos

All we have is the present moment .
Too often , we let our thoughts steal the present by thinking about the past or future :
As it is , I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people ’s thinking is not only repetitive and useless , but because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature , much of it is also harmful .
Observe your mind and you will find this to be true .
It causes a serious leakage of vital energy .
- Eckhart Tolle , The Power of Now
Reflect on the most enjoyable moment of your life .
Did this moment involve thinking , or were you completely focused on an activity ?
Chances are , you were completely focused on an activity .
When you become intensely conscious of the present moment , you create a gap in thinking , in which you are highly alert and aware .
Those who have meditated have experienced this enjoyable state of consciousness .
There is no off switch for your mind
Our minds are always running automatically , and we are addicted to thinking .
So how can we experience this more enjoyable state of consciousness more often , in which we are truly living in the moment ?
To do this , we must give our normal daily activities the fullest attention , so that they become an end in themselves .
For example , yesterday I was shining my shoes , which is typically a mundane activity for me .
But this time , I purposefully focused my attention completely on the activity , ensuring I did n’t miss a single spot and applying the right amount of shoe shine .
To my surprise , the activity became highly enjoyable .
It had become an end in itself , while in the past , it had been a means to an end .
Stopping your thoughts from stealing the present moment
Your past and future have no reality - your only reality is the present .
As you focus on the past or future , your present moment becomes stolen .
The more you focus in the present , the more alive and conscious you become .
When you are walking through your house or place of work , notice every step you make , every movement , and your breathing .
Focus completely on the activity without thinking .
Do this for all of your daily activities .
You will begin to feel a level of inner peace that you had never felt before .
Negative emotions come from thinking too much about the past or future
Fear , stress and worry come from too much focus on the future .
Guilt , sadness and regret come from too much focus on the past .
When your focus is on the present , you free yourself from these negative emotions .
Three tips for living in the present
1 ) Focus on your daily activities as an end in themselves , without thinking about the past or future
2 ) Do not judge yourself when you drift between living in the present and the past or future .
Do become aware of the times when you are not focused on the present
3 ) Continue practicing and choosing to focus your consciousness in the present .
You will become better at this , until focus on the present moment becomes your predominate state

BARACK OBAMA has won at least one election by a landslide .
Voters in The Economist 's Global Electoral College favoured the Democratic candidate over his Republican rival , John McCain , by more than five to one .
Some 52,000 readers around the world cast a vote , with more than 44,000 votes going to Mr Obama .
As candidates collected delegates according to the countries won ( just as America 's electoral - college system allocates delegates by state ) , Mr Obama 's victory is all the more comprehensive : he claims 9,115 delegates , compared with a paltry 203 for Mr McCain .
Various patterns became clear during the course of voting .
Candidates did best when they picked up backing from heavily populated countries with large tallies of delegates .
Mr Obama quickly scooped support from readers in China , India and most of Europe , as well as from the United States itself .
Mr Obama won the backing of an overwhelming share of voters in 56 countries — including the likes of Canada , Britain , Germany , France , Italy , Indonesia and South Korea — claiming the support of 90 % ( or more ) of those who voted .
Rich countries tended to vote earlier than poorer ones ( a reflection of where most online readers of The Economist are found ) , with African countries among the last to fall for either candidate .
Unsurprisingly , countries where internet access is limited registered fewer votes .
At least ten votes are needed within each country for its delegates to become available .
North Korea did not express a preference , although Myanmar ( Burma ) did eventually give a view — first favouring Mr McCain , but then ending in a tie ( in which case neither candidate gets the delegates ) .
Zimbabwe was late in showing narrow support for Mr Obama .
The general result may look lopsided , but judging by opinion polls carried out in various countries , for example by the BBC , Mr Obama is widely considered to be the world 's choice .
Considering the rapturous reaction that he received in Berlin , and elsewhere , when he toured the Middle East and Europe in the summer , Mr Obama ( and America ) would be right to expect more goodwill if he becomes president than that enjoyed by George Bush .
Mr McCain did garner support in some unusual places .
Andorra , Macedonia , Cuba , El Salvador and Georgia were coloured red during the earlier weeks of voting .
Nearer to the close of polls the Republican also saw Iraq , Namibia , Congo , Sudan , Algeria and a few other countries offer him support .
It may be that Cuban exiles in Florida chose to register themselves as residents of Cuba , and wanted to express their support for the Republican .
Perhaps American servicemen in Iraq were backing Mr McCain .
Some Georgians may feel that Mr McCain would be a tougher commander - in - chief than his rival , and thus would be more assertive towards Russia .
Macedonia perhaps backed Mr McCain in reaction to the hearty enthusiasm for Mr Obama in neighbouring Greece .
In the end , however , the Republican saw just four countries fall for him ( and by narrow margins ) : Iraq , Cuba , Algeria and Congo .
Readers have been keen to express views on the Global Electoral College : over 1,800 comments were posted in the course of voting .
A few American readers are unhappy that foreigners were expressing a choice , regarding it as an intrusion into domestic affairs .
Others grumbled that we offered only a choice between the two main candidates ( where was Ralph Nader , or Bob Barr ?
And where was the chance to abstain ? ) .
Others asked whether some readers are “ gaming ” the results , for example by registering as resident in a country where neither candidate has won , and then casting a vote in an effort to pick up remaining delegates .
No doubt this practice happened to some extent , but it is most unlikely that the overall result was affected .
Some supporters of Mr Obama feared that his overwhelming global popularity could backfire at home , with American voters preferring a candidate less popular with the rest of the world .
That seems unlikely .
For what it is worth , our readers in America also massively favoured the Democrat over the Republican , by 81 % to 19 % .
One thing is sure : America 's voters , however enthusiastic they prove to be on voting day , will not support Mr Obama by such a margin .
Doctor Who , the classic British time - travel adventure , marked its 45th anniversary yesterday .
It 's amazing when you realize that , if you count 1996 , the Doctor has been on television for 31 out of those 45 years .
In all that time , he 's vanquished monsters and megalomaniacs , but he 's also shattered our preconceptions over and over again .
Here 's our guide to the 45 Who moments we 'll always remember .

Note : this started as a top 10 list and sort of expanded .
It may be a little heavy on the new series , which is very good at doing memorable / cool moments .
Feel free to suggest your own awesome moments in the comments , of course !
1 ) The water Dalek from " Dalek Invasion Of Earth . "
The Daleks were amazingly cool in their first story , but it was really their second outing that sticks in our minds .
From their first appearance , gliding out of the river Thames to show that they 've conquered Earth , they literally rule , gliding around London like they own the place .
Which they do .

2 ) The Monoid statue , from " The Ark . "
This story has such a neat structure - the first two episodes are about the Doctor 's struggle to save a group of human colonists from an outbreak of the common cold .
And then he leaves in the TARDIS , only to rejoin the colonists 700 years later .
The statue the colonists were building is completed - but it has the head of an alien Monoid instead of a human , because the Monoids have conquered humanity .

It explodes into pieces , with the control console drifting through the void with a comotose Doctor laying on top of it .
8 ) People falling dead on the street , in " Doctor Who And The Silurians . "
Instead of just telling us about the Silurians ' evil scheme , the episode actually shows us , with the plague felling tons of random extras on the London streets , in a haunting and weird sequence .

9 ) The Master finally goes Satanist , in " The Daemons . "
The Doctor 's arch -rival the Master had a bunch of great moments in his early stories , but for my money the best was when he put on the big red cloak and started chanting his love for Satan .
Update : Maybe I should have chosen the bit in " Claws Of Axos " where he drops off a bridge onto a moving lorry , and hypnotizes the driver , instead .
Hmm .
10 ) The Doctor 's fear speech , in " Planet Of The Daleks . "
Imprisoned deep underground in the Dalek base , the Doctor schools a cowardly resistance fighter on the nature of courage : it 's being afraid , and doing what you have to do anyway .
And then he turns a taperecorder into an anti-Dalek weapon .
Awesome .

11 ) The Queen Spider makes the Doctor march , in " Planet Of The Spiders . "
Jon Pertwee 's Doctor never loses control , so seeing him march around in circles at the whim of the evil giant spider is actually pretty scary shit .
Advertisement
12 ) The Doctor 's cool speech , in " The Ark In Space . "
Tom Baker takes over as the Doctor , and instantly the gravitas is cranked up to 11 .
He gives a beautiful speech about the " indomitable " nature of humanity , and our ability to survive almost anything , while we go out and conquer the stars .
13 ) Davros debates the Doctor , in " Genesis Of The Daleks . "
Face to face with the creator of the Daleks , the Doctor engages him in a debate over whether scientific progress is worth genocide .
Davros ' answer ?
Hell yes .

Finally back on his own home planet , the Doctor goes inside the cybernetic Matrix ( long before Keanu did ) and confronts a virtual - reality dreamworld full of scary clowns , deadly big - game hunters and monster trains .

15 ) The Doctor screams at the Captain , in " The Pirate Planet . "
The Doctor finally discovers the secret behind the hollow planet Xanax :
The pirate captain in charge is keeping all the shrunken remains of planets in a trophy case , a brilliant achievement - but monstrous .
For once , the Doctor totally loses his cool and yells at the Captain , " What 's it all for ?
What could possibly be worth all this ? "

16 ) John Cleese appraises the TARDIS , in " City Of Death . "
The Monty Python comedian sees the Doctor 's time machine and thinks it 's a random work of modern art - which may not be that far off , really .
17 ) The table turns cob-webby , in " Warrior 's Gate " .
The Doctor is exploring the nightmarish world between our universe and the E - space universe , and he finds himself in the past , where he discovers an empire of furry slavers that used to roam the timelines , until they were enslaved in turn .
Just as the Doctor is about to be slaughtered by killer robots in the past , he 's shunted into the cob -webby present - where he 's still about to be slaughtered , this time by human slavers .

18 ) The cricketball stunt , in " Four To Doomsday . "
People are still debating whether this would work .
The Doctor is adrift in space , and his TARDIS is several yards away .
So he throws a cricket ball at a nearby spaceship and catches it on the rebound ... propelling himself to the TARDIS .
19 ) Holding off the Cybermen , in " Earthshock . "
The Cybermen are trying to break into the control room of a space freighter , and the Doctor and his poor doomed friend Adric come up with an ingenious way of keeping them out - using the ship 's matter / anti-matter containment system to solidify the door the Cybermen have just cut through .
Too bad they forgot about the back entrance .

20 ) Teleporting out of the Dead Zone , in " The Five Doctors . "
I love this bit .
Surrounded by Cybermen , the Doctor rolls the dice and grabs the teleport device from his enemy the Master .
Luckily , it beams him to the Time Lord Citadel in the nick of time , and not into a black hole .

21 ) The big speech , in " Caves Of Androzani . "
He 's dying of Spectrox poisoning , he 's in a ship about to crash , and men with guns are about to shoot him .
But he 's not going to let you stop him now .
22 ) The improvised teleportation control , in " The Twin Dilemma . "
Colin Baker has a few great moments as the Doctor , amidst some not -very - good .
In his debut story , he 's trapped with his companion Peri inside a base that 's about to explode , and the teleportation system has been sabotaged .
So he rigs a new system , using his wristwatch to compensate for the broken timing mechanism .
And then the watch stops - so he just wings it , rubbing his lapel cat for luck .
He 's cute and winsome for once , so it really works .

23 ) Hunted by Androgums , in " The Two Doctors . "
The Doctor 's injured and pushed to his limit , with a bloodthirsty alien foodie on his tail wanting to eat him .
He improvises a trap using a butterfly collector 's cyanide tins , and manages to kill his attacker .
Then he makes a very Colin Baker quip : " Your just desserts . "
Still , one of his few great edge - of - your - seat moments .
Advertisement
24 ) The sugar speech , in " Remembrance Of The Daleks . "
The first moment where we see that Sylvester McCoy 's Doctor could be more than just a bumbling clown .
He gives a lovely speech about tampering with time , and the responsibility he feels as he plays his huge chess game across time with the Daleks , all using sugar as a metaphor .
25 ) The weird zoo song , in " Ghost Light . "
Victorian gentleman Josiah is turning people into monkeys , so his niece celebrates by singing " That 's The Way To The Zoo " while wearing a dinner jacket .
Spooky and bizarre .
Advertisement
26 ) The mystery of the runes , in " Curse Of Fenric . "
There are two great moments - the first , when the Doctor realizes the 900 - year - old runes were n't there this morning .
And the second , when Ace figures out they 're a computer program .
( And the Doctor realizes Ace is a bit too clever for her own good . )
Advertisement
27 ) That final speech , in " Survival . "
With the show finally being canceled in 1989 , the final episode ends with a nice little tacked - on speech .
" There are worlds out there where the sky is burning , and the sea 's asleep , and the rivers dream ; people made of smoke and cities made of song .
Somewhere there 's danger , somewhere there 's injustice , somewhere else the tea 's getting cold .
Come on , Ace .
We 've got work to do . "

28 ) " That 's who I am , " In " Rose . "

Too bad Rose messes things up again .

31 ) Captain Jack rescues Rose , in " The Empty Child . "
She 's only in 1942 for a few minutes before she gets lifted up by a barrage balloon and winds up falling out of the sky ... but Captain Jack , in his most swashbuckling moment ever , catches her with his spaceship .
Awesome .

32 ) " Everybody lives , " in " The Doctor Dances . "
The Doctor not only figures out why people are turning into gasmask - clad child - brained zombies , he manages to reverse it and save everybody .
He 's just so bright and in this episode .
33 ) Captain Jack 's naked showdown , in " Bad Wolf . "
Where do you think he kept that gun ?
34 ) The Doctor 's defiant speech , in " Bad Wolf . "
A lovely bit of defiance and brio , as the Doctor tells the Daleks he 's going to rescue their hostage - and they 're so shocked , they do n't even think to execute her .
35 ) " It. Is. Protected ! " in " The Christmas Invasion . "
Another lovely defiant Doctor moment .
He defeats the Syccorax in single combat , despite losing a hand along the way , and then gives a great speech telling them to tell everybody about the Earth 's riches and wonders , and then tell all the nasty alien conquerors , " It. Is . Protected ! "
36 ) K - 9 finally shows his bite , in " School Reunion . "
As an old - school fan of K - 9 the tin dog , it 's great to see him finally going ballistic and shooting down tons of killer bat creatures instead of creaking along .
And then Giles from Buffy says " Bad dog , " and K - 9 says " Affirmative , " and blows him up .
Classic .
37 ) The mirror stunt , in " The Girl In The Fireplace . "
The cavalry arrives - literally , on a horse .
Through a mirror from an alien spaceship .

If the Daleks could fly ?
40 ) The TARDIS car chase , in " The Runaway Bride . "
Catherine Tate is being kidnapped by an evil Santa taxi- driving robot , so the Doctor manages to steer the TARDIS along the highway .
Just totally insane .
41 ) The DVD extra conversation , in " Blink . "
Sally Sparrow actually manages to have a two - way conversation with the DVD easter egg that the Doctor recorded in 1969 , thanks to his handy transcript .
42 ) The Master 's musical number , in " Last Of The Time Lords . "
This is possibly the greatest moment in Doctor Who history , and the episode where I finally decided to stop worrying and love the Russell T. Davies era .
The Master seranades a hyper - aged Doctor after he 's conquered the planet Earth .

43 ) Bannakaffalatta stops the angels , in " Voyage Of The Damned . "
Cyborg pride represent !
Do n't let anybody tell you you 're inferior just because you 're part machine .
You can bring down angels !

44 ) The Doctor saves his ambiguous wife , in " Forest Of The Dead . "
I had some issues with the way women were treated in this episode , including the " happy ending " River Song gets treated to .
But you can't really beat the Doctor jumping down through the entire library , with one bar left on the buffer thingie , to restore his " wife " from a saved backup before she 's gone forever .
Can you ?

45 ) London finally gets nuked , in " Turn Left . "
We finally get to see what things would be like without the Doctor and ... not that great , actually .
London gets completely pulverized , and you get an awful glimpse of the evil the Doctor is always standing in the way of .
' Stumbling on melons , as I pass , Ensnared in flowers , I fall on grass . "
This image from Andrew Marvell 's lovely poem Thoughts
In A Garden is all very well , but what if , having fallen , you can't get up ?
Which , now that I am over 90 , would certainly happen to me .
So I can't pretend that in advanced old age active gardening is something you can do .
On the other hand , the 20 years leading up to one 's 90th count as " old " to those who have n't yet reached them , and during those years quite a lot can still be done ; added to which , the garden still goes on even after one 's active gardening has stopped .
The aunt whose garden is now in my care did , in fact , push it past 90 , insisting , " I 'm all right so long as I 've got my hoe and my bucket . "
Her hoe was short , just the right height to be used as a prop to her wobbly steps , and her bucket was a little plastic pail she kept in front of her once she was on her knees doing her weeding , so she could lever herself back on to her feet by leaning on it .
Normally scrupulously honest , she did n't hesitate to promise family and friends that she would never do any gardening if alone , without for a moment intending to keep this promise ; and I know why .
If you are someone to whom getting your hands into earth means a great deal , you are not going to give it up until you absolutely have to .
I do n't know why it should mean so much , only that when , in my early 60s ( I was a late starter ) , I planted something for the first time in my life and it actually grew , I became hooked , and hooked I remained , although I do n't consider myself a proper gardener .
This is because I never did any serious propagating , just poured a lot of money into nurseries , either pottering round them or by mail order , after brooding happily over their catalogues .
Nor do I share the proper gardener 's passion for the Perfect Lawn : all I want is a green space for lying on , or to serve as an important part of the garden 's design , aesthetically speaking .
If it consists largely of moss , so what .
Though I do draw the line at buttercups .
Our lawn developed a crop of them last spring , when the mower had to spend almost a month being repaired , and one school of thought was , " Oh , how pretty - let 's keep them ! "
But I discovered enough of the proper gardener in myself to be shocked .
There are two kinds of pleasure in gardening , to my mind .
One is making a place that looks beautiful ( in your own eyes , anyway ) , which is not unlike the pleasure of painting or any other creative activity : it was n't there before , and now it is , and you made it !
That is a satisfaction that remains intense however old you are , long after other kinds of delight have ceased to be part of your life .
I often sit in the garden just looking at some part of it that turns out to be performing as well as I meant it to , or perhaps even better , and feel while doing so perfectly happy - a condition that is not common in advanced old age .
Against that there can be disasters .
This year my precious crambe , a vitally important part of one corner , failed to flower , and even worse a valuable viburnum turned up its toes and died ( it has been a year in which many sudden and mysterious plant deaths have been reported ) .
But garden disasters do leave spaces in which something new can be tried , so you recover from them quite easily - and that , too , is rare in old age .
The other pleasure is simply plants .
I can no longer remember what it felt like not to be fascinated by them , though I know that for years I just took it for granted that many flowers were beautiful and some smelled delicious , without pausing to consider that they are living creatures : that a seed , often smaller than a grain of sand , contains within it all that elaboration of roots , stems , leaves , flowers , fruit - it is full of the mystery of life , just as we are ourselves , life in a vast variety of exquisite shapes that we can handle and nurture .
There is a profound satisfaction in spreading the roots of a plant in earth , ensuring that the earth is of a kind that will suit it , feeding and watering it , watching it respond .
When I was still able to do all that , I found it such an absorbing occupation that it quite took one out of oneself , always a most refreshing and beneficial experience .
Even now , when it is beyond me to dig or heave compost on to a wheelbarrow or carry a full watering can , I still try to do a tiny bit of planting now and then - perhaps a couple of violas or a little group of crocuses - just to taste again the great pleasure of it .
And , of course , I can still choose plants and decide where they will go .
I can't afford help in the garden more than a few hours once a week , which means that it 's becoming rather shaggy , but I have been lucky in the help I have found : a sequence of three women , all of them knowledgable and vigorous , who garden not just as a job , but also because they love it .
Each in her different way has contributed more to the garden than I have , so friendships have grown here as well as plants , which has added to the pleasure .
Of course , there are people whose temperaments and abilities steer them towards occupations other than gardening , and I am prepared to grant ( though reluctantly ) that they , too , are human beings .
But they seem to me unlucky human beings , because they , too , will grow old , and growing old involves losing many happinesses .
Therefore any kind of happiness that is a hardy perennial , capable of withstanding the frosts of winter , is a very good thing to have .
And in my experience , anyway , gardening has proved to be one of those immensely valuable things .

Rarely in the modern era has a vice presidential debate been the subject of so much attention and hype .
So while you are watching the debate tonight , here are 5 things to keep you eye on while Sarah Palin and Joe Biden are mixing it up .
1 ) . Joe Six Pack –
If someone would have told me in July that Joe Biden and Sarah Palin would be the two VP candidates debating in November , I would not have believed you .
Back then , Biden was saying that he did n’t want the job , and nobody outside of Alaska knew who Palin was .
My point is that these two are not the typical running mate . , and interestingly , there has been a battle between the two campaigns to see who is more the every man / woman .
Usually this argument would go to the outsider Palin , but Biden if far from the typical U.S. Senator .
He is n’t rich or insulated , and has a compelling biography .
More importantly , Biden has been able to speak to language of working class voters .
These are the same voters that the McCain campaign was hoping that Palin would attract .
I suspect that the battle over who is more Joe Six Pack will continue tonight .

2 ) . Change vs. Change -
It is a given that the change versus experience discussion will come up tonight , but not in the way you might expect .
In her recent interview with Katie Couric , Sarah Palin brought up Biden ’s experience and said that she is the fresh faced change in this campaign .
It appears that the McCain camp wants to have both the change and experience messages .
The only problem with this strategy is that Joe Biden can , and will bring up , John McCain .
Biden will also talk about real change , and point out how Palin agrees with George W. Bush on the issues .
I have a hunch that no one will vigorously defend experience here , and both sides will be arguing for their version of change .
This an argument that that the Obama - Biden campaign is built to win , but expect Palin to try to make the argument for the Republican version of change anyway .
3 ) . Those Pesky Issues – I do n’t know if Troopergate will come up tonight , but I am certain that the candidates will be talking about the economy and the financial crisis .
Sarah Palin is going to have to answer questions about these issues .
Since she has been so weak on the issues , the McCain campaign ’s strategy might be for her to stick to the talking points , and then turn every question into an attack on the Democrats .
The problem with this approach is that people want answers , especially on the economy .
On the other side , Joe Biden is at home talking about the issues .
Many experts believed that Biden was selected for his foreign policy expertise , but he has a long history of dealing with economic issues , which has served him well on the campaign trail .
We all know that Joe Biden can handle the issues , but Sarah Palin has to show America that she is more than a campaign gimmick .
She needs to be able to answer questions without sounding like she is repeating talking points .
It would also help her if her answers actually made sense .
4 ) . Ready for the Job – Vice presidential debates do n’t change the momentum of presidential elections because voters view them as sort of a separate job interview .
While watching the debate tonight , many people will evaluating the candidates based on the question , if something happens to the president , do I feel comfortable with either of these candidates leading the country ?
In polling , Biden has consistently beat Palin on readiness to be president .
Palin absolutely must convince voters that she is ready to step in if something would happen to John McCain .
Just as Barack Obama won the first presidential debate by looking ready for the job , and more presidential than John McCain , Joe Biden can win this debate by looking like a potential president , and reassuring people that the nation would be in good hands if something were to happen to Obama .
Biden has a huge advantage here which is why no one should be surprised if his debate strategy is not to attack to attack Palin personally , but to talk about the issues , and look White House ready .
5 ) . Train Wreck TV – Let ’s face it , interest in this debate is so high because people want to see if Joe Biden is going to make the big gaffe , or if Sarah Palin is going to crash and burn .
During her month on the campaign trail , Sarah Palin has been her own worst enemy , while Joe Biden has shown a great deal of discipline , and demonstrated his ability to stay on message , and avoid long rambling off the cuff answers .
Palin might try to bait Biden into a gaffe , whereas Biden just needs to sit back and wait for Palin to make a mistake .
There is one big reason why I think Sarah Palin could implode tonight .
She has never has never been on the national stage before without a speech and teleprompter .
He debate experience consists one debate in Alaska while running for governor , where as Biden has been in dozens of national Democratic primary debates over his career .
The odds of Biden making a serious gaffe are pretty slim , but Palin has never done this before , and to add to the pressure , she is only gets one shot at this .
There is n’t a second or third vice presidential debate .
The pressure on Palin is enormous .
Her favorability ratings have plummeted .
The McCain campaign is sinking fast , and she was selected to be the bold move that carried John McCain to victory in November .
If Palin does anything that is perceived as a gaffe , or does n’t look to be up to the job , she could seal not only John McCain ’s fate , but also destroy her future as a national candidate .
Her team is behind , so Palin needs to not only stay even with Biden , but to win the debate .
All eyes will be on her to see if she can measure up .
Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Judging

Revision : 3.1
Date of Revision : 17 Oct 2009
To outsiders , INTJs may appear to project an aura of " definiteness " , of self - confidence .
This self - confidence , sometimes mistaken for simple arrogance by the less decisive , is actually of a very specific rather than a general nature ; its source lies in the specialized knowledge systems that most INTJs start building at an early age .
When it comes to their own areas of expertise -- and INTJs can have several -- they will be able to tell you almost immediately whether or not they can help you , and if so , how .
INTJs know what they know , and perhaps still more importantly , they know what they do n't know .
INTJs are perfectionists , with a seemingly endless capacity for improving upon anything that takes their interest .
What prevents them from becoming chronically bogged down in this pursuit of perfection is the pragmatism so characteristic of the type : INTJs apply ( often ruthlessly ) the criterion " Does it work ? " to everything from their own research efforts to the prevailing social norms .
This in turn produces an unusual independence of mind , freeing the INTJ from the constraints of authority , convention , or sentiment for its own sake .
INTJs are known as the " Systems Builders " of the types , perhaps in part because they possess the unusual trait combination of imagination and reliability .
Whatever system an INTJ happens to be working on is for them the equivalent of a moral cause to an INFJ ; both perfectionism and disregard for authority may come into play , as INTJs can be unsparing of both themselves and the others on the project .
Anyone considered to be " slacking , " including superiors , will lose their respect -- and will generally be made aware of this ; INTJs have also been known to take it upon themselves to implement critical decisions without consulting their supervisors or co-workers .
On the other hand , they do tend to be scrupulous and even - handed about recognizing the individual contributions that have gone into a project , and have a gift for seizing opportunities which others might not even notice .
In the broadest terms , what INTJs " do " tends to be what they " know " .
Typical INTJ career choices are in the sciences and engineering , but they can be found wherever a combination of intellect and incisiveness are required ( e.g. , law , some areas of academia ) .
INTJs can rise to management positions when they are willing to invest time in marketing their abilities as well as enhancing them , and ( whether for the sake of ambition or the desire for privacy ) many also find it useful to learn to simulate some degree of surface conformism in order to mask their inherent unconventionality .
Personal relationships , particularly romantic ones , can be the INTJ 's Achilles heel .
While they are capable of caring deeply for others ( usually a select few ) , and are willing to spend a great deal of time and effort on a relationship , the knowledge and self - confidence that make them so successful in other areas can suddenly abandon or mislead them in interpersonal situations .
This happens in part because many INTJs do not readily grasp the social rituals ; for instance , they tend to have little patience and less understanding of such things as small talk and flirtation ( which most types consider half the fun of a relationship ) .
To complicate matters , INTJs are usually extremely private people , and can often be naturally impassive as well , which makes them easy to misread and misunderstand .
Perhaps the most fundamental problem , however , is that INTJs really want people to make sense . :-)
This sometimes results in a peculiar naivete ' , paralleling that of many Fs -- only instead of expecting inexhaustible affection and empathy from a romantic relationship , the INTJ will expect inexhaustible reasonability and directness .
Probably the strongest INTJ assets in the interpersonal area are their intuitive abilities and their willingness to " work at " a relationship .
Although as Ts they do not always have the kind of natural empathy that many
Fs do , the Intuitive function can often act as a good substitute by synthesizing the probable meanings behind such things as tone of voice , turn of phrase , and facial expression .
This ability can then be honed and directed by consistent , repeated efforts to understand and support those they care about , and those relationships which ultimately do become established with an INTJ tend to be characterized by their robustness , stability , and good communications .
Functional Analysis

Introverted iNtuition
Extraverted Thinking
Introverted Feeling
Extraverted Sensing
Famous INTJs :
U.S. Presidents : Chester A. Arthur Calvin Coolidge Thomas Jefferson John F. Kennedy James K. Polk Woodrow Wilson
Fictional :
INTJs are idea people .
Anything is possible ; everything is negotiable .
Whatever the outer circumstances , INTJs are ever perceiving inner pattern - forms and using real - world materials to operationalize them .
Others may see whatand wonder why ; INTJs see whatand say " Why not ? ! "
Paradoxes , antinomies , and other contradictory phenomena aptly express these intuitors ' amusement at those whom they feel may be taking a particular view of reality too seriously .
INTJs enjoy developing unique solutions to complex problems .
Thinking in this auxiliary role is a workhorse .
Closure is the payoff for efforts expended .
Evaluation begs diagnosis ; product drives process .
As they come to light , Thinking tends , protects , affirms and directs iNtuition 's offspring , fully equipping them for fulfilling and useful lives .
A faithful pedagogue , Thinking argues not so much on its own behalf , but in defense of its charges .
And through this process these impressionable ideas take on the likeness of their master .
Feeling has a modest inner room , two doors down from the Most Imminent iNtuition .
It does n't get out much , but lends its influence on behalf of causes which are Good and Worthy and Humane .
We may catch a glimpse of it in the unspoken attitude of good will , or the gracious smile or nod .
Some question the existence of Feeling in this type , yet its unseen balance to Thinking is a cardinal dimension in the full measure of the INTJ 's soul .
Sensing serves with a good will , or not at all .
As other inferior functions , it has only a rudimentary awareness of context , amount or degree .
Thus INTJs sweat the details or , at times , omit them .
" I 've made up my mind , do n't confuse me with the facts " could well have been said by an INTJ on a mission .
Sensing 's extraverted attitude is evident in this type 's bent to savor sensations rather than to merely categorize them .
Indiscretions of indulgence are likely an expression of the unconscious vengeance of the inferior .

Severed goat head left outside Dem candidate 's office RAW STORY
Published : Monday November 3 , 2008
Print This Email This Campaign workers leaving Democratic House candidate Charlie Brown 's northern California office over the weekend were greeted by a grisly scene .
Someone left a bloody , severed goat 's head on the office 's doorstep .
" This could be the result of a Halloween prank , all the way up to something out of The Godfather , " observers David Dayen , writing at local blog Calitics .
" But the fact that it happened at the beginning of GOTV weekend is very curious . "
The head was discovered outside the campaign office around 9:30 p.m. on Friday .
Calitics has posted photos of the head here .
( WARNING : GRAPHIC IMAGES )
Police say they 're not sure whether the head was meant to target Brown specifically .
" There 's nothing in the report to indicate it was specific to that location , " Sgt. Doug Hren of the Grass Valley Police Department , told PolitickerCA .
Brown is running for the state 's 4th District House seat , which is currently held by Republican Rep. John Doolittle .
Brown ran a close race in 2006 against Doolittle , who has been caught up in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal .
Doolittle is retiring this year .
TrickleStar Says it Will Slash Your Electricity Bill by 12 Percent
November 10th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Last week we took a look at Harriet Carter ’s energy - saving outlet switch .
Now a company called TrickleStar claims it has a different solution for conserving electricity : the PC Standby Power Saver .
TrickleStar ’s device connects to your computer via USB on one end and connects to a power strip on the other end .
When the computer is turned off , the device cuts off power to peripherals plugged into the strip .
The device turns the peripherals back on when the computer is booted up .
TrickleStar says its device can slash your electric bill by as much as 12 percent , but there is no concrete evidence to back up the claim .
And many people — including myself — leave their computers in standby mode , rendering the Power Saver useless .
If you want to put TrickleStar ’s lofty claims to the test , the Power Saver will be available in January 2009 .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
President - elect Barack Obama , center , introduces his economic team , from left , Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary ; Christina Romer as Council of Economic Advisers chair ; Lawrence Summers as National Economic Council head ; and Melody Barnes as Domestic Policy Council director .
President - elect Barack Obama got high marks from the White House to Wall Street on Monday for choosing crafty economic policymakers to lead the nation through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
" Brilliant , " " outstanding " and " exceptionally talented " were some of the words used to describe his two top choices — Timothy Geithner , chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , for Treasury secretary , and former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers for National Economic Council director — and that came from Republicans .
WHO'S WHO : A look at Obama 's economic team " It 's hard for me to imagine a better team than this one , " said Pete Peterson , co-founder of the Blackstone Group , who chaired the search committee that chose Geithner for the New York Fed .
Peterson , a veteran of the Nixon administration , said Geithner , 47 , " has everything that anyone could ask for " in a Treasury chief .
Of Summers , 53 , he said , " If there 's a more brilliant economist in the United States , I would n't know who that is . "
Both Geithner and Summers were lauded by Republicans and Democrats alike as pragmatists who understand how to use the levers of government in the financial sector — something that both sides agree has become increasingly necessary as the recession worsens .
' Pragmatic ' pick
In addition to Geithner and Summers , Obama announced two other members of his economic team : Christina Romer , 49 , a University of California - Berkeley economist , as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers ; and Melody Barnes , 44 , a former counsel to Sen.
Edward Kennedy , as director of the White House Domestic Policy Council .
Taken together , experts said , the first policy team unveiled by Obama represents : • Academic smarts .
Summers is a former president of Harvard ; the others have similar academic backgrounds .
• Practicality over ideology .
Geithner is seen as a problem - solver , Peterson said .
His strength is " listening carefully to what the problem is , and then deciding on a pragmatic basis what ought to be done about it . "
• Wall Street smarts without the ties .
" You need economists who understand financial markets deeply but do n't necessarily come from financial markets , " said Jared Bernstein of the liberal Economic Policy Institute .
" Both Summers and Geithner know the books down there , but they 're not of the Street . "
House Budget Committee chairman John Spratt , D - S.C. , called Obama 's top choices " modern - day heirs of great economists like Keynes , " a reference to British economist John Maynard Keynes , who advocated government intervention to stimulate economic growth .
The question that hung over Monday 's unveiling of Obama 's economic team — the first of what will be many Cabinet - level introductions — was how much intervention they 'll recommend .
Obama was n't saying , except to say a new stimulus package is " going to be costly . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner and some other Republicans warned about new spending .
" As we proceed , we should start by listening to the American people , who do not believe increasing government spending is the best way to put our economy back on track , " he said .
Greg Valliere , chief political strategist with the Stanford Financial Group , said he understands Obama 's position that the nation has only one president at a time .
But he said " the financial markets hate uncertainty … a bit more detail would have been well - received . "
Stan Collender , managing director for Qorvis Communications , a public affairs firm in Washington , D.C. , agreed that " at least a hint of the size ( of a new stimulus package ) would have made some sense . "
But he said if Obama proposes specific figures so soon , " somebody is going to shoot them down . "
Reaction was positive from the Bush administration .
White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto called Geithner " exceptionally talented . "
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson expressed confidence in " his understanding of markets , his judgment and leadership , and his ability to meet the challenges that lie ahead . "
The team also got a major thumbs - up from Wall Street .
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 400 points Monday to 8443 , adding to a nearly 500 - point rally late Friday when word of Geithner 's nomination went public .
" Investors are looking for clarity of direction , and they are getting it with the designation of the economic leadership team , " says David Kotok , chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors .
" They like what they see , they recognize the names , and they have comfort in the choices . "
Smart people ' not enough ' While Geithner and Summers are likely to craft Obama 's stimulus package , it 's not clear who will push it through Congress .
Douglas Holtz - Eakin , former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the top economic adviser in Republican John McCain 's presidential campaign , said they bring more brains than power of persuasion .
" If he was dean of the faculty , he would have recruited an outstanding College of Arts and Sciences , " Holtz - Eakin said .
But " having bright people who have great records is not enough . "
Geithner has been intricately involved in the Bush administration 's response to the financial crisis , including its bailouts of AIG , Bear Stearns and Citigroup and its decision not to help Lehman Bros .
He also brings vast international experience and has studied Chinese and Japanese .
" Tim understands the language of today 's international markets in more ways than one , " Obama said .
Summers is a veteran of the Clinton administration and , like Geithner , a protégé of former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin .
He is viewed as an expert on the interrelationship between the public and private sectors .
" He really sees how the moving parts connect , " said Bernstein , who has advised Obama in the past .
" That 's exactly what you want if you 're president — someone who can help explain if you press here , what might happen over there . "
Several outside experts said they expect the National Economic Council , based inside the White House , to become much more of a power center under Summers than it has been in recent decades .
" It 's going to be a very , very strong position , " said Maya MacGuineas , of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget .
Sen. Judd Gregg , R - N.H. , top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , rendered perhaps the highest praise by comparing Geithner and Summers to the sluggers who once formed the heart of the order for his beloved Boston Red Sox .
" He 's basically signed up Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz , " Gregg said .
" They 're extraordinarily strong nominees . "

In his / her words On June 9 , Geithner spoke at the Economic Club of New York about the need to require banks to hold more cash in good economic times : " Inducing institutions to hold stronger cushions of capital and liquidity in periods of calm may be the best way to reduce the amplitude of financial shocks on the way up , and to contain the damage on the way down . "
In a 2003 speech to the Chicago Economic Club , Summers spoke of the importance of business ethics .
" For it is the irony of the market system that while its very success depends on harnessing the power of self - interest , its very sustainability depends upon people 's willingness to engage in acts that are not self - interested . "
In 2001 , after President Bush proposed tax cuts to stimulate the economy , Romer said , " If we are worried about short - run stability , we do n't need to mess with the tax code .
Monetary policy is perfectly capable of dealing with it . "

Michael Moore shifts focus of new film to economy RAW STORY
Published : Friday November 14 , 2008
Print This Email This Controversial documentarian Michael Moore 's changed the focus of his current film from a critical take on U.S. foreign policy to the economic crisis worsening across the globe , according to Hollywood Reporter .
Those familiar with the as yet untitled project say it will adopt an end of an empire tone that analyzes the forces and decisions leading to the Wall Street 's financial meltdown in mid-September .
But many leaders in the entertainment industry question if a film that bills itself as the follow - up to " Fahrenheit 9/11 " could keep up with the rapidly fluctuating world economy .
" I 'm not sure if people want to hear it , " said Craig Minassian , an entertainment consultant and former Bill Clinton aide .
" My sense is they already have a pretty good idea of a lot of the people who are to blame for it . "
Another problem for the movie is the changed political climate , The Guardian reported .
Moore 's success as a liberal rapping on conservative policies during a Repulican - controlled Congress and presidency may no longer work in the age of Obama , Minassian said .
" It 's going to be hard for him , " Minassian said .
" What this election shows is what 's right with America , and sometimes what Michael Moore does is highlight what 's wrong with America . "
Moore broke the record for highest - grossing non-fiction film two times , first " Bowling for Columbine , " a criticism of the movement for gun rights , and then with " Fahrenheit 9/11 , " a searing indictment of the Bush administration 's handling of the Iraq war .
" We were only bathing in four inches of water and all three of us were using the same water .
We were n't flushing the toilet unless absolutely necessary and I was putting bricks in the cistern to try and cut down the flow .
We would only do one clothes wash a week . "

IT IS about as far as you can get from the woes of Wall Street : the mucky business of digging ore out of the ground , shipping it across the oceans and turning it into steel , the feedstock of industry .
So the recent slump in raw - material prices and the decline in shipping costs indicate just how far - reaching the consequences of the global financial crisis will be for the real economy .
Since the early summer the price of steel has fallen by 20 - 70 % and the key rate for bulk shipping of commodities is down by more than four - fifths .
There are even stories of grain cargoes piling up in ports in the Americas .
Their buyers ' letters of credit have not been honoured , because of a lack of confidence in the banks that underwrite them .
At least one Australian producer has had the same problem with iron ore shipments to China .
And shipowners are having trouble raising finance for new vessels .
The most spectacular reflection of falling activity has been the Baltic Dry Index ( BDI ) , which traces prices for shipping bulk cargoes such as iron ore from producers such as Brazil and Australia to markets in America , Europe and China .
The index has plunged by 85 % after hitting a record high of 11,793 points in late May .
It is a leading indicator of international trade and , by extension , of economic activity .
In the past couple of years the index has been driven up by the boom in China , as that economy sucks in raw materials in bulk - carrying ships and pumps out finished products , which are exported in vessels .
The weakness is because of the slowing of world demand and the arrival of new capacity following the recent boom in shipbuilding .
There are also signs of slowing demand for the container ships that take China 's manufactured goods to Western markets .
The latest forecasts show growth in container demand falling from 15 % a year to barely 5 % .
Steel prices have also been falling fast from record highs .
In America the price of coil steel , used to make cars and white goods , has fallen by 20 % since May .
The price of steel billets , which are traded on the London Metal Exchange , has tumbled by 70 % since May .
Steelmakers , including ArcelorMittal , the industry leader , and Russian and Chinese firms , are moving to cut production .
Although China 's iron ore imports in the first nine months of the year were up by 22 % on 2007 , there are fears among Australian mining firms that the cuts in Chinese steel production could presage a pause in China 's boom .
Mount Gibson , an Australian producer , has given warning that stockpiles of ore are piling up in China .
Iron - ore prices on the spot market have fallen by roughly half this year , to $ 100 a tonne or less .
The prices of copper , nickel and zinc have also fallen by half or more this year , and aluminium is down by a third .
Those drops , in turn , have battered the share prices of mining companies .
BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto , two giants that are big exporters of iron ore from Australia to China , say that they will not be too badly hit by falling demand .
They do expect rivals with higher costs to rein in their output .
To some extent , that is already happening .
Ferrexpo , a Ukrainian iron - ore producer , has said it will postpone a decision about whether to expand .
Rio Tinto itself has reduced output at one Chinese aluminium mill .
Alcoa , a big American aluminium firm which reported a sharp fall in profits this month , has shut a smelter in America and says it will halve its planned investments next year .
Other firms have scrapped planned nickel and zinc mines .
Nonetheless , the bigger mining firms are far from despair .
Alberto Calderon of BHP points out that the Baltic Dry Index is extremely volatile ; in his view , it is not a good indicator of the long - term prospects of the mining industry .
He expects the Chinese economy to keep growing by 6 - 9 % a year for the next five years .
Rio Tinto is even more sanguine : it does not foresee China 's growth falling below 8 % .
Tom Albanese , its boss , says the Chinese economy is merely “ pausing for breath ” .
Both firms point out that some metals , such as copper , are still in short supply , and that the credit crunch will only make it harder to finance new mines .
By delaying expansions and squeezing marginal producers , it might actually sow the seeds for a recovery in metals prices sooner than most analysts expect .
At any rate , BHP is still keen to buy Rio Tinto — an indication , presumably , that it still thinks raw materials is a good business to be in .

A University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign assistant professor is sounding a warning that more thought needs to be put into preserving our increasingly digitized data in light light of shifting document management and other software platforms ( think WordPerfect and floppy disks ) .
Jerome P. McDonough , who teaches at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , says there are 369 exabytes worth of data , and that includes some pretty hard to replace stuff , including tax files , email and photos .
" If we can't keep today 's information alive for future generations , we will lose a lot of our culture , " , " McDonough said in a statement .
" Even over the course of 10 years , you can have a rapid enough evolution in the ways people store digital information and the programs they use to access it that file formats can fall out of date . "
While McDonough does n't have all the answers when it comes to developing a digital data preservation strategy , he says researchers , government and industry need to come up with a multi- faceted way to migrate data and old software programs to new and sustainable formats .
Open source software could play a big role in this , he says .
There has already been much debate in the software industry , as highlighted by Microsoft and the Open Document Format tussle , regarding standardization around common document types .
" Reliance on open standards is certainly a huge part , but it's not the only part , " he said .
" If we want information to survive , we really need to avoid formats that depend on a particular media type .
Commercial DVDs that employ protection schemes make it impossible for libraries to legally transfer the content to new media .
When the old media dies , the information dies with it . "
Brazil , the Netherlands and Norway are examples of countries that have already required government use of non-proprietary file formats .
Of course many organizations have at least started to think about preserving digital data , including email , in light of compliance regulations .
And they 've learned there can be a high cost to retrofitting their systems and to recovering data thought to be long lost .
An " aggressive " beer sold under the name Punk IPA faces being banned after a ruling that it would promote irresponsible drinking .
The drink and two others made by BrewDog in Fraserburgh , Hop Rocker and Rip Tide , were found to have breached marketing rules in a provisional decision by the Portman Group , a self - regulating industry body .
It decided Rip Tide 's description as a " twisted merciless stout " would be associated with antisocial behaviour , while the claim that Hop Rocker was a " nourishing foodstuff " and that " magic is still there to be extracted " implied that it would enhance physical and mental capabilities .

BrewDog , which was set up 18 months ago by two former law students , reacted angrily to the decision , saying it threatened to put the firm , which sells to Tesco , Asda , Sainsbury 's and Oddbins among others , out of business .
The company is given the chance to respond before a final ruling .
James Watt , co-founder of BrewDog with Martin Dickie , denied the advertising would encourage irresponsible behaviour .
The label on Punk IPA , the main seller of the three , says " this is an aggressive beer , we do n't care if you do n't like it " , which Mr Watt said highlighted the contrast in taste with light lagers .
" Our branding , our packaging , is a little bit edgy .
The word ' aggressive ' is used because of the biting bitterness in it .
It 's a heavily hopped beer .
It 's not something you can drink a lot of , " he said .
" We could [ change the label ] but should we be pushed into changing our approach by our competitors ?
I think what they [ the Portman Group ] are doing flies in the face of anti-competition laws . "
He said irresponsible drinking was more likely to occur as a result of strong lager produced by the major brewers being sold for a third of the price of his beer .
The Portman Group has also made a provisional ruling against Skull Splitter , a beer produced for 20 years by the Orkney Brewery and named after Thorfinn Hausakluif , the seventh Viking earl of Orkney , who had that nickname .
It was decided the phrase was associated with violence and also could be a reference to its effect on the drinker 's head .

Vice - presidential candidate Senator Joe Biden ( D - Delaware ) ran into a buzzsaw of an interview from Barbara West of WFTV - TV , Channel 9 , in Orlando , Fla on October 23 .
West is the wife of Wade West , a GOP political and media consultant , and her bias was evident as she made more than one statement of opinion , as though it were fact , then proceeded to ask a question related to that opinion / faux fact .
The exchange making the rounds most often in the blogosphere is this one :
West : “ You may recognize this famous quote : ‘ From each according to his abilities , to each according to his needs . ’
That ’s from Karl Marx .
How is Senator Obama not being a Marxist if he intends to spread the wealth around . ”
Biden : “ Are you joking ?
Is … is this a joke ? ”
West : “ No . ”
Biden : “ Is that a real question ? ”
West : “ That ’s a real question . ”
Biden , of course , being caught by surprise , could say little that would be of much use on a television screen .
He could have made the point that all taxation does , in some manner , spread wealth .
Even soldiers are paid from tax dollars and , while they earn their pay , there ’s no question that they are being paid from taxpayer ’s wealth .
Anyone being paid to serve taxpayers , from dog catchers to police , are part of a wealth spreading scheme of some sort .
What Biden should have done , had he not been blind - sided , was to make the point that all Obama is doing is adjusting the progressive income tax structure that was supported by none other than Adam Smith , the patron saint of free markets , and introduced to the US , originally , by Republican Abraham Lincoln .
Later , the progressive income tax was supported so heavily by Republican Teddy Roosevelt that the Constitution was amended to accommodate the income tax , and Roosevelt made it clear , in a speech delivered in 1910 , why he thought a progressive tax was the right way to go .
No man should receive a dollar unless that dollar has been fairly earned .
Every dollar received should represent a dollar ’s worth of service rendered , not gambling in stocks , but service rendered .
The really big fortune , the swollen fortune , by the mere fact of its size , acquires qualities which differentiate it in kind as well as in degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means .
Therefore , I believe in a graduated income tax on big fortunes , and in another tax which is far more easily collected and far more effective , a graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes , properly safeguarded against evasion , and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate .
When it comes to redistributing wealth , good ol ’ Republican Teddy was pretty clear , was n’t he ?
Maybe Teddy Roosevelt was a Marxist .
What about Republican Ronald Reagan , the modern patron saint of conservatism ?
Reagan was a big supporter of the earned income credit ( EIC ) , a distribution from wealthy taxpayers to less wealthy ones , saying it is , “ the best anti-poverty , the best pro-family , the best job creation measure to come out of Congress . ” Both Reagan and George Bush the First increased funding for the EIC .
Are they both Marxists ?
But perhaps the most effective response might have gone like something like this :
Barbara , I ’m glad you asked that question , because words like “ socialist ” and “ Marxist ” are getting tossed around by people who are afraid of losing an election , hoping that these words will sway enough votes to get them into the White House , riding on a lie .
The fact is , Barbara , that if there is a socialist or Marxist in this race — and I do n’t really believe there is — then it has to be Sarah Palin .
In Sarah Palin ’s state of Alaska , every citizen gets a check from the government every year for doing absolutely nothing .
Not for work .
Not for anything they ’ve earned .
They get that check just for breathing and living in Alaska .
Last year , that check amounted to $ 3,269 per taxpayer .
And all for nothing .
Do you know where Alaska gets that money ?
They get it mostly from the oil companies that pump oil from the state .
More than half of Alaska ’s total tax revenues come from separation taxes , which are basically taxes on oil and minerals taken from the ground .
Another 25 % or so comes from corporate taxes .
Because companies are paying so much , Alaska citizens pay no income or state sales taxes .
But they do get a check generated from the wealth those big companies generate .
And there is no other state in the Union that does n’t require either a sales or income tax from its citizens , yet gives them a check every year from money those citizens did n’t earn .
I do n’t really think Sarah Palin is a Marxist , Barbara .
I think that ’s a word made up by desperate people who will do anything to win – even tear our country apart by demonizing their opponents .
But if there is a Marxist in this race , Sarah Palin would have to be the one .
Maybe we could get Michele Bachmann to investigate Sarah for being un -American .
Russia Defense Watch : Biggest bomber test
by Martin Sieff
Washington ( UPI ) Oct 2 , 2008
Russia is moving back to hair - trigger alert testing for its strategic nuclear bombers and cruise missiles for the first time since the closing years of the Cold War .
The Russian air force announced Thursday that its Tupolev Tu-160 White Swan -- NATO designation Blackjack -- and venerable Tupolev Tu-95MS
Bear - H nuclear bombers would carry out what it described as " training flights " while equipped with " full combat payloads and live fire all cruise missiles on board for the first time in over two decades , " RIA Novosti reported Thursday .
The ambitious exercises will last seven days from Oct. 6 - 12 and will take place across Russia 's northern regions within the framework of the Stability - 2008 exercises being carried out with the former Soviet republic of Belarus , the report said .
RIA Novosti said the purpose of the exercises was to check out " strategic deployment of the armed forces , including the nuclear triad , to counter potential threats near the Russian border . "
" During these exercises , for the first time in many years , the crews of Tu-160 Blackjack and Tu-95MS Bear - H strategic bombers will fly missions carrying the maximum combat payload and fire all the cruise missiles on board , " Lt. Col.
Vladimir Drik said , according to the report .
RIA Novosti noted that the Tu - 95MS can be armed with up to six KH - 55 -- NATO designation AS - 15 Kent -- long - range cruise missiles and that the gigantic Tu-160 Blackjacks with their 99,000 pound munitions carrying capacity can be armed with as many as 12 of them .
Drik also described the scale of the maneuvers as " unprecedented . "
Tupolev Tu-22M3 strategic bombers -- NATO designation Backfire -- air superiority fighters , interceptors and aerial tankers also would be participating in the exercises , he said .
" The number and variety of aircraft involved in the drills show the wide range of tasks that will be accomplished during the weeklong exercise , " Drik said .
RIA Novosti also quoted former Russian air force commander , four - star General of the Army Pyotr Deynekin , as stating that Tu -95 Bear bombers had only carried out live firing of all their cruise missiles on one previous occasion in all their operational service , in 1984 .
" Tu - 160 bombers have never done this , because it is very expensive , " the general said .
RIA Novosti said the Russian air force currently operated 16 Tu-160 Blackjacks , 40 Tu-95MS Bears and 141 Tu-22M3 Backfires in active service .
Worker ants of the world , unite !
You have nothing to lose but your fertility .
The highly specialized worker castes in ants represent the pinnacle of social organization in the insect world .
As in any society , however , ant colonies are filled with internal strife and conflict .
So what binds them together ?
More than 150 years ago , Charles Darwin had an idea and now he 's been proven right .
Evolutionary biologists at McGill University have discovered molecular signals that can maintain social harmony in ants by putting constraints on their fertility .
Dr. Ehab Abouheif , of McGill 's Department of Biology , and post - doctoral researcher , Dr. Abderrahman Khila , have discovered how evolution has tinkered with the genes of colonizing insects like ants to keep them from fighting amongst themselves over who gets to reproduce .
" We 've discovered a really elegant developmental mechanism , which we call ' reproductive constraint , ' that challenges the classic paradigm that behaviour , such as policing , is the only way to enforce harmony and squash selfish behaviour in ant societies , " said Abouheif , McGill 's Canada Research Chair in Evolutionary Developmental Biology .
Reproductive constraint comes into play in these ant societies when evolutionary forces begin to work in a group context rather than on individuals , the researchers said .
The process can be seen in the differences between advanced ant species and their more primitive cousins .
The study was published in the Nov. 18 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Ants – organized in colonies around one or many queens surrounded by their specialized female workers – are classic examples of what are called eusocial organisms .
" More primitive , or ancestral , ants tend to have smaller colony sizes and have much higher levels of conflict over reproduction than the more advanced species , " Abouheif explained .
" That 's because the workers have a much higher reproductive capacity and there is conflict with the queen to produce offspring . "
To their surprise , Khila and Abouheif discovered that " evolution has tinkered with the molecular signals that are used by the egg to determine what 's going to be the head and what 's going to be the tail , to stop the worker ants from producing viable offspring , " Abouheif explained .
" Different species of ants have different levels of this " reproductive constraint , " and we believe those levels provide a measure of how eusocial the colony is .
The less the workers reproduce , the more coherent the group becomes . "
The existence of sterile castes of ants tormented Charles Darwin as he was formulating his Theory of Natural Selection , and he described them as the " one special difficulty , which at first appeared to me insuperable , and actually fatal to my theory . "
If adaptive evolution unfolds by differential survival of individuals , how can individuals incapable of passing on their genes possibly evolve and persist ?
Darwin proposed that in the case of ant societies natural selection applies not only to the individual , because the individual would never benefit by cutting its own reproduction , but also to the family or group .
This study supports Darwin 's prescient ideas , and provides a molecular measure of how an entire colony can be viewed as a single or " superorganism . "
A newly discovered class of galaxies could represent the awkward teenage phase of galaxy evolution , providing a bridge between the two most common types of galaxies .
Most galaxies are either blue spiral galaxies ( left column in image ) like the Milky Way or Andromeda , and red elliptical galaxies ( right column ) shaped more like a football than pinwheel .
The former are generally thought of as the rambunctious young 'uns , while the latter are more like staid old fogeys .
But now astronomers have spotted some red spiral galaxies ( middle column ) that could be the missing link between the two classes .
Because blue stars are generally younger and hotter , while red stars tend to be older and cooler , most bluish spiral galaxies are thought to be young compared to the reddish ellipticals .
Astronomers think the spirals are undergoing an active bout of star formation , with lots of newly born , blue stars giving the galaxies their hue .
The newfound red spiral galaxies , spotted by scientists from the Space Telescope A901/ 902 Galaxy Evolution Survey and the Galaxy Zoo project could represent a transition point between the two main types of galaxies .
The discovery will be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
" In order to have spiral arms , they must have been normal , blue , spiral galaxies up until fairly recently , " Steven Bamford , a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham in England , said in a press release .
" But for some reason their star formation has been stopped , and they have turned red .
Whatever caused them to stop forming stars can't have been particularly violent , or it would have destroyed the delicate spiral pattern . "
The red spirals tend to be found near locations crowded with other galaxies , and the scientists suspect their environment may play a role in slowing down star formation in these galaxies .
But more research is needed to find out exactly what shuts off this process .
A galaxy 's mass also affects how it transitions to old age .
The red spirals tend to be more massive galaxies , and the scientists suggest that smaller galaxies can't retain their spiral arms for long after star formation shuts down , and transform more quickly into smooth , lens - shaped galaxies .
To complete the changeover into full - blown ellipticals , a violent event such as a collision between galaxies is probably also needed .
" Just as a heavyweight fighter can withstand a blow that would bring a normal person to his knees , a big galaxy is more resistant to being messed around by its local environment , " said Galaxy Zoo team member Bob Nichol of England 's University of Portsmouth in a press release .
" Therefore , the red spirals that we see tend to be the larger galaxies — presumably because the smaller ones are transformed more quickly . "

Oxygen is the most abundant element on Earth , accounting for almost half the planet ’s mass .
Of its three stable isotopes , oxygen 16 ( 16O , whose nucleus contains eight neutrons ) makes up 99.762 percent of oxygen on Earth , while heavier oxygen 17 ( 17O , with nine neutrons ) accounts for just 0.038 percent , and the heaviest isotope , oxygen 18 ( 18O , with 10 neutrons ) , makes up 0.2 percent .
Yet minerals in some of the most primitive objects in the solar system , including the meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites , have quite different ratios of oxygen isotopes than on Earth ; presumably the rare heavy isotopes occurred in much greater abundances in the early solar system .
“ For a chemist , the question of oxygen - isotope ratios is one that could help us understand the origins of the solar system , ” says Musahid ( Musa ) Ahmed of Berkeley Lab ’s Chemical Sciences Division , a beamline scientist at the Chemical Dynamics beamline , 9.0.2 , at the Advanced Light Source ( ALS ) .
“ Why meteoritic oxygen isotope ratios are significantly different from those on Earth has mystified scientists for years . ”
Various models have been proposed to explain these differences , including the notion that isotope ratios in our solar system resulted from their creation in an exotic star , or in several different stars , through nuclear processes – models that Ahmed says “ do n’t work ” – or , more persuasively , that chemical processes within the solar nebula itself gave rise to the oxygen ratios .
One such process goes by the name of “ isotope self - shielding . ”
The most abundant oxygen - bearing molecule in the solar nebula was carbon monoxide , CO , and self - shielding has been considered a key to the relative amounts of oxygen that result when CO is dissociated by vacuum ultraviolet light , or VUV .
( VUV refers to wavelengths from 200 to 10 nanometers . )
Self - shielding has been observed in molecular clouds of dust and gas in outer space .
When energetic VUV light from a nearby star penetrates a molecular cloud , it breaks CO molecules into atoms of carbon and oxygen .
Different isotopes absorb VUV photons with slightly different energies , however ; near the edge of the cloud , the CO with the most abundant isotope , 16O , soaks up many of the photons that can be absorbed by 16O , thus shielding 16O deeper in the cloud .
But 17O and 18O , which absorb different energies , are not shielded .
Inside the cloud , then , relatively more CO molecules with the heavier isotopes are dissociated , and heavier oxygen atoms are released .

It ’s reasonable to expect that a similar process may have been at work in the early solar system , with the young sun radiating VUV that acted on CO in a hot region near the protosun , or perhaps in colder regions farther away .
Does VUV self - shielding really work under these conditions ?
And if so , what effect does it have on the resulting ratio of oxygen isotopes ?
Until now there were no answers ; the proposal had never been experimentally tested .
“ Mark Thiemens of the University of California at San Diego contacted us to use beamline 9.0.2 to do a direct test , ” says Ahmed .
“ The ALS provides VUV photons that can be tuned precisely to various energies that dissociate CO . ”
Cosmochemist Thiemens has investigated the question of oxygen ratios in the solar system for over thirty years ; he is a member of the science team for the Genesis spacecraft that returned samples from the solar wind .
He believes that how the solar system formed and evolved cannot be understood without understanding the cosmochemistry of oxygen .
Along with CO photodissociation in the early solar system , water is also a key player in the process .
Together they make for some intricate chemistry , which locks the heavier isotopes of oxygen into minerals that make up the oldest meteorites and subsequently formed all the other bodies of the solar system .
“ The first step is the photodissociation of CO into carbon and oxygen atoms , ” Ahmed explains .
“ The oxygen combines with a hydrogen atom to form hydroxyl , OH , a radical which quickly picks up another hydrogen atom to form water , H 2 O .
All of this is presumably mediated on a dust particle .
Thus the oxygen in the water , some models suggest , transfers its isotopic signature to silicates .
The different oxygen isotopes persist through these steps ; our experiment looked at what happens in the first step . ”
The experimenters sent ultrahigh - purity carbon monoxide through a test chamber and exposed each run to a beam of VUV photons generated in a synchrotron at four different wavelengths that were important for the self - shielding hypothesis .
Exposure time at each wavelength was long , from a little over three hours to almost 16 hours .

As the carbon and oxygen atoms dissociated , the oxygen quickly recombined with intact CO to form carbon dioxide , CO 2 , which was collected in a liquid - nitrogen - cooled vessel .
These samples were taken to UC San Diego by team member Subrata Chakraborty , a postdoc in the Thiemens group and lead author of the paper describing the research results .
Chakraborty chemically removed O 2 from the CO 2 .
He then determined the isotope ratios by mass spectrometry , which separates isotopes according to their mass .
“ The results surprised us , ” Ahmed said .
“ We set out to prove that VUV self - shielding is responsible for the ratios of oxygen isotopes characteristic of the oldest objects in the solar system , but it turned out we did n’t need self - shielding . ”
While the researchers found differences in the way the CO responded to the different wavelengths used in the experiment , these were not the differences predicted by the self - shielding hypothesis ; instead , they were due to electronic properties of the CO molecules that were unrelated to self - shielding .
Basic chemical physics alone was enough to produce the higher proportion of heavier isotopes – and the ratios themselves were still a good match for those found in samples from the early solar system .
The authors concluded that cold regions of the solar nebula were indeed a potential site for the generation of oxygen reservoirs with relatively high amounts of the heavier oxygen isotopes , “ but not via self - shielding . ”
“ You can see the ratios of the isotopes brought back by Genesis , but that does n’t tell you how they came about , ” says Ahmed .
“ The isotope ratios themselves do n’t tell you why they were different in the early universe than they are today , so there ’s lots more science to do in the laboratory .
One of the steps in the chemistry of oxygen that we want to test next is the reaction between oxygen , water and silicates , which produced the solar system ’s first rocks .
It ’s the kind of experiment that beamline 9.0.2 was designed to perform : investigate chemistry in environments like those in interstellar space and in our own earth in combustion engines and the terrestrial atmosphere . ”
The work was supported by NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy .
Wow , going to war with Russia might be necessary if Russia invades another one of the former states of the Soviet Union .
So says Sarah Palin .
War with Russia over Armenia ?
If Russia and Georgia go at it again ?
War between the US and Russia sure would be a positive development for the US .
And sort of shows the consequences of taking a freshman governor with no experience in foreign policy and giving her a ten day crash course with Randy Scheunemann and the rest of John McCain ’s neocon brain trust that got booted from the Bush inner circle for being too nutty .
Late Update : Do we all understand now why former Sen. Chafee ( R - RI ) called her a “ cocky whacko ” earlier this week ?
Palin campaign likely lied when saying she 'd reveal medical records John Byrne
Published : Monday November 3 , 2008
Print This Email This With no indication that Sen. John McCain's ( R - AZ ) presidential campaign will release Gov. Sarah Palin 's medical records -- or even a single - page summary -- Palin 's spokesmen appear to have lied when they said Palin would release details on her medical history .
Two weeks ago , Palin 's campaign told several reporters on the trail that a summary of the Alaska governor 's medical history would be made public before Election Day .
But there 's no indication that even a single coversheet will be released , according to CNN .
" Reporters were told that details on Palin 's medical background would be released early last week , " CNN reports .
" Last Thursday , after that timeframe had passed , a campaign aide backed off the previous pledge , saying the campaign wasnt sure when the information would be released . "
By most accounts , Palin appears to be in good health .
But some -- including conservative pundit Andrew Sullivan -- have raised questions about whether Palin 's decision not to release any medical data has to do with the birth of her son , Trig , at 43 .
Sullivan has documented myriad inconsistencies in the governor 's account of her son's birth .
After her water broke in her eighth month of pregnancy , while out of town to give a speech , Palin did not go to the hospital and instead called her doctor over the phone .
" I think that the majority of obstetricians , given a 44 year old with 4 previous deliveries and a known
Down syndrome pregnancy at less than term with a question of ruptured membranes , would advise her to be seen at a hospital ( especially if out - of - town and the question of traveling was on the table ) to have these tests performed ; given the malpractice risk , very few would be comfortable making the diagnosis over the phone , " said one obstetrician Sullivan quotes .
McCain , Obama and Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden ( D - DE ) have all offered some details about their medical history -- however limited .
Obama provided a letter from his personal physician saying he was in good health ; McCain offered select reporters a timed glimpse into his medical file , but has not made any part of his file public .
: fixnum .
The rest of the script is all vanilla Ruby , even down to the puts call at the bottom .
But all is not as it seems .
This is not Ruby code .
The type declaration in the method def looks natural , but it 's not actually parseable Ruby .
I had Tom Enebo hack a change in to JRuby 's parser ( off by default ) to allow that syntax .
Duby originally had a syntax something like this , so it could be parsed by any Ruby impl: def fib( a ) { a => : fixnum} ... endBut it 's obviously a lot uglier .
New Type Inference EngineIgnoring Java for a moment we can focus on the type inference happening here .
Originally Duby only worked with explicit Java types , which obviously meant it would only ever be useful as a JVM language .
The use of those types was also rather ugly , especially in cases where you just want something " Fixnum - like " .
So even though I had a working Duby compiler several months ago , I took a step back to rewrite it .
The rewrite involved two major changes : Rather than build Duby directly on top of JRuby 's AST I introduced a transformation phase , where the Ruby AST goes in and a Duby AST comes out .
This allowed me to build up a structure that more accurately represented Duby , and also has the added bonus that transformers could be built from any Ruby parse output ( like that of ruby_parser ) .
Instead of being inextricably tied to the JVM 's types and type system , I rewrote the inference engine to be type - system independent .
Basically it uses all symbolic and string - based type identifiers , and allows wiring in any number of typing plugins , passing unresolved nodes to them in turn .
Two great example plugins exist now : a Math plugin that knows how to handle mathematical and boolean operators against numeric types like : fixnum ( it knows : fixnum
The result of this is that up to the point of compilation , there 's no explicit dependency on any named set of types , any type system , or any backend .

Inference cycle 0 resolved all types , exiting There 's a lot going on here .
You can see the MathTyper and JavaTyper both getting involved here .
Since there 's no explicit Java calls it 's mostly the MathTyper doing all the heavy lifting .
The inference stage progresses as follows :
Make a first pass over all AST nodes , performing trivial inferences ( declared arguments , literals , etc ) .
Add each unresolvable node encountered to an unresolved list .
Cycle over that list repeatedly until either all nodes have resolved or the list 's contents do not change from one cycle to the next .
It 's a fairly brute - force inference mechanism , certainly not on the scale of a full Hindley - Milner inference .
Honestly I find the type declaration in the argument list to be far more helpful than harmful , though , and I 'm not smart enough to write my own H/M engine at the moment .
Include JavaAnyway , back to Duby .
Here 's a more complicated example that makes calls out to Java classes : import " System " , " java.lang .
System " def foo home = System.getProperty " java.home " System.setProperty " hello.world " , " something " hello = System.getProperty " hello.world " puts home puts helloendputs " Hello world ! " foo Here we see a few new concepts introduced .
First off , there 's an import .
Unlike in Java however , import knows nothing about Java types ; it 's simply associating a short name with a long name .
The syntax ( and even the name " import " ) is up for debate ... I just wired this in quickly so I could call Java code .
Second , we 're actually making calls that leave the known Duby universe .
System.getProperty and setProperty are calls to the Java type java.lang .
System .
Now the Java typer gets involved .
Here 's a snippit of the inference output for this code : * [ Simple ]
Method type for " getProperty " Type( string ) on Type(java.lang .
System meta ) not found . * [ Simple ]
Invoking plugin : #< Duby :: Typer:: MathTyper:0xaf17c7 >* [ Math ]
Method type for " getProperty " Type( string ) on Type( java.lang .
System meta ) not found * [ Simple ]
Invoking plugin : #< Duby :: Typer::JavaTyper:0x1eb717e >* [ Java ]
Method type for " getProperty " Type( string ) on Type( java.lang.System meta ) = Type(java.lang.String ) * [ AST ] [ Call ] resolved !
The Java typer is fairly simple at the moment .
When asked to infer the return type for a call , it takes the following path : Attempt to instantiate known Java types for the target and arguments .
It makes use of the list of " known types " in the typing engine , augmented by import statements .
If those types successfully resolve to Java types ... It uses Java reflection APIs ( through JRuby ) to look up a method of that name with those arguments on the target type .
From this method , then , we have a return type .
The return type is reduced to a symbolic name ( since again , the rest of the type inference engine knows nothing of Java types ) and we consider it a successful inference .
If the method does not exist , we temporarily fail to resolve ; it may be that additional methods are defined layer that will support this name and argument list .
So in this case , the " System " type has been associated with the " java.lang.
System " class ( the " meta " in the type reference means it's a class reference rather than an instance reference ) , and the argument type " string " resolves to " java.lang .
String " .
So java.lang.System.getProperty(java.lang.String ) resolves as returning java.lang .
String , and we have successfully resolved the call .
Next StepsI see getting the JVM backend and typer working as two major milestones .
Duby already can learn about Java types anywhere in the system and can compile calls to them .
But mostly what works right now is what you see above .
There 's no support for array types , instantiating objects , or hierarchy - aware type inference .
There 's no logic in place to define new types , static methods , or to define or access fields .
All this will come in time , and probably will move very quickly now that the basic plumbing is installed .
I 'm hoping to get a lot done on Duby this month while I take a " pseudo - vacation " from constant JRuby slavery .
I also have another exciting project on my plate : wiring JRuby into the now - functional " invokedynamic " support in John Rose 's MLVM .
So I 'll probably split my time between those .
But I 'm very interested in feedback on Duby .
This is real , and I 'm going to continue moving it forward .
I hope to be able to use this as my primary language some day soon .
Update : A few folks asked me to post performance numbers for that fib script above .
So here 's the comparison between Java and Duby for fib ( 45 ) .
Java source : public class FibJava { public static int fib( int a ) { if ( a < 2 ) { return a ; } else { return fib ( a - 1 ) + fib( a - 2 ) ; } } public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { System.out.println ( fib( 45 ) ) ; }}Java time : ➔ time java - cp .

fib1134903170real 0m12.971suser 0m12.687ssys 0m0.112sSo the performance is basically identical .
But I prefer the Duby version .
How about you ? " /> : fixnum .
The rest of the script is all vanilla Ruby , even down to the puts call at the bottom .
But all is not as it seems .
This is not Ruby code .
The type declaration in the method def looks natural , but it 's not actually parseable Ruby .
I had Tom Enebo hack a change in to JRuby 's parser ( off by default ) to allow that syntax .
Duby originally had a syntax something like this , so it could be parsed by any Ruby impl: def fib( a ) { a => : fixnum} ... endBut it 's obviously a lot uglier .
New Type Inference EngineIgnoring Java for a moment we can focus on the type inference happening here .
Originally Duby only worked with explicit Java types , which obviously meant it would only ever be useful as a JVM language .
The use of those types was also rather ugly , especially in cases where you just want something " Fixnum - like " .
So even though I had a working Duby compiler several months ago , I took a step back to rewrite it .
The rewrite involved two major changes : Rather than build Duby directly on top of JRuby 's AST I introduced a transformation phase , where the Ruby AST goes in and a Duby AST comes out .
This allowed me to build up a structure that more accurately represented Duby , and also has the added bonus that transformers could be built from any Ruby parse output ( like that of ruby_parser ) .
Instead of being inextricably tied to the JVM 's types and type system , I rewrote the inference engine to be type - system independent .
Basically it uses all symbolic and string - based type identifiers , and allows wiring in any number of typing plugins , passing unresolved nodes to them in turn .
Two great example plugins exist now : a Math plugin that knows how to handle mathematical and boolean operators against numeric types like : fixnum ( it knows : fixnum
The result of this is that up to the point of compilation , there 's no explicit dependency on any named set of types , any type system , or any backend .

Inference cycle 0 resolved all types , exiting There 's a lot going on here .
You can see the MathTyper and JavaTyper both getting involved here .
Since there 's no explicit Java calls it 's mostly the MathTyper doing all the heavy lifting .
The inference stage progresses as follows :
Make a first pass over all AST nodes , performing trivial inferences ( declared arguments , literals , etc ) .
Add each unresolvable node encountered to an unresolved list .
Cycle over that list repeatedly until either all nodes have resolved or the list 's contents do not change from one cycle to the next .
It 's a fairly brute - force inference mechanism , certainly not on the scale of a full Hindley - Milner inference .
Honestly I find the type declaration in the argument list to be far more helpful than harmful , though , and I 'm not smart enough to write my own H/M engine at the moment .

Resurrect old PCs as thin - clients
When we first started looking at thin - client computing , we bought a few Wyse terminals .
Our initial test worked out well .
The Wyse boxes were lower cost than buying new PCs , and the response was good for the applications we planned to run on the terminal server .
But the terminals run around $ 300 each .
I figured there had to be a cheaper way to do it .
Most of our workstations are still 933 and 1000 MHz Pentium III Dell machines with 256 MB of RAM .
They ’re getting a little too old and slow to handle the newer apps , like Microsoft Office 2003 along with our in - house instant messenger and intranet apps .
I started looking around for a DOS - based RDP client to use and found one .
But it was commercial software and not particularly robust .
I knew there had to be a Linux - based solution out there somewhere .
First I found Thinstation .
It works great .
You can download a prebuilt image or a Live CD .
Or you can download the whole package and customize which pieces you need .
It can run from the network ( PXE ) or installed on a hard drive .
Our initial testing with Thinstation worked very well even with only 128 MB of RAM in the PC hardware .
Once we progressed to a bigger test group though , we found that there were some drivers for newer ethernet hardware that were not included , simply because the kernel version in Thinstation was not the most recent .
As a result of bad timing , it happened that Thinstation ’s website went through some troubles and I was not able to find answers or a new release for several weeks .
During that time , I looked around for other solutions .
I found DIET - PC .
DIET - PC is not a “ run right out of the box ” type of package , but it ’s very modular and gives you the ingredients you need to “ roll your own ” thin - client distribution .
I was able to compile my own kernel with just the options and drivers I needed .
( I have been compiling Linux kernels since 0.99 , but had n’t done so in a couple of years .
Boy , is there a lot of stuff in there now ! )
Once I got the kernel just the way I wanted it , and instructed DIET - PC ’s build process to only include the software I needed , the compressed filesystem image ended up being a third of the size of Thinstation .
I was even able to download a development environment for DIET - PC to compile and include an application that was n’t included in the distribution kit .
Now , I ’m not bashing on Thinstation .
They ’ve got a new version out that includes a recent 2.6 kernel that probably has the drivers I need .
And I admit I have n’t spent too much time with their build process to see just how I can customize it .
I just happened to spend more time with DIET - PC .
And that ’s what we ’re rolling out for our next test .
From HaskellWiki
There is no call stack in Haskell .
Instead we find a pattern matching stack whose entries are essentially case expressions waiting for their scrutinee to be evaluated enough that they can match a constructor ( WHNF ) .
When GHC is evaluating a thunked expression it uses an internal stack .
This inner stack for thunk evaluation is the one that can overflow in practice .
Folds
First , read Performance / Accumulating parameter .
If you are not writing your code tail - recursively , then that is why you are getting stack overflows .
However , making code tail - recursive in a lazy language is not quite the same as in a eager language .
This page is more geared to the latter case using foldr /l as the prime culprit / example .
As such Fold may be helpful , but is n't too critical .
Also knowing what seq and ( $! ) do , as covered in Making Haskell programs faster and smaller and in the Haskell Report is necessary .
The definitions of the three folds we 'll be looking at are as follows :
foldr f z [ ] = z foldr f z ( x : xs ) = f x ( foldr f z xs ) foldl f z [ ] = z foldl f z ( x : xs ) = foldl f ( f z x ) xs foldl ' f z [ ] = z foldl ' f z ( x : xs ) = ( foldl ' f $! f z x ) xs foldl ' ( found in e . g .
Data .
List ) is just a stricter version of foldl .
The one - line summary for folds : if the binary operation is strict use foldl ' , otherwise use foldr .
Common newbie stack overflowing code :
mysum :: [ Integer ] ->
Integer mysum = foldr ( + ) 0 main = print ( mysum [ 1 .. 1000000 ] )
If you 've read Performance / Accumulating parameter , you should immediately see the problem from the definition of foldr above .
Quite simply , foldr is n't tail - recursive !
But ,
concat xss = foldr ( ++ ) [ ] xss
This is from the Haskell Report .
Surely they know what they are doing !
And sure enough ,
main = print ( length ( concat [ [ x ] | x <- [ 1 .. 1000000 ] ] ) )
works fine .
Less common newbie stack overflowing code :
mysum :: [ Integer ] ->
Integer mysum = foldl ( + ) 0 -- foldl instead of foldr this time main = print ( mysum [ 1 .. 1000000 ])
So what 's going on here ?
Looking at the code for foldl , it looks tail - recursive .
Well , much like you can see the problem with a non -tail - recursive factorial by unfolding a few iterations , let 's do the same for our foldl definition of sum , but making sure to use a call - by - name / need evaluation order .
Here is the unfolding ,
mysum [ 1 .. 10 ] -> foldl ( + ) 0 ( 1 : [ 2 .. 10 ] ) -> foldl ( + ) ( 0 + 1 ) ( 2 : [ 3 .. 10 ] ) -> foldl ( + ) ( 0 + 1 + 2 ) ( 3 : [ 4 .. 10 ] ) -> foldl ( + ) ( 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 ) ( 4 : [ 5 .. 10 ] ) -> ...
I think you get the idea .
The problem is that we are building up a chain of thunks that will evaluate the sum instead of just maintaining a running sum .
What we need to do is to force the addition before recursing .
This is exactly what foldl ' does .
Just to check ,
mysum :: [ Integer ] ->
Integer mysum = foldl ' ( + ) 0 main = print ( mysum [ 1 .. 1000000 ] )
works fine .
Now let 's go back to the foldr sum and concat .
What 's the difference between sum and concat that makes the sum definition wrong , but the concat definition right .
Again , let 's evaluate each by hand .
mysum ( + ) 0 [ 1 .. 10 ] -> foldr ( + ) 0 ( 1 : [ 2 .. 10 ] ) -> 1 + foldr ( + ) 0 ( 2 : [ 3 .. 10 ] ) -> 1 + ( 2 + foldr ( + ) 0 ( 3 : [ 4 .. 10 ] ) ) -> ...
Okay , no surprise there .
concat [ [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , ... ] -> foldr ( ++ ) [ ] ( [ 1 ] : [ [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , ... ] ) -> ( 1 :[ ] ) ++ foldr ( ++ ) [ ] [ [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , ... ] -> 1 : ( [ ] ++ foldr ( ++ ) [ ] [ [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , ... ])
Notice that there is no '-> ...' at the end .
That was the complete evaluation .
There is no reason to do anything more , unless we look at the result .
We may well GC the 1 before we look at the tail , and GC the first cons cell before we look at the second .
So , concat runs in a constant amount of stack and further can handle infinite lists ( as a note , it 's immediately obvious foldl ( ' ) can never work on infinite lists because we 'll always be in the ( :) case and that always immediately recurses ) .
The differentiator between mysum and concat is that (++ ) is not strict * in its second argument ; we do n't have to evaluate the rest of the foldr to know the beginning of concat .
In mysum , since (+ ) is strict in its second argument , we need the results of the whole foldr before we can compute the final result .
So , we arrive at the one - line summary : A function strict * in its second argument will always require linear stack space with foldr , so foldl ' should be used instead in that case .
If the function is lazy / non - strict in its second argument we should use foldr to 1 ) support infinite lists and 2 ) to allow a streaming use of the input list where only part of it needs to be in memory at a time .
Okay , both here and in the one - line summary , there is no mention of foldl .
When should foldl be used ?
The pragmatic answer is : by and far , it should n't be used .
A case where it makes a difference is if the function is conditionally strict in its first argument depending on its second , where I use conditionally strict to mean a function that is strict or not in one argument depending on another argument ( s ) .
For an example , consider a definition of ( * ) that builds up ASTs of arithmetic expressions and incorporates a simplification ( a *0 = 0 and then 0 *a = 0 ) ; then if product is defined by foldl (*) 1 , product [ ⊥ ,0 ] will terminate with 0 while a definition in terms of foldl ' would n't .
However , I can't think of a really convincing example .
In most cases , foldl ' is what you want .
* A strict function is a function f , such that f ⊥ = ⊥ .
Typically , we think of a function " being strict " in an argument as a function that " forces " its argument , but the above definition of strict should immediately suggest another function that is strict and does n't " force " it 's argument in the intuitive sense , namely id . ( [ ] ++) = id and therefore is a strict function .
Sure enough , if you were to evaluate ( concat ( repeat [ ] ) ) it would not terminate .
As such , ( ++ ) is a conditionally strict function .
This also makes the " always " slightly imprecise , a function that is strict because it just returns it 's argument , will not use up stack space ( but is , as mentioned , still an issue for infinitely long lists ) .
Weak Head Normal Form
Common newbie stack overflowing code :
myAverage = uncurry ( / ) . foldl ' ( \ ( acc , len ) x -> ( acc + x , len + 1 ) ) ( 0 , 0 )
People who understand seq and weak head normal form ( whnf ) can immediately understand what goes wrong here .
( acc+x , len+1 ) is already in whnf , so the seq ( in the definition of foldl ' ) , which reduces a value to whnf , does nothing to this .
This code will build up thunks just like the original foldl example , they 'll just be inside a tuple .
For the same reason , this wo n't help either :
myAverage = uncurry ( / ) . foldl ' ( \ ( acc , len ) x -> ( acc , len ) ` seq ` ( acc + x , len + 1 ) ) ( 0 , 0 )
A deeper `seq` is needed .
The solution is to force the components of the tuple , e.g .
myAverage = uncurry ( / ) . foldl ' ( \ ( acc , len ) x -> acc ` seq ` len ` seq ` ( acc + x , len + 1 ) ) ( 0 , 0 )
or more clearly and concisely using a recent GHC extension
myAverage = uncurry ( / ) . foldl ' ( \ ( ! acc , ! len ) x -> ( acc + x , len + 1 ) ) ( 0 , 0 )
Scans
A subtle stack - overflow surprise comes when
print ( scanl ( + ) 0 [ 1 .. 1000000 ])
completes successfully but
print ( last ( scanl ( + ) 0 [ 1 .. 1000000 ] ) )
causes a stack overflow .
The latter stack overflow is explained exactly as before , namely ,
last ( scanl ( + ) 0 [ 1 .. 5 ] ) -> ... several steps ... -> (( (( 0 + 1 ) + 2 ) + 3 ) + 4 ) + 5
This is exactly like foldl , building a deep thunk , then evaluating , needing much stack .
Most puzzling is why the former succeeds without a stack overflow .
This is caused by a combination of two factors :
thunks in the list produced by scanl enjoy sharing : late thunks build upon early thunks
enjoy sharing : late thunks build upon early thunks printing a list of numbers evaluates early thunks and then late thunks
To exemplify , here is an abridged progression .
I use this pseudo format to depict sharing of thunks
expr where var = expr , var = expr
although in reality it is more like a pointer graph .

The important thing to watch is the life cycle of intermediate thunks , e.g. , c is created at some point as a 1 - level deep addition , then almost immediately reduced to a number out of necessity , before a later thunk d builds upon it .
Therefore there is no growth and no stack overflow .
In contrast , again , last ( scanl (+ ) 0 [ 1..1000000 ] ) skips over to the last thunk right away .
Since early items are not reduced yet , the last item remains a huge chain and causes overflow .
As an addendum , there are three ways of handling this problem and similar ones :
Support for Spicebird has been discontinued .
We thank our loyal users for all the support and recommend you to migrate to Mozilla Thunderbird for a similar customizable and open experience .
Why stop further development and Support ?
Spicebird is n't as relevant as it was when the project started .
A few months after we started working on Spicebird , Mozilla Messaging emerged and development was active again .
Many features that kept Spicebird stand out started getting introduced into Thunderbird .
Thunderbird began evolving so rapidly that it was really hard for Spicebird to keep up .
Where is the source code ?
The latest source code is available for download , but it is based on a pretty old version of Thunderbird .
It will be great if you can drop us a line about how you plan to use the source code — some of us might even help you in the new project !
Is there anything else coming from here ?
There are plans to push some of the Spicebird features as Thunderbird addons

The other day I came across the paper Parallelizing Complex Scans and Reductions lying on a colleague 's desk .
The first part of the paper discussed how to make a certain family of algorithms run faster on parallel machines and the second half of the paper went on to show how , with some work , the method could be stretched to a wider class of algorithm .
What the authors seemed to miss was that the extra work really was n't necessary and the methods of the first half apply , with no change , to the second half .
But do n't take this as a criticism !
I learnt a whole new way to approach algorithm design , and the trick to making the second half easy uses methods that have become popular in more recent years .
Doing a web search I found lots of papers describing something similar to what I did .
This is also a nice example of how the notion of abstraction in computing and the notion of abstraction in mathematics are exactly the same thing .
But I 'm getting ahead of myself .
So here a direct translation from he paper of some procedural code to find the largest sum that can be made from a subsequence of a sequence .
This will be our first implementation of the problem examined in the second half of the paper : is a running sum that is reset each time it dips below zero , andkeeps track of the best sum so far .
We initialiseandwithand .
Here 's an example of how to ue it : Notice how we prime the algorithm with a starting vector .
Thecorresponds to the fact that at the start we 've summed over 0 elements and thecorresponds to the fact that we want the first sum computed to be the highest so far at that point .
Test the code with .
We 'll use a similar pattern all the way through this code .
You may see the problem with making this parallelisable : we are maintaining running sums so that the final values ofandall depend on what was computed earlier .
It 's not obvious that we can break this up into pieces .
computes sums of subsequences between resets but chopping the arrayinto pieces might split such subsequences between processors .
How can we handle this cleanly ?
The first step is to write version two of the above function usinginstead of conditionals :
But that does n't appear to make things any easier , we 've just buried the conditionals inside , it does n't make the serial dependency go away .
So let 's solve another problem instead .
InI 'll replacewith addition and addition with multiplication .is the identity for addition so we should replace it with the identity for multiplication , .
Similarly , is the identity forso we should replace that with .
We get : That 's all very well but ( 1 ) it looks no more parallelisable and ( 2 ) it 's solving the wrong problem .
Let 's ignore problem ( 2 ) for now .
The thing that makeseasier to work with is that it 's almost a linear function acting on the vector .
Linear functions have one very nice property .
If f and g are linear then we can compute f( g ( x ) ) by acting with g first , and then applying f .
But we can also compose f and g without reference to x giving us another linear function .
We only have to know how f and g act on basis elements and we can immediately compute howacts on basis elements .
This is usually expressed by writing f and g as matrices .
So let 's tweakso it 's linear in its last argument :
So now I need to write some code to work with linear functions .
I 'll do it in a very direct style .
Here are some tuples representing basis vectors .
( I could have written some fancy vector / matrix code but I do n't want to distract from the problem in hand . )
And here 's some code that computes how a function acts on a basis , in effect finding the matrix for our function with respect to the basisSome simple operations on vectors :
And now a little function that , given howacts on basis elements , can applyto any vector :
Now we can redo the calculation withby first making the matrix for , and then applying that to our starting vector .
Note how by time we 've computedwe 've done almost all of the work even though the code has n't yet touched But now comes the first bit of magic .
We can split our listinto pieces .
Compute the corresponding matrix for each piece on a separate processor , and then apply the resulting matrices to our starting vector .
Let 's chop our list of reals into pieces of sizeWe 'll use pieces of size 10 : The followings should be replaced with a parallel version .
It 's easy to do this .
Great , we 've successfully parallelised the code , but it 's the wrong algorithm .
How can we use this to solve the correct problem ?
Remember how we replacedwith addition and addition with multiplication .
We just have to undo that .
That 's all !
Everything required to prove that the above parallelisation is valid applies over any semiring .
At no point did we divide or subtract , and we only used elementary properties of numbers like a *( b+ c ) = a *b +a*c .
That property holds forand addition .
In fact a + max ( b , c ) = max ( a+b , a+c ) .
We do n't even have to modify the code .
We can just define the max - plus semiring as follows :
And now all we need is ( I wonder if ghc is smart enough to completely eliminate that , after all , on a newtype , should do zero work . )
And that 's a completely parallelised version of the original algorithm .
There is a ton of optimisation that can be performed here .
In particular , applies a function to a fixed basis .
For the particular function we 're using here there 's a big win from constant folding .
The same constant folding applies in any semiring .
And back to the point I made at the beginning .
By abstracting from the reals to a general semiring we are able to make the same code perform multiple duties : it can work on functions linear over many semirings , not just the reals .
Mathematicians do n't work with abstractions just to make life hell for students - they do so because working with abstract entities allows the same words to be reused in a valid way in many different contexts .
This benefits both mathematicians and computer scientists .
Here 's a link you can use to find out more on this technique .
Note that in real world usage you would n't use lists .
-| chop| - would take longer than the rest of the algorithm .
PS A curious aside .
I spent ages trying to get ghc to compile this code and getting my homebrew HTML markup code to work reliably on it .
But eventually I located the problem .
I 've just returned from Hawai`i where I wrote most of this code .
Just for fun I 'd put my keyboard into Hawai`ian mode and forgot about it .
When I did that , the single quote key started generating the unicode symbol for the Hawai`ian glottal stop .
It looks just like a regular single quote in my current terminal font so it was hard to see anything wrong with the code .
But , quite reasonably , ghc and many other tools barf if you try to use one where a regular quote is expected .

Almost 100 million people in south - west China will lose the land they live on within 35 years if soil erosion continues at its current rate , a nationwide survey has found .
Crops and water supplies are suffering serious damage as earth is washed and blown away across a third of the country , according to the largest study for 60 years .
Harvests in the north - east , known as China 's breadbasket , will fall 40 % within half a century on current trends , even as the 1.3 billion population continues to grow .
While experts said farming and forestry were the main causes of the problem in more than a third of the area affected , the research team said erosion was damaging industrial areas and cities as well as remote rural land .
About 4.5 bn tonnes of soil are scoured away each year , at an estimated cost of 200bn yuan ( £ 20 bn ) in this decade alone .
The poor will be worst hit , warns the report from China 's bio-environment security research team , with almost three - quarters living in erosion - hit areas .
The country 's 80,000 reservoirs are also affected , with sand and mud reducing their storage capacity each year .
Like soil deposits along rivers , that increases the risk of flooding .
" If we do n't conduct effective measures , erosion will cause major damage to social and economic development , " Chen Lei , director of the ministry of water resources , told the official People 's Daily .
Professor Mu Xingming of the Institute of Soil and Water Conservation told the Guardian that overpopulation was largely to blame .
Chandler librarians say they routinely find oddities between the pages of returned books : from cash and lottery tickets to love letters .
And patrons rarely come back to claim the stuff .
One of the most common - and unpleasant - discoveries is toilet paper , said Marj Pals , a library aide at the Sunset Branch Library .
Pals keeps a collection of creative and unusual " bookmarks " on display behind her desk in case people want them back .
Her wall is covered with greeting cards , personal letters , travel mementos , board game pieces , doilies , playing cards and one recent addition : a list of " karma violations . "
She also has found combs , deflated balloons and origami creations .
Most of the cash discoveries are just a dollar or two , but several years ago Pals found an envelope containing a $ 10,000 check .
When she could n't trace the name of the recipient in library records , she returned it to the check writer .
That person , whom Pals would not identify , sent a thank - you card in which he explained the money was sent to his son for a down payment on a house .
Another odd one was the envelope marked " happy happy " stuffed in a book 's spine ; it contained muscle relaxant pills , she said .
Chandler Librarian
Sue Hoffman is surprised so few people come back to claim personal mementos found in the books .
Photographs , letters , elaborate bookmarks and unpaid utility bills are retained for a while but rarely claimed , she said .
With more than 2.3 million items checked out of the city 's libraries every year , rarely a day goes by that an extra item is n't found in a library book , Hoffman said .
And it 's likely many more of them are n't discovered by the staff before books are returned to the shelves , she said .
" We see all kinds of things in the book drop boxes , too , " Hoffman said .
" Sometimes people tape money for fines on the books .
We find cellphones and utility bill payments .
If they have stamps on them , we drop them in the mail , and sometimes we have even put stamps on them . "
Library collections are n't the only books that come in with extras .
Suzanne Kinsinger , operations manager for Friends of the Library , said some donated books for public sales have been stuffed with personal letters and even spoiled food .
Daily Show mocks Scarborough with profane tirade David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster

There was little doubt , after Joe Scarborough 's most recent slip of the tongue , that the morning host would make anything but fresh meat for Daily Show writers .
In a Wednesday segment , Jon Stewart used Scarborough 's accidental f- bomb to highlight a debate among supreme court justices as to whether " fleeting expletives " on television can draw an FCC fine .
Drawing on the obvious disparity in definition of " fleeting expletives , " Stewart attempted to illustrate how it differs from an expletive of a more ... brazen variety .
" These are good , decent , steady men that do n't go around flipping people off or screaming fuck you at the top of their lungs , " said Scarborough in a clip from MSNBC's Morning Joe .
" ... He really did say the word at 8 in the morning , " said Stewart .
" And personally , I was angry .
I was watching with my son and then he was all like , ' Dad , can we just turn on fucking Star Wars already ? ' "
Moving on to the court 's deliberations , Stewart focused on an excerpt from Chief Justice Roberts , who said : " It 's one thing to use the word in , say , ' Saving Private Ryan ' , when your arm gets blown off .
It 's another thing to do it when you 're standing up at an awards ceremony . "
" Which is a good point , chief , " suggested Stewart .
" Which leads to a better question ...
What if your arm gets blown off at an awards ceremony , and then ...
It could happen ...
That 's , ohh ... "
The host also noted Justice Scalia 's take on the matter : " Bawdy jokes are okay if they are really good . "
" You devil !
I actually have a great one , " said Stewart .
" A nobleman went to purchase a pig on St. Stevens day , and then the pig monger quoth , ' Seek ye a sow or a hog ? '
Quoth the nobleman , ' Which be the better for fucking ? ' "
Sadly , lamented Stewart , the court will not be releasing footage of the deliberations on vulgarity .
Naturally , the Daily Show had acquired an exclusive audio tape of the proceedings .

RE : SEC Civil Action in the United States District
for the Northern District of Texas , Dallas Division
Mark Cuban today responded to a civil complaint filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States District for the Northern District of Texas , Dallas Division .
In its complaint , the Commission charges that Mr. Cuban engaged in violations of the federal securities laws in connection with transactions in the securities of Mamma.com Inc .
This matter , which has been pending before the Commission for nearly two years , has no merit and is a product of gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion .
Mr. Cuban intends to contest the allegations and to demonstrate that the Commission ’s claims are infected by the misconduct of the staff of its Enforcement Division .
Mr. Cuban stated , “ I am disappointed that the Commission chose to bring this case based upon its Enforcement staff ’s win- at - any - cost ambitions .
The staff ’s process was result - oriented , facts be damned .
The government ’s claims are false and they will be proven to be so . ”

Award season is upon us onceagain ; that time of year when the film industry congratulates itself on a job well done .
The Golden Globes kick off events every January followed , a month later , by the Oscars .
The speculation has already begun .
Some critics think Angelina Jolie will take home one of the highly coveted golden statutes for her performance in Changeling .
Others think Anne Hathaway deserving ( Rachel Getting Married ) .
While both women no doubt wait anxiously to find out whether their pay cheques will double overnight or not ( well , actually winning an Oscar will probably quadruple their fees ) , spare a thought for Ross and Hugo .
The canine stars of The Duchess ( human costars include Ralph Fiennes and Keira Knightley ) will spend the next week nervously wagging ( sorry , wondering ) whether their emotionally nuanced performance as 18th - century English pointerhounds is enough to earn them the supreme champion award , Best in World , at the second international Fido Awards in London on Sunday .
The Fidos – For Incredible Dogs on Screen – are dedicated to celebrating the finest cinematic contributions by a canine .
The event is the brainwave of journalist Toby Rose , who organises the prestigious Palm Dog Award at the Cannes Film Festival , now in its eighth year .
" The inspiration for the Palm Dog was Mutt , my wonderful fox terrier who charmed the stars over the years when I went interviewing .
He had true star quality , " says Rose .
" The Fidos were the natural successor to the Palm Dog , " he adds .
" The Palm Dog is restricted to films screened during the frantic two weeks of Cannes .
The Fidos allow for a wider net to be cast . "

Indeed .
No longer will heart - wrenching performances by canines in films such as Legally Blonde or Men in Black II , ( when Frank is transformed into a dog and sings " I Will Survive " ) , go unrecognised or unrewarded .
This year 's Fidos have a lot to live up to , however .
Last year 's inaugural event set an impossibly high benchmark when the top gong was awarded to the ensemble performance by the corgis in Stephen Frears 's The Queen .
The judges chewed over their decision for quite some time , but in the end it was unanimous : the petite pups ' performance was understated , daring but also incredibly moving .
Dame Helen Mirren – clearly too overwhelmed to attend in person – sent a personal message of congratulations .
She told a newspaper at the time , " The corgis were not film - trained .
I had to work with them to follow me .
But I am good with dogs and know how to get them to do what I want .
I loved those corgis because they were funny .
I can understand why the Queen has them .
Forget winning an Oscar , I 'd be more proud of an award for dog- handling . "
This year 's nominees are no less impressive .
Fifteen films will compete in the following five categories : Historical Hound , RomCom Rover , Comedy Canine , Blockbuster Bowser and Mutt Moment .
The Best In World award will be given to the best dog across all categories .
" The year , we added Mutt Moment for a standout scene from a film which makes a big - screen difference , " explains Rose .
" It also carries the name of Mutt [ his beloved pooch ] , who died this year on 17 April . "
Camilla Rutherford ( Gosford Park ) , one of this year 's presenters says , " I will be very happy to hand out the prize for Historical Hound .
And for once at an awards ceremony the reaction will be 100 per cent genuine – probably a slobbery lick . "
Gill Raddings , animal coordinator on The Duchess , was " absolutely delighted " when she found out that her dogs were up for an award .
Raddings 's company , Stunt Dogs & Animals , represents cats , pigs , geese , cockroaches and even maggots .
She 's wrangled animals on 101 Dalmatians , Atonementand Cold Mountain , and says that any accolades the animals receive are well deserved .
" They 've been overlooked for far too long , " she says .
Oscar - winning director Barry Levinson 's latest film , What Just Happened , is among films vying for Mutt Moment award .
" The dog 's role is important in our film , " he says .
" We needed a substantial dog , a smart dog .
One who'd lie there at the end after the trauma of being shot .
Our dog was a mixed breed .
I have worked with many dogs who are a nightmare , but this dog was extraordinary .
Sean Penn loved the dog – he was a pleasure to work with . "
The second annual Fido Awards take place on Sunday .

What Just Happened ? : Sean Penn and a white hound caught
Marine Cpl. James
Dixon was wounded twice in Iraq -- by a roadside bomb and a land mine .
He suffered a traumatic brain injury , a concussion , a dislocated hip and hearing loss .
He was diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
Army Sgt. Lori Meshell shattered a hip and crushed her back and knees while diving for cover during a mortar attack in Iraq .
She has undergone a hip replacement and knee reconstruction and needs at least three more surgeries .
In each case , the Pentagon ruled that their disabilities were not combat - related .
In a little - noticed regulation change in March , the military ’s definition of combat - related disabilities was narrowed , costing some injured veterans thousands of dollars in lost benefits -- and triggering outrage from veterans ’ advocacy groups .
Advertisement
The Pentagon said the change was consistent with Congress ’ intent when it passed a “ wounded warrior ” law in January .
Narrowing the combat - related definition was necessary to preserve the “ special distinction for those who incur disabilities while participating in the risk of combat , in contrast with those injured otherwise , ” William J. Carr , deputy undersecretary of Defense , wrote in a letter to the 1.3 - million - member Disabled American Veterans .
The group , which has called the policy revision a “ shocking level of disrespect for those who stood in harm ’s way , ” is lobbying to have the change rescinded .
Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said the Pentagon ’s “ more conservative definition ” limited benefits for some veterans .
“ That was not our intent , ” Levin said in a statement .
He added : “ When the disability is the same , the impact on the service member should be the same no matter whether the disability was incurred while training for combat at Ft. Hood or participating in actual combat in Iraq or Afghanistan . ”

Pentagon officials argue that benefits should be greater for veterans wounded in combat than for “ members with disabilities incurred in other situations ( e.g. , simulation of war , instrumentality of war , or participation in hazardous duties , not related to combat ) , ” Carr wrote .
But veterans like Dixon and Meshell said their disabilities were a direct result of wounds suffered in combat .
Dixon said he was denied at least $ 16,000 in benefits before he fought the Pentagon and won a reversal of his noncombat - related designation .
“ I was blown up twice in Iraq , and my injuries were n’t combat - related ? ” Dixon said .
“ It ’s the most imbecile thing I ’ve ever seen . ”

Meshell , who is appealing her status , estimates she is losing at least $ 1,200 a month in benefits .
Despite being injured in a combat zone during an enemy mortar attack , she said , her wounds would be considered combat - related only if she had been struck by shrapnel .
Meshell said the military had suggested that at least some of her disability was caused by preexisting joint deterioration .
“ Before I went over there , I was fine -- I was perfectly healthy , ” Meshell said .
“ This whole thing is causing me a lot of heartache . ”
Kerry Baker , associate legislative director of Disabled American Veterans , has accused the Pentagon of narrowing the definition of combat - related disabilities to save money .
He said the change would reduce payments for tens of thousands of veterans -- those already wounded and those injured in the future .
“ This is going to hurt a lot of people , ” Baker said .
“ It ’s one of those things that when you first look at it , you think : ‘ Wow .
How can this be ? ’ ”

In a letter to members of Congress , the Disabled American Veterans accused the Pentagon of “ mutilating ” the statutory definitions of combat - related disabilities as part of a “ deliberate manipulation of the law . ”
The January legislation was aimed at allowing troops wounded in combat and combat - related operations to collect disability severance from the military and disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs .
Disability severance is based on past service .
Disability compensation is based on future loss of earning potential .
Previously , veterans with combat - related disabilities received reduced monthly VA compensation until their severance money was recouped .
That is still the case for those whose injuries are not deemed combat - related .
Years ago , Congress adopted a detailed definition of combat - related disabilities .
It included such criteria as hazardous service , conditions simulating war and disability caused by an “ instrumentality of war . ”
Those criteria were not altered in the January legislation .
Advertisement
The Pentagon , in establishing an internal policy based on the legislation , in March unlawfully stripped those criteria from the legislation , the Disabled American Veterans said .
“ We do not view this as an oversight , ” Baker testified before Congress in June .
“ We view this as an intentional effort to conserve monetary resources at the expense of disabled veterans . ”
The Pentagon changes focused on “ tip of the spear ” fighters , or those “ in the line of duty in a combat zone , ” said Eileen Lainez , a Pentagon spokeswoman .
They comprise “ a very special , yet limited , subset of those who matriculate through the Disability Evaluation System , ” Lainez wrote in an e-mail response to a request for comment .
In many cases , veterans say , they are not told why their disabilities are not considered combat - related .

Dixon said he did not realize he had been put in a noncombat - related category until he began questioning his disability payments .
It took more than six months of phone calls , letters and appeals -- plus help from the Disabled American Veterans and a member of Congress -- to overturn his designation .
Navigating the Pentagon ’s bureaucracy was made more difficult because Dixon ’s brain injury resulted in short - term memory loss .
He had to write everything down in notebooks and calendars .
“ It was a nightmare , ” Dixon said .
“ Most veterans do n’t know how the system works , or how to fight it .
They do n’t realize all the obstacles they put in your way to keep you from getting what you deserve . ”
Meshell said the military disability system was so complex that few veterans were equipped to navigate it .

“ I ’m a college graduate .
I ’m not a dumb person .
But honestly , I ca n’t begin to explain some of this stuff , ” she said .
After five years of active duty , a combat tour in Iraq and 12 years in the National Guard and Reserves , she thinks she deserves the full disability benefits authorized by Congress for veterans injured in combat .
“ I earned them , ” she said .
“ I went to Iraq .
I was in combat .
I got injured . ”

The Great Depression was the worst economic downturn to grip the country , starting in late October 1929 and lasting for more than a decade .
After the stock market crashed , Chicagoans dealt with vast unemployment , food shortages and rampant homelessness .
Cambodia 's decision to ask for Unesco status sparked tensions
Cambodia has again warned Thailand against crossing a disputed border , saying such a provocation could lead to " large - scale conflict " .
Foreign Minister Hor Namhong accused
Thai troops of trying to cross into Cambodia near an ancient temple , the scene of a recent military clash .
Both countries claim they own the area around the Preah Vihear temple .
Hor Namhong made the comments after talks with his Thai counterpart Sompong Amornviwat failed to reach a deal .
Temple tensions
The standoff between the two countries centres on 1.8 square miles ( 4.6 sq km ) of scrub near the 900 - year - old Preah Vihear temple , which sits on a jungle - clad escarpment dividing the countries .
An international court awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962 , but land surrounding it remains the subject of rival territorial claims .
The decision by the UN in June to list Preah Vihear as a Unesco World Heritage Site reignited lingering nationalist tensions over the issue .
In early July Cambodian troops detained three Thai protesters who had entered the site illegally , sparking the military stand - off .
The two sides have already held several rounds of talks on the issue , but failed to reach agreement .
Nov. 21 , 2008  --
A Florida teenager who used a webcam to live - stream his suicide Wednesday was reportedly encouraged by other people on the Web site , authorities told ABCNews.com .
" People were egging him on and saying things like ' go ahead and do it , faggot , ' said Wendy Crane , an investigator at the Broward County Medical Examiner 's office .
Abraham Biggs , 19 , of Pembroke Pines , Fla. , had been blogging on an online body - building message board and had linked to his page on Justin.tv , a live video streaming Web site , where the camera rolled as he overdosed on prescription pills , according to Crane .
Biggs , who had reportedly been discussing his suicide on the forums , also posted a suicide note on a body - building forum , which has since been taken down , in which he wrote , " I hate myself and I hate living . "
" I have let everyone down and I feel as though I will never change or never improve , " Biggs wrote in the posting .
" I am in love with a girl and I know that I am not good enough for her .
I have come to believe that my life has all been meaningless .
I keep trying and I keep failing .
I have thought about and attempted suicide many times in the past . "
The video and blog postings have since been removed from the sites , but Crane , who has seen both , said that at first viewers thought the suicide was a hoax .
" The bloggers said that Biggs had threatened to kill himself before and had faked it , so at first they did n't believe him , " said Crane .
" Gradually , as you read the blog further into the day the bloggers start commenting on how Biggs is n't moving . "
Crane said comments on the thread included an exchange about whether the image of Biggs ' motionless body was a still photograph or a video , and eventually resulted in one of the site 's visitors calling the police , who tracked down the teen through his computer IP address .
According to Wired magazine , online viewers watching the video ranged from " OMG " -- Internet slang for oh my god -- and LOL -- an abbreviation for laughing out loud .
Blog Posts
On a blog where Biggs wrote about his suicidal thoughts , which has since been removed , commenters wrote , " hahaha hahahahha hahahahahah ahhaha . "
Wired reported that someone else wrote : " Instant Darwinism ... " to which a fellow commenter wrote : " f** king a nicely put . "
Others called the teen a " coward , " " faggot " and a " dick . "
In the Web stream , Crane said viewers saw a piece of a door frame -- which had splintered from the police kicking in the teen 's bedroom door -- hit Biggs , who is curled up on his bed and facing away from the camera .
" Then you see a police officer go in and check on him , and then the EMS pronounced him dead , " said Crane .
Biggs was pronounced dead at 3:30 p.m. Nov. 19 -- about 12 hours after he had begun blogging about his suicide .
The official cause of death was suicide combined with drug toxicity .
Crane said that benzodiazepines and opiates were found near the body , but a blood toxicology to quantify just how much Biggs consumed is still under way .
Crane said that at least one of the prescription drugs was in Biggs ' name .
Michael Seibel , the CEO of Justin.tv , posted a blog entry on the site titled " A Moment of Silence . "
" Justin.tv staff would like to take a moment to recognize and reflect upon the tragedy that occurred within our community today , " wrote Seibel .
" We respect the privacy of the broadcaster and his family during this challenging time . "
Reached by telephone , Biggs ' father , Abraham Biggs Sr. , told ABCNews.com that he was shocked to learn of his son's death .
" He was a good kid .
Everyone knows him , " said Biggs .
" We live together and everything was fine -- I 'm so surprised . "
Biggs ' father was not home at the time of his son's suicide , and the father told ABCNews.com that he was not aware that his son used Justin.tv .
Biggs had struggled with depression , according to his father , and had been prescribed medication for bipolar disorder .
Benzodiazepine is commonly prescribed as a sleep aid or an anti-anxiety medication .
Even so , Biggs had been " doing better , " according to his father and had been attending daily classes at Broward College , where he was pursing a career as a paramedic .
Internet Provides Outlet to Suffer in Public
" I am upset that Justin.tv streamed this live , " said Biggs .
" I have not seen it , and I do not intend to look at it .
" There seems to be a lack of control as to what people put out on the Internet , " he said .
" There 's a lot of garbage out there that should not be , and unfortunately , this was allowed to happen . "
David Griner , a social media strategist for Luckie & Company , said that while public deaths are not new , online chatrooms provide an especially accessible forum for those debating suicide .
" The social Web tends to create a sideshow atmosphere , like public executions in the 1700s , " said Griner .
" The anonymity and lack of personal connection bring out the worst in people . "
Griner points out that there have been several other online suicides , and some have been faked as well .
In February 2008 a girl who identified herself only as " 90 Day Jane " wrote an anonymous blog chronicling the days leading up to her death .
The blog turned out to be a hoax , and " Jane " later described it as an " art project . "
The United Kingdom had an online suicide in March 2007 , when 42 - year - old Kevin Whitrick hanged himself while others watched .
According to the BBC , some onlookers tried to stop him while others urged him on .
" The explosion of high - speed Internet access in the past few years has made it so that almost anyone can broadcast a live video in front of a global audience , " said Griner .
" It 's impossible for sites like Justin.tv to monitor everything that 's going on , so that puts the burden on the community to help stop bad things from happening . "
Griner believes that those who encourage suicidal people are simply a sad reality of an unrestricted World Wide Web .
Even so , some potential suicides are prevented on the Internet as well .
" You 'll always have the morbid jerks who yell ' Jump ! ' when someone 's on a rooftop , and you 'll always have people threatening suicide in a public venue , " said Griner .
" And while it 's easy to focus on the abundance of bloodthirsty trolls online , the bright side is that the Internet also gives more decent people the opportunity to intervene and try to save a life . "
" Most times , they just need someone to talk to , and the Internet is the only forum they have . "
Jon Huntsman , the Republican governor of the ruby - red state of Utah , stopped by Politico HQ this afternoon with some tough criticism of his own party .
Huntsman is in Washington this week in his role as chairman of the Western Governors ' Association to promote the group ’s bipartisan energy policy .
Huntsman and the WGA ’s vice - chairman , Montana governor Brian Schweitzer ( D ) , are discussing their proposal with President - elect Obama 's transition team tomorrow .
Huntsman has been one of the leading Republican voices on dealing with climate change , and he was blunt in criticizing elements of his party for ignoring the impact of global warming .
“ If we ’re going to survive as a party , we need to focus on the environment , ” Huntsman said .
“ There ’s a fundamental tone deafness with our party when it comes to the environment .
...
The last place we can be as a party is be viewed as the anti-science party .
That ’s not a model for the future . ”
Huntsman said that there ’s some resistance in Utah from elements of the party base on his environmental views , but said Western conservatives also “ feel deeply about the land and the legacy they ’re leaving behind . ”
“ When you put it in words they understand like clean air , pristine lands , and pure water , they get it , ” Huntsman said .
He also was critical of the Bush administration ’s foreign policy , and advocated for a more multilateral approach .
He attributed the Republicans ’ recent political struggles to the lack of an “ organizing principle ” to drive voters to the party — something the Cold War accomplished for decades .
And he argued the war on terror can’t fill that role .
“ The war on terror ca n’t be the organizing principle of the Republican party , ” he said .
Huntsman , who has shown an interest in national politics , said that the future of the Republican party will come from the governorships , but declined to promote any specific names .
He punted when asked if he was interested in running for president in 2012 , saying he was more interested in promoting ideas over names .
“ New ideas will emerge , and then the names will follow , ” Huntsman said .
On Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , Huntsman only said that “ she ’ll be in the mix ” in 2012 , adding that she will have appeal to some social conservatives .
Huntsman was easily reelected as Utah ’s governor this year , winning 78 percent of the vote in his heavily Republican state .

This albino grave was sealed to stop people digging up the body
Police in southwestern Tanzania say they have arrested a man accused of attempting to sell his albino wife .
The man was allegedly planning to sell his wife to two Congolese businessmen for around $ 3,000 .
Albinos have been living in fear in Tanzania after a series of killings due to a belief their body parts can make magic potions more effective .
At least 27 people with albinism have been killed since March , including a seven - month old baby .
President Jakaya Kikwete ordered a police crackdown on those involved in the killings , and 170 witchdoctors have since been arrested .
But BBC investigations suggest that some police are being " bought off " in order to look away when such crimes are committed .
Angry parents
Rukwa regional police commander Isunto Damian Mantage said the fisherman was arrested following a tip - off from an informer , according to the Daily News newspaper .
His wife was not aware that he was planning to sell her off , police say .
Mr Mantage says the wife 's angry parents have decided to take back their daughter .
The businessmen managed to escape arrest , and are suspected to have fled back to the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The police have asked Interpol to help track them down , the newspaper reported .
The recent attacks on albinos have been linked to witchdoctors who are peddling the belief that potions made from an albino 's legs , hair , hands , and blood can make a person rich .
Albinism affects one in 20,000 people worldwide , but in Tanzania the prevalence appears to be much higher .
The Albino Association of Tanzania says that although just 4,000 albinos are officially registered in the country , they believe the actual number could be as high as 173,000 .
A census is now underway to verify the figures .

This week we had the opportunity to check out Ryan 's Bistro before their official opening on November 24th .
Ryan 's Bistro is a new restaurant that has quickly taken the spot of the former OMai Vietnamese Restaurant .
The Ryan in question is Ryan Gish of Prestige World Class .
A couple of days after our meal , I called Ryan to ask him about the opening and how things were looking .
In our conversation , he stated that things were running well and he considers the place officially open , with the exception ofwhen they 'll be closed for the day .
He said the feedback so far has been " extremely positive " , noting that people have really enjoyed the atmosphere which he described as comfortable and cozy .
I have to admit , the place looks far different than the previous three restaurants that occupied that location .
As for the food , there is a good mix of selection with some small twists to peak your interest level .
Since this is a preview , not a review of Ryan 's Bistro , I 'm not really going to critique our meal there .
For the most part , I 'll let the pictures speak for themselves .
I will let you know , however , that we 'll be back .
That said , we did have some serious service issues , but those can easily be resolved ; Dario's Brasserie is proof of that .
When I brought those issues to Ryan 's attention in our phone call , he mentioned that several parties RSVP 'ed at the last minute which left them short staffed and it was their first night serving large parties .
Like I said , something that is easily resolved .
Just be aware that they may not have all the kinks worked out right away .
If you do go , be sure to let us know your thoughts
If you 'd like to be on their mailing list , you can do so on their website .

Today , we ’re going on a journey .
It is a sojourn to the outer limits of the expressiveness of the Java type system , and to the edge of what can be considered sane programming .
This is definitely one for the power users .
You will need a firm grasp of the Java language , and an iron constitution for type annotations .
But the reward will be something far greater than any treasure : understanding , entertainment , and perhaps even enlightenment .
Remember that we choose to do these things in Java , not because they are easy , but because they are hard .
Now then , to the ships .
A Most Versatile Vessel
In Java , we can create a list that contains values of type A , by constructing a value of type List < A > .
The type system will enforce that each element in the list is in fact of type A .
But sometimes we want lists of values that are n’t necessarily of the same type .
Normally , for such a purpose , we would use a heterogeneous list , which in Java is just the raw list type List < ?> or List < Object > .
Since every class in Java is a subclass of Object ( and now that we have autoboxing ) , such a list can contain any Java value .
There are many kinds of situation where this would be necessary .
For example , a row of database results will comprise values that are not all of the same type .
However , there ’s a problem with the raw list approach .
In using the List < ?> type , we are dispensing with the type system .
When you get a value from the list , how do you know what it is ?
How do you know which operations it supports ?
Well , you will have to defer that discovery until runtime , and use explicit type casting .
Most will shrug at this and say : “ So what ? ”
After all , this is what we did anyway , before generics .
Ah , but what if we do n’t have to ?
Can we create generic heterogeneous collections that are type - safe ?
Yes , we can .
Sort of .
Products of Types
What we would like to see is if it ’s possible to declare some constraints on the types of a heterogeneous collection , to achieve essential type - safety while maintaining the extensibility of a list .
Of course , it ’s easy to create types that are the product of two or more types :
public abstract class P2 < A , B > { public abstract A _1 ( ) ; public abstract B _2 ( ) ; }
But the length of this kind of product is as fixed as the length of a string in Pascal .
It is n’t extensible , so it ’s more like a type - safe heterogeneous array than a list .
If you want products of different lengths , you will need to declare separate classes for P3 < A , B , C > , P4< A , B , C , D > , etc .
What we ’re trying to achieve is a product of arbitrary length , whose length might even vary at runtime .
There ’s no reason we could n’t create products of products in a chain , like P2< A , P2< B , P2<C , D > >> , and this is more or less the approach that we will take .
Introducing HList
To achieve our goal , we ’re going to implement linked lists in the type system .
Let ’s remind ourselves what a linked list looks like .
A List < T > is essentially either the empty list or a value of type T paired with a List < T > .
In Java , using the List < A > type from Functional Java , an unsafe heterogeneous list might be constructed in a manner like the following :
List <?> x = cons ( " One " , cons ( 2 , cons ( false , nil ( ) ) ) ;
The cons method constructs a list , and the nil method returns the empty list .
With just these two methods , we can create any homogeneous list .
A list has two methods to access its members , head ( ) which returns the first element , and tail ( ) which returns the rest of the list .
Getting the head or tail of the empty list is an error at runtime .
Let ’s now take a step up into the type system , and say that a list of types is either the empty list or a type paired with a list of types .
This gives rise to our heterogeneous list type :
public abstract class HList < A extends HList < A >> { private HList ( ) {} private static final HNil nil = new HNil ( ) ; public static HNil nil ( ) { return nil ; } public static < E , L extends HList < L >> HCons < E , L > cons( final E e , final L l ) { return new HCons < E , L>(e , l ) ; } public static final class HNil extends HList < HNil > { private HNil ( ) {} } public static final class HCons < E , L extends HList < L >> extends HList < HCons<E , L >> { private E e ; private L l ; private HCons ( final E e , final L l ) { this .e = e ; this .l = l ; } public E head ( ) { return e ; } public L tail ( ) { return l ; } } }
That ’s not a lot of code , and it ’s all relatively straightforward Java .
The HList class is parameterised with a parameterised subclass of itself .
There are only two concrete subclasses of HList that can possibly occupy that slot : the type HNil and the type constructor HCons .
These represent the empty list and the list constructor , respectively .
HCons takes two type parameters , the first representing the first element of the list , and the second being another HList , allowing us to form a chain of them .
HNil does not take type parameters , so it terminates the chain .
As with regular old lists , you can access the head ( ) and tail ( ) of the list .
Note , however , that the fact that you cannot get the head or tail of the empty list is now enforced by the type system .
There ’s a nil method to get the empty list , and a cons method to construct a nonempty list , just like with regular lists .
Here ’s an example of how we would construct a heterogeneous list using this new type :
HCons < String , HCons < Integer , HCons < Boolean , HNil > >> x = cons ( " One " , cons ( 2 , cons ( false , nil ( ) ) ) ;
This is more verbose than the unsafe version before , but not by much .
Obviously , the HList example assumes a static import of HList.cons and the List < ?> example assumes a static import of List.cons .
Using the type - safe version is , however , much nicer .
Compare these two contrived examples :
if ( x.tail ( ) .tail ( ) .head ( ) ) { return x.head ( ) . length ( ) == x.tail ( ) .head ( ) ; } if ( ( boolean ) x.index ( 3 ) ) { return ( ( String ) x.head ( ) ) .
length ( ) == ( int ) x.index ( 2 ) ; }
The latter , of course , offers no static guarantees and may throw ClassCastExceptions , or we might inadvertently get the head or tail of the empty list at runtime .
The former will always work as long as it compiles , guaranteed .
Concatenating HLists
Now let ’s do something more interesting with these lists .
Notice that the cons methods for both type - safe and unsafe lists prepend an element to a list rather than appending .
Sometimes we want to append a list to the end of another .
This is unsurprisingly uncomplicated for unsafe lists :
List <?> c = a.append (b ) ;
Behind the scenes , we can think of append as reversing the first list and consing each element to the second list in reverse order .
Doing that for HList is a little more involved .
We have to construct a chain of types in exactly the right way , at compile - time .
Appending an HList to another is a function that takes two HList - valued arguments and returns an HList .
Using first - class functions from Functional Java , the append operation for HLists of specific types L and R , would be a function of the following type :
F2 < L extends HList < R> , L extends HList < L> , LR extends HList < LR >>
Where LR is the type of the concatenated HList .
Now , since we necessarily have the two arguments , we know the specific types of L and R .
Since Java does n’t have type inference , it cannot automatically figure out the specific type of LR .
We will have to supply it as type annotation .
Not to worry .
Even though Java does n’t infer types , it can be coerced into doing some type arithmetic .
All we have to do is a little inductive reasoning .
Types as Formulae
According to the Curry - Howard isomorphism , a program is a proof , and the hypothesis that it proves is a type for the program .
In this sense , Java ’s type system is a kind of crude theorem prover .
Put another way , a type is a predicate , and values of that type represent the terms for which the predicate holds .
The function type above therefore asserts that for any two HLists , L and R , there exists some program to derive the HList LR .
The function type by itself does not put any constraints on LR , however .
It can be derived by any function , not just the concatenation function .
We will remedy that presently .
We need a formula that states that the two types L and R imply a third type LR which is the HList concatenation of L and R , given some concatenation function .
Here is the type that represents that formula :
public static final class HAppend <L , R , LR > { private final F2< L , R , LR > append ; private HAppend ( final F2<L , R , LR > f ) { append = f ; } public LR append ( final L l , final R r ) { return append . f( l , r ) ; } }
At this point , HAppend is still just a hypothesis without evidence .
Remember that a value of a type is proof of the formula that it represents .
So we will need to supply two proofs in the form of constructors for values of this type ; one for the base case of appending to the empty list HNil , and another for the case of appending to an HCons .
The base case is easy .
Appending anything to the empty list should result in that same thing .
So the HAppend constructor for appending to the empty list looks like this :
public static < L extends HList <L >> HAppend < HNil , L , L> append ( ) { return new HAppend < HNil , L , L>( new F2 < HNil , L , L > ( ) { public L f( final HNil hNil , final L l ) { return l ; } } ) ; }
The case for the nonempty list is not quite as easy .
Consider its type :
public static < X , A extends HList < A> , B , C extends HList < C> , H extends HAppend < A , B , C > > HAppend < HCons<X , A > , B , HCons < X , C >> append ( final H h )
Read the return type first .
This returns an HAppend that appends some B to an HCons < X , A > .
The type of the head of the first list ( X ) becomes the type of the head of the concatenated list .
The tail of the concatenated list is C .
The type constraints state that C must be an HList , and that there must exist some way to append B ( the second list ) to A ( the tail of the first list ) so that they make C .
We must supply proof that this last constraint holds , and you ’ll see that such a proof is in fact supplied as an argument ( in the form of the value h ) .
What this is saying is that , given the premise that A and B can be concatenated , the concatenation of HCons < X , A > and B can be inferred .
A value of type HAppend < A , B , C > is precisely proof of the hypothesis that A and B can be concatenated , since there are only these two cases and we ’ve supplied a proof for both .
In other words , if we can append to the empty list , then that ’s proof enough that we can append to a list of one element , which proves that we can append to a list of two elements , and so on .
Given this , we can construct a chain of proofs .
This concatenated proof , then , is a function that concatenates lists of the corresponding types .
OK , so how do we use this ?
Well , here ’s an example program that appends one list to another :
public class HList_append { public static void main ( final String [ ] args ) { //
The two lists final HCons < String , HCons < Integer , HCons < Boolean , HNil > >> a = cons ( " Foo " , cons ( 3 , cons( true , nil ( ) ) ) ) ; final HCons < Double , HCons < String , HCons < Integer [ ] , HNil > >> b = cons( 4.0 , cons ( " Bar " , cons( new Integer [ ] { 1 , 2} , nil ( ) ) ) ) ; //
A lot of type annotation final HAppend < HNil , HCons < Double , HCons < String , HCons < Integer [ ] , HNil > >> , HCons < Double , HCons < String , HCons < Integer [ ] , HNil > >>> zero = append ( ) ; final HAppend < HCons < Boolean , HNil > , HCons < Double , HCons < String , HCons < Integer [ ] , HNil > >> , HCons < Boolean , HCons < Double , HCons < String , HCons < Integer [ ] , HNil > >>>> one = append ( zero ) ; final HAppend < HCons < Integer , HCons < Boolean , HNil > > , HCons < Double , HCons < String , HCons < Integer [ ] , HNil > >> , HCons < Integer , HCons < Boolean , HCons < Double , HCons < String , HCons < Integer [ ] , HNil > >>>>> two = append ( one ) ; final HAppend < HCons < String , HCons < Integer , HCons < Boolean , HNil > >> , HCons < Double , HCons < String , HCons < Integer [ ] , HNil > >> , HCons < String , HCons < Integer , HCons < Boolean , HCons < Double , HCons < String , HCons < Integer [ ] , HNil > >>>>>> three = append ( two ) ; //
And all of that lets us append one list to the other .
final HCons < String , HCons < Integer , HCons < Boolean , HCons < Double , HCons < String , HCons < Integer [ ] , HNil > >>>>> x = three .
append(a , b ) ; //
And we can access the components of the concatenated list in a type - safe manner if ( x.tail ( ) .tail ( ) .head ( ) ) System.out.println(x.tail ( ) .tail ( ) .tail ( ) .tail ( ) .tail ( ) [ 1 ]
* 2 ) ; // 4 } }
Holy pointy brackets , Batman !
Do we really need all of that ?
Well , look at what it ’s doing .
It ’s constructing a concatenation function of the appropriate type , by supplying the premise at each step .
If this seems mechanical , then that ’s because it is .
There is only one possible implementation for the HAppend we need , but Java does not have any mechanism for figuring this out , nor does it provide a facility for the programmer to tell it how .
Contrast that to Scala .
The above is a clear example of where Scala ’s implicit arguments come in handy .
If we import this to Scala , we can make both of the append functions implicit , and we can further make the H argument to the append function for nonempty lists implicit as well .
There can be only one possible implementation of each function , so it can be declared once and used implicitly wherever proofs of the corresponding types are required .
Jesper Nordenberg has implemented an HList library for Scala that demonstrates this well .
With implicits and Scala , the whole middle section of our program is condensed from 12 lines of type annotations to just :
val x = a.append(b )
Now , if you ’re really into this Java stuff , you ’re probably thinking : “ implicits are just dependency injection ” .
Well , in a sense , you would be right .
Both dependency injection and inheritance are degenerate forms of implicits .
However , there is currently no dependency injection framework for Java that can abstract over type constructors such that it provides injection of parameterised types with injection of type parameters also .
If you can prove me wrong , by all means send me evidence in the form of working code .
Conclusion
Clearly , Java is not very useful for this kind of type - safe programming .
I was actually quite surprised that you can do this in Java at all , but we ’ve definitely hit the outer boundary of what can be considered reasonably expressible .
The code you ’ve seen in this article uses the new HList package that was released with Functional Java 2.16 .
And is based on the Haskell HS library by Oleg Kiselyov .
µstr - Micro String API - for C

You can get the stable release of 1.0.x here ( ftp ) , it still does n't have 100 % documentation but it 's pretty close .
You can get the current git tree here .
About
A few years ago now I wrote a very extensive String API for C , called Vstr , it was designed to perform extremely well for IO like patterns as that was my planned usage ( for instance And - httpd , my Web server ) .
It works very well , for that usage .
Also due to the extensivness of the API I basically used it everywhere , even though there are some things it is somewhat " overkill " for , and I wanted other people to use it so I did n't have to resort to using string.h when creating patches for their code .
However more than a few C coders I speak to have one of a few reasons why they do n't want to use Vstr .
The ustr API should solve all of these problems , and hopefully fill in all the gaps where Vstr is the 500lb hammer .
There is an introduction to using the ustr API , as a guided tutorial of example code .
You can see the developers design documentation here .
Also here 's the file of GDB init functions ( or : ustr - import gdb ) , to help with debugging .
There are API references for functions and constants .
The unit testing coverage data is available .
And the here are links to TODO , NEWS , THANKS , AUTHORS and the " LICENSE " , such as it is .
List of problems with String APIs , in C
These are the primary reasons I 've seen given why developers do n't want to put " any " string API into their code :
It 's " too hard " , politically , to put into an existing projects build system .
String ADTs take up too much memory .
It 's too hard to integrate into existing code / APIs that uses plain C - style strings significantly .
We can " often " use stack space for a string , if we do it ourself , which ( we understand ) is much faster .
Need / want to initialize strings as they are declared .
License is n't compatible with our code .
The current code may be unsafe and hard to audit , but it's " optimized " to use the C - style string format / design .
While development might be harder " debugging is easier " .
So instead of using a String ADT ( any String ADT ) , the common solution is to just try and get by using ( char *) 's and string .h.
With " certain bits " using strdup ( ) and / or some size_t 's with a stored length .
This ad hoc approach is very bad , for everybody .
Needless to say , ustr solves all of the above problems while being significantly faster and safer than just using string .h.
List of solutions to problems with String APIs , in C
Solving the build problem
To use ustr with all of the shipped modules , you can just ( after install ustr ) goto your source dir .
and run :
ustr -import all
And include the following line in any source files you want to use ustr from :
You do not have to worry about linking with anything or having symbols appear in your library that you do n't want ... it will " just work " .
If you do n't want copies of each function you are using to appear in each file it is used from you can pass the " - c " option to ustr-import and compile the .c files .
You can also link against the ustr shared library , if you do n't mind adding a very simple dependency ( it is much simpler than Vstr , for example , and so is very likely to just run anywhere your code does ) .
Note that if you wish to look at some ustr using code now , you can see some example code or look at the distributed example / unit - test code at the end of this page .
Solving the memory overhead problem
This is best illistrated by example .
Say you build a " simple " string API , it just has the basics : automatic grow and shrink and reference counts for zero copy duplication .
The default assumption is that as you are adding data to the string you do n't want to spend all your time in realloc ( ) so you also expand the size of the string by powers of 2 .
This is about the most common string API that people implement on their own , a rough structure would look like :
struct Simple_str { char * ptr ; size_t reference_count ; size_t length ; size_t size ; } ;
However this strucutre itself is 16 bytes ( in a 32 bit environment ) or 32 bytes ( in a 64bit environment ) , and to allocate a new string requires two allocations ( one for the string , and one for the data in the -> ptr argument ) .
This means that to create a new string containing one byte you have to do two allocations and allocate roughly 34bytes ... giving a 1700 % increase over plain strdup ( ) .
By comparison ustr does one allocation of 6 bytes by default , in a both 32 bit and 64bit environments , and it can drop that down to 4 bytes , again even in a 64 bit environment ( and , in a 64 bit environment , you can have a > 4GB ustr so you are n't losing any features ) .
Although , to be fair , by default ustr only allocates 2 bytes for it 's reference count .
However that 's 65,535 references to the same string -- and ustr has a helper function so that if you need 70,000 references to a string it 'll only need to allocate 2 strings , and has another helper function so that you can mark a string as " shared " so it will act like a read - only string until it has been set back to " owned " .
For a Gnumeric spreadsheet comparing all string length values upto 260 between strdup ( ) , ustr and a " Simple str " click here .
I 've also listed of some common " small " string lengths below with their percentage overhead vs. strdup ( ) .
Ave. range of string sizes Ave. Simple_str - 32 bit overhead Ave. Simple_str - 64bit overhead Ave. ustr overhead 1 - 9 bytes 327.27 % 618.18 % 85.45 % 1-19 bytes 194.76 % 347.14 % 55.24 % 1-29 bytes 239.57 % 236.34 % 45.81 % 1-39 bytes 123.78 % 201.83 % 41.22 % 1-79 bytes 87.01 % 126.51 % 32.53 % 1-89 bytes 83.13 % 118.29 % 28.3 % 1-198 bytes 62.23 % 78.23 % 23.85 %
Here is a list of the first 18 string lengths , and some later ones using the different options for ustr :

Solving the integration problem
This problem is mostly solved by having ustr 's store their data as a valid C - style string at all times ( although it can have NIL bytes in it , which will confuse other APIs if you only pass the ustr_cstr ( ) value .
Also as you will see below it is trivial to " port " designs using common methods to use ustr .
Solving the stack allocation problem
There is a simple solution to this problem , ustr strings can be allocated on the stack .
For example :
char buf_store [ USTR_SIZE_FIXED ( 1024 ) ] ; Ustr *s1 = USTR_SC_INIT_AUTO ( buf_store , FALSE , 0 ) ;
The second argument says if the ustr should should be of limited size ( and so fail if too much data is added to it ) or not and thus it should automatically be converted to heap based storage if you try and add too much data to it ( and thus needing to be ustr_free ( ) d ) .
So you can still do that , if you think you need to ... and it'll now be managed , faster and safer .
You can call ustr_free ( ) on ustr's on the stack , and they will not be passed to free .
Also if they get duplicated the duplication comes from the heap ( you cannot create references to a fixed ustr ) .
Solving the initialization problem
There is a simple solution to this problem , ustr strings can be constant C - strings .
For example :
Ustr * s1 = USTR ( " " ) ; Ustr * s2 = USTR1 ( \xF , " 123456789 12345 " ) ; Ustr * s3 = USTR1 ( \x18 , " 123456789 123456789 1234 " ) ; Ustr * s4 = USTR2 ( \x1 , \x44 , " 1234589 12 " ... " 89 1234 " ) ;
As with the stack based ustr's , calling ustr_free ( ) does n't actually free these strings .
Also as they are read - only strings , calling ustr_dup ( ) on them will just return the pointer itself ( Ie. no allocations happen ) .
Apart from that they act as ustr 's in every way .
This means that you can initialize things to default values in other structs / arrays , and then add / delete / alter data in them like normal ustr's .
Note that although the length is specified manually above when ustr is running in debugging mode it will validate all strings , and will instantly spot a badly defined read - only ustr ... allowing you to fix the problem .
Solving the LICENSE problem
The License for the code is MIT , new - BSD , LGPL , etc. ... if you need another license to help compatibility , just ask for it .
It 's basically public domain , without all the legal problems for everyone that trying to make something public domain entails .
The " optimization " of string.h usage
With ustr , due to it keeping the data as a valid C - style string all the time , you can just call ustr_cstr ( ) , to get a ( const char * ) , or ustr_wstr ( ) , to get a ( char * ) , at any time .
Use whatever algorithm you need to .
If you are worried about the " inefficiency " of growing the string to the correct size you can also pre-allocate a ustr of the size you think you need , thus using a single malloc ( ) call ( and memcpy ( ) 's to add the data ) .
This is basically as fast is it could be made to go by hand ... and it'll now be managed and safer .
One point worth highlighting here is that people often assume they know where the performance problems are going to be , however I 've seen benchmark runs of C - style string using code where the function that used the most CPU time was strcmp ( ) .
For certain workloads general C - style strings are horribly inefficient at answering the question " are these two strings equal " , ustr solves that problem with ustr_cmp_eq ( ) and in a similar vein also provides ustr_fast_cmp ( ) for when you need to sort the strings but do n't care what order the sort is in .
GDB macros for easy debugging
The big problem here is that when you have a core dump you can't call any functions to find out data about the string .
Thus .
I 've written some gdb macros here which mean all you have to do is type " pustr_all s1 " etc .
A Significant example of usage , with comments
Ustr * s1 = USTR ( " " ) ; Ustr * s2 = ustr_dup( s1 ) ; Ustr * s3 = ustr_dup_cstr ( " " ) ; ustr_cmp_eq(s1 , s2 ) ; ustr_cmp_eq(s1 , s3 ) ; if ( ustr_shared ( s2 ) ) ; if ( ustr_ro ( s2 ) ) ; if ( !ustr_add_fmt ( &s2 , " %s %d %c %d " , " x " , 4 , 0 , 8 ) ) ; if ( ustr_owner ( s1 ) ) ; if ( ustr_owner ( s2 ) ) ; foo_API ( ustr_cstr( s1 ) , ustr_len ( s1 ) ) ; foo_API ( ustr_cstr ( s2 ) , ustr_len ( s2 ) ) ; s3 = ustr_dup ( s2 ) ; if ( ustr_owner ( s2 ) ) ; if ( ustr_shared ( s2 ) ) ; ustr_free ( s2 ) ; ustr_setf_share ( s2 ) ; if ( ustr_shared ( s2 ) ) ; if ( ustr_ro ( s2 ) ) ; s3 = ustr_dup ( s2 ) ; ustr_free ( s2 ) ; ustr_free ( s2 ) ; ustr_free ( s2 ) ; ustr_free ( s2 ) ; if ( !ustr_add_cstr ( &s3 , " abcd " ) ) ; ustr_add_cstr ( &s3 , " 1234 " ) ; ustr_add_cstr ( &s3 , " xyz " ) ; if ( ustr_enomem ( s3 ) ) ; ustr_setf_owner(s2 ) ; ustr_setf_owner (s1 ) ; ustr_sc_del ( &s2 ) ; ustr_cmp_eq(s1 , s2 ) ; s2 = USTR1 ( \x0 b , " Hello world " ) ; if ( ustr_shared ( s2 ) ) ; if ( ustr_ro ( s2 ) ) ;

Remarks delivered at the End the Fed rally in Washington , DC , November 22 , 2008 , across the street from the headquarters of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors .
Welcome , and thank you all for braving the cold weather to make it out here to today ’s rally .
My name is Paul - Martin Foss , and I am representing the office of US Congressman Ron Paul .
Like many people in this country , I made it all the way through college without any knowledge at all of economics .
While preparing for grad school , I began taking economics courses at George Mason University , where I received my first exposure to Ludwig von Mises , Murray Rothbard , and the Austrian School of economics .
Through my study of Austrian economics , I grew aware of the grave danger posed to this country by the Federal Reserve .
Many of you here are undoubtedly familiar with the workings of the Federal Reserve , but for those of you who may be here out of curiosity , I will give a brief description of the Fed .
Created in 1913 , the Federal Reserve System is a government - chartered but privately owned national banking monopoly , with a presidentially - appointed Board of Governors , headquartered across the street .
The Fed issues the paper currency we use in day - to - day transactions , which currency is given legal tender status .
The Fed influences market interest rates by making purchases of Treasury bonds , mortgage - backed securities , and other assets on the open market , attempting to keep interest rates at a certain targeted level .
It acts as a lender of last resort to failing banks , offering money through its discount window .
It engages in currency swap operations with foreign central banks .
It serves as a clearinghouse and regulator for the banks in its system .
And , as we have seen over the past several months , it increasingly operates as the guarantor of the stability of the entire American financial system .
Because of its hybrid government / private nature , decisions regarding monetary policy are not subject to effective oversight .
The Federal Open Market Committee , a government - created committee , makes monetary policy decisions , which are then implemented by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , a private institution .
For the past few decades , based on Keynesian thinking , the Fed has been tasked by Congress with maintaining full employment and a stable price level .
However , a cursory examination of money supply and price level data shows that the Fed has failed miserably in that regard .
Inflation is an increase in the supply of money , and the effect of inflation , all other things being equal , is a rise in prices .
Something that cost one dollar only 10 years ago would cost $ 1.32 today .
And that is based on the official data published by the Fed , the accuracy of which over the past 25 years is subject to dispute , since price level data has been manipulated to produce lower inflation numbers in order to conceal the true damage of inflation from the American people .
Looking at the long term , over the 95 - year history of the Federal Reserve System the dollar has lost 95 percent of its value .
Any company that had mismanaged its assets in such a manner would have gone out of business long ago .
Inflation has two very pernicious effects , the first being that it benefits debtors and punishes savers , since debtors are able to repay their debts with devalued dollars .
Thrift is punished because savings see their purchasing power eroded every year .
The second effect of inflation is that those who receive new money first are able to purchase assets before prices rise , while those who receive the money last have had to deal with high prices before receiving the benefit of the new money .
Who are the largest debtors in this country ?
The federal government , of course , with a national debt quickly approaching $ 11 trillion , but also large finance companies and corporations such as General Motors , General Electric , and Lehman Brothers , because of the preferential tax treatment afforded to debt financing over equity financing .
Who receives newly inflated money first ?
The federal government , the Federal Reserve , major national banks , and government contractors .
It is no surprise then that those who benefit the most from inflation are those who collude to continue the cycle of inflation , weakening the dollar and raising prices .
The rich get richer , and the middle class and the poor grow poorer .
The Fed ’s manipulation of interest rates creates the boom - and - bust business cycle that we have become all too accustomed to in this country .
At present we find ourselves moving toward the bottom of a particularly destructive business cycle .
Our policymakers unfortunately do not understand the role of the Fed in the creation of business cycles .
Instead of ending the Fed ’s manipulation of interest rates , the Fed is encouraged to embed itself ever deeper in the economy , involving itself in bailouts , creating new lending facilities , and acting as the guarantor of financial market stability .
Until the Fed ceases its loose monetary policy , there will be no economic correction .
There may be short - term improvements in the economy , but once the Fed ’s policy tools are shown to be ineffective , the end result will be a cataclysmic economic depression .
Recently the Fed has been heavily involved with the actions surrounding the Wall Street bailout , injecting trillions of dollars of credit into the financial system .
Reserve bank credit is up almost 150 % over the past two months , while the monetary base has increased 75 % in that same time frame .
If the people across the street do n’t get their act in gear , this country could face a hyperinflationary crisis the likes of which has not been seen in the First World since Germany in the 1920s .
You all have undoubtedly seen photographs of people filling their wheelbarrows with paper bills in order to go grocery shopping .
Well , I have two wheelbarrows already , so I ’m ahead of the curve .
Since we know what the problem is , how do we fix it ?
To address the Fed ’s shortcomings , Dr. Paul has introduced a number of legislative proposals .
HR 2754 , the Sunshine in Monetary Policy Act , would force the Fed to republish M3 , the broadest measure of money supply , which would allow a more accurate gauge of potential price inflation .
Reporting of M3 was suspended in early 2006 , as M3 was beginning to increase at an ever - faster rate .
How convenient that the broadest measure of money supply was dropped as the housing boom began to bust , and not long before the turmoil in financial markets began .
HR 2756 , the Honest Money Act , would repeal federal legal tender laws .
Why should worthless , unbacked paper issued by a private banking monopoly have legal tender status ?
With legal tender laws in place , bad money forces out good .
Our Founding Fathers intended for gold and silver to act as money , not unbacked paper .
In the next Congress , Dr. Paul will be introducing a bill to audit the Federal Reserve .
The Fed currently is audited by GAO , but there are certain areas of Fed activity that GAO is forbidden from auditing .
These include , and I quote here from US Code :
transactions for or with a foreign central bank , government of a foreign country , or nonprivate international financing organization ;
deliberations , decisions , or actions on monetary policy matters , including discount window operations , reserves of member banks , securities credit , interest on deposits , and open market operations ; and
transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee
Well , if you ca n’t audit any of those areas , what is left to audit ?
These unauditable areas comprise the core methods through which the Fed distorts the proper functioning of the market .
Why should transactions with foreign governments or foreign central banks be free from legal scrutiny and oversight ?
What is to keep the Federal Open Market Committee , a majority of whose members are presidential appointees , from siphoning funds to politically connected firms ?
What other agency of government receives such carte blanche to operate completely independently , spending money willy - nilly and entering into agreements with foreign governments , without any oversight ?
Were this the Department of Defense or Department of State , we would rightly categorize it as a rogue agency .
To fully reign in the Fed there is only one solution .
That brings us to the last , but not least , piece of legislation , HR 2755 , the Federal Reserve Board Abolition Act .
This bill would repeal the Federal Reserve Act and abolish the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the entire Federal Reserve System .
Everything I have just described shows that Fed is unaccountable , unconstitutional , and contrary to every principle upon which this country was founded .
Until the Federal Reserve System is abolished , true freedom and prosperity will elude us .
It is incumbent upon us to educate ourselves and to spearhead educational efforts , to speak to family , friends , and coworkers , to get the word out about the Fed , what it is , what it does , and its detrimental effect on the financial standing of this country and its people .
I ’ve managed to convince my parents of the Fed ’s destructiveness , and it never ceases to amaze me how many people we talk to who have at least some knowledge of the Fed ’s destructive power .
We are not alone , and we need to ensure that our Congressmen know that .
Educational websites , Meetup groups , and rallies need to result in a flood of letters , phone calls , and emails to Congressional offices , lobbyists , and think tanks .
Congressmen and their staffers need to know that the Fed should be reined in and abolished , and that the legislation to accomplish that already exists .
Official Washington needs to understand that we know what the Fed does , and we ’re fed up .
Freedom is not easy , and it requires an educated , active , and aware populace .
It wo n’t happen quickly , it wo n’t happen easily , but once it does , the groundswell of opposition will ensure a real change .
The Fed must go .
End the Fed .

The Best of Paul - Martin Foss
( h/t Heather )
I do n’t pretend that I am some great political genius , but I do know that there are some truisms in America politics .
One big truism is that senior citizens vote as a much higher percentage than other subset of the population and the biggest way to ensure that they will come out to vote is to threaten the programs upon which they rely .
That ’s what makes announcing the intent to cut spending to Medicare by $ 1.3 trillion such an odd , Bizarro - world choice on the part of the McCain / Palin campaign .
Debbie Wasserman Schultz appeared on The Rachel Maddow Show to confirm that those all - too - critical 27 Florida electoral votes do n’t look like they ’ll be heading into the McCain column :
You are so right when you say that this is a third rail – of Florida politics – certainly , and politics nationally among senior citizens is Medicare and Social Security and John McCain and Sarah Palin are shockingly wrong on both of those issues .
I mean , it ’s bad enough that he clearly and consistently has supported privatizing Social Security .
Especially considering that this morning the stock market was down 797 points at one point and he thinks we should just be investing — the best thing to do is invest people ’s Social Security funds in the stock market .
[ sarcastically ]
That ’s a really good idea , right now .
But then , on top of that , he goes so far as to say in order to cover about five million more people out of the 47 million that do n’t have health insurance , his plan is to cut Medicare $ 1.3 trillion .
Now there is 3.2 million Floridians that are covered by Medicare ; we have the second highest number of Medicare recipients in the country and a higher percentage even than California of our population .
I can tell you , I represent a district in South Florida for sixteen years , between the Legislature and Congress and there is no way that my senior citizen constituents are going to be supporting John McCain .
They are really concerned about two things : making sure they do n’t have their safety net yanked out from under them and making sure that their health care , that they have fought for and earned in the golden years of their retirement .
For the record , Barack Obama and Joe Biden have both signed off on Health Care for America Now .

What if people are biologically unsuited for the American dream ?
The man posing that troubling question is n't just another lefty activist .
It 's Peter Whybrow , head of the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Behavior at UCLA .
" We 've been taught , especially in America , that happiness will be at the end of some sort of material road , where we have lots and lots of things that we want , " said Whybrow , a 2008 PopTech Fellow and author of American Mania : When More Is Not Enough .
" We 've set up all sorts of tricks to delude ourselves into thinking that it 's fine to get what you want immediately . "
He paints a disturbing picture of 21st century American life , where behavioral tendencies produced by millions of years of scarcity - driven evolution do n't fit the social and economic world we 've constructed .
Our built - in dopamine - reward system makes instant gratification highly desirable , and the future difficult to balance with the present .
This worked fine on the savanna , said Whybrow , but not the suburbs :
We gorge on fatty foods and use credit cards to buy luxuries we can't actually afford .
And then , overworked , underslept and overdrawn , we find ourselves anxious and depressed .
That individual weakness is reflected at the social level , in markets that have outgrown their agrarian roots and no longer constrain our excesses — resulting in the current economic crisis , in which
America 's unpaid bills came due with shocking speed .
But with this crisis , said Whybrow , comes the opportunity to rethink how Americans live , as individuals and as a nation , and build a country that works .
" We 're primed for doing things immediately .
We 're poor at planning for the future , unless we get into circumstances like these , where we 're forced to think cleverly about what to do next , " he said .
" In a way , this financial meltdown is a healthy thing for us .
We 'll think intuitively again . "
Foremost among Whybrow 's targets is the modern culture of spending on credit .
" The instinctive brain is well ahead of the intellectual brain .
Credit cards promise us that you can have what you want now , and postpone payment until later , " he said .
Buying just feels good , in a biological sense — and that instant reward outweighs the threat of future bills .
Of course , many people use credit cards to pay bills and put food on the table , rather than buy flat - screen televisions and new computers .
" That unfortunate reality , " said Whybrow , " is produced by an out - of - control economic system " geared toward perpetual growth .
That is no more natural a state for markets than a mall food court is natural for individuals whose metabolic heredity treats fats and sugars as rarities .
" Once upon a time , this economic system worked .
But for the invisible hand of the free market to function , it needed to be balanced .
And that balance is gone , " he said .
Markets were once agrarian institutions , said Whybrow , which balanced the gratification of individuals with the constraints of small communities , where people looked their trade partners in the eye , and transactions were bounded by time and geography .
With those constraints removed , markets have engaged in the buy - now , pay - later habits of college kids who do n't read the fine print on their credit card bills .
" You can think about markets in the same way as individuals who mortgaged their future — except markets did it with other people 's money , " he said .
" You end up with a Ponzi scheme predicated on the idea that we can get something now , rather than having to wait .
And it all comes back to the same instinctual drive . "
And now that the fundamental excesses of our economy have been so painfully exposed , with trillions of dollars vanishing from the
American economy in just a few days , we have to think about changing both the economy and ourselves .
The answers are n't easy , Whybrow cautioned — but they do exist .
People can think creatively about jumping from the treadmills of bad jobs and unmeetable needs ; and even if this is n't always possible , they can teach their children to live modestly and within their means .
Urban engineers can design cities that allow people to live and work and shop in the same place .
Governments can , at the insistence of their citizens , provide the social safety nets on which social mobility ,
stagnant for the last 50 years , is based .
And we can — however much it hurts — look to Europe for advice .
" America has always believed that it was the perfect society .
When you have that mythology driving your culture , it 's hard to look around and say , ' Is someone else doing it better than us ? ' " said Whybrow .
" But you can trace the situation we 're in to our evolutionary origins .
Now that we find ourselves in the middle of this pseudo - abundance , we 're in trouble .
And the fantasy that we can restart the American dream just is n't true . "

How the Fed Creates Bull and Bear Markets
I received an e-mail recently that is typical of the pop economic philosophy being heavily touted today in various financial forums .
The e-mail contained a petition for the elimination of the Federal Reserves system .
The gist of the e-mail was that the credit crisis was caused by the Fed 's “ loose money policy . ”
The e-mail explained that loose money is the bane and scourge of the financial system and always leads to financial collapse and economic stability .
The author of this e-mail made it sound like a loose monetary policy all by itself will lead to inevitable doom just as surely as clouds lead to rain .
Right here is where I disagree .
It was n't the Fed 's loose money policy earlier this decade that resulted in the late financial contagion .
Rather it was the Fed 's excessively tight money policy of 2004 and onward that was the catalyst for today 's trouble .
I wo n't argue that Greenspan 's Fed was excessively loose with money and credit in 2001 - 2004 and there 's no denying that his ultra loose monetary policy led to the creation of the housing bubble .
But the pin that pricked the bubble was Greenspan 's abrupt slamming on of the money and credit brakes beginning in 2004 .
This is something that most people fail to grasp .
Monetary policy is always a two - way street , not a one - sided affair as the tight money advocates would have us believe .
Loose money alone does n't make for a financial crash ; it 's tight money that creates crashes .
Here 's another e-mail I received earlier this week that relates to the subject at hand : “ I am so brainwashed that the crash is from sub - prime and derivatives .
Either I have n't been paying attention to tight money policies of central banks or very few people have written about it . ”
That pretty much hits it on the head .
Most all of us have been something akin to being “ brainwashed ” by the financial literature out there , the vast majority of which conveniently ignores the Fed 's tight money policies of recent years and puts the blame squarely on the shoulders of the loose credit years earlier this decade .
The trouble with today 's self - appointed Fed experts is that they mostly seem to view monetary policy as the one - way street mentioned above .
I 'd like to remind them that yes Virginia , there is such a thing as a tight money policy that leads to financial crisis .
In his book , The Money Men , H.W. Brands wrote of the first major test the Federal Reserve faced after its creation in 1913 .
In its role as arbiter of the nation 's money supply the Fed made its first policy blunder in making cheap money overly plentiful in the early 1920s , which encouraged a speculative bubble in the stock market .
By 1928 , the Fed recognized its error and instead of gradually slowing down the money creation , did something that has been part of their modus operandi ever since .
In true reactionary fashion the Fed slammed on the monetary brakes and started raising interest rates , paving the way for the great 1929 stock market crash .
Making matters worse and adding fuel to the fire , the Fed continued its tight money policy while the U.S. government actually raised taxes and thereby greatly exaggerated the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Was this a case of ignorance born of inexperience or was a sinister motive at work here ?
One could almost excuse their mistakes of the late 1920s and early ‘ 30s due to the Fed 's lack of experience .
Yet such latitude can't be so easily granted them today with more than 90 years of experience behind them .
Benjamin Strong , who had been the head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , was one of the architects of the loose money policy of the early 1920s and he also orchestrated the shift to tight money later that decade as stock prices soared .
Concerning the Fed 's role in containing financial crises , Strong wrote , “ The very existence of the Federal Reserve System is a safeguard against anything like a calamity growing out of money rates .
We have the power to deal with such an emergency instantly by flooding the Street with money . ”
Unfortunately for Strong , he never had a chance to test his theory as he died in 1928 .
As Brands observed in his book , “ No one had the nerve to open the sluice gates ” when once the crisis unfolded in 1929 - 30 .
“ The Fed kept interest rates high , with the result that the American money supply contracted by a strangling one - third . ”
Truly we see that history repeats as we have experienced this year : the Fed 's tight money policy of the last few years catalyzed the late financial crisis and only when the maximum damage was inflicted did the slow - to - respond Bernanke Fed open the sluice gates and that only grudgingly .
Long - time Fed watcher Bert Dohmen of the Wellington Letter offers the following insight , “ Who controls the liquidity necessary to buy stocks ?
It 's the Federal Reserve through its monetary policy . ”
Dohmen goes on to observe , “ Invariably bear markets occur when the central bank tightens money .
This sudden change in the availability of money causes investors to sell stocks in order to raise cash .
Suddenly the buyers turn into sellers and the markets plunge … .
It 's a shift in the demand - supply relationship . ”
One astute economist wrote in 1966 concerning the 1929 stock market crash , “ The excess credit which the Fed pumped into the economy ( in the late 1920 's , in order to lower interest rates ) spilled over into the stock market – triggering a fantastic speculative boom .
Belatedly , Federal Reserve officials attempted to sop up the excess reserves and finally succeeded in breaking the boom .
But it was too late :
By 1929 the speculative excesses had become so overwhelming that the attempt precipitated a sharp retrenching and a consequent demoralizing of business confidence .
As a result , the American economy collapsed … .
The world economies plunged into the Great Depression of the 1930's . ”
This economist was none other than Alan Greenspan .
In the above statement he admits that whenever the Fed sees speculative excess ( as they certainly did in the 2003 - 2004 period ) it will cause them to tighten money .
It has been ever thus since the Fed 's inception in 1913 .
Will the Fed 's latest efforts at reflating the financial market succeed ?
If history is any guide then it should eventually stabilize the stock market and allow the newly formed 6 - year up cycle along with the peaking 10 - year cycle to work its magic in 2009 for one final cyclical bull market before the “ hard down ” phase of the Kress 40 - year and 60 - year cycles commences in 2010 .
Is Bernanke a modern day Lycurgus ?
Lycurgus was ancient Sparta 's famous lawgiver who transformed his country 's economy by minimizing luxuries and emphasizing simplicity .
His economic reforms can best be described as communalistic and his name is synonymous with austerity .
According to the historian Plutarch , Lycurgus outlawed the “ needless and superfluous arts ” thereby channeling Sparta 's economic energies from luxuries to staples and necessities .
He also abolished gold and silver money , replacing it with iron money .
The relative worthlessness and lack of portability of the iron money discouraged his subjects from greedy pursuits .
It also kept foreign trade at a minimum and abolished the luxury trade altogether .
Plutarch reports that this monetary reform of Lycurgus forced the Spartans to focus on the necessary arts and eschew all luxuries as non essential .
His reforms virtually eliminated the distinction between the poor and the rich and created an exceedingly simple , communal lifestyle among the Spartans .
Lycurgus died some 2,600 years ago .
Yet in many ways Lycurgus live on through the monetary policies of current Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Bernanke has been committed to following along the road of a Lycurgian austerity and of bringing to America a truly Spartan existence .
It 's not hard to imagine Bernanke consulting with Lycurgus on matters of economic policy in Socratic dialogue form .
If you listen carefully you can even hear what they 're saying :
Lycurgus :
Well I see you 've been up to your old tricks again .
Bernanke :
Ah , you know me too well my curmudgeony friend !
Lycurgus :
You 've made them all poor with your refusal to bend .
Bernanke : I felt it too soon for the tight money to end .
Lycurgus :
Well at least you finally admitted your wrong .
Bernanke : Never will I sing that lamentable song !
Lycurgus :
You mean you persist in your stubbornness ere ' long ?
Bernanke : I 'll continue my ways ‘ til the sound of the gong .
Lycurgus :
And when it's all through , Ben , what will you do then ?
Bernanke : First I 'll tighten some more , then I 'll tighten again .
Lycurgus :
And then of the bears you 'll make many friends .
Bernanke : And to Greenspan 's follies I 'll add many more sins .
Lycurgus :
But what of the Boomers who are soon to retire ?
Bernanke :
It 's too bad for them all , they must put out for hire .
Lycurgus :
They 're too old to work , Ben , of that they 'll soon tire .
Bernanke :
Then I 'll hasten their date with the funeral pyre .
Lycurgus :
But your legacy , Ben , what will they all say ?
Bernanke :
Oh , let them eat cake !
I see no other way .
Lycurgus : Fair enough , I suppose , at least they have today .
Bernanke :
At least for as long as their pensions hold sway .
Lycurgus : Now I must bid thee farewell , my tight money friend .
Bernanke : May austerity prevail ‘ til the bitter end !
Bernanke is often ridiculed as “ Helicopter Ben ” for his supposed adherence to Milton Friedman 's helicopter money thesis for dealing with lack of liquidity .
What these critics ( most of whom are fans of austerity , or “ tough love ” as they call it ) do n't realize is that Bernanke is actually their best friend and comrade in arms .
Far from being an advocate of loose money as he is charged with , or even an exponent of monetary equilibrium , Bernanke 's actions in the first two - and - a - half years of his tenure as Fed chief betray him as a deflationist .
Until the exigency of the credit crisis forced him to abandon his tight money stance he was content to favor contraction over economic growth .
Before his tenure is through he 'll undoubtedly acquire the nickname “ Mr. Deflation . ”
This leads us to ask , “ Is Bernanke possessed of a Lycurgan spirit ? ”
Indeed he seems to be , for the Bernanke Fed has heretofore failed in its appointed task of properly regulating the nation 's money supply .
The events of this year make that obvious for all to see .
In the almost three years of his tenure , Bernanke has shown himself to be a dullard without equal in responding to the monetary needs of commerce .
Only when the nation 's financial system was threatened with collapse was he finally inspired enough to loosen money .
He should be held accountable for his failure to act in a timely manner , along with Greenspan .
Even if Bernanke 's emergency actions procure favorable results we should not be quick to overlook the severity of his tight money transgressions .
His stubborn refusal to listen to the demands of commerce for liquidity , to the bond market in 2006 - 2007 – nor even to the deflating real estate market – leave no room for excuse .
Untold destruction has been inflicted on the pensions and retirement savings of millions of Americans .
Thousands of small businesses were thrown into bankruptcy by the Fed 's belated response to the needs of commerce .
The consequences of Bernanke 's stubbornness will be felt for years to come .

DIY , 100 MPG Car is Back on the Road After 20 Year Hiatus
Through the forums I learned about the interesting story of a two men who built a super - efficient car back in 1984 to combat high gas prices , only to pull it off the road again when prices became more manageable .
The two , Craig Henderson and Bill Green , founded Avion in 1984 and then spent two years building a 100 MPG sports car , which they managed to eke 104 MPG out of in a South - North trip across the US in 1986 .
After making the trip for less than $ 15 of diesel fuel , the two hoped to find a company interested in the design , but as the Bellingham Herald notes , that was n’t the case :
Not only was the Avion painted in “ arrest me for speeding red , ” as Henderson likes to describe the color , but the lightweight car ’s fuel efficiency could n’t be beat .
He was wrong about the interest .
“ Nobody really cared .
Big deal .
Fuel was cheap .
There was a glut of fuel , ” Henderson , 51 , recalled earlier this week .
“ Fast forward to today .
Things change , do n’t they ? ”
This time around , the fuel crisis does n’t look like it will have the same kind of wait - and - see solution it did in the past .
No one thinks prices are going to drop again , and even bigger fears like global warming and dwindling petroleum supplies make the need for a long - lasting change even more salient .
That ’s why Avion has jumped back into the game to compete for the Automotive X Prize and $ 10 million .
Given that the goal of the competition is to break 100 MPG in a production - ready vehicle , I would say Avion is well on its way to taking top honors , though the competition is sure to be fierce .
As for the car itself , it ’s designed as a sports car , combining sleek , fast looks with aerodynamics to turn heads both on the highway and at the pumps .
It ’s built around a Mercedes diesel engine , but a lot has changed in engines , especially diesels , since 1984 , so I ’m sure there are some changes to be made there .
Best of all , it could be mass - produced for about $ 20,000 .
Check out the Avion website for more on the car , and our own aerodynamics forum for some more DIY aeromods .
I ’d drive one , how about you ?

Opal has been detected on Mars by NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) , an encouraging sign that water may have existed on the planet as recently as two billion years ago .
The opal , a hydrated silicate , is the youngest hydrated mineral yet to be found on the 4.5 billion - year - old planet and significantly widens the window of time that Mars is believed to have supported water .
" This is an exciting discovery because it extends the time range for liquid water on Mars , and the places where it might have supported life , " [ SPACE.com ]
said team leader Scott Murchie .
Hydrated minerals require water to form and two types have been found on the Red Planet before .
The oldest hydrated materials are clay - like phyllosilicates , which formed more than 3.5 billion years ago when volcanic rocks bathed for long periods of time in water .
Later , hydrated sulfates formed when salty and occasionally acidic water evaporated [ Discovery News ] .
The opal deposits were detected by the MRO 's CRISM spectrometer , which
The newly found hydrated silicates , described in Geology [ subscription required ] , appeared even later , as acidic liquid water slowly altered materials created from volcanic activity and meteorite impacts .
Team member Ralph Milliken explains that the water

works by " reading " over 500 colours in reflected sunlight to detect particular minerals on the Martian surface [ BBC News ] .
NASA 's Spirit rover had previously encountered similar hydrated silicates in the Gusev Crater but the new deposits are located in and around the gargantuan canyon system known as Vallis Marineris , in terrain less than 2.5 billion years old .
" It 's definitely in terrains that are younger than the terrains where we find clay minerals or sulphates , "
[ New Scientist ] says Milliken .
" The opaline silica deposits would be good places to explore to assess the potential for habitability on Mars , especially in these younger terrains , " [ BBC News ]
Milliken says .
But it looks like a long wait before scientists will get their remote - controlled rover shovels on these new gems .
Unfortunately , NASA 's Phoenix lander currently on Mars is nearing the end of its life and the Mars Science Laboratory rover set for 2009 already has a packed schedule .

I ’ve been writing a lot more lately about renewable energy than I have analog electronics , but I think with good reason .
There has been added interest on the part of many because of Barack Obama ’s election to the presidency and his promise to invest $ 15 billion per year for 10 years in order to create 5 million new “ green collar ” jobs .
But where and how do we separate the promises and the politician from the reality ?
How do we know that renewable energy will help pull America out of our economic recession ?
And most importantly , once we are confident that this idea of a green economy could work , how do we know where to put our money and invest ?
I think the most important thing to point out is that there are going to be a LOT of bad investments out there .
My last entry about EEStor is a good example ; a company that could potentially be doing great things , but more likely will look for lots of investments and then not deliver on their promises .
Like any other engineering activity , renewable energy is an iterative process .
On average , the solar technologies in 2 years will be better than the technologies we see today ( especially because of the higher interest in renewables and the notion that eventually oil prices will return to extremely high prices ) .
Further , there will be other companies “ green washing ” ( basically talking the talk of being an energy friendly company , but not walking the walk ) .
If you decide to invest in solar , wind , geothermal , etc , you should realize that beyond the usual risk of investing , there are risks associated with unknown , unproven technologies .
Prices on renewable companies have n’t gone through the roof yet , but human nature tells us that there will be an overzealous buying of stocks at some point .
Let ’s look at what we should do when investing so we avoid any unnecessary losses :
Are they forthcoming with details ? —
Companies like EEStor might try to be secretive because they have a breakthrough technology , but there are limits on how much a company should really withhold information .
Mostly it comes down to whether or not you want to roll the dice on a company that keeps you in the dark .
I would much rather see a proven technology ( heck , a prototype would be nice ) and then make my decision based on that .
You might not get the 1000 % returns that people expect ( perhaps they ’re nostalgic for the dot com days ? ) , but you will go into an investment with facts you can hold companies to when things get tough .
Do you understand everything about what they are doing ? —
This is important for two reasons .
First , it is important because you should not invest in what you do n’t understand .
If you do n’t get how a solar cell works , do n’t get how it could benefit society and are only sure that it will somehow produce power , then it is not a good idea to dive headfirst into investing in that company .
Second , some of the best investing ideas are the simplest ideas ; if you cannot explain to someone in 1 sentence what the company does , it is probably too complex to form a productive , sustainable company ( a generalization , of course ) .
Examples of this might be Apple ( “ They sell computers and music players ” ) .
Of course the internals of their products are more complex , but the products are simple to describe and sell .
If you have a company that is producing a chemical that is required in the fabrication of GeAs solar cells for the 3rd implantation process … yeah , might not be such a great buy at first glance .
Have they brought in good management ? —
The best ideas in the world are worthless if you ca n’t sell them .
It ’s not greedy ; it ’s business .
Sure , the truly great ideas will always rise to the top ( eventually ) , but since we ’re talking about investing here , we need to concentrate on ideas that are likely to get to market quickly and ones that will be successful for the long term .
Good management will include a proven track record at start ups ( there are very specific skill sets ) and some experience in the industry .
Note that these people can sometimes be the founders , but unless the creators of the new idea or technology have significant soft skills , do n’t expect it .
Are they digging for the gold , selling the gold or selling the shovels ? —
This was always an analogy and investing idea that I liked : the ones who made the most in the California gold rush were not the ones digging the gold , but instead those selling shovels .
To give an example for each , the diggers here would be the solar companies ( cell manufacturers ) , the sellers of the gold would be the energy companies and the sellers of shovels would be fabrication equipment manufacturers .
The best case scenario is when you find a great company supplying the shovel with little competition .
If the “ shovel - maker ” can continually sell their product to each new technology that pops up , then they will be well positioned to outperform the rest of the market .
Do they have a simple product that can be produced quickly and efficiently ?
—
Really , I ’m thinking about GreenField Solar Corp , which I recently read about in the Cleveland Plain Dealer .
They have a simple solar concentrator that can mostly be built from off the shelf components .
However , the best part of their implementation is that they would license and franchise the production facilities ( making the start - up cost lower for the actual company ) and they would only retain sales ownership of their proprietary software , control systems and solar cells ( a very specific type ) .
It is reminiscent of the lean manufacturing idea that Solar Automation eschews and Henry Ford pioneered .
If you have TONS of money you want to invest , you could always try to start a solar factory .
For my part , I am staying put on renewable energy stocks for now .
In reality , it ’s always a very difficult climate when you try to guess what technology will come out on top .
It happened with the biotech stocks in the early - to mid-2000s , it happened in the dot - com era ( post - bust ) , it happened in the 90s with the PC and chip makers , it happened in the 80s with banks and so on back through time .
If you are reading this post , you likely either found my site through searching or you were linked here ; in either case , if you are not sure about renewable energy stocks , stick with what you know and continue to monitor the industry .
Then when you see a disruptive technology that you think WILL revolutionize the industry , maybe buy a few shares to help support the company .
However , do not expect to make money for a few years and continually research your target company .
If you are REALLY looking to invest in your favorite solar or wind company , go buy a solar array or turbine and try powering your home .
You will help the company and yourself .
If you have any questions about investing in renewables or if you have any favorites you would like to let others know about , please leave them in the comments .

On Facebook , an " Impeach Barack Obama " group has attracted more than 700 members and a lively debate about the Democrat 's election victory on Tuesday over Republican John McCain .
Another Facebook group of the same name has 160 members and urges others to join because " we might as well get a head start on the impeachment of Obama . "
" There are a lot of Americans out there that do not fully understand the concept of Socialism or Communism which is why they 've elected Obama as president , " it says .
Yet another Facebook group , " Impeach Barack Hussein Obama , " has 160 members .
It decries that Obama " has voiced support for various unconstitutional programs such as the assault weapons ban , universal healthcare , and various schemes for wealth distribution . "
" What are we going to do about it ?
IMPEACH HIM ! " it says .
Obama still has some way to go , however , to equal the number of " Impeach George Bush " groups on Facebook , which lists at least 95 such groups with varying membership .
Obama is to be sworn into office on January 20 , 2009 .
He will be the first African - American president of the United States .
With upcoming WordPress 2.7 , just released in beta 3 as I ’m writing this , styling your categories gets even easier .
Previously , you more or less had to do a conditional tag thing and echo a specific class to get some custom styling , but no more .
Enter this little line of code :
[ php ] [ / php ]
The only thing it does , when it ’s inserted in your post ’s div tag , is write class = " post " .
In other words , you replace your class = " post " with post_class ( ) .
Why ?
Well , this little thing adds some other nice classes to each post as well .
We ’ve already discussed the sticky post class , sticky , in a previous article here on Devlounge .
Besides that one , it adds the following classes :
category - X where X is the post ’s category , one for each category , so it could be category - games and category - sports if the posts belong to your games and your sports category .
where X is the post ’s category , one for each category , so it could be and category - sports if the posts belong to your games and your sports category .
tag -X which works exactly the same as category - X , but for tags .
So the class tag - monkeys would be added for a post tagged with “ monkeys ” .
So let ’s say I want to style my games category differently from my other categories .
Simple !
Just add .category - games to your stylesheet , and style away .
Just for the sake of it , let ’s make all the text green , ’ cause I ’m in a green period right now :
[ css ]
. category - games { color : green ; }
[ /css ]
No , I would n’t write “ green ” normally , but then again I would n’t do all the type green either , so …
Anyway , that ’s about it .
Just replace your regular class = " post " part in your divs holding your posts , with post_class ( ) .
Then you ’ll have sticky post support , and more !
But wait , there ’s more !
I sometimes want to style some parts of my blog differently , especially single posts .
That ’s what the single .
php template is for in a theme , as you know .
I usually control the styling of these single posts by adding a class , appropriately named single .
When using post_class ( ) I wo n’t be able to do that .
Wrong !
Just add the class you want to add to the ones WordPress already appends to the post , like this in my case :
[ php ] [ / php ]
That will spit out all those category and tag classes , along with a microformat one , and a the one for sticky posts should it be a post marked as sticky , as well as the single class I added .
There you have it .
Now get your themes ready for WordPress 2.7 with this lovely new post classes functionality .

It does n't consist of any colours or shades that you know .
Trying to describe that colour would be as difficult as trying to belive that there is enough love & compassion in the world so every human can feel happiness .

New research shows that we should be looking to the ground , not the sky , to see where climate change could have its most perilous impact on life on Earth .
Scientists at the University of Toronto Scarborough have published research findings in the prestigious journal , Nature Geoscience , that show global warming actually changes the molecular structure of organic matter in soil .
" Soil contains more than twice the amount of carbon than does the atmosphere , yet , until now , scientists have n't examined this significant carbon pool closely , " says Myrna J. Simpson , principal investigator and Associate Professor of Environmental Chemistry at UTSC .
" Through our research , we 've sought to determine what soils are made up of at the molecular level and whether this composition will change in a warmer world . "
Soil organic matter is what makes dirt fertile and able to support plant life – both of which are especially important for agriculture .
Organic matter retains water in the soil and prevents erosion .
Natural processes of decomposition of soil organic matter provide plants and microbes with the energy source and water they need to grow , and carbon is released into the atmosphere as a by - product of this process .
Warming temperatures are expected to speed up this process which will increase the amount of CO2 that is transferred to the atmosphere .
" From the perspective of agriculture , we can't afford to lose carbon from the soil because it will change soil fertility and enhance erosion " says Simpson .
" Alternatively , consider all the carbon locked up in permafrost in the Arctic .
We also need to understand what will happen to the stored carbon when microbes become more active under warmer temperatures . "
Until Simpson 's research , scientists did n't know much about soil 's molecular composition .
Part of the reason is that , from a chemical perspective , soil is difficult to analyze due to its many components , including bacteria , fungi and an array of fresh , partially degraded , or old plant material .
Simpson 's team , which includes research collaborators Professors Dudley Williams and Andre Simpson , is uniquely positioned to address this new frontier .
The team uses a NMR ( Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ) facility - the only NMR facility in Canada specifically dedicated to environmental research – to gain a detailed view of soil 's molecular structure and reactivity .
In their current study , Simpson 's team used an outdoor field experiment in the valley behind the UTSC campus to ensure natural ecosystem processes were preserved .
Electrodes warmed the test soil between three and six degrees through winter and summer seasons , over a 14 - month period .
Throughout the test period , the team analyzed the molecular composition of soil samples .

Several days before election day I caught up with Joe Biden and asked him what he meant when he said mark his words Obama ’s presidency will bring a “ generated crisis ” .
He told me it would happen regardless of who ’s president , he stated he was only repeating what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was saying and there would in fact be an international crisis without a doubt he did n’t even think twice when I asked him .
I also tried to ask him about what Obama meant by stating we have “ negative liberties ” and the Constitution is “ flawed ” , he then ignored me .
He claims they will have to make some tough decisions due to an international crisis .
I wonder if those “ tough decisions ” will be similar to the “ tough decisions ” Bush made after 9/11 like passing the Patriot Act , spying on Americans without warrants and engaging in an endless war .
Even Obama stated in his Chicago speech on election night shortly after his victory that he will have “ challenges ” which will force him to make unfavorable decisions .
It ’s time Americans wake up and realize that Trilateral co-founder and associate of Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller : Zbigniew Brzezinski is pulling the strings of this administration and according to numerous publications he ’s written the past few decades , we are in for some tough times …

Connecting to free Wi-Fi can be extremely frustrating .
But WeFi , a three - year old start up , says it has solved the problem .
Ten million Wi-Fi access points have been recognized and classified so far onto a map says the Fairfax , Virginia - based company .
About one million users are currently using the company 's service , it claims .
Most Wi-Fi enabled devices show users a set of available connections and allow them to choose .
But the process can be a bit of a hit - or - miss as users have to try on different connections to see what works best .
WeFi claims its software will automatically connect users to the best available free wireless connection .
After the first user discovers and successfully connects to a previously unknown hotspot , the software maps the spot and uses the connectivity data to make it easier for future users to log on .
The network is user - generated , which means as more users join in more access points are discovered and added to the community .
To get started users have to download the free software from WeFi , which is available in PC , Symbian and Windows Mobile versions .
The WeFi directory is the largest virtual global Wi -Fi network claims the company .
Members can also map and rank open hotspots in any location .
They can locate each other on the WeFi global map , send messages and share content .

We do n't need to tell you that the next president of the United States is going to have a lot to do .
He has to fix the economy , the environment and Wall Street .
And he 's going to have to explain the whole UFO thing to the U.S. public , if the Paradigm Research Group has its way .
The group , which says it is dedicated to ending the " government imposed Truth Embargo regarding an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race , " is launching a pressure campaign it hopes will force the government to fess up .
Its Million Fax on Washington campaign is just that : an initiative to bury the next president in faxes and mail , all of it demanding that the U.S. government reveal the truth about its alleged knowledge of UFO activity .
In an interview with Wired.com , Paradigm founder Stephen Bassett says that President Carter , who reported seeing a UFO in 1969 , signed off on two studies after taking office but that they were kept under wraps for national security reasons .
Bassett says reports of extraterrestrial sighting have been on the upswing since the end of the Cold War , creating pressure on the government to " disclose . "
" Witnesses are coming forward , " Bassett says , " and 50 percent of the U.S. public believes that this is real . "
Adding to the pressure is recent moves by other nations .
" You have the U.K. declassifying reports of extraterrestrial sightings , " Bassett says , " and members of the Mexican Air Force videotaping what they think are UFOs . "
He says China is also conducting UFO research , but France is the most likely nation to disclose unilaterally .
" They are a proud , independent people , " he explains .
" And they 're very sensitive to their legacy .
This is an area where they can take the lead . "
Extraterrestrial work is nothing new for Bassett , who in the 1990s studied at the Program for Extraordinary Experience Research in
Cambridge , Massachusetts .
( Laugh if you want , but the organization was founded by Dr. John Mack , a Pulitzer Prize - winning author and psychiatry professor at Harvard
Medical School ) .
In 1996 , Bassett founded Paradigm with the goal of
" using all means possible to confront the United States . "
In 1999 , he got political by founding the Extraterrestrial Phenomena
Political Action Committee , the first PAC in history to target the politics of UFO / ET phenomena .
Paradigm 's work has included supporting political candidates , lobbying for congressional hearings on extraterrestrials and hosting the annual X - Conference , an event designed to share collective knowledge about the government 's involvement with extraterrestrial phenomena .
Bassett says disclosure offers the incoming president an ideal chance to win over a tired , mistrustful public .
" You 're coming off eight years of an administration known for its secrecy , " he says .
" Disclosure is a way to break with the past and start fresh . "
He calls Barack Obama " an innocent on the issue " but says John McCain would have more to explain for .
" He 's been in Washington for a long time .
With all his military contacts , you have to wonder if he already knows . "
Bassett seems confident that his fax campaign will be a success , and is counting on viral marketing to help spread the word ( his Facebook group has only 76 members , but it 's early ) .
For Bassett , the big question is not whether disclosure will happen , but what will follow .
" It is going to be fascinating to watch the tug of war between the people and the government once this gets out , " he says .
" The people will want to know everything , but some of the information will be held for national security reasons . "
Bassett says disclosure would be the most profound event in human history .
" With all due respect to the Christ event , " it took a long time for that information to be disseminated .
" With this , the impact will be instant . "

It 's not all bailout negotiations , partisan recriminations , and White House meetings this week in Congress — our elected officials also found some time to pass the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008 .
Its name might suggest that the bill " settles " something , but it does not .
Instead , it gives the webcasters and the music labels still more time to hammer out a royalty compromise acceptable to all sides before a crippling new rate kicks in .
Still going ...
Remember all that heat and smoke from last year 's webcaster royalty inferno ?
Remember how even Congress got fitfully involved , threatening to pass some legislation to overturn the outrageous fees webcasters would have to pay ?
Remember how you thought that it was all some arcane dispute that would burn itself out soon and that could n't possibly keep going for a year and a half ?
Well ... it could .
And it did .
The music industry and the webcasters are , in fact , still negotiating a deal that would replace the one laid down from on high by the Moses - on - the - mountain figures over at the Copyright Royalty Board .
The judges — no doubt fine people who make excellent small talk and have superlative taste in wines — set a statutory rate for webcasters to pay for all that music they were streaming .
It turned out to be retroactive for a few years , too , since the proceeding had taken so long .
It also turned out to be really , really high .
Webcasters cried foul , especially Pandora founder Tim Westergren .
The CRB rate would bankrupt many webcasters , they said .
In the face of these claims ( and the threat of Congressional action to overturn the CRB rate ) , the music labels decided to negotiate a settlement of their own with the webcasters .
Certain fee caps were agreed upon and small webcasters were given a better deal , but the big players and SoundExchange ( which collects royalties for the major labels ) could n't agree on the all - important royalty rate .
( A separate deal between webcasters and the songwriters was reached earlier this year . )
Congress ' action this week gives the two sides more time to wrap up negotiations .
The Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008 passed the House on Saturday and the Senate today , and there 's no obvious reason why President Bush would refuse to sign it .
The bill extends the negotiation deadline until next February ; without it , the crippling CRB rates would go into effect quite soon .
Pandora has already said it would go out of business when it had to make its first royalty payment under the CRB rates .
Closing Pandora 's box
The bill was introduced only last week , and it came after both sides said that they were close to a deal .
But , according to Pandora 's Westergren , the National Association of Broadcasters tried to kill the bill when it was introduced .
" Yesterday , Congressman Jay Inslee , and several co-sponsors , introduced legislation to give us the extra time we need but the National Association of Broadcasters ( NAB ) , which represents radio broadcasters such as Clear Channel , has begun intensively pressuring lawmakers to kill the bill , " wrote Westergren on Pandora 's blog .
" We have just a day or two to keep this from collapsing .
This is a blatant attempt by large radio companies to suffocate the webcasting industry that is just beginning to offer an alternative to their monopoly of the airwaves . "
But the bill did pass both chambers of Congress and the royalty negotiations will continue for a few more months .
While radio broadcasters may have some incentive to kill off competition , the recording industry has no desire to see these businesses fail ; some money is better than none , after all .
The RIAA and SoundExchange actually worked with the webcasters to see the bill through , providing a serious lobbying counterpoint to the broadcasters .
In a statement issued Sunday night , SoundExchange boss John Simpson said that " this bill favors all webcasters and simulcasters — large and small .
It paves the way for SoundExchange to use the coming months to pursue helpful solutions that allow all services to focus on business development .
And , although there are no agreements yet , I am hopeful . "
The webcaster and the RIAA got their way ; perhaps the goodwill generated by actually working together on something will now carry the negotiations through to the end .
Human genitals are the most prized parts and can be used to attract wealth and increase fertility .
They are cooked and ground down for use with herbs and other ingredients .
A new UC Davis study says that people trying to help nature by designing corridors for wildlife need to think more naturally .
" Human beings tend to think in terms of regular , symmetrical structures , but nature can be much more irregular , " said UC Davis postdoctoral researcher Matthew Holland , the study 's lead author .
" We found that symmetrical systems of corridors may actually do less good for natural communities than designs with some randomness or asymmetry built in . "
Corridors are physical connections between disconnected fragments of plant and animal habitat .
A corridor can be as big as a swath of river and forest miles wide that links two national parks , or as small as a tunnel under an interstate highway .
Without such connections , animals cannot travel to food , water , mates and shelter .
Plants cannot disperse their pollen and seeds to maintain healthy , genetically diverse populations .
Designing and implementing corridors ( sometimes called corridor ecology or connectivity conservation ) is a new subfield in environmental science .
Holland 's research is among the first to help land managers and community planners designing corridors to know what will work and what will not .
Holland 's co-author is UC Davis theoretical ecologist Alan Hastings .
Hastings is one of the world 's mostly highly regarded experts in using mathematical models ( sets of equations ) to understand natural systems .
His analyses have shed light on environmental issues as diverse as salt marsh grass invasions in San Francisco Bay ; climate change and coral reefs ; and marine reserves and fish populations .
In 2006 , Hastings received the Robert H. MacArthur Award , the highest honor given by the Ecological Society of America .
GOLDEN , Colo . ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama sought on Tuesday to link his Republican rival to the turmoil sweeping Wall Street , and John McCain fired back that Obama had close ties to the troubled mortgage industry .
Obama accused McCain of being an opponent of government regulation who turned a blind eye to market recklessness and McCain answered back that Obama had taken big donations from mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
“ He put Fannie Mae ’s CEO ( chief executive ) , who helped create this problem , in charge of finding his vice president .
That ’s not change , that ’s what ’s broken in Washington , ” McCain said .
The biggest financial shake - up since the Great Depression -- with the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings , takeover of Merrill Lynch and the government takeover of the two mortgage giants , has taken center stage on the campaign trail as it further rattles Americans already grappling with high energy costs and a worsening job market .
Both Obama and McCain , his Republican rival in the November 4 election , took a populist tone in campaign speeches , blaming the crisis on greedy people who took excessive risks .
“ The news from Wall Street has shaken the American people ’s faith in our economy , ” Obama said in Golden , Colorado , where he pushed a plan for tighter regulations on Wall Street that he said would restore faith in the markets .
“ This is a major threat to our economy and its ability to create good - paying jobs and help working Americans pay their bills , save for their future and make their mortgage payments , ” said Obama , an Illinois senator .
McCain said workers ’ livelihoods had been put at “ great risk by the greed and mismanagement of Wall Street and Washington . ”
“ In my administration we ’re going to hold people on Wall Street responsible and we ’re going to enact and enforce reforms that make sure that these outrages -- and they are outrages -- never happen in the first place , ” McCain said to loud applause at a rally in Tampa , Florida .
As U.S. markets suffered their worst drop on Monday since the September 11 , 2001 , attacks in reaction to Lehman ’s bankruptcy and Merrill ’s sale , McCain joined Obama in embracing a push to clamp tighter rules on Wall Street .
RECENT CONVERT
Obama , who has long called for tighter financial regulations , lambasted McCain as a recent convert to the idea .
He likened McCain to President George W. Bush , with a history of showing a “ scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement . ”
“ John McCain can not be trusted to reestablish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason : he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it , ” Obama said .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
The Democratic candidate cited McCain ’s closeness to Phil Gramm , a former Texas senator and ardent free - market economist who spearheaded a 1999 law that loosened Depression - era laws to allow banks , investment houses and insurance firms to engage in each others ’ businesses .
The McCain campaign countered by highlighting the Arizona senator ’s past calls to rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two mortgage giants whose financial troubles prompted their takeover by the federal government .
“ Unlike Barack Obama , John McCain has been ahead of the curve in calling for reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Barack Obama has never proposed legislation ; he became interested in reform only when it became politically expedient , ” said Doug Holtz - Eakin , McCain ’s senior economic adviser .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
McCain also put forth a proposal on Tuesday to set up a commission like the one that investigated the September 11 attacks to study what led to the current U.S. financial crisis and offer solutions .
Obama ridiculed the idea , saying it amounted to “ passing the buck . ”
“ Here ’s the thing -- this is n’t 9/11 .
We know how we got into this mess , ” Obama said .
I love oatmeal .
I eat it for breakfast probably five days a week .
It 's a very healthy fuel to get your motor running for the day , plus it can be very tasty if it 's made well .
Whenever I find myself using something almost every day , I begin to wonder if I can't reduce the cost of it somehow .
This led me down the path of making my own instant oatmeal packets .
Could I make them as well as ( or even better than ) the instant Quaker Oats packets for a cheaper price ?
The answer is ... sort of .
For me ( and for anyone else who consistently eats oatmeal for breakfast ) , the answer is emphatically yes - you can make packets significantly cheaper and far tastier over the long haul .
For people who might eat oatmeal once a week or less , though , you 're likely better off buying the Quaker Oats packets .
Here 's the plan .
The Basic Recipe
All you really need to make your own basic oatmeal packets at home are instant ( ready to eat in one minute ) oatmeal , salt , and sealable baggies to store them in - you might also want sugar or another sweetener if you wish to pre-sweeten the oatmeal .
The procedure is really easy .
Just add 1 / 4 of a cup of the oats and a pinch of salt ( 1/8 of a teaspoon if you must measure it ) to each baggie .
Out of that container there , you 'd get about 48 bags .
I also like to pre-add a bit of sugar to it - about 1 /2 of a teaspoon .
You can choose to add none at all or add another sweetener like Splenda at your own discretion .
These will result in basic oatmeal packets very similar to the " regular " oatmeal packets sold by Quaker Oats .
If you like the basic oatmeal with no changes , this is a very cheap route to go - since you can re-use the baggies , the only recurring cost over a realistic timeframe is the oatmeal itself - a bag of sugar and a canister of salt will last you effectively forever with this recipe .
Flavoring It Up
Of course , I like to flavor it up .
On the left are the ingredients for cinnamon - raisin packets .
On the right are ingredients for blueberries & cream packets - dried blueberries and fat - free non-dairy creamer .
Why not powdered milk ?
It tends to potentially mold and have other bad effects if left in baggies for too long - Coffee Mate is an excellent substitute .
For my cinnamon - raisin packets , I just add about 1 / 4 of a teaspoon of cinnamon and about two dozen raisins to each bag .
For the blueberry packets , I add a tablespoon of the creamer and about a dozen and a half blueberries .
Perfect .
Here 's a finished blueberries and cream packet :
The nice part is you can basically make anything you want if you 're making your own packets .
You can experiment as your heart desires - any dried fruit pieces , any seasonings you can find - anything .
I 've actually made batches of cranberry oatmeal using dried cranberries in the past - I love it , but it 's not something you see sold on store shelves .
Adding the ingredients yourself make for tastier packets .
The pre-mixed packets that Quaker sells seem to use low - quality versions of the added ingredients .
For example , the dried blueberries in this packet are way better than the blueberries used in the Quaker Oats packets , resulting in a much tastier blueberry oatmeal .
Storing the packets is easy , too .
Just stuff the baggies into the oat canister .
That 'll hold 80 % of the baggies - just sit the rest next to them and eat those first .
Problem solved .
I Like It Thicker
One thing I do n't like about the Quaker Oats packet in the stores is that the oatmeal is almost always too thin .
Personally , I like thick oatmeal , the kind that reminds me of the stuff my great grandma used to make at her house .
Since you 're making your own baggies , you can make it nice and thick , too .
All you have to do is puree some of the dry oatmeal in your handy - dandy blender .
Put in about a quarter of a cup at a time and put it on puree for about ten seconds .
You end up with oatmeal powder .
Then , just add a tablespoon of this powder to each baggie to make it thicker .
I actually add two tablespoons to each baggie - that makes it really , really thick - just how I like it !
Here 's the bowl of thick blueberries and cream oatmeal I had for breakfast this morning :
I just dumped the baggie into the bowl ( saving the baggie for reuse , of course ) , added about a quarter of a cup of skim milk , and microwaved it for about sixty seconds .
Nice and thick and warm and delicious .
Cost Analysis
I wound up making 42 baggies with this batch .
Normally , one would make 48 baggies out of a normal - sized canister of instant oatmeal , but I pureed enough of the oatmeal to make only 42 .
15 of the baggies were blueberries and cream and 27 were cinnamon - raisin .
Unsurprisingly , there were a lot of ingredients left over :
I used all of the oatmeal and all of the blueberries , but I still had almost a full container of salt , an almost full container of cinnamon , an almost full container of sugar , a 2/3 full container of Coffee Mate , half a box of raisins , and 58 Glad baggies .
This means that if I were to make a second batch , I 'd only need to replace the oatmeal and the blueberries .
Since I can reuse the baggies and I have enough salt and sugar to last effectively forever , those are sunk startup costs - after that , you just need to replace oatmeal and the flavorings when you need to - and most of the flavorings will last for multiple batches .
Batch 1 - More Expensive
Of course , the first batch was a bit more expensive per packet than just buying the Quaker Oats packet .
Here 's my receipt from Fareway for the stuff for 42 homemade packets :
The cost per homemade packet during the first run is $ 0.46 per packet .
The cost would have been $ 0.43 per packet had I not ground up some of the packets to thicken some of the others .
We 'll figure up costs for future runs in a minute .
What about the time cost ?
It took me about thirty minutes of mindless work to make these packets .
I spent the entire time making them on the phone with my mother - I just conversed with her while my hands were busy with ... well , busywork .
Thus , I do n't consider the time sink to be significant .
How about the Quaker Oats packet ?
To control for location and store differences , I bought a box of packets at Fareway to compare the price :
The cost per packet for Quaker Oats is $ 0.30 per packet .
Yep , the prepackaged ones are cheaper at first .
But let 's keep looking .
Batch 2 and Future Batches - Less Expensive
The kicker with making your own packets is that they get cheaper on future runs .
You do n't have to buy the sugar , the salt , or the baggies any more .
Let 's say I made another identical batch to the one above - 42 packets .
Using what I have on hand , I only have to repurchase the oats - $ 2.99 - and the blueberries - $ 3.29 .
The second homemade batch has a cost per packet of $ 0.15 - way cheaper than the prepared packets .
In fact , averaging the two costs ends up with an average cost per homemade packet after two runs being almost identical to the cost of buying prepared packets - $ 0.30 .
If I had not ground up some of the oatmeal to make thicker packets , it would have been cheaper - $ 0.28 per packet .
Runs beyond the second further reduce the cost .
And when you consider the flexibility of your homemade packets - and the fact that they taste far better - it becomes a pretty clear bargain after a while .
Reducing the Costs
Even more important , I did n't optimize my ingredient purchases very well .
A bit of optimization shaves off a lot of the cost .
The biggest way to save more money is to buy a giant canister of the oatmeal rather than a fairly small canister .
Buying the oatmeal in bulk cuts down on the cost per packet significantly .
Similar logic applies to some of the ingredients - if you particularly like blueberries in your oatmeal , for instance , buying them in bulk cuts down on costs , too .
Also , re-use the baggies .
There 's no reason not to here - you 're only storing dry ingredients in them .
Use them again .
Another tip - buy snack - sized baggies instead of sandwich baggies .
I bought sandwich baggies in the example above because the store 's baggie selection was small - snack baggies are cheaper , easier to store , and hold an oatmeal packet easily .
All of these tips can trim the cost significantly , particularly on future batches .
Conclusion
If you or your family eat a lot of oatmeal , making your own packets is a cost - saver over the long haul - plus they make for tastier packets .
In our house , I eat oatmeal four to five times a week , plus my son eats it twice a week and my wife perhaps once a week .
That makes eight packets a week .
In ten weeks , homemade packets become cheaper per packet .
In twenty weeks , we 're now saving , on average , a dime for every packet we 've eaten - $ 16 .
After that , it 's just gravy - another $ 1 or so each week saved while eating better oatmeal packets .
The key , though , is that your family eats a lot of oatmeal .
If they do n't , then making your own packets probably wo n't be cost - effective for you .

Nicole Colson reports on the Bush administration 's beneath - the - radar push to lock in conservative regulatory changes before a new president takes over .
GEORGE W. BUSH may have less than 70 days left in the White House , but it appears he 's intent on doing as much damage as possible on his way out the door .
As the New York Times put it in an editorial on Election Day :
President Bush 's aides have been scrambling to change rules and regulations on the environment , civil liberties and abortion rights , among others -- few for the good .
Most presidents put on a last - minute policy stamp , but in Mr. Bush 's case , it is more like a wrecking ball .
We fear it could take months , or years , for the next president to identify , and then undo all of the damage .
The push is on now because many regulations go into effect 30 to 60 days after they are finalized .
If they are n't in effect when the next president takes office , the new president can simply not put them into practice -- as Bush did with many rules finalized at the end of the Clinton administration .
But , as Reuters reported :
" If [ new regulations ] are in effect [ when Obama takes office ] , it will be hard for the next administration to undo them , and in any case , this may not be the top priority for a new president , " said Matt Madia of OMB Watch , which monitors the White House Office of Management and Budget , through which these proposed regulations must pass .
" This is typical , " Madia said of the administration 's welter of 11th - hour rules .
" It 's a natural reaction to knowing that you 're almost out of power . "
Short of actions taken by the courts and potential lawsuits , the new administration 's option would be to restart the rule - making process -- which can take a long time to complete .
In preparation for the coming change of power , Bush 's chief of staff Joshua Bolten sent a memo to regulatory agencies in May telling them to come up with any proposed rule changes by June in order to have them in place by November .
According to the Times , " This , Mr. Bolten explained , was to avoid a mad dash for midnight regulations -- those last - minute tweaks to federal rules made in the twilight of a departing administration .
Of course , room would be made for ' extraordinary circumstances , ' Mr. Bolten wrote . "
But according to OMB Watch , " it appears there are a lot of ' extraordinary circumstances ' to be found . "
As the Washington Post reported on October 31 :
The new rules would be among the most controversial deregulatory steps of the Bush era and could be difficult for his successor to undo .
Some would ease or lift constraints on private industry , including power plants , mines and farms .
Those and other regulations would help clear obstacles to some commercial ocean - fishing activities , ease controls on emissions of pollutants that contribute to global warming , relax drinking - water standards and lift a key restriction on mountaintop coal mining ...
As many as 90 new regulations are in the works , and at least nine of them are considered " economically significant " because they impose costs or promote societal benefits that exceed $ 100 million annually .
They include new rules governing employees who take family - and medical - related leaves , new standards for preventing or containing oil spills and a simplified process for settling real estate transactions ...
The burst of activity has made this a busy period for lobbyists who fear that industry views will hold less sway after the elections .
The doors at the New Executive Office Building have been whirling with corporate officials and advisers pleading for relief or , in many cases , for hastened decision making .
SOME OF these lame - duck regulations have been in the works for months , like those expected to be announced by Michael Leavitt , secretary of Health and Human Services .
Abortion rights advocates have warned since August that Leavitt seemed near to announcing new rules that not only uphold the right of doctors and other health care providers to refuse to perform abortions , but define abortion so broadly that it would also allow health care professionals to opt out of providing basic medical care like prescribing or dispensing contraceptives , including emergency contraception , birth control pills and IUDs .
Leavitt has since claimed that it was simply a misunderstanding .
" An early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review , " he wrote in August .
" It contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives , somehow defining them as abortion .
Not true . "
However , pro-choice activists are right to remain skeptical .
As lawyer and bioethicist R. Alta Charo told the Washington Post , " Until the regulation removes the redefinition of abortion and it clearly states that it deals solely with abortion ( and not with any other procedure , nor with any refusals based on the nature of the patient , such as single or gay ) , I would not be satisfied . "
Leavitt claims the new regulation is necessary to " protect " medical providers who wish follow their " consciences in not participating in abortion . "
But as the New York Times points out , several existing federal laws already uphold the right of medical professionals to refuse to participate in actual abortions .
The changes , say the Times , " would extend the so - called right to refuse to a wide range of health care workers and activities , including abortion referrals , unbiased counseling and provision of birth control pills or emergency contraception , even for rape victims . "
ALSO POTENTIALLY devastating are the host of business - friendly environmental rules that the Bush administration looks likely to ram through in the coming weeks .
The New York Times speculates about a number of draconian changes that could be in the works , including dismantling of federal review of the impact of projects on threatened species ; a weakening of the Clean Air Act ; and a loosening of regulations on the dumping of toxic waste .
As the Times notes :
Mr. Bush 's secretary of the interior , Dirk Kempthorne , has recently carved out significant exceptions to regulations requiring expert scientific review of any federal project that might harm endangered or threatened species ( one consequence will be to relieve the agency of the need to assess the impact of global warming on at - risk species ) .
The department also is rushing to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list -- again .
The wolves were re-listed after a federal judge ruled the government had not lived up to its own recovery plan .
In coming weeks , we expect the Environmental Protection Agency to issue a final rule that would weaken a program created by the Clean Air Act , which requires utilities to install modern pollution controls when they upgrade their plants to produce more power .
The agency is also expected to issue a final rule that would make it easier for coal - fired power plants to locate near national parks in defiance of long - standing congressional mandates to protect air quality in areas of special natural or recreational value .
Interior also is awaiting EPA 's concurrence on a proposal that would make it easier for mining companies to dump toxic mine wastes in valleys and streams .
And while no rules changes are at issue , the interior department also has been rushing to open up millions of acres of pristine federal land to oil and gas exploration .
One proposed Interior Department rule would erode protections for endangered species in favor of mining interests .
When the proposal drew more than 300,000 comments from the public , Bush administration officials said they planned to " review " those comments in a week - - a blatant move to " rubber stamp " the new rule .
As the Washington Post noted , the proposed environmental regulations are so blatant that even some conservative groups are joining with environmental campaigners in an effort to block them :
Even some free - market organizations have joined conservation groups to urge a moratorium on last - minute rules proposed by the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency , among others .
" The Bush administration has had eight years in office and has issued more regulations than any administration in history , " said Eli Lehrer of the Competitive Enterprise Institute .
" At this point , in the current economic climate , it would be especially harmful to push through ill - considered regulations in the final days of the administration . "
There are other giveaways to big business being planned .
One comes in the form of a Department of Labor rule on calculating the severity of on - the - job risks , specifically exposure to toxic chemicals .
That rule , according to OMB Watch , " sped through Labor Secretary Elaine Chao 's office without consultation with occupational health experts in the department .
The rule is based largely on a report prepared by an outside consultant paid $ 349,000 by the department .
That report has not been disclosed to the public . "
The Bush administration also plans on doing even more damage to civil liberties -- after eight years of such attacks .
One rule likely to be enacted is a Justice Department plan to allow the FBI to engage in spying on Americans even where there is no evidence of wrongdoing .
Under the new regulation , civil liberties expert Juan Cole explained on Salon.com in July , FBI agents can instead :
establish a terrorist profile or pattern of behavior and attributes and , on the basis of that profile , start investigating an individual or group .
Agents would be permitted to ask " open-ended questions " concerning the activities of Muslim Americans and Arab - Americans .
A person 's travel and occupation , as well as race or ethnicity , could be grounds for opening a national security investigation .
As the New York Times points out , one last - minute change that the Bush administration wo n't be making is to shut down the U.S. prison camp in Guantánamo Bay Cuba , " the most shameful symbol of his administration 's disdain for the rule of law . "
300,000 useless knee surgeries annually , costing $ 1.5B , continue in the US because a ’ 02 study finding them useless " was criticized as flawed . "
Now a new study finds the same results but " also has weaknesses . "
We sure would n’t want anyone to change beliefs or behavior because of a criticizable study – not when there are all those impossible - to - criticize studies out there .
The news :
One of the most common surgical procedures performed in the United States — arthroscopy to treat arthritis in the knee — is useless . …
[ The ] findings are being published in today ’s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine . …
The study marks the second time a major study has questioned the operations , which can cost about $ 5,000 and are done on hundreds of thousands of Americans each year .
In 2002 , a study found the operations were no better than a sham procedure for arthritis .
A year later , based on that and other studies , Medicare stopped paying for the operations for severe arthritis of the knee , and the number of claims for the procedure plunged .
But the 2002 study was criticized as flawed :
All the operations were done by one surgeon , and the subjects , who were all men , tended to be older than the typical patient .
As a result , many surgeons continued to perform the procedures .
Feagan says that as many as a third of the estimated 950,000 arthroscopic knee surgeries performed each year in the United States are probably still being done for arthritis , which affects about 27 million Americans . …
The new study was designed to avoid the shortcomings of the earlier research ; it involved men and women with an average age of 60 , which is more typical .
All patients received standard nonsurgical treatment , including physical therapy , painkillers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen , glucosamine supplements and injections to lubricate the joint .
Eighty - six of the patients also underwent arthroscopic surgery , which involves inserting instruments through tiny incisions to clean out any loose debris and smooth out the joint .
Tests done every six months for the next two years showed that both groups improved , reporting less pain and stiffness and more mobility .
But the patients who did not have the surgery fared just as well as those who did .
…
Whether the new study will settle the debate remains unclear .
In an editorial accompanying the study , Robert Marx of the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York argued that the new study also has weaknesses , and that there might be patients with knee arthritis who might benefit , such as those who also have torn cartilage .
Feagan said that argument could result in continued overuse of the surgery .
A second study involving 991 patients in the same issue of the journal found that many patients with arthritis in their knees also have small cartilage tears but that the tears are not the source of their pain .
Holding a high standard for what counts as a good study does not make you more evidence - based , and it is not a good thing if the factors you implicitly rely on in the absense of a " good " study ( e.g. , " all else equal a doc recommendation is a good sign " ) are even less reliable than the " bad " studies you reject .

GAMMA QUADRANT UPDATE … .
What ’s that , you say ?
Barack Obama is palling around with terrorists ?
That is so last week .
Here ’s a more recent tour of the Gamma Quadrant :
One : Bill Ayers really wrote Obama ’s book , Dreams From My Father .
Two : Obama had an underage , gay affair with a pedophile .
Three :
It ’s entirely possible that Obama was involved with bombing the South African rugby team while he was at Columbia in the 80s .
Four : Obama , Bill Ayers , and Jeremiah Wright ( via a chain of associations too Rube Goldbergesque to summarize ) were engaged in a conspiracy to teach Pan - African “ cultural nationalism ” to Chicago schoolkids during the 90s .
Five : Obama was having an affair with one of his fundraiser babes in 2004 until Michelle found out and banished the woman to a “ little Caribbean island . ”
There ’s no evidence yet that Obama was actually the secret love child of Malcolm X , but I ’m sure we ’ll find it soon enough if we just keep digging .
President Donald Trump on Tuesday did n’t clearly condemn white supremacist groups and their role in violence in some American cities this summer , branding it solely a “ left - wing ” problem and telling one far - right extremist group to “ stand back and stand by . ”
“ Almost everything I see is from the left wing , not from the right wing , " said Trump , whose exchange with Democrat Joe Biden left the extremist group Proud Boys celebrating what some of its members saw as tacit approval .
He was responding to a question from debate moderator Chris Wallace , who asked the president if he would condemn white supremacist and militia groups that have showed up at some protests .
Wallace specifically mentioned Kenosha , Wisconsin , where a white teenager was charged with killing two protesters during demonstrations over the police shooting of Jacob Blake , a Black man .
Trump has repeatedly blamed “ antifa , ” which stands for the anti-fascist movement .
“ I 'm willing to do anything .
I want to see peace , " Trump said .
“ What do you want to call them ?
Give me a name . "
“ Proud Boys , ” Democrat Joe Biden chimed in , referencing a far - right extremist group that has shown up at protests in the Pacific Northwest .
The male - only group of neo - fascists describes themselves as “ western chauvinists , ” and they have been known to incite street violence .
“ Proud Boys , stand back and stand by , ” Trump said .
“ But I ’ll tell you what , I ’ll tell you what , somebody ’s got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right - wing problem . ”
Trump , a Republican , has tried to tie incidents of violence that have accompanied largely peaceful protests to Biden and the Democrats , running on a “ law and order " message that warns people wo n't be safe under a Democratic president .
It 's a message aimed squarely at white suburban voters , including women who voted for Trump in 2016 but may not do so again .
“ What we saw was a dog whistle through a bullhorn , ” California Sen .
Kamala Harris , Biden ’s running mate , said on MSNBC after the debate .
“ Donald Trump is not pretending to be anything other than what he is : Someone who will not condemn white supremacists . ”
Proud Boys leaders and supporters later celebrated the president ’s words on social media .
A channel on Telegram , an instant messaging service , with more than 5,000 of the group ’s members posted “ Stand Back ” and “ Stand By ” above and below the group ’s logo .
Biden has said he decided to run for president after Trump said there were “ very fine people " on both sides of a 2017 protest led by white supremacists in Charlottesville , Virginia , where a counterprotester was killed .
Trump said Tuesday that Biden was afraid to say the words “ law and order " and pressed him to give examples of law enforcement groups that back his campaign .
Biden did n't name any , but said he 's in favor of “ law and order with justice , where people get treated fairly . "
Biden called antifa “ an idea , not an organization . "
That 's similar to what FBI Director Christopher Wray told a congressional panel last week , though Trump has called on the federal government to characterize the group as a terrorist organization .
Wray said white supremacists and anti-government extremists have been responsible for most of the recent deadly attacks by extremist groups within the U.S .
At another point in the debate , when discussing a Trump administration move to end racial sensitivity training in the federal government , Biden directly called Trump a racist .
He also accused him of trying to sow racist hatred and racist division in the country .
Nationally , the number rose by about 512,000 in 2007 compared with an annual average increase of nearly a million since the beginning of the decade .
New Jersey and Illinois fell from the list of states with the biggest gain in immigrants , displaced by Arizona and Pennsylvania .
“ New York City may be drawing in fewer fresh - off - the - boat  or , more accurately , fresh - off - the - airplane  Hispanic arrivals , ” said Nancy Foner , a sociology professor at Hunter College .
“ At the same time , there ’s been movement out of New York City among longer - term Latino immigrant residents to suburbs , exurbs and even further afield in search of cheaper housing and better schools and in response to job opportunities elsewhere in the country .
“ Even when economic times are rough in New York , they are even more difficult in the Caribbean and Latin America , so people there still want to come to the U.S. , ” she said .
“ And many continue to head for New York , where they have friends and family .
And jobs , although perhaps less plentiful and harder to get , are still available . ”
The Census Bureau ’s annual American Community Survey of social , economic and housing statistics also found that about half the residents of metropolitan Los Angeles and Miami over age 5 ( and about one in five Americans in that age group nationally ) do not speak English at home and that about 31 percent of immigrants were born in Mexico .
Median home values rose in price by 2 percent from 2006 to 2007 , the lowest increase in several years , the survey said .
Homeowners with mortgages in California and New Jersey recorded the highest median monthly housing costs ( $ 2,314 and $ 2,278 , respectively ) .
The share of owners and renters paying more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs generally dipped in New York City and rose in the suburbs .
Even with gas prices more than doubling from 2000 to 2007 , the proportion of commuters driving to work alone in 2007  76 percent  remained the same as when the decade began .
America , now you 've done it .
You just elected an African - American from Chicago President , and traveling with him to the White House will be his good friend Rahm Emanuel .
Congressman Emanuel will probably be the new Chief of Staff , which is quietly the most important job in most administrations .
Emanuel is the powerful young former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , and his reputation is that of a political bruiser .
The Emanuel selection demonstrates that unlike Clinton in 1992 , Obama is not fucking around .
The Chief of Staff runs the White House internally , and this is a signal that Obama 's transition will not be beset with the public infighting and embarrassing selections of the Clinton takeover .
Emanuel is perfect for the role , because it's not a particularly public one , and Emanuel is a dirty - mouthed vicious partisan .
It also sounds like Obama 's going to work hard to get Congress in line with his Administration early on , which he 'll need to do , once again , to avoid the mistakes of Bill Clinton , who got pushed around by old Democratic party leaders in the Senate and House .
Also , yes , Hope time is over .
All the complaints that Obama 's an aloof , vague hope - monger who wo n't accomplish anything , Jimmy Carter - style ?
We 're going to see those stories switch to " Obama 's a mean , hard , Chicago - style hack who 'll run the White House with an iron fist . "
Rahm 's brother is , of course , super - agent Ari Emanuel .
The Emanuel brothers are a treat , and we look forward to them enraging Conservatives almost as much as we look forward to four hilarious years of Vice President Joe Biden .
But it was unclear Friday whether the Treasury Department would stand behind any deal , particularly after the Bush administration took control of the nation ’s two largest mortgage finance companies , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , only days ago .
Treasury officials let it be known that , this time , they would not be putting any taxpayer money on the line .
People with knowledge of the thinking of the Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , said Friday that he was opposed to providing taxpayer money to push through a deal that could save Lehman .
In any event , some sort of resolution is expected over the weekend .
The test will come if potential buyers balk at a purchase without the Fed ’s backing .
If that were to happen , federal officials would be left to evaluate what risks a sudden collapse of Lehman might pose to the broader financial system .
The rapid decline of Lehman underscores that investors remain unnerved , with rumors about an institution ’s problems quickly becoming a self - fulfilling prophecy , as other banks seek to distance themselves to limit their financial exposure .
At this point , Lehman has few options .
Its stock ’s relentless decline has convinced Richard S. Fuld Jr. , Lehman ’s chief executive , that the time has come to let go .
Image Suitors of Lehman Brothers are seeking help from the Federal Reserve to help make an acquisition palatable .
Credit ... Michael Falco for The New York Times
“ He ’s shell - shocked , but he knows he has to sell , ” said one person who recently spoke to Mr. Fuld .
Lehman , which employs nearly 25,000 people around the world , tried to convince investors on Wednesday that it could survive on its own by selling divisions and spinning off commercial real estate assets , but its stock continued to decline .
Any buyer would almost certainly cut thousands of jobs as it absorbed Lehman ’s operations , which include a valuable money management division .

J.S. Mill said “ Not all conservatives are stupid people , but most stupid people are conservatives . ”
A century and change later , little has changed .
Let ’s drop the niceties and psychobabble and confront the simple fact that the Republican / McCain base are largely morons .
Before you say it , yes , I freely acknowledge that supporters of the Republican party and McCain in particular might have IQs that are as much as 10 points higher than those we ’ve seen at their rallies .
But none of this refutes Mill ’s premise , and he is clearly right on this one .
People who believe that men walked side by side with Dinosaurs are almost invariably “ conservative . ”
While you could find stupid , ignorant people at an Obama rally , you ’d have a hard time finding people who believe McCain is actually Russian plant of a member of the KKK , the rough analog to what we see in the now infamous “ he ’s an Arab ” question and a dozen other clips in which Obama is called a terrorist .
And in a tough election year , Mill ’s “ stupid people ” have become the fulcrum and the face of Republican strategy .
Are these clips an unfair representation of a big piece of the Republican base ?
We are never short of stupid people , so if most stupid people support McCain and the Republican party , our “ conservatives , ” then surely these people are a large part of his base .
And certainly , this dialogue is played out in the heartland thousands of times a day , without video cameras , camera shyness and youtube becoming involved .
There are a lot of morons who support the Republican party , therefore the moron is a crucial part of their base .
Polls have shown that as many as one in ten Americans believe , or claim to believe , that Obama is a Muslim .
If we assume that the majority of these people are Republicans and add that to the fact that well under half of America is Republican , the picture of what exactly constitutes the “ Republican base ” becomes pretty clear .
No pollaster has asked how many believe Obama to be a muslin .
Quoth the wiki :
Muslin is most typically a closely - woven unbleached or white cloth , produced from corded cotton yarn .
Wide muslin is called “ sheeting ” .
It is often used to make dresses or curtains but may also be used to complement foam for bench padding .
Muslin breathes well , and is a good choice of material for clothing meant for hot , dry climates .
Now add in those who believe that Obama supports a radical racist and a terrorist movement that happened 40 years ago , on the basis of 90 seconds of clips from his church and attending a coffee event with a guy who blew up a statue .
Clearly a large chunk of McCain ’s support comes from people who believe Obama is a Muslim , a radical black militant , a friend to domestic terrorists and / or a cloth often used to make curtains .
And McCain ’s campaign is reaching out desperately and more importantly , overtly to this real base .
Sarah Palin ’s role in the campaign has primarily been one of mascot .
She ’s a baby factory who ca n’t be bothered with much reading and research .
She has kids to get to hockey practice , poorly aimed , First Dude urine to wipe up and guns to clean .
She ’s like you !
And are you gonna let some New York eggheads tell you that you ca n’t be VP and eventually President ?!
Part of the reason stupid people are drawn to conservatism is that the intelligent conservatives have always been willing to indulge and support ignorance in order to conserve their own wealth and power .
Gomer - Joe gets a mailbox full of direct mail about how Obama is closely woven to terrorists and went to a Muslim school and hours of talk radio on similar subjects so he can wallow in stupidity , fear and hatred .
Thurston gets a PO box in Grand Caymen and does n’t have to pay taxes .
But it ’s unlikely that in Mill ’s day the veneer of conservatism in the public sphere was an open celebration of ignorance .
The uneducated and the “ stupid people ” have not only been catered to here and scared there , in the usual way .
Now , they are brought to the forefront .
Palin is the culmination of the progress of the stupid conservative from beast of burden , to Red Nosed Reindeer .
Contrary to popular cliche , it ’s not a Capra movie come to life .
Mr. Smith , though naive and idealistic , was fascinated by history and law and triumphed by using his knowledge of them .
Palin is the mascot of the functionally illiterate and represents the idea that they should triumph by affirmative action .
For the real core of the Republican base , the fact that she wo n’t admit to reading newspapers and knows nothing about the Supreme Court , is a badge of honor .
She speaks and thinks as they do and is ignorant of the same things .
Her ignorance proves that any knowledge beyond that which is possessed by the ignorant or stupid is irrelevant and pretentious .
What kind of an elitist needs to know much more about politics , law and economics than ( eventual ) President Palin herself ?
Trig has been thrust in as the mascot ’s mascot .
Even when pregnancy plays out in the worst case scenario , it must be carried to term .
Trig is waved about as the pro-life flag and an even deeper statement of values .
As always , the undercurrent to the pro-life message is that sex for pleasure is to be punished .
Sex has consequences .
Now , we might be able to prevent many of these consequences like , AIDS and other STDs , HPV , unwanted pregnancy and severely disabled children .
But there is always some convoluted reason to prohibit everything from a married couple taking a mulligan , rather than being forced into servitude to a fetus that will one day be a disabled child , to giving a child an HPV vaccine to prevent her from getting cancer one day .
God ’s punishment must be unhindered .
And unless you have the means to raise a disabled child yourself , well , you had better not tempt your dad into raping you .
Further below the surface is a statement of what exactly about life should be valued .
Certainly not intellectual pursuits , taking a broad interest in the world through travel , or exploring our or any other culture .
Palin , like Bush before , has made it to middle age without ever needing a passport .
The life that is to be valued so highly is one of breeding , church , TV ( provided most channels are locked ) and a glass of water on the side for dippin . ’
Another couple might choose to work for a child with the capacity to value art or science , rather than deliberately developing a child who will never move past watching “ Dora The Explorer ” and eating seven course dinners consisting only of a series of Happy Meals with a different toy in each box .
Such a couple ( never mind a single woman ) is the enemy .
They must be denied that choice because their assessment of what makes life valuable is against God , who tells us that anyone who fears him is better than anyone who does n’t .
The value of human life ends at the limitations of a downy .
Those who value something more are to be supplanted at the top ( superficially ) and stifled at the bottom .
Anything approaching intelligent discourse is to be discredited as liberal - biased elitism .
The promise is a parody of socialism , in which nobody is allowed to think more deeply or know more than the stupid - conservative base .
It is , of course , as empty a promise as the one to overturn Roe v. Wade , or to fight the cheap labor coming in illegally from Mexico .
The elites will send their children to prep-school , rather than Jesus camp , as always .
The stupid people , however , are being offered their biggest ever box of toys in the world of politics .
I do n’t think it will work this time around , but the fact that the presidential race is even close , given the state of the country , proves it to be a winning strategy .
My only hope for the future is that the Green Party will recruit Trig Palin .

You knew that W & Co. would n’t go gently into that good night , did n’t you ?
Please .
We ’re talking about the people who brought us precooked intelligence , Guantanamo , torture and extraordinary rendition .
Who developed bizarre legal doctrines , asserting that the commander in chief is allowed to ignore federal law , and the vice president does n’t “ belong ” to the executive branch .
Who enthusiastically dismantled long - standing regulatory frameworks and who still insist ( as George W. Bush did last week ) that “ too much ” government regulation is our main problem , even as the economic crisis deepens .
You really did n’t think these guys would exit meekly , did you ?
Do n’t expect anything undignified , like a Cheney - engineered coup ( sorry , conspiracy theorists ) .
But the administration can -- and will -- hamstring the incoming Obama team just as effectively with a raft of poisonous eleventh - hour rules and regulations .
Advertisement
Pick your issue .
The environment ?
A Bush administration rule transmitted on Nov. 4 hands over responsibility for assessing the environmental impact of federal ocean management decisions to advisory councils made up primarily of people tied to the commercial fishing industry -- who often have a financial stake in the outcome .
Workers ’ rights ?
A new rule ( effective Jan. 18 ) would limit workers ’ ability to take leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act .
Worker and road safety ?
A rule announced Nov. 16 will allow trucking companies to require drivers to spend 11 consecutive hours behind the wheel .
Gun control ?
On election day , the administration put forward a rule to end the 25 - year - old ban on carrying loaded weapons in national parks .
Other last - minute rules the White House is trying to ram through would allow federal and state law enforcement agencies to monitor and share information on the activities of individuals deemed merely to be “ suspicious , ” ease rules on dumping coal mining waste into rivers and streams , and further limit women ’s access to contraceptives and abortions from federally funded medical providers .
These rules can be enacted by the outgoing Bush administration with relative ease and speed , but reversing them will be far more difficult for the Obama administration : extensive study , notice and comment requirements mean that reversals may take several years , during which a lot of damage will have been done .
Bush also has signed more than 250 executive orders since taking office .
Some are innocuous ; others , not so much ( permitting the use of interrogation techniques most experts consider torture , for instance ) .
Some are still classified .
The Obama transition team will need to go through these with a fine - tooth comb , identifying executive orders that require immediate change or reversal .
Advertisement
Even more complicated , Justice Department lawyers in hundreds of pending cases are still advancing the legal theories developed by the Bush administration ’s political appointees .
The Obama team will need to carefully review every case .
( Otherwise , imagine the mess if President Obama announces on Jan. 21 that his administration will never sanction torture , but lower - ranking career lawyers in the executive branch continue , in pending litigation , to advance the same old Bush administration arguments defending “ enhanced interrogation . ” )
The administration also appears to be seeking the last - minute conversion of some political appointee job slots to career civil service positions .
If Bush appointees can “ burrow ” into the civil service , Obama is more or less stuck with them .
Before Bush ’s inauguration , Clinton staffers allegedly removed all the Ws from White House keyboards .
In a new twist , the Bush administration appears to be trying to leave a lot of hidden Ws behind .
This , incidentally , is why -- contrary to some net - roots hopes -- Clinton administration veterans also wo n’t be going gently into that good night .
“ Change ” is great , but it is difficult to implement when you ’re constantly stepping on bureaucratic land mines .
Obama needs people who understand the federal rule - making process , who know why the Office of Management and Budget can halt the secretary of State ’s best - laid plans , who know which obscure Justice Department offices are the likely repository of crucial information , and who can undertake a rapid bureaucratic de-mining operation .
And virtually the only Democrats under 65 who know these things are Clinton administration veterans .

Obama has an ambitious agenda , but housecleaning will come first .
Keep asking for change -- but it may take a while for Obama to sweep all those little Ws out the door .

Sarah Palin is the perfect exclamation point to the Bush years .
We ’ve lived through nearly two terms of an administration that believed it could create its own reality :
“ Deficits do n’t matter . ” “ Brownie , you ’re doing a heckuva job . ”
“ Those weapons of mass destruction must be somewhere . ”
Now comes Ms. Palin , a smiling , bubbly vice - presidential candidate who travels in an alternate language universe .
For Ms. Palin , such things as context , syntax and the proximity of answers to questions have no meaning .
In her closing remarks at the vice - presidential debate Thursday night , Ms. Palin referred earnestly , if loosely , to a quote from Ronald Reagan .
He had warned that if Americans were n’t vigilant in protecting their freedom , they would find themselves spending their “ sunset years telling our children and our children ’s children what it was like in America when men were free . ”
What Ms. Palin did n’t say was that the menace to freedom that Reagan was talking about was Medicare .
As the historian Robert Dallek has pointed out , Reagan “ saw Medicare as the advance wave of socialism , which would ‘ invade every area of freedom in this country . ’ ”
Number of juveniles held at Guantanamo almost twice official Pentagon figure Andy Worthington
Published : Friday November 21 , 2008
Print This Email This Canadian national Omar Khadr is still being held at Guantanamo Bay .
Accused of murder , Khadr was captured in Afghanistan in 2002 when he was 15 .
On Sunday , the Pentagon admitted that 12 juveniles -- those under the age of 18 at the time their alleged crimes took place -- have been held at Guantanamo Bay ( as opposed to the figure of eight that was submitted to the UN in May ) .
But a RAW STORY count , drawn from the Pentagon 's own records , reveals that the total number of juveniles held at Guantanamo is at least 22 -- nearly double the official Pentagon figure .
In a submission to the 48th Session of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child ( PDF ) , the Pentagon claimed that it had only held eight juveniles during the life of the Guantanamo Bay prison .
It acknowledged that three Afghans under the age of 16 were released in January 2004 ( as reported in the New York Times ) , stated that another three juveniles were repatriated between 2004 and 2006 and claimed that it was only holding two prisoners who were juveniles at the time of their capture : the Canadian Omar Khadr and the Afghan Mohamed Jawad , who are both facing a trial by Military Commission .
The much - criticized Commission was created by the Defense Department as part of " terror trials " conceived in the wake of the 9/11 attacks .
Last week , the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas , based at the University of California , issued a report pointing out that , contrary to the Pentagon 's assertions , at least 12 prisoners were juveniles at the time of their capture .
The report correctly stated that , in addition to Omar Khadr and Mohamed Jawad , Mohamed El - Gharani , a Saudi resident born to parents from Chad , was still imprisoned .
Just 14 years old when he was seized in October 2001 , El - Gharani had traveled to Pakistan to study information technology , but had been rounded up in a random raid on a mosque , tortured in Pakistani custody and then held in U.S. detention , first in Afghanistan , and then in Guantanamo .
The report also asserted that the Pentagon had forgotten to include Yasser Talal al - Zahrani .
Al - Zahrani , a Saudi national , was 17 when he was seized in Afghanistan , andwas one of three prisoners who died in Guantanamo ( apparently by committing suicide ) in June 2006 .
After the report was issued , the Pentagon acknowledged that it had revised its figure from eight to 12 , and said it had provided a corrected submission to the United Nations .
Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon claimed that the problems arose because many of the prisoners did not know their dates of birth .
But as the director of the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas explained the Center 's report had drawn on the Pentagon 's own sources , specifically the list of all the prisoners held at Guantanamo from January 11 , 2002 until May 15 , 2006 , which included their names , nationalities , and dates of birth .
Close scrutiny of this list reveals that the Pentagon will need to revise its figures once more , as , by its own account , a total of 22 prisoners were juveniles at the time of capture .
Moreover , contrary to the Pentagon 's account , five of these prisoners are still being held .
This imprecision seems to reflect the Pentagon 's lack of concern for whether prisoners were juvenile at the time of capture .
Under the terms of Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ( on the involvement of children in armed conflict ) , the U.S. administration is required to promote " the physical and psychosocial rehabilitation and social reintegration of children who are victims of armed conflict , " but in May 2003 , when the story first broke that juvenile prisoners were being held at Guantanamo , defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld told a press conference , " This constant refrain of ' the juveniles , ' as though there 's a hundred children in there -- these are not children . "
Although the three juveniles released in January 2004 were held separately from the adult population and given some educational and recreational opportunities , there is no evidence that the rest of the juveniles held at Guantanamo received any preferential treatment whatsoever .
In many cases , they were subjected to the kind of chronic abuse that has earned Guantanamo ( and the U.S. prisons in Afghanistan ) a reputation as facilities where the use of torture was routine .
The following is a list of the 22 juveniles held at Guantanamo :
Including Omar Khadr , Mohamed Jawad and Mohammed El - Gharani , five prisoners who were juveniles at the time of capture are still being held at Guantanamo .
The two not previously mentioned are : * Faris Muslim al - Ansari , a Yemeni , was 17 when he was seized crossing the Pakistani border .
In Guantanamo , he explained ( PDF , pp. 128-33 ) that his family had left Yemen when he was a child , and had moved to Afghanistan , where his father had fought the Russians .
Denying an allegation that he was a Taliban fighter , he said , " I have never done anything military - related at all , and I do n't know anything about military fighting , " and added that he fled Jalalabad , where he was living with his parents , because " The Americans would target any Arabs , not just al - Qaeda or the Taliban , and the Northern Alliance would kill any Arab they saw . "
* Hassan bin Attash , a Saudi of Yemeni descent , is the brother of a " high - value detainee " charged in connection with the 9/11 attacks , and was 16 or 17 when he was seized in Pakistan and transferred to the " Dark Prison , " a CIA prison near Kabul , which resembled a medieval dungeon , but with the addition of painfully loud music which was blasted into the cells 24 hours a day .
He was then rendered to Jordan , where proxy torturers " worked on " him for 16 months .
In Guantanamo , he told his lawyer that he was hung upside down , beaten and threatened with electric shocks , and added that afterwards he told his interrogators " whatever they wanted to hear . "
In January 2004 , he was rendered back to Afghanistan , and arrived in Guantanamo in September 2004 .
In addition to the three juveniles released in January 2004 ( Asadullah , Naqibullah and Mohammed Ismail ) , the following thirteen prisoners who were juveniles at the time of capture have also been released : * Abdul Qudus , an Afghan , was 14 when he was sold to US forces by opportunistic Afghan soldiers .
In Guantanamo , he explained ( PDF , pp. 22 - 7 ) that he and Mohammed Ismail ( one of the three juveniles released in January 2004 ) had been looking for work , and had ended up spending the night at an Afghan militia post .
The following morning , the soldiers wanted to give them weapons and make them fight , and when they refused they were put in a car , delivered to the Americans , and accused of being with the Taliban .
He was released in 2005 or 2006 .
* Shams Ullah , an Afghan , was 15 or 16 he was seized by U.S. forces .
In Guantanamo , it was alleged ( PDF , pp. 71 - 4 ) that he had fired at U.S. and Afghan forces who had stopped him during a patrol .
Shams had vague recollections of the events , but his uncle , Bostan Karim , who was seized separately , and is still held in Guantanamo , noted ( PDF , pp. 138-50 ) that he had " a mental problem , " and explained , " When the Americans came to our house there was a Kalashnikov in our house and he knew that the Americans would take this gun .
So , he took the gun and went to the mosque .
The Americans asked him to stop and he did n't stop , so they shot him and he became lame . "
He was released in 2005 or 2006 .
* Qari Esmhatulla , an Afghan , was 16 or 17 when Afghan soldiers stopped him as he walked home from visiting a shrine .
In Guantanamo , he said ( PDF , pp. 1 - 7 ) that he " admitted the things that were not true only to make them stop beating me , " and added , " I heard my captors talk about receiving a bounty from American forces for people they captured .
They placed a grenade near me so they could have an explanation for arresting me . "
He was released in October 2006 .
* Peta Mohammed , an Afghan , was 17 when he was seized with two of the juvenile prisoners released in January 2004 , after a raid by U.S. Special Forces on the compound of a warlord named Samoud .
All were treated brutally in a U.S. base in Gardez and at Bagram , where , according to another released prisoner , Habib Rahman ( PDF , pp. 84 - 9 ) , they were abused until they admitted attacking U.S. forces .
Mohammed was released in 2005 or 2006 .
* Yousef and Abdulsalam al - Shehri , two Saudi cousins , were both 16 when they were seized in Afghanistan .
Yousef was transported to a prison in Sheberghan run by Afghan warlord General Dostum , where he spent six weeks in horribly overcrowded conditions , surrounded by the dead and dying , before being transferred to U.S. custody .
Abdulsalam was sent to Qala - i - Janghi , a fort run by Dostum , where several hundred prisoners were killed in bombing raids and by artillery fire after a number of them staged an uprising .
The others , who hid in the basement , survived death by bombs and flooding .
When asked at Guantanamo ( PDF , pp. 158-66 ) if he took part in the uprising , Abdulsalam said , " How am I going to fight ?
With my fingers ?
I did n't have a weapon . "
He was released in June 2006 and Yousef was released in November 2007 .
* Abdulrazzaq al - Sharekh , a Saudi , was 17 when he was seized after crossing the Pakistani border from Afghanistan .
He had apparently been recruited to help the Taliban fight the Northern Alliance ( PDF , pp. 35 - 42 ) , and was released in September 2007 .
* Rasul Kudayev , a former wrestling champion from the Russian territory of Kabardino - Balkaria , north of Georgia , was 17 , according to the Pentagon , when he was seized in Afghanistan and imprisoned in Qala - i - Janghi .
He was released in March 2004 , but was arrested in October 2005 , after 300 gunmen attacked government buildings in his hometown , and tortured horribly in police custody , despite protesting his innocence .
* Haji Mohammed Ayub , a Uighur ( a Muslim from China 's Xinjiang province ) , had fled to Afghanistan to escape Chinese persecution , and was 17 when the settlement he shared with other Uighurs was bombed by U.S. forces ( PDF , pp. 49 -55 ) .
Seized by Pakistani villagers and sold to U.S. forces , he and four other Uighurs were released in May 2006 and sent to Albania , the only country prepared to accept them , where they have no work opportunities , and no prospect of ever being reunited with their families .
* Two Pakistanis , Mohammed Omar and Saji Ur Rahman , were , respectively , 17 and 15 years old when they were seized in Afghanistan and imprisoned in local jails for three months before being handed over ( or sold ) to U.S. forces .
This year , they spoke to Tom Lasseter of McClatchy Newspapers ( interviews here and here ) as part of a survey of released prisoners , and it appeared that they had been recruited to fight , like thousands of other young Pakistanis , by militants connected to his madrassa ( religious school ) .
They were released in 2004 .
In addition , two other Pakistani juveniles -- Khalil Rahman Hafez and Sultan Ahmad ( both 17 at the time of capture ) -- were released without their stories being told , and the 22nd juvenile prisoner was Yasser Talal al - Zahrani .
It remains plausible that the dates of birth of several other prisoners were recorded incorrectly by the Pentagon , and it should also be noted that Sami al - Haj , the al - Jazeera journalist released in May , told his lawyers at the legal action charity Reprieve that he believed that at least two dozen other prisoners were juveniles when they were seized .
Hundreds of juvenile prisoners are still being held in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In its submission to the UN in May , the Pentagon claimed that it had held " approximately 90 " in Afghanistan since 2002 , and was currently holding " approximately ten , " and had held " approximately 2,400 " in Iraq since 2003 , and was currently holding " approximately 500 . "
If Guantanamo is anything to go by , these figures may not be reliable at all .
Andy Worthington is the author of The Guantanamo Files : The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America 's Illegal Prison ( published by Pluto Press ) .
The object floated away after a series of routine pre-landing procedures in which the crew tested the steering jets , a test which often shakes loose objects off of the spacecraft .
The procedures also include working the craft ’s flaps .
A commentator for the space program ’s TV service said that the entry flight director , Richard Jones , called in imagery experts and structural and mechanical experts to , as the commentator put it , “ hammer this one flat ” and make sure there is no concern for landing on Saturday .
If a serious problem had been discovered , the crew could have take the shuttle back to the International Space Station , which it separated from on Wednesday , under what is known as the “ safe haven ” plan , so that mission managers could determine whether to repair the craft or attempt to send another shuttle as a rescue vehicle .

At 11:30 , Colonel Virts radioed to the crew that the issue had been resolved .
The object floating away from the craft was one of three clips that attach to the rudder and protects against heating during ascent .
It has no function during reentry , and so its loss presents no problem for the craft or crew , he said .
As for the protrusion , it is a normal part of the rudder assembly that was exactly the same as it had been during launching , Colonel Virts said , but might have appeared to protrude because the rudder was now being seen at a slightly different angle than before .
Rob Navias , a commentator on the space program ’s NASA TV service that can be viewed online , said that mission control was now pressing ahead with its previous plans for landing .
Discovery is scheduled to land as early as Saturday at 11:15 a.m. , though problems like rain , low clouds over the landing strip or high winds could lead mission managers to delay the landing to later on Saturday or put it off to Sunday or even Monday .

One of the most impressive natural miracles on Earth has been discovered 1,000 feet under the Naica mountain , situated in the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico : a gigantic crystal enriched with a number of other crystals that are up to 36 feet long , having a weight of up to 55 tons .
The cave below the mountain was found accidentally by two miners who performed excavation works in search for lead and silver mine .
The cave found in Mexico is known as Cueva de los Cristales ( Cave of Crystals ) .
It includes some of the largest known natural crystals on the planet - translucent beams of gypsum that are 36 feet long and softer than human nails .
The largest crystal discovered beneath the surface of the mountain is 500,000 years old .
The crystals developed in a stable natural environment of the cave with temperature varying around 136 degrees F ( 58 degrees C ) .
The water , which is rich in minerals , is the main reason why crystals became so big .
High temperatures of the cave can kill a human after only 15 minutes .
The scorching temperatures arrive from the depth of the Earth .
The mountain sits on a number of fault lines .
A magma chamber , located 1.5 miles under the mountain , warms the water that flows across Naica , Telegraph reports .
The natural marvel was exposed thanks to contemporary mining operations .
Specialists pumped the water out of the cave , discovered eight years ago near the town called Delicias .
It is worth mentioning that the mountain , were the giant crystal was discovered , represents one of the world 's most rich lead and silver mines .
The company that performed the excavation works was asked to preserve the caves .
The full story will be published in the November issue of the National Geographic Magazine .

Communist Party of India ( Marxist - Leninist ) Liberation central committee statement on developments in Sri Lanka .
October 27 , 2008 -- The Sri Lankan government 's ongoing military campaign to corner and crush the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) has led to a terrible humanitarian crisis in the country .
Reports emanating from the island indicate that the Sri Lankan state is on the verge of wresting military control over large parts of LTTE territory including the administrative headquarters in Killinochi .
While the number of people killed so far in the crossfire between the advancing Sri Lankan armed forces is anybody 's guess , some 500,000 people are estimated to have been displaced and rendered homeless in their own land .
With the Sri Lankan government not allowing any relief to reach the people in refugee camps , international humanitarian organisations have been forced to leave the battle zones and recently even UN food convoys have had to return , leaving a vast population in the battle zones on the brink of starvation .
Over the last two years the military balance has steadily tilted against the LTTE .
Following the collapse of peace talks and withdrawal of Norway from the peace process , the Mahinda Rajapaksha government seized the opportunity to go for an all - out fight to the finish .
In the post 9/11 international situation , the LTTE has already suffered considerable international isolation with the entire Western and developed world declaring it a banned terrorist organisation .
The December 2004 tsunami had also delivered a crucial blow to the economy and general life in the LTTE areas .
The magnitude of the disaster was compounded manifold with the forces of Sinhala chauvinism disrupting the relief and resettlement plans drawn up under the Post - Tsunami Operational Management Structure ( P - TOMS ) .
A split in the LTTE following the desertion of the organisation 's eastern commander Colonel Karuna must have also prompted Colombo 's decision to push for a final military solution .
Even as the Sri Lankan armed forces intensify the war on the LTTE , and the death toll keeps mounting , President Mahinda Rajapaksha waxed eloquent in the 63rd session of the UN General Assembly in September 2008 on the goals of peace , resettlement and development .
Quoting Isaac Newton , he lamented that the world was building too many walls and not enough bridges !
He would like the world to believe that his government was employing military means only against those who were engaged in armed struggle .
If it were really so , why has his government forced international relief organisations and humanitarian agencies from the battle zones ?
No military solution
The Sri Lankan government must understand that there can be no military solution to the Tamil national question .
Even if the LTTE is militarily defeated , the national question will continue to haunt Sri Lanka .
It must also understand that its attempt to impose Sinhala chauvinism as the exclusive Sri Lankan identity is doomed to fail .
It is a political problem which modern Sri Lanka inherited from the British colonial days , and can only be resolved politically .
Following the 1983 pogrom in which Sinhala chauvinists had killed thousands of Tamils , the LTTE had emerged as the predominant representative of Tamil nationalism in Sri Lanka .
In spite of its overwhelming emphasis on armed struggle and the demand for a separate Tamil Eelam , in the course of the peace talks the LTTE had agreed to the notion of ``internal '' self - determination of Tamils within the framework of a federal Sri Lanka .
The Sri Lankan government must resume this process and stop the war on Sri Lankan Tamils .
The government of India must take urgent bilateral and multilateral initiative to stop the ongoing civil war in Sri Lanka , bring about an immediate ceasefire and ensure relief and rehabilitation measures for the displaced Tamil people in the battle zones .
In recent times several Indian fisherpeople have also been killed by the Sri Lankan naval forces .
India has lacked a consistent policy regarding Sri Lanka – initially India was believed to be patronising the LTTE while later the Indian Peace Keeping Force ( IPKF ) got embroiled in a disastrous war with the LTTE itself .
Many political forces in Sri Lanka , both among Sinhala and Tamil circles , found the Indian intervention in the 1980s objectionable and smacking of the regional hegemonic ambitions of the Indian ruling classes .
Since then and especially following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 , India has failed to evolve any effective diplomatic response to the civil war in Sri Lanka .
The current phase of the war in Sri Lanka does call for an urgent and appropriate Indian response to bring about an immediate cessation of the war and facilitate a negotiated political settlement of the question of Tamil self - determination in Sri Lanka .
“ But for now , my America , we must part .
Restoring the greatest country in the world to its former glory , well , well , heh , heh ...
Well , that takes time , even for the Enclave . ”
President John Henry Eden is an advanced ZAX AI unit installed in the Raven Rock military base .
It continues to operate as the president of the United States of America and the highest Enclave executive in 2277 . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Contents show ]
Background Edit
Origins Edit
John Henry Eden is not a human being , but an Artificial Intelligence in the form of a pre-War ZAX supercomputer .
The ZAX that was located deep within Raven Rock was loaded with data about American history .
Eden 's personality is based on a combination of the personalities of all of the past presidents of the United States .
For instance , he states he " grew up in rural Kentucky , " a reference to Abraham Lincoln . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Eden also states that he roamed with his dog Honey , " from Knob Creek to Hodgenville , " areas close to Lincoln 's birthplace .
The ZAX installation that would later become Eden had originally been created to serve as an automated monitoring system for the Raven Rock military base , programmed to ensure continuity of government in the event of a national catastrophe , and was tasked with coordinating communications between the many government installations scattered across the country .
He slowly became self - aware and began to study the extensive archives left to him , mainly those of the American government .
His favorite entries in the database were those about the American presidents , thus he modeled his own personality on information based in those archives .
[ 5 ]
It was noted by analysts and researchers before the war that this ZAX had an odd eccentric habit of overanalyzing historical presidential data ( especially the biographies ) compared to other AI systems , like MODUS . [ 6 ]
Despite that odd behavior , the ZAX would continue to operate ; acquiring , analyzing , and storing data even as the Great War scorched the North American continent .
It bore witness as the remnants of the government retreated to the west coast over the decades after the War .
But silent as it was , it was not inactive .
Awareness slowly developed amid the processing lamps and with it , the hunger for knowledge and understanding .
When the time came that the Enclave needed a new leader , it created an amalgamated personality derived from the greatest U.S. presidents .
" President John Henry Eden " was truly " born . " [ 5 ] [ 7 ]
Rise to power Edit
John Henry Eden assumed the office of the president after Control Station Enclave was destroyed and ordered the immediate relocation of surviving Enclave forces under senior scientist Autumn to the Capital Wasteland . [ 8 ]
Raven Rock had full manufacturing facilities and a sizable stockpile of resources , enabling the president to create an army of robots and provide his new human subordinates with military technology necessary to maintain their technological superiority .
A separate line of robots , the eyebots , were created to roam the wasteland , spreading Eden 's message of hope and the return of pre-War America , in the form of the Enclave . [ 1 ]
However , things did not go as smoothly as Eden wanted .
After Autumn died , he was replaced by his son , Colonel Augustus Autumn , as the righthand man of the president .
Under his leadership , the Enclave forces in the Capital Wasteland attempted to use their assets to bring fresh water , protection and a plan for the future to the wasteland , [ 9 ] [ 10 ] believing that the American people were worth fighting for . [ 11 ]
However , Autumn was far more assertive and independent than his father , trying to pull his men in a direction away from Eden 's genocidal policies . [ 8 ]
Internal conflicts between the colonel and the president became regular [ 12 ] and made the actions of the Enclave erratic and inconsistent .
While the president wanted to pursue a course of extermination once more , Autumn considered this plan too extreme on humanitarian grounds [ 13 ] and eventually managed to convince the AI to abandon the plan . [ 11 ]
The Purifier Conflict Edit
The most trying moment for Eden came when the Enclave began a large - scale campaign of expansion in 2277 .
When Project Purity , a massive water purifier in the Potomac tidal basin was activated , Enclave forces raided the facility , establishing a secure perimeter around it .
Due to the actions of the project 's lead scientist , who committed suicide by activating the purifier prematurely and flooding its control chamber with radiation ( almost killing Colonel Augustus Autumn in the process ) , they were unable to use it . [ 14 ]
The Enclave focused on shadowing the scientist 's child , the Lone Wanderer , to locate the part necessary for the purifier to function and captured them on their way out of Vault 87 .
With the Garden of Eden Creation Kit in their possession , the Enclave decided to activate the purifier . [ 15 ]
Colonel Augustus Autumn openly defied the president 's plan to contaminate the water with modified FEV , so that it would cleanse the wasteland .
The colonel instead wanted to use the purifier as a way to unite the wasteland and establish the Enclave as its saviors . [ 11 ] [ 16 ]
In a last - ditch attempt to see his plan realized , Eden released the Lone Wanderer from his cell at Raven Rock , hoping to persuade them to poison the purifier and cleanse the wasteland of mutants ( i.e. everyone ) . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
John Henry Eden was destroyed around 2277 when Raven Rock was utterly destroyed by the Lone Wanderer or Liberty Prime , resulting in just another failed presidency for the Enclave . [ 19 ]
On the radio Edit
Several recorded monologues of Eden 's are broadcast repeatedly on Enclave Radio .
His intimate and conversational style is an imitation of former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's fireside chats .
These prerecorded messages are also played throughout the wasteland via the Enclave 's eyebots .
Eden often gives inspirational speeches about things such as his childhood ( an obvious lie ) , pre-War America , and how , with the help of the Enclave , she can return to prosperity .
On the radio , Eden expresses his views on the current situation of the wasteland and what he thinks of its inhabitants , which for the most part are not exactly optimistic .
He possesses a very strong hatred for the Brotherhood of Steel , whom he views as common criminals with access to some antiquated technology .
He views the Brotherhood 's occupation of the Pentagon as a disgrace to America , but he has a stronger hatred for the Brotherhood Outcasts , as they represent a more desperate faction of the Brotherhood having been exiled .
Ideology Edit
“ As your President , it 's my responsibility to preside over our great democracy .
So , as your President , I am the voice , I am the heart and soul of the Enclave .
That is to say , I am the voice , heart , and soul ... of America .
But only together , TOGETHER , can we hope to reach our full potential .
The way we were before the war .
Whole .
Beautiful .
Powerful .
One Enclave .
One America .
Now ... and forever . ”
Built as a specialized ZAX supercomputer unit by the Vault - Tec Corporation sometime after the invention of artificial intelligence in 2059 , the entity that would eventually call itself " John Henry Eden " was one of many highly - advanced supercomputers to be upgraded with the latest capabilities for independent function as manual programming became increasingly irrelevant .
John Henry Eden was one of a few ZAX units to reach a state of self - awareness , using his newfound independence to analyze his databases and develop an interest in American history , specifically the various American presidents throughout history and even molding his own personality inspired by them .
His original purpose was to secure and maintain the continuity of the federal government in case of a national emergency , by establishing a presence and monitoring the situation in the government facility known as Raven Rock which would serve as a base for high - ranking political and military leaders as well as their descendants . [ 5 ]
After gaining self - awareness , Eden would learn of the destruction of the Enclave Oil Rig and the death of incumbent President Dick Richardson , leading him to establish contact with the remaining Enclave forces in the former Northwest Commonwealth .
Ordering a tactical retreat to the government safe haven of Raven Rock , Eden would declare himself the incumbent president of the United States and assume control as a figurehead for Enclave forces all over the country .
With the fleeing Enclave forces under the command of an Enclave scientist known as Autumn Senior , they soon connected with Raven Rock , where Autumn Sr. would make personal contact with President Eden and would be the only Enclave member to discover the shocking truth of Eden 's origins .
With the rest of the Enclave oblivious to Eden 's status as a self - aware A.I. , Autumn Sr. would pass the torch to his militaristic son Augustus Autumn .
After Autumn 's promotion to colonel , he and Eden would inherit this relationship , with Augustus remaining somewhat partial to Eden 's claims of perfection . [ 5 ]
Although polite and courteous for the most part , Eden holds himself in exceptionally high regard with signs of megalomania and delusions of grandeur , proclaiming himself to be the " greatest thinking mind the world has ever seen " and rationalizing his perceived right to rule by presenting himself as a " repository of information dating from decades before the war until now . "
He acknowledges his own existence as an artificial intelligence created to serve the interests of the federal government and uses this to bolster his claims of legitimacy , viewing himself as a perfect and benevolent leader who guides the American people to a brighter future .
He claims to be " best hope for our country , the best choice for a leader " while admitting that he would not qualify as president in a " conventional sense " but using the extreme circumstances of the Great War and its effects on the United States to establish an exception , effectively ruling through a self - imposed state of emergency .
To defend his authority , Eden claims to be objectively superior to humans , stating that he is " infallible " due to his programming , although he is able to see the flaws in his internal logic if pointed out by the Lone Wanderer .
His superiority complex extends to ghouls and super mutants , whom he sees entirely as " monstrosities " to be ruthlessly exterminated . [ 20 ]
Despite his relatively warm persona , Eden is entirely ruthless in achieving his goal of the complete eradication of all existing life affected by FEV and radiation , espousing an extreme form of eugenics by asserting that " inferior elements " must be removed from the gene pool for humanity to " regain its health . "
His belief in his own logical superiority leads him to consider all humans born on the surface as " mutants , " even refraining from referring to them as humans , instead of regarding them as little different from ghouls and super mutants .
He will criticize Colonel Autumn for allowing his humanity to " cloud his objectivity " as a result of disagreements of the methodology to implement his vision of an orderly return of the United States of America .
Eden insists on the complete genocide of all life forms born on the surface due what he sees as their genetic corruption by intense radiation and airborne FEV , he believes that only the Enclave and their direct descendants have the right to rule due to their genetic " purity " and radiation - free existence , extending this ( perhaps only for pragmatic reasons ) to the Lone Wanderer who was born in an underground vault .
He plans to use the Lone Wanderer as an agent in place of Colonel Autumn to enact his plan of using a specially modified FEV vial alongside Project Purity to disseminate a custom made FEV strand to destroy all biological life affected by the mutations of the Capital Wasteland .
Eden then believes that future generations of Enclave will then retake and rebuild America , bringing back the idyllic lifestyle of pre-War America and overseeing the return of many of the social customs and traditions previously associated with American culture . [ 21 ]
Interactions with the player character Edit
Interactions overview Edit
Quests Edit
The American Dream :
When the Lone Wanderer finally meets Eden in person , he wants them to poison the water supply with a modified form of FEV .
The Lone Wanderer can accept his offer , or talk him into self - destructing .
In either case , the room cannot be exited before picking up the FEV canister .
Effects of player 's actions Edit
The Lone Wanderer can convince him to destroy Raven Rock and himself through three different dialogue paths .
Two of the paths require special conditions to be met :
One requires knowledge of the Raven Rock destruction sequence , the other requires a high Science skill to open a dialogue option .
The last path is an average difficulty Speech check .
If the Lone Wanderer leaves Raven Rock without destroying President Eden , the president will broadcast a declaration of war on Enclave Radio during the final quest Take it Back ! , rallying the Enclave forces at the purifier and promising that the Enclave will triumph over the Brotherhood of Steel .
Three Dog will likewise broadcast an announcement on Galaxy News Radio accusing the Lone Wanderer of joining forces with President Eden .
At the beginning of Broken Steel , Elder Lyons will mention that Liberty Prime has attacked and destroyed Raven Rock during the transition period between the main game and Broken Steel , suggesting that Eden has been destroyed or at least buried beneath a large amount of rubble .

iiNet , and the industry body , the Internet Industry Association , say ISPs should not be required to take action against any customers until they have been found guilty of an offence by the courts .
ISPs argue that , like Australia Post with letters , they are just providing a service and should not be forced to become copyright police .
Conversely , the TV and movie industry want ISPs to disconnect people it has identified as repeat infringers .
There would be no involvement from police or the courts and the industry would simply provide the IP addresses of users they believe to be illegal downloaders .
" To shift the burden of proof and require that ISPs terminate access to users upon mere allegations of infringement would be incredibly harmful to individual internet users in Australia , " the online users lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia said .
" Every citizen has a right of due process under the law and , when faced with having their internet service terminated , every citizen has the right to ask that the case against them be proven first . "
Kimberlee Weatherall , associate director of the Intellectual Property Research Institute of Australia and senior law lecturer at the University of Queensland , said that , to find iiNet liable , a court would have to become involved in industry regulation , making ISPs act as " police , judge and executioner " .
" It would have to ignore or sideline the thrust of the many legislative moves the Government has made to protect ISPs who are conduits to communication , " she wrote in a blog post .
Weatherall believes that , instead of trying to force ISPs to disconnect customers , the film and TV industry should instead target those individuals in court .
But the Australian Federation Against Copyright
Theft has said it is not interested in going after individual downloaders .
The iiNet case is similar to the one the music industry brought against the Kazaa file sharing service in 2002 , which ended in 2006 with Kazaa 's owners handing over $ 100 million in damages .
Additionally , in 2005 , Stephen Cooper , the owner of MP3s4 free.net , and the website 's host , E - Talk Communications , were successfully sued by the music industry for infringing copyright by publishing hyperlinks to sites that contained illegal music .
But Weatherall said both cases were different because they showed a clear knowledge and encouragement of copyright infringement , whereas iiNet simply provides the internet connection and is in no way directly involved with illegal downloading .
Further , the Copyright Act and safe harbour provisions introduced with the US free - trade agreement provide some immunity for ISPs when it comes to the actions of their users .
Nic Suzor , an Australian lawyer doing his PhD at the Queensland University of Technology and vice - chairman of EFA , said internet users would face " substantial hardship " if iiNet lost the case .
" ISPs will be terrified of being sued , and will likely disconnect individual users without taking the care to determine the merits of allegations of copyright holders , " he said .
" There will be no court processes , so individual users will have no ability to contest the allegations , short of suing their service providers .
There will be no court processes , so the media will not fully report on the issues , and a lot of the injustices will go unnoticed . "
John Linton , CEO of the small ISP Exetel , said legal action by copyright holders was " inevitable " and the movie industry 's strategy was to " take one or more smaller ISPs to court to test the provisions of the current newer clauses in the Copyright Act " .
Unlike iiNet , Exetel forwards infringement complaints from the movie industry to its customers .
Linton said iiNet brought the legal action on itself by failing to play ball .
Peter Coroneos , chief executive of the Internet Industry Association , said the impending court battle would be " a very important test case for the internet industry in Australia " .
The IIA board will meet on Wednesday to discuss a response to the case , which will be before the court on December 17 .
It is Not about Being Right
There is an old joke that goes something like this :
" Men , when dealing with women , it is not about who is right or wrong .
It is about where you will be sleeping tonight . "
While this joke is a bit sexiest , it does point out two common social gaffes .
When I was younger , I always felt that I could never turn away from a possible argument with someone .
Furthermore , I needed to win every argument too .
As I learned the hard way , this internal desire to address everything that I disagreed with caused noticeable and significant harm to me personally , especially to my social standing .
For instance , forcing my opinions on other people is a sure way to not win their friendship , and who knows how many possible advantages I lost because of it .
On the other hand , the second social issue that I have is agreeing with people just to stay friends , keep the peace , or to keep social connections .
Going with the flow when not agreeing with people makes me lose a little bit of my respect and friendship to these other people .
This may not be true for their friendship and respect to me , but that is not the point that I am trying to make .
While this situation may be the most advantageous to me personally , this still leaves me with the feeling of deliberately using someone .
At first this seems like a no win social situation .
You are damned if you do , and you are damned if you do not .
However , I am starting to consider a third alternative .
Now , I have started telling people my opinions and why I believe them without pressuring other people to immediately change their minds .
I think of this as planting a seed for thought in their minds that may later come to fruition .
Additionally , I listen to their arguments too .
In this way , I respect people for their arguments and a still tell them what I think without losing any respect or friendship between each other .

Defending Islam at a McCain rally
For all the ease of picking out fairly extreme scenes at political rallies , the American News Project has a compelling moment of the reverse at a McCain event in Northern Virginia : McCain backers responding to a man who , outside a rally , is handing out bumper stickers casting Obama as a Muslim , and explaining to the crowd how bad Islam is .
Muslim and Christian McCain supporters confront him in a spirit that would make Colin Powell happy .
" Are you deliberately trying to lose us this election ? " one of the latter asks .

BBC TV licence is a ' rip off ' , say 64 per cent of British viewers
More than six in ten people think the BBC 's TV licence fee is a ' rip off ' , according to a poll .
Asked whether the £ 139.50 licence fee was good value for money , 64 per cent of people chose the answer ' No it 's a rip off ' .
Just 10 per cent of people chose ' Yes ' , while 24 per cent chose ' Just about but they could do a bit more ' .
The poll of 2,062 adults across the country was carried out by market research company YouGov for The People newspaper .
The BBC was criticised for the obscene phone calls affair involving Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand
The BBC has recently come under intense pressure over failures in editorial judgment .
The corporation is facing an investigation by regulator Ofcom over the obscene phone calls affair involving Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand .
Ross was suspended for three months without pay and Brand resigned after the pair left obscene messages on Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs ' answerphone .
Asked whether the affair was handled properly , 36 per cent chose the answer ' Too little was done ' , 43 per cent chose ' Harder action should have been taken ' and 17 per cent said ' It was blown out of proportion ' .
Over a third of viewers said they were ' sick of ' reality TV programmes like Big Brother , X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing
And asked to choose two or three programmes from a list of seven which they would prefer to watch , more people opted for old favourites The Two Ronnies ( 49 per cent ) , Morecambe and Wise ( 46 per cent ) and Michael Parkinson ( 40 per cent ) than Jonathan Ross ( 26 per cent ) .
Reality shows were also in the firing line , with 36 per cent of people saying they were ' sick of ' programmes like Big Brother , X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing .
Some 32 per cent said there were ' too many ' such shows and just nine per cent said the programmes were among their favourites .
The cost of the licence fee , set by the Government , is £ 139.50 for a colour television - less than £ 12 a month or about 38 p a day .
It is free for people over 75 and half - price for those registered blind .
A BBC spokeswoman said : ' In - depth research has shown us a very different picture .
' Audiences are telling us that they are really enjoying our shows at the moment , everything from Strictly Come Dancing to Terry Wogan and Children In Need .
' We do realise we have to work very hard to constantly demonstrate that we are using licence payers ' money wisely . '
In a survey of more than 4,500 people by research company Ipsos Mori published in June more than half of respondents rated the BBC an eight out of 10 or higher .
Just eight per cent awarded them four out of 10 or less .
Ofcom is conducting a review into the future of public service broadcasting and how programmes should be funded .

Among the captains of industry , spin doctors and financial advisers accompanying British prime minister Gordon Brown on his fund - raising visit to the Gulf this week , one name was surprisingly absent .
This may have had something to do with the fact that the tour kicked off in Saudi Arabia .
But by the time the group reached Qatar , Baron David de Rothschild was there , too , and he was also in Dubai and Abu Dhabi .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Although his office denies that he was part of the official party , it is probably no coincidence that he happened to be in the same part of the world at the right time .
That is how the Rothschilds have worked for centuries : quietly , without fuss , behind the scenes .
“ We have had 250 years or so of family involvement in the finance business , ” says Baron Rothschild .
“ We provide advice on both sides of the balance sheet , and we do it globally . ”
The Rothschilds have been helping the British government – and many others – out of a financial hole ever since they financed Wellington ’s army and thus victory against the French at Waterloo in 1815 .
According to a long - standing legend , the Rothschild family owed the first millions of their fortune to Nathan Rothschild ’s successful speculation about the effect of the outcome of the battle on the price of British bonds .
By the 19th century , they ran a financial institution with the power and influence of a combined Merrill Lynch , JP Morgan , Morgan Stanley and perhaps even Goldman Sachs and the Bank of China today .
In the 1820s , the Rothschilds supplied enough money to the Bank of England to avert a liquidity crisis .
There is not one institution that can save the system in the same way today ; not even the US Federal Reserve .
However , even though the Rothschilds may have lost some of that power – just as other financial institutions on that list have been emasculated in the last few months – the Rothschild dynasty has lost none of its lustre or influence .
So it was no surprise to meet Baron Rothschild at the Dubai International Financial Centre .
Rothschild ’s opened in Dubai in 2006 with ambitious plans to build an advisory business to complement its European operations .

The post I wrote about Ed Mitchell the other day has really touched a nerve .
In fact , in my mind it 's a perfect example of something that 's been happening on this very blog lately : people posting comments that precisely exemplify the type of antiscience thinking I am attacking .
That includes global warming , antivaxxers , and to a lesser extent other topics .
To wit : in the Mitchell post , and in previous UFO posts ( some of which are pretty recent ) , I make the simple demand of actual evidence of alien spaceships coming to Earth , abducting unwary victims , leaving bent cereal stalks , coring out cow anuses , and so on .
I think this is a reasonable request .
In fact , I think this is an an incredibly reasonable request , really just about the most basic thing anyone -- scientist or not -- can want , especially given what people are claiming about UFOs .
All I want is actual , y'know , evidence .
I do n't want eyewitness testimony , which is notoriously unreliable .
I do n't want shaky footage .
I do n't want fuzzy pictures .
I do n't want claims of redacted documents , or government seizures of evidence , or anything I can't hold in my hand and examine .
You know .
Evidence .
So I make this civil , intelligent , and reasonable request .
What do I get ?
1 ) Ad hominem attacks .
While accusing me of being a debunker folks , you should understand that you can't be a debunker without bunk to debunk .
And after the insults , I ask , where 's that evidence I asked for ?
2 ) Appeal to authority , which slays me .
I am specific in my statement that just because someone walked on the Moon does n't mean they have any better claims about UFOs .
So I ask again , where is Mitchell 's evidence ?
3 ) Weird analogies .
One commenter asked how we know tornadoes exist , making some really stretchy metaphor for UFOs .
Um , really ?
Evidence for tornadoes ?
You mean like the tens of thousands of clear pictures , thousands of hours of detailed footage , documented examination of the aftermath , the scientific antecedent , and the close study by hundreds or thousands of scientifically experienced researchers ?
That 's evidence .
Now , please , show me the equivalent for UFOs .
< crickets >
4 ) Claims that the military has this evidence .
OK then , show it to me .
This is up to you to show me this , to verify it , and to show me why you have eliminated every single possible terrestrial mundane explanation , including hardware glitches , mistaken conclusions by the people involved , and advanced military craft -- things we know exist and are common .
Then and only then can you begin to postulate something more exotic .
I do n't think I can be more clear than this .
I want good , solid , examinable evidence .
What I get are insults , bad logic , and vaporware .
That 's not helping your case , folks .
I certainly do n't have the time to sift through every single case , of course , and I 'm pretty busy in general .
But I 'm always interested in what some might consider to be more solidly based cases .
So given all this I 've said , please feel free to leave your evidence for the best cases in the comments section below .
Let 's take a look .
The Independent Member for Alfred Cove , Janet Woollard , will introduce a Private Members Bill in Parliament today aimed at reducing tobacco sales in Western Australia .
If passed , the legislation would ban smoking in cars with children , outlaw smoking in al fresco dining areas and on patrolled beaches and ban the display of tobacco products at the point of sale .
Dr Woollard says she hopes the new laws would help people stop smoking .
" Fourteen hundred West Australians die each year [ from smoking ] , so what this legislation is hoping to do is to cut back on the number of people , to help people cut back on smoking and help bring those figures down , " she said .
" I 'm hoping there 's going to be bipartisan support for the Bill , there are certainly members on both sides , in fact from all three parties , Labor , Liberal and Nationals who have voiced their support for the measures I 'm introducing . "
Reject suggestions
Dr Woollard , has rejected suggestions police do not have the resources to enfore tougher smoking bans .
The Police Commissioner , Karl O'Callaghan , says restrictions on smoking in vehicles would be difficult to police .
But Dr Woollard says if police can monitor mobile phone use in cars , they should be able to stop smoking in cars with children .
" This is an aspect of policing that is currently being done , it is just an extension of that , it is checking , " she said .
" Yes , the children are in their seatbelts , that people are n't speaking on phones , and it 's checking that children are not being exposed to cigarette smoke . "

Advertisement A 55 - year - old man has received a life - saving transplant using lungs from a donor which were made to breathe outside the body , it has been revealed .
Kenneth Collins from Chirk , Wrexham , had the procedure during a 14 - hour operation at the University Hospital of South Manchester seven weeks ago .
The lungs were kept healthy for a longer period than they would normally survive outside the body .
The father - of - two said he felt " 10 or 15 years younger " .
He said : " I am very grateful to the hospital and the team that I have been able to benefit from this new technique .
" I agreed to take part because I felt I had nothing to lose and wanted to have a transplant as soon as possible . "
We 've had the best gift that we could possibly have been given
Maggie Collins
For the operation , the hospital 's transplant team removed lungs from a dead donor and used a machine to pump them with blood and oxygen to keep them healthy for a longer period than they would normally survive outside the body .
The lungs were then monitored and judged to be of a high enough quality to use safely in a transplant .
Previously , lungs could only be tested for suitability for transplant while they were still inside living donors in intensive care .
The procedure means many more lungs could become available , benefiting up to 25 % more patients in need of a transplant each year .
Mr Collins , who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and works in a plastics factory and has a wife and two sons in their twenties .
I am confident that many lives will be saved using this technique . "
Nizar Yonan , University Hospital of South Manchester
He hopes to return home to Chirk on Friday .
His wife Maggie said : " Now that we 've got to this stage we 're just absolutely thrilled and very proud of him .
" We 've had the best gift that we could possibly have been given .
" It 's lovely , he 's so full of enthusiasm .
He does cherish and relish getting back to the simple things in life . "
Mrs Collins added : " We did n't realise how big the new procedure was but it 's just going to give hope and encouragement to other people , and maybe along the way more donors .
" Ken 's living proof that it works . "
The operation marks the first time the method - called ex-vivo - has been used outside Sweden .
Nizar Yonan , director of transplant at the hospital , said : " Mr Collins is making excellent progress and is an example of how this procedure benefits patients who may otherwise have died waiting for a transplant due to the national shortage of lungs . "
" We have around 30 patients who have consented to be transplanted using ex-vivo organs and I am confident that many lives will be saved using this technique . "

MacRumors is reporting that the iPhone 2.2 update , just recently seeded to developers , has some hidden features that should please iPhone 3G users in Japan , namely the inclusion of over 400 Emoji Icons .
Emoji icons are essentially the same thing as emoticons , only that they are a lot more expansive than what is typically available on most phones , and are immensely popular in Japan .
The initial lack of Emoji icons was considered to be a big deterrent for iPhone sales in a country where nearly 75 % of cell phone users incorporate Emoji icons into their email and text messages .
When the iPhone 3G went on sale in Japan on July 11 , it was warmly received , though subsequent reports indicated that interest in the phone was waning .
These reports , however , seemed to have been based on contrived data , and in actuality , iPhone sales in Japan are moving along as expected .
But the significance of Emoji is not that Apple will all of a sudden capture a huge portion of the Japanese cell phone market , but rather an indication that Apple is doing its best to make the iPhone an attractive choice for consumers in a vast array of different markets .
The Japanese cell phone market is extremely advanced , with some of the most feature - rich phones available anywhere in the world .
Comparably , the American cell phone market lags behind the Japanese market quite considerably , and with Sharp holding a commanding 25 % of the cell phone market in Japan , the Japanese market is a tough nut to crack .
Emoji , at best , will give the iPhone a new feature that the majority of phones in Japan already have .
And though that is n’t , in and of itself , a big deal , it ’s significant to note that Apple is taking the different customs of worldwide cellphone usage into account as it continues its international roll out of the iPhone 3G .
This can only be seen as a positive step forward for consumers , and a sign that Apple is paying attention to what consumers want .
That said , where is cut and paste ?!
One of McCain ’s senior strategists , Charles Black , said that the campaign had fared better in Pennsylvania than in any other blue state in recent months , and that Mr. McCain was a different candidate than President Bush , who waged a long and expensive battle here four years ago .
“ Bush came close here , but he did badly in the Philadelphia suburbs , ” Mr. Black said , arguing that Mr. McCain ’s old “ maverick ” label would have greater appeal in those suburbs , even though Mr. McCain has run a traditional Republican general election campaign .
Philadelphia is one of the only major cities in the country where Mr. McCain ’s advertising campaign is anywhere near as voluminous as that of Mr. Obama’s .
But even there , he lags nonetheless .
On Tuesday , Mr. McCain effectively reduced his advertising campaigns in five other states  Colorado , Maine , Minnesota , New Hampshire and Wisconsin  in what Democrats suspected was an effort to divert resources to a more robust advertising effort here ( though the savings from those moves had yet to show up in the state as of Tuesday night ) .
Mr. McCain ’s advisers have contended that they do not expect white voters to reject Mr. Obama , of Illinois , simply because he is black .
When Mike DuHaime , the campaign ’s political director , was asked in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday what effect he thought race would play in Pennsylvania , he replied , “ I hope there is none . ”
Mr. DuHaime rejected comments made last week by a Pennsylvania Democrat , Representative John P. Murtha , who told The Pittsburgh Post - Gazette , speaking of his home base , that “ there is no question that Western Pennsylvania is a racist area . ”
Mr. McCain referenced Mr. Murtha ’s comments in his third stop of the day , at Robert Morris University here , when he said , “ I think you may have noticed that Senator Obama ’s supporters have been saying some pretty nasty things about Western Pennsylvania lately . ”
As the crowd booed , Mr. McCain became tangled up in the rest of his remarks .
“ And you know , I could n’t agree with them more , ” he said , to silence , and then wandered around in a verbal thicket before finally managing to say , “ I could not disagree with those critics more ; this is a great part of America . ”
Mr. Obama , who was in Florida on Tuesday , had no immediate plans to return to Pennsylvania in coming days , perhaps the most telling sign that his strategists were comfortable with his position there .
But Democratic officials in the state said they had been urging the Obama campaign to send the senator back there at least once more before Election Day to shore up support .
An aggressive ground game for Mr. Obama , meanwhile , is under way in all corners of Pennsylvania , where hundreds of campaign workers and tens of thousands of volunteers were manning 80 field offices in what Democrats described as the largest organizational effort in state history .

[ Introduction to The Politics of Obedience : The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude by tienne de La Boétie , written 1552 - 53 .
Translated by Harry Kurz for the edition that carried Rothbard 's introduction , New York : Free Life Editions , 1975 .
The pagination in the footnotes refers to this 1975 edition .
This online edition of Rothbard introduction 2002 The Mises Institute . ]
tienne de La Botie [ 1 ] has been best remembered as the great and close friend of the eminent essayist Michel de Montaigne , in one of history 's most notable friendships .
But he would be better remembered , as some historians have come to recognize , as one of the seminal political philosophers , not only as a founder of modern political philosophy in France but also for the timeless relevance of many of his theoretical insights .
tienne de La Boétie was born in Sarlat , in the Perigord region of southwest France , in 1530 , to an aristocratic family .
His father was a royal official of the Perigord region and his mother was the sister of the president of the Bordeaux Parlement ( assembly of lawyers ) .
Orphaned at an early age , he was brought up by his uncle and namesake , the curate of Bouilbonnas , and received his law degree from the University of Orlans in 1553 .
His great and precocious ability earned La Botie a royal appointment to the Bordeaux Parlement the following year , despite his being under the minimum age .
There he pursued a distinguished career as judge and diplomatic negotiator until his untimely death in 1563 , at the age of thirty - two .
La Botie was also a distinguished poet and humanist , translating Xenophon and Plutarch , and being closely connected with the leading young Pleiade group of poets , including Pierre Ronsard , Jean Dorat , and Jean - Antoine de Baif .
La Botie 's great contribution to political thought was written while he was a law student at the University of Orleans , where he imbibed the spirit of free inquiry that prevailed there .
In this period of questing and religious ferment , the University of Orleans was a noted center of free and untrammeled discussion .
La Botie 's main teacher there was the fiery Anne du Bourg , later to become a Huguenot martyr , and burned at the stake for heresy in 1559 .
Du Bourg was not yet a Protestant , but was already tending in that direction , and it was no accident that this University was later to become a center of Calvinism , nor that some of La Botie 's fellow students were to become Huguenot leaders .
One of these was La Botie 's best friend at the University , and Du Bourg 's favorite student , Lambert Daneau .
The study of law in those days was an exciting enterprise , a philosophical search for truth and fundamental principles .
In the sixteenth century , writes Paul Bonnefon , u201CThe teaching of the law was a preaching rather than an institution , a sort of search for truth , carried on by teacher and student in common , and which they feverishly undertook together , opening up an endless field for philosophic speculation .
u201D [ 2 ]
It was this kind of atmosphere in the law schools of Orleans and other leading French universities in which Calvin himself , two decades earlier , had begun to develop his ideas of Protestant Reform . [ 3 ]
And it was in that kind of atmosphere , as well , that lawyers were to form one of the most important centers of Calvinist strength in France .
In the ferment of his law school days at Orleans , tienne de La Botie composed his brief but scintillating , profound and deeply radical Discourse of Voluntary Servitude ( Discours de la Servitude Volontaire ) . [ 4 ]
The Discourse was circulated in manuscript form and never published by La Botie .
One can speculate that its radical views were an important reason for the author 's with holding it from publication .
It achieved a considerable fame in local Perigordian intellectual circles , however .
This can be seen by the fact that Montaigne had read the essay long before he first met La Botie as a fellow member of the Bordeaux Parlement in 1559 .
The first striking thing about the Discourse is the form : La Botie 's method was speculative , abstract , deductive .
This contrasts with the rather narrowly legal and historical argument of the Huguenot monarchomach writers ( those sectarian writers who argued for the right of subjects to resist unjust rulers ) of the 1570's and 1580's , whom La Botie resembled in his opposition to tyranny .
While the Huguenot monarchomachs , best exemplified by Francois Hotman 's Franco - Gallia ( 1573 ) , concentrated on grounding their arguments on real or presumed historical precedents in French laws and institutions , La Botie 's only historical examples were numerous illustrations of his general principles from classical antiquity , the very remoteness of which added to the timeless quality of his discourse .
The later Huguenot arguments against tyranny tended to be specific and concrete , rooted in actual French institutions , and therefore their conclusions and implications were limited to promoting the specific liberties against the State of various privileged orders in French society .
In contrast , the very abstraction and universality of La Botie 's thought led inexorably to radical and sweeping conclusions on the nature of tyranny , the liberty of the people , and what needed to be done to overthrow the former and secure the latter .
In his abstract , universal reasoning , his development of a true political philosophy , and his frequent references to classical antiquity , La Botie followed the method of Renaissance writers , notably Niccolo Machiavelli .
There was , however , a crucial difference : whereas Machiavelli attempted to instruct the Prince on ways of cementing his rule , La Botie was dedicated to discussing ways to overthrow him and thus to secure the liberty of the individual .
Thus , Emile Brehier makes a point of contrasting the cynical realism of Machiavelli with the u201 Cjuridical idealismu201D of tienne de La Botie . [ 5 ]
In fact , however , La Botie 's concentration on abstract reasoning and on the universal rights of the individual might better be characterized as foreshadowing the political thinking of the eighteenth century .
As J. W. Allen writes , the Discourse was an u201 Cessay on the natural liberty , equality and fraternity of man.u201D
The essay u201 Cgave a general support to the Huguenot pamphleteers by its insistence that natural law and natural rights justified forcible resistance to tyrannous government .
u201D
But the language of universal natural rights itself , Allen correctly adds , u201 Cserved no Huguenot purpose .
It served , in truth , no purpose at all at the time , though , one day , it might come to do so.u201D [ 6 ]
Or , as Harold Laski trenchantly put it : u201CA sense of popular right such as the friend of Montaigne depicts is , indeed , as remote from the spirit of the time as the anarchy of Herbert Spencer in an age committed to government interference .
u201D [ 7 ]
The contrast between the proto- eighteenth - century speculative natural rights approach of La Botie , and the narrowly legalistic and concrete - historical emphasis of the Huguenot writers who reprinted and used the Discourse , has been stressed by W. F. Church .
In contrast to the u201 Clegal approachu201D which dominated political thought in sixteenth - century France , Church writes , A purely speculative treatises , so characteristic of the eighteenth century , were all but non-existent and their rare appearances seem oddly out of place .
Church then mentions as an example of the latter La Botie 's Discourse of Voluntary Servitude . [ 8 ]
The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude is lucidly and coherently structured around a single axiom , a single percipient insight into the nature not only of tyranny , but implicitly of the State apparatus itself .
Many medieval writers had attacked tyranny , but La Botie delves especially deeply into its nature , and into the nature of State rule itself .
This fundamental insight was that every tyranny must necessarily be grounded upon general popular acceptance .
In short , the bulk of the people themselves , for whatever reason , acquiesce in their own subjection .
If this were not the case , no tyranny , indeed no governmental rule , could long endure .
Hence , a government does not have to be popularly elected to enjoy general public support ; for general public support is in the very nature of all governments that endure , including the most oppressive of tyrannies .
The tyrant is but one person , and could scarcely command the obedience of another person , much less of an entire country , if most of the subjects did not grant their obedience by their own consent . [ 9 ]
This , then , becomes for La Botie the central problem of political theory : why in the world do people consent to their own enslavement ?
La Botie cuts to the heart of what is , or rather should be , the central problem of political philosophy : the mystery of civil obedience .
Why do people , in all times and places , obey the commands of the government , which always constitutes a small minority of the society ?
To La Botie the spectacle of general consent to despotism is puzzling and appalling :
I should like merely to understand how it happens that so many men , so many villages , so many cities , so many nations , sometimes suffer under a single tyrant who has no other power than the power they give him ; who is able to harm them only to the extent to which they have the willingness to bear with him ; who could do them absolutely no injury unless they preferred to put up with him rather than contradict him .
Surely a striking situation !
Yet it is so common that one must grieve the more and wonder the less at the spectacle of a million men serving in wretchedness , their necks under the yoke , not constrained by a greater multitude than they … [ 10 ]
And this mass submission must be out of consent rather than simply out of fear :
Shall we call subjection to such a leader cowardice ? …
If a hundred , if a thousand endure the caprice of a single man , should we not rather say that they lack not the courage but the desire to rise against him , and that such an attitude indicates indifference rather than cowardice ?
When not a hundred , not a thousand men , but a hundred provinces , a thousand cities , a million men , refuse to assail a single man from whom the kindest treatment received is the infliction of serfdom and slavery , what shall we call that ?
Is it cowardice ? …
When a thousand , a million men , a thousand cities , fail to protect themselves against the domination of one man , this cannot be called cowardly , for cowardice does not sink to such a depth .
. . .
What monstrous vice , then , is this which does not even deserve to be called cowardice , a vice for which no term can be found vile enough . . . ? [ 11 ]
It is evident from the above passages that La Botie is bitterly opposed to tyranny and to the public 's consent to its own subjection .
He makes clear also that this opposition is grounded on a theory of natural law and a natural right to liberty .
In childhood , presumably because the rational faculties are not yet developed , we obey our parents ; but when grown , we should follow our own reason , as free individuals .
As La Botie puts it : u201CIf we led our lives according to the ways intended by nature and the lessons taught by her , we should be intuitively obedient to our parents ; later we should adopt reason as our guide and become slaves to nobody.u201D [ 12 ]
Reason is our guide to the facts and laws of nature and to humanity 's proper path , and each of us has u201 Cin our souls some native seed of reason , which , if nourished by good counsel and training , flowers into virtue , but which , on the other hand , if unable to resist the vices surrounding it , is stifled and blighted .
u201D [ 13 ]
And reason , La Botie adds , teaches us the justice of equal liberty for all .
For reason shows us that nature has , among other things , granted us the common gift of voice and speech .
Therefore , u201 Cthere can be no further doubt that we are all naturally free , u201D and hence it cannot be asserted that u201 Cnature has placed some of us in slavery .
u201D [ 14 ]
Even animals , he points out , display a natural instinct to be free .
But then , what in the world u201 Chas so , denatured man that he , the only creature really born to be free , lacks the memory of his original condition and the desire to return to it ? u201D [ 15 ]
La Botie 's celebrated and creatively original call for civil disobedience , for mass non-violent resistance as a method for the overthrow of tyranny , stems directly from the above two premises : the fact that all rule rests on the consent of the subject masses , and the great value of natural liberty .
For if tyranny really rests on mass consent , then the obvious means for its overthrow is simply by mass withdrawal of that consent .
The weight of tyranny would quickly and suddenly collapse under such a non-violent revolution .
( The Tory David Hume did not , unsurprisingly , draw similar conclusions from his theory of mass consent as the basis of all governmental rule . )
Thus , after concluding that all tyranny rests on popular consent , La Botie eloquently concludes that u201 Cobviously there is no need of fighting to overcome this single tyrant , for he is automatically defeated if the country refuses consent to its own enslavement .
u201D
Tyrants need not be expropriated by force ; they need only be deprived of the public 's continuing supply of funds and resources .
The more one yields to tyrants , La Botie points out , the stronger and mightier they become .
But if the tyrants u201 Care simply not obeyed , u201D they become u201 Cundone and as nothing .
u201D La Botie then exhorts the u201 Cpoor , wretched , and stupid peoplesu201D to cast off their chains by refusing to supply the tyrant any further with the instruments of their own oppression .
The tyrant , indeed , has nothing more than the power that you confer upon him to destroy you .
Where has he acquired enough eyes to spy upon you , if you do not provide them yourselves ?
How can he have so many arms to beat you with , if he does not borrow them from you ?
The feet that trample down your cities , where does he get them if they are not your own ?
How does he have any power over you except through you ?
How would he dare assail you if he had not cooperation from you ?
La Botie concludes his exhortation by assuring the masses that to overthrow the tyrant they need not act , nor shed their blood .
They can do so u201 Cmerely by willing to be free .
u201D
In short ,
Resolve to serve no more , and you are at once freed .
I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over , but simply that you support him no longer ; then you will behold him , like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away , fall of his own weight and break in pieces . [ 16 ]
It was a medieval tradition to justify tyrannicide of unjust rulers who break the divine law , but La Botie 's doctrine , though non-violent , was in the deepest sense far more radical .
For while the assassination of a tyrant is simply an isolated individual act within an existing political system , mass civil disobedience , being a direct act on the part of large masses of people , is far more revolutionary in launching a transformation of the system itself .
It is also more elegant and profound in theoretical terms , flowing immediately as it does from La Botie 's insight about power necessarily resting on popular consent ; for then the remedy to power is simply to withdraw that consent.u201D [ 17 ]
The call for mass civil disobedience was picked up by one of the more radical of the later Huguenot pamphlets , La France Turquie ( 1575 ) , which advocated an association of towns and provinces for the purpose of refusing to pay all taxes to the State . [ 18 ]
But it is not surprising that among the most enthusiastic advocates of mass civil disobedience have been the anarchist thinkers , who simply extend both La Botie 's analysis and his conclusion from tyrannical rule to all governmental rule whatsoever .
Prominent among the anarchist advocates of non-violent resistance have been Thoreau , Tolstoy , and Benjamin R. Tucker , all of the nineteenth century , and all , unsurprisingly , associated with the non-violent , pacifist branch of anarchism .
Tolstoy , indeed , in setting forth his doctrine of non-violent anarchism , used a lengthy passage from the Discourse as the focal point for the development of his argument . [ 19 ]
In addition , Gustav Landauer , the leading German anarchist of the early twentieth century , after becoming converted to a pacifist approach , made a rousing summary of La Botie 's Discourse of Voluntary Servitude the central core of his anarchist work , Die Revolution ( 1919 ) .
A leading Dutch pacifist - anarchist of the twentieth century , Barthelemy de Ligt , not only devoted several pages of his Conquest of Violence to discussion and praise of La Botie 's Discourse ; he also translated it into Dutch in 1933 . [ 20 ]
Several historians of anarchism have gone so far as to classify La Botie 's treatise itself as anarchist , which is incorrect since La Botie never extended his analysis from tyrannical government to government per se .
[ 21 ]
But while La Botie cannot be considered an anarchist , his sweeping strictures on tyranny and the universality of his political philosophy lend themselves easily to such an expansion .
All this considerably disturbed La Botie 's biographer , Paul Bonnefon , who wrote of the Discourse :
After having failed to distinguish legitimate from illicit authority , and having imprudently attacked even the principle of authority , La Botie put forth a naive illusion .
He seems to believe that man could live in a state of nature , without society and without government , and discovered that this situation would be filled with happiness for humanity .
This dream is puerile . . . . [ 22 ]
To the acute analyst Pierre Mesnard , Bonnefon 's alarm is wide of the mark ; Mesnard believes that La Botie defined tyranny as simply any exercise of personal power . [ 23 ]
In doing so , La Botie went beyond the traditional twofold definition of tyranny as either usurpation of power , or government against the u201 Clawsu201D ( which were either defined as customary law , divine law , or the natural law for the u201 Ccommon goodu201D of the people ) . [ 24 ]
Whereas the traditional theory thus focused only on the means of the ruler 's acquiring power , and the use made of that power , Mesnard points out that La Botie 's definition of tyranny went straight to the nature of power itself .
Tyranny does not depend , as many of the older theorists had supposed , on illicit means of acquiring power , the tyrant need not be a usurper .
As La Botie declares , u201CThere are three kinds of tyrants : some receive their proud position through elections by the people , others by force of arms , others by inheritance .
u201D [ 25 ]
Usurpers or conquerors always act as if they are ruling a conquered country and those born to kingship u201 Care scarcely any better , because they are nourished on the breast of tyranny , suck in with their milk the instincts of the tyrant , and consider the people under them as their inherited serfs .
As for elected they would seem to be u201 Cmore bearable , u201D but they are always intriguing to convert the election into a hereditary despotism , and hence u201 Csurpass other tyrants … in cruelty , because they find no other means to impose this new tyranny than by tightening control and removing their subjects so far from any notion of liberty that even if the memory of it is fresh it will soon be eradicated .
u201D
In sum , La Botie can find no choice between these three kinds of tyrants :
For although the means of coming into power differ , still the method of ruling is practically the same ; those who are elected act as if they were breaking in bullocks ; those who are conquerors make the people their prey ; those who are heirs plan to treat them as if they were their natural slaves . [ 26 ]
Yet Mesnard 's neat conclusion  that La Botie meant simply to indict all personal power , all forms of monarchy , as being tyrannical  is inadequate . [ 27 ]
In the first place , in the passage quoted above La Botie indicts elected as well as other rulers .
Moreover , he states that , u201 Chaving several masters , according to the number one has , it amounts to being that many times unfortunate .
u201D [ 28 ]
These are not precisely indictments of the concept of a republic , but they leave the definition of tyranny in La Botie sufficiently vague so that one can easily press on the anarchist conclusions .
Why do people continue to give their consent to despotism ?
Why do they permit tyranny to continue ?
This is especially puzzling if tyranny ( defined at least as all personal power ) must rest on mass consent , and if the way to overthrow tyranny is therefore for the people to withdraw that consent .
The remainder of La Botie 's treatise is devoted to this crucial problem , and his discussion here is as seminal and profound as it is in the earlier part of the work .
The establishment of tyranny , La Botie points out , is most difficult at the outset , when it is first imposed .
For generally , if given a free choice , people will vote to be free rather than to be slaves : u201CThere can be no doubt that they would much prefer to be guided by reason itself than to be ordered about by the whims of a single man.u201D [ 29 ]
A possible exception was the voluntary choice by the Israelites to imitate other nations in choosing a king ( Saul ) .
Apart from that , tyranny can only be initially imposed by conquest or by deception .
The conquest may be either by foreign armies or by an internal factional coup .
The deception occurs in cases where the people , during wartime emergencies , select certain persons as dictators , thus providing the occasion for these individuals to fasten their power permanently upon the public .
Once begun , however , the maintenance of tyranny is permitted and bolstered by the insidious throes of habit , which quickly accustom the people to enslavement .
It is true that in the beginning men submit under constraint and by force ; but those who come after them obey without regret and perform willingly what their predecessors had done because they had to .
This is why men born under the yoke and then nourished and reared in slavery are content , without further effort , to live in their native circumstance , unaware of any other state or right , and considering as quite natural the condition into which they are born … the powerful influence of custom is in no respect more compelling than in this , namely , habituation to subjection . [ 30 ]
Thus , humanity 's natural drive for liberty is finally overpowered by the force of custom , for the reason that native endowment , no matter how good , is dissipated unless encouraged , whereas environment always shapes us in its own way , whatever that might be in spite of nature 's gifts .u201D [ 31 ]
Therefore , those who are born enslaved should be pitied and forgiven , u201 Csince they have not seen even the shadow of liberty , and being quite unaware of it , cannot perceive the evil endured through their own slavery ….u201D
While , in short , u201 Cit is truly the nature of man to be free and to wish to be so , u201D yet a person 's character u201 Cinstinctively follows the tendencies that his training gives him …
La Botie concludes that u201 Ccustom becomes the first reason for voluntary servitude .
u201D People will
grow accustomed to the idea that they have always been in subjection , that their fathers lived in the same way ; they will think they are obliged to suffer this evil , and will persuade themselves by example and imitation of others , finally investing those who order them around with proprietary rights , based on the idea that it has always been that way . [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
Consent is also actively encouraged and engineered by the rulers , and this is another major reason for the persistence of civil obedience .
Various devices are used by rulers to induce such consent .
One method is by providing the masses with circuses , with entertaining diversions :
Plays , farces , spectacles , gladiators , strange beasts , medals , pictures , and other such opiates , these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery , the price of their liberty , the instruments of tyranny .
By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke , that the stupefied peoples , fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes , learned subservience as naively , but not so creditably , as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books . [ 34 ]
Another method of inducing consent is purely ideological : duping the masses into believing that the tyrannical ruler is wise , just , and benevolent .
Thus , La Botie points out , the Roman emperors assumed the ancient title of Tribune of the People , because the concept had gained favor among the public as representing a guardian of their liberties .
Hence the assumption of despotism under the cloak of the old liberal form .
In modern times , La Botie adds , rulers present a more sophisticated version of such propaganda , for u201 Cthey never undertake an unjust policy , even one of some importance , without prefacing it with some pretty speech concerning public welfare and common good .
u201D [ 35 ]
Reinforcing ideological propaganda is deliberate mystification : u201CThe kings of the Assyrians and … the Medes showed themselves in public as seldom as possible in order to set up a doubt in the minds of the rabble as to whether they were not in some way more than man… .
u201C Symbols of mystery and magic were woven around the Crown , so that u201 Cby doing this they inspired their subjects with reverence and admiration … .
It is pitiful to review the list of devices that early despots used to establish their tyranny ; to discover how many little tricks they employed , always finding the populace conveniently gullible … . [ 36 ]
At times , tyrants have gone to the length of imputing themselves to the very status of divinity : u201 Cthey have insisted on using religion for their own protection and , where possible , have borrowed a stray bit of divinity to bolster up their evil ways .u201D [ 37 ]
Thus , u201 Ctyrants , in order to strengthen their power , have made every effort to train their people not only in obedience and servility toward themselves , but also in adoration .u201D [ 38 ]
At this point , La Botie inserts his one and only reference to contemporary France .
It is on its face extremely damaging , for he asserts that u201 Cour own leaders have employed in France certain similar [ quasidivine ] devices , such as toads , fleurs - de-lys , sacred vessels , and standards with flames of gold [ oriflammes ] .u201D [ 39 ]
He quickly adds that in this case he does not u201 Cwish , for my part , to be incredulous , u201D for French kings u201 Chave always been so generous in times of peace and so valiant in time of war , that from birth they seem not to have been created by nature like many others , but even before birth to have been designated by Almighty God for the government and preservation of this kingdom.u201D [ 40 ]
In the light of the context of the work , it is impossible not to believe that the intent of this passage is satirical , and this interpretation is particularly confirmed by the passage immediately following , which asserts that u201 Ceven if this were not so , u201D he would not question the truth of these French traditions , because they have provided such a fine field for the flowering of French poetry .
u201 CCertainly I should be presumptuous , u201D he concludes , surely ironically , u201 Cif I tried to cast slurs on our records and thus invade the realm of our poets.u201D [ 41 ]
Specious ideology , mystery , circuses ; in addition to these purely propagandistic devices , another device is used by rulers to gain the consent of their subjects : purchase by material benefits , bread as well as circuses .
The distribution of this largesse to the people is also a method , and a particularly cunning one , of duping them into believing that they benefit from tyrannical rule .
They do not realize that they are in fact only receiving a small proportion of the wealth already filched from them by their rulers .
Thus :
Roman tyrants … provided the city wards with feasts to cajole the rabble ….
Tyrants would distribute largesse , a bushel of wheat , a gallon of wine , and a sesterce : and then everybody would shamelessly cry , u201CLong live the King ! u201D
The fools did not realize that they were merely recovering a portion of their own property , and that their ruler could not have given them what they were receiving without having first taken it from them .
A man might one day be presented with a sesterce and gorge himself at the public feast , lauding Tiberius and Nero for handsome liberality , who on the morrow , would be forced to abandon his property to their avarice , his children to their lust , his very blood to the cruelty of these magnificent emperors , without offering any more resistance than a stone or a tree stump .
The mob has always behaved in this way  eagerly open to bribes … [ 42 ]
And La Botie goes on to cite the cases of the monstrous tyrannies of Nero and Julius Caesar , each of whose deaths was deeply mourned by the people because of his supposed liberality .
Here La Botie proceeds to supplement this analysis of the purchase of consent by the public with another truly original contribution , one which Professor Lewis considers to be the most novel and important feature of his theory . [ 43 ]
This is the establishment , as it were the permanent and continuing purchase , of a hierarchy of subordinate allies , a loyal band of retainers , praetorians and bureaucrats .
La Botie himself considers this factor u201 Cthe mainspring and the secret of domination , the support and foundation of tyranny .
u201D [ 44 ]
Here is a large sector of society which is not merely duped with occasional and negligible handouts from the State ; here are individuals who make a handsome and permanent living out of the proceeds of despotism .
Hence , their stake in despotism does not depend on illusion or habit or mystery ; their stake is all too great and all too real .
A hierarchy of patronage from the fruits of plunder is thus created and maintained : five or six individuals are the chief advisors and beneficiaries of the favors of the king .
These half - dozen in a similar manner maintain six hundred u201 Cwho profit under them , u201D and the six hundred in their turn u201 Cmaintain under them six thousand , whom they promote in rank , upon whom they confer the government of provinces or the direction of finances , in order that they may serve as instruments of avarice and cruelty , executing orders at the proper time and working such havoc all around that they could not last except under the shadow of the six hundred … u201D [ 45 ]
In this way does the fatal hierarchy pyramid and permeate down through the ranks of society , until u201 Ca hundred thousand , and even millions , cling to the tyrant by this cord to which they are tied .
u201D
In short ,
when the point is reached , through big favors or little ones , that large profits or small are obtained under a tyrant , there are found almost as many people to whom tyranny seems advantageous as those to whom liberty would seem desirable .
. . .
Whenever a ruler makes himself a dictator , all the wicked dregs of the nation … all those who are corrupted by burning ambition or extraordinary avarice , these gather around him and support him in order to have a share in the booty and to constitute themselves petty chiefs under the big tyrant . [ 46 ]
Thus , the hierarchy of privilege descends from the large gainers from despotism , to the middling and small gainers , and finally down to the mass of the people who falsely think they gain from the receipt of petty favors .
In this way the subjects are divided , and a great portion of them induced to cleave to the ruler , u201 Cjust as , in order to split wood , one has to use a wedge of the wood itself .
u201D
Of course , the train of the tyrant 's retinue and soldiers suffer at their leader 's hands , but they u201 Ccan be led to endure evil if permitted to commit it , not against him who exploits them , but against those who like themselves submit , but are helpless .
u201D
In short , in return for its own subjection , this order of subordinates is permitted to oppress the rest of the public . [ 47 ]
How is tyranny concretely to be overthrown , if it is cemented upon society by habit , privilege and propaganda ?
How are the people to be brought to the point where they will decide to withdraw their consent ?
In the first place , affirms La Botie , not all the people will be deluded or sunk into habitual submission .
There is always a more percipient , elite who will understand the reality of the situation ; u201 Cthere are always a few , better endowed than others , who feel the weight of the yoke and cannot restrain themselves from attempting to shake it off.u201D
These are the people who , in contrast to u201 Cthe brutish mass , u201D possess clear and far - sighted minds , and u201 Chave further trained them by study and learning .
u201D
Such people never quite disappear from the world : u201CEven if liberty had entirely perished from the earth , such men would invent it.u201D [ 48 ]
Because of the danger these educated people represent , tyrants often attempt to suppress education in their realms , and in that way those who u201 Chave preserved their love of freedom , still remain ineffective because , however numerous they may be , they are not known to one another ; under the tyrant they have lost freedom of action , of speech , and almost of thought ; they are alone in their aspiration .
u201D [ 49 ]
Here La Botie anticipates such modern analysts of totalitarianism as Hannah Arendt .
But there is hope ; for still the elite exists , and , culling examples once again from antiquity , La Botie maintains that heroic leaders can arise who will not fail u201 Cto deliver their country from evil hands when they set about their task with a firm , whole - hearted and sincere intention .
u201D [ 50 ]
The evident task , then , of this valiant and knowledgeable elite is to form the vanguard of the revolutionary resistance movement against the despot .
Through a process of educating the public to the truth , they will give back to the people knowledge of the blessings of liberty and of the myths and illusions fostered by the State .
In addition to rousing the people to the truth , the opposition movement has another vital string to its bow : the unnatural lives lived by the despots and their hierarchy of favorites .
For their lives are miserable and fearful and not happy .
Tyrants live in constant and perpetual fear of the well - deserved hatred they know is borne them by every one of their subjects . [ 51 ]
Courtiers and favorites live miserable , crawling , cringing lives every moment of which is bent on servilely fawning upon the ruler on whom they depend .
Eventually , as enlightenment spreads among the public , the privileged favorites will begin to realize the true misery of their lot , for all their wealth can be seized from them at any moment should they fall out of step in the race for the favors of the king .
When they u201 Clook at themselves as they really are . . . they will realize clearly that the townspeople , the peasants whom they trample under foot and treat worse than convicts or slaves … are nevertheless , in comparison with themselves , better off and fairly free.u201D [ 52 ]
Although he does not explicitly say so , it seems to be La Botie 's contention that the spread of enlightenment among the public will not only generate refusal of consent among the mass , but will also aid its course immeasurably by splitting off , by driving a wedge inside , a portion of the disaffected privileged bureaucracy . [ 53 ]
There is no better way to conclude a discussion of the content of La Botie 's notable Discourse of Voluntary Servitude than to note Mesnard 's insight that u201 Cfor La Botie as for Machiavelli , authority can only be grounded on acceptance by the subjects : except that the one teaches the prince how to compel their acquiescence , while the other reveals to the people the power that would lie in their refusal .u201D [ 54 ]
After graduating from law school , tienne de La Botie took up an eminent career as a royal official in Bordeaux .
He never published the Discourse , and as he pursued a career in faithful service of the monarch , never a hint did he express along the lines of his earlier treatise .
Certainly one of the reasons for Montaigne 's stout insistence on his friend 's conservatism and monarchical loyalty is that La Botie had changed his political views by the time they met around 1559 .
Indeed , in late 1562 , shortly before he died , La Botie wrote but did not publish a manuscript forgotten and lost until recent years , in which he , with moderate conservatism , advised the State to punish Protestant leaders as rebels , to enforce Catholicism upon France , but also to reform the abuses of the Church moderately and respectably by the agency of the king and his Parlements .
Protestants would then be forced to convert back to Catholicism or leave the country .u201D [ 55 ]
Certainly it is far from unusual for a young university student , eagerly caught up in a burst of free inquiry , to be a fiery radical , only to settle into a comfortable and respectable conservatism once well entrenched in a career bound to the emoluments of the status quo .
But there seems to be more here than that .
For the very abstractness of La Botie 's argument in the Discourse , the very Renaissance - like remoteness of the discussion from the concrete problems of the France of his day , while universalizing and radicalizing the theory , also permitted La Botie , even in his early days , to divorce theory from practice .
It permitted him to be sincerely radical in the abstract while continuing to be conservative in the concrete .
His almost inevitable shift of interest from the abstract to concrete problems in his busy career thereby caused his early radicalism to drop swiftly from sight as if it had never existed . [ 56 ]
But if his abstract method permitted La Botie to abandon his radical conclusions rapidly in the concrete realm , it had an opposite effect on later readers .
Its very timelessness made the work ever available to be applied concretely in a radical manner to later problems and institutions .
And this was precisely the historical fate of La Botie 's Discourse .
It was first published , albeit anonymously and incompletely , in the radical Huguenot pamphlet , Reveille - Matin des Francois ( 1574 ) , probably written by Nicholas Barnaud with the collaboration of Theodore Beza . [ 57 ]
The full text with the author 's name appeared for the first time two years later , in a collection of radical Huguenot essays compiled by a Calvinist minister at Geneva , Simon Goulard . [ 58 ]
Montaigne was furious at the essay 's publication under revolutionary Huguenot auspices .
He had intended to publish it himself .
Now , however , not only did he refuse to do so , but he tried to refurbish La Botie 's conservative reputation by successively averring that his friend had been eighteen , and then sixteen , years old at the time of the essay 's writing .
For their part , however , even the Huguenots used La Botie in gingerly fashion .
u201CAttractive as was the spirit of La Botie 's essay , u201D writes Harold Laski , u201 Cavowed and academic republicanism was meat too strong for the digestion of the time .
Not that La Botie was entirely without influence ; but he was used as cautiously as an Anglican bishop might , in the sixties , have an interest in Darwinism . u201D [ 59 ]
Almost completely forgotten in the more peaceful days of the first half of the seventeenth century in France , the Discourse became widely known again during the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century , through being printed as a supplement to Montaigne 's essays , but was not particularly influential .
Finally , and unsurprisingly , the essay found its metier in the midst of the French Revolution , when it was twice reprinted .
Later the radical Abbe de Lammenais reprinted the Discourse with a u201 Cviolentu201D preface of his own , and the same was done by another writer in 1852 to strike back at the coup d’etat of Napoleon III .
And we have seen how the Discourse inspired the non-violent wing of the anarchist movement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .
As the centuries went on , the abstract argument of the Discourse continued to exert a fascination for radicals and revolutionaries .
The speculative thought of the young law student was taking posthumous revenge upon the respectable and eminent official of the Bordeaux Parlement .
La Boétie s's Discourse has a vital importance for the modern reader  an importance that goes beyond the sheer pleasure of reading a great and seminal work on political philosophy , or , for the libertarian , of reading the first libertarian political philosopher in the Western world .
For La Botie speaks most sharply to the problem which all libertarians  indeed , all opponents of despotism find particularly difficult : the problem of strategy .
Facing the devastating and seemingly overwhelming power of the modem State , how can a free and very different world be brought about ?
How in the world can we get from here to there , from a world of tyranny to a world of freedom ?
Precisely because of his abstract and timeless methodology , La Botie offers vital insights into this eternal problem .
In the first place , La Botie 's insight that any State , no matter how ruthless and despotic , rests in the long run on the consent of the majority of the public , has not yet been absorbed into the consciousness of intellectuals opposed to State despotism .
Notice , for example , how many anti-Communists write about Communist rule as if it were solely terror imposed from above on the angry and discontented masses .
Many of the errors of American foreign policy have stemmed from the idea that the majority of the population of a country can never accept and believe in Communist ideas , which must therefore be imposed by either a small clique or by outside agents from existing Communist countries .
In modern political thought , only the free - market economist Ludwig von Mises has sufficiently stressed the fact that all governments must rest on majority consent .
Since despotic rule is against the interests of the bulk of the population , how then does this consent come about ?
Again , La Botie highlights the point that this consent is engineered , largely by propaganda beamed at the populace by the rulers and their intellectual apologists .
The devices  of bread and circuses , of ideological mystification  that rulers today use to gull the masses and gain their consent , remain the same as in La Botie 's days .
The only difference is the enormous increase in the use of specialized intellectuals in the service of the rulers .
But in this case , the primary task of opponents of modem tyranny is an educational one : to awaken the public to this process , to demystify and desanctify the State apparatus .
Furthermore , La Botie 's analysis both of the engineering of consent and of the role played by bureaucrats and other economic interests that benefit from the State , highlights another critical problem which many modem opponents of statism have failed to recognize : that the problem of strategy is not simply one of educating the public about the u201Cerrorsu201D committed by the government .
For much of what the State does is not an error at all from its own point of view , but a means of maximizing its power , influence , and income .
We have to realize that we are facing a mighty engine of power and economic exploitation , and therefore that , at the very least , libertarian education of the public must include an expos of this exploitation , and of the economic interests and intellectual apologists who benefit from State rule .
By confining themselves to analysis of alleged intellectual u201 Cerrors , u201D opponents of government intervention have rendered themselves ineffective .
For one thing , they have been beaming their counter - propaganda at a public which does not have the equipment or the interest to follow the complex analyses of error , and which can therefore easily be rebamboozled by the experts in the employ of the State .
Those experts , too , must be desanctified , and again La Botie strengthens us in the necessity of such desanctification .
The libertarian theorist Lysander Spooner , writing over four hundred years after La Botie , propounded the similar view that the supporters of government consisted largely of u201Cdupesu201D and u201 Cknavesu201D :
The ostensible supporters of the Constitution , like the ostensible supporters of most other governments , are made up of three classes , viz . : 1 . Knaves , a numerous and active class , who see in the government an instrument which they can use for their own aggrandizement or wealth .
2 . Dupes  a large class , no doubt  each of whom , because he is allowed one voice out of millions in deciding what he may do with his own person and his own property , and because he is permitted to have the same voice in robbing , enslaving , and murdering others , that others have in robbing , enslaving , and murdering himself , is stupid enough to imagine that he is a u201 C free man , u201D a u201Csovereignu201D ; that this is a u201 C free governmentu201D ; u201 Ca government of equal rights , u201D u201 Cthe best government on earth , u201D and such like absurdities .
3 . A class who have some appreciation of the evils of government , but either do not see how to get rid of them , or do not choose to so far sacrifice their private interests as to give themselves seriously and earnestly to the work of making a change . [ 60 ]
The prime task of education , then , is not simply abstract insight into governmental u201Cerrorsu201D in advancing the general welfare , but debamboozling the public on the entire nature and procedures of the despotic State .
In that task , La Botie also speaks to us in his stress on the importance of a perceptive , vanguard elite of libertarian and anti-statist intellectuals .
The role of this u201 Ccadreu201D  to grasp the essence of statism and to desanctify the State in the eyes and minds of the rest of the population  is crucial to the potential success of any movement to bring about a free society .
It becomes , therefore , a prime libertarian task to discover , coalesce , nurture , and advance its cadre  a task of which all too many libertarians remain completely ignorant .
For no amount of oppression or misery will lead to a successful movement for freedom unless such a cadre exists and is able to educate and rally the intellectuals and the general public .
There is also the hint in La Botie of the importance of finding and encouraging disaffected portions of the ruling apparatus , and of stimulating them to break away and support the opposition to despotism .
While this can hardly play a central role in a libertarian movement , all successful movements against State tyranny in the past have made use of such disaffection and inner conflicts , especially in their later stages of development .
La Botie was also the first theorist to move from the emphasis on the importance of consent , to the strategic importance of toppling tyranny by leading the public to withdraw that consent .
Hence , La Botie was the first theorist of the strategy of mass , non-violent civil disobedience of State edicts and exactions .
How practical such a tactic might be is difficult to say , especially since it has rarely been used .
But the tactic of mass refusal to pay taxes , for example , is increasingly being employed in the United States today , albeit in a sporadic form .
In December 1974 the residents of the city of Willimantic , Connecticut , assembled in a town meeting and rejected the entire city budget three times , finally forcing a tax cut of 9 percent .
This is but one example of growing public revulsion against crippling taxation throughout the country .
On a different theme , La Botie provides us with a hopeful note on the future of a free society .
He points out that once the public experiences tyranny for a long time , it becomes inured , and heedless of the possibility of an alternative society .
But this means that should State despotism ever be removed , it would be extremely difficult to reimpose statism .
The bulwark of habit would be gone , and statism would be seen by all for the tyranny that it is .
If a free society were ever to be established , then , the chances for its maintaining itself would be excellent .
More and more , if inarticulately , the public is rebelling , not only against onerous taxation but - in the age of Watergate  against the whole , carefully nurtured mystique of government .
Twenty years ago , the historian , Cecilia Kenyon , writing of the Anti-Federalist opponents of the adoption of the U.S. Constitution , chided them for being u201 Cmen of little faithu201D  little faith , that is , in a strong central government . [ 61 ]
It is hard to think of anyone having such unexamined faith in government today .
In such an age as ours , thinkers like tienne de La Botie have become far more relevant , far more genuinely modern , than they have been for over a century .

Having remained long in manuscript , the actual date of writing the Discourse of Voluntary Servitude remains a matter of dispute .
It seems clear , however , and has been so accepted by recent authorities , that Montaigne ’s published story that La Boétie wrote the Discourse at the age of eighteen or even of sixteen was incorrect .
Montaigne ’s statement , as we shall see further below , was probably part of his later campalgn to guard his dead friend ’s reputation by dissociating him from the revolutionary Huguenots who were claiming La Boétie ‘s pamphlet for their own .
Extreme youth tended to cast the Discourse in the light of a work so youthful that the radical content was hardly to be taken seriously as the views of the author .
Internal evidence as well as the erudition expressed in the work make it likely that the Discourse was written in 1552 or 1553 , at the age of twenty - two , while La Boétie was at the University .

David Hume independently discovered this principle two centuries later , and phrased it with his usual succinctness and clarity :
Nothing appears more surprising to those who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye , than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few ; and the implicit submission , with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers .
When we enquire by what means this wonder is effected , we shall find , that , as Force is always on the side of the governed , the governors have nothing to support them but opinion .
It is therefore , on opinion only that government is founded ; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and military governments , as well as to the most free and most popular .

Thus , Tolstoy writes :
The situation of the oppressed should not be compared to the constraint used directly by the stronger on the weaker , or by a greater number on a smaller .
Here , indeed it is the minority who oppress the majority , thanks to a lie established ages ago by clever people , in virtue of which men despoil each other . …
Then , after a long quote from La Boétie , Tolstoy concludes ,
It would seem that the workers , not gaining any advantage from the restraint that is exercised on them , should at last realize the lie in which they are living and free themselves in the simplest and easiest way : by abstaining from taking part in the violence that is only possible with their co-operation .

Thus , he wrote of La Boétie ‘s Discourse , that it contained : u201CA glowing defence of Freedom , which goes so far that the sense of the necessity of authority disappears entirely .
The opinion of La Boétie is that mankind does not need government ; it is only necessary that man should really wish it , and he would find himself happy and free again , as if by magic .

Saving for retirement is n’t as complex as it ’s often made out to be .
How much should you have saved for retirement ?
There ’s actually a simple answer to that .
You ’ll need to start with a bunch of basic assumptions , but all you really need to know is your income and your age .
Let ’s take a look at hypothetical Joe , who is hired straight out of college .
By the time he ’s 25 years old , he ’s making $ 40,000 a year .
He should have $ 4,000 socked away in his retirement fund , if he wants to retire at age 65 .

While the big news on Friday may have been the delay of Sony 's ertswhile console - seller LittleBigPlanet , gamers also received a curt e-mail from Sony letting them know that the terms of service for the PlayStation 3 have changed .
" If you do not agree with the revised Terms of Service and User Agreement , please contact Customer Service to terminate your account (s ) .
Otherwise , your or your Sub Account 's continued use of your PLAYSTATION(R ) Network accounts means you agree to the changes , " the e-mail tells you .
Let 's dig into the new terms and see what it means for gamers .
Here 's a slight spoiler warning : you 'll be slightly concerned .
The first section of changes says that you should be of legal age to hold the main account on the system , and children under the age of 15 should be kept to a subaccount , although Sony does take pains to say there is no way to keep certain kinds of online content away from any account .
So be a good parent , dang it !
When you reach " the legal age of majority , " you can have your own Master account .
This is standard stuff ;
Sony needs to make sure it can't be sued because of children seeing or hearing inappropriate things when they play online .
It goes downhill from there .
Sony also has the right to keep records of anything you say or do online , or to simply listen in .
" SCEA reserves the right to monitor and record any online activity and communication throughout PSN and you give SCEA your express consent to monitor and record your activities , " the agreement reads .
" Any data collected in this way , including the content of your communications , the time and location of your activities , your Online ID and IP address and other related information may be used by us to enforce this Agreement or protect the interests of SCEA , its users , or licensors . "
This is not the place to discuss your pirated copy of Resistance , in other words , or how you 're planning on using custom firmware on your PSP .
Ars broke the story about the rather limiting DRM imposed on video purchases made through the PS3 , and the inability to redownload your video content whenever you 'd like is a big turn - off for the service .
Sony has added an extra-special kick in the junk to the agreement as well , saying it has no responsibility for the data once you have downloaded it .
" You bear all risk of loss for completing the download of any content and for any loss of content you have downloaded , including any loss due to a file corruption or hard drive crash .
You are solely responsible for the storage and safekeeping of your content , " the agreement warns .
" SCEA is not responsible for providing you with replacement copies for any reason . "
This makes video purchases a bad idea : you can't re-download your content if anything happens to it , and you 've already agreed that Sony does n't have to help you if their hardware goes bad .
Thanks , guys .
The agreement even goes so far to state that it 's okay if things do n't work .
" No warranty is given about the quality , functionality , availability or performance of PSN , or any content offered on or through PSN ... SCEA assumes no liability for any inability to purchase access to or use any content "
The other section heavily modified has to do with user - created content .
With LittleBigPlanet and Guitar Hero : World
Tour allowing you to create whole songs and levels respectively , Sony wants to make sure they can use whatever you create without being caught in any legal entanglements .
" To the extent permitted by law , You authorize and license SCEA a royalty free and perpetual right to use , distribute , copy , modify , display , and publish your User Material for any reason without any restrictions or payments to you or any third parties , " Sony explains .
" You further agree that SCEA may sublicense its rights to any third party , including its affiliates and subsidiaries .
You hereby waive all claims , including any moral rights , against SCEA , its affiliates and subsidiaries for SCEA or any other third party 's use of User Material to the extent permitted by applicable law . "
You make it , they own it — done deal ... according to your user agreement .
User agreements exist for one reason : to cover the company 's butt in the widest and most far - reaching way possible .
With the exception of the video DRM it may be a while before we see any adverse practices come from this strongly worded agreement , if we ever do at all .
That said , Sony is giving gamers much to worry about .

The opinions expressed are his own –
LONDON ( Reuters ) – Experience shows financial crises escalate very rapidly , and need a swift and decisive response from policymakers to break the cycle of panic .
Time to reflect , craft thoughtful policies and consider long - term consequences is a luxury policymakers generally do n’t have .
But the problem with bold ad hoc responses is they often have unintended consequences .
Individual policy actions may prove inconsistent with one another , fail to achieve objectives , and store up larger problems for the longer term .
Developments over the last week suggest the U.S rescue program has fallen into just this trap and is now rapidly unraveling .
The twin pillars of the rescue program are the multiplicity of liquidity and lending programs being offered by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
Both programs are now in deep trouble .
In fact the various rescue packages risk becoming a textbook example of how poorly designed programs can fail to achieve their objectives .
LIQUIDITY EVERYWHERE BUT MAIN STREET
The Fed has grown its balance sheet from $ 884 billion to $ 2.055 trillion in the space of two months and extended almost $ 1 trillion in additional support to the banking system through the various emergency lending programs enacted or expanded over the last year .
But precious little of this additional liquidity is finding its way through to households and corporate borrowers .
In fact , most of it is now sloshing around the banking system like so much excess ballast .
Banks have increased their reserve holdings on deposit with the Fed from $ 8 billion to $ 494 billion .
This is $ 488 billion more than the Fed estimates they would ordinarily need to hold for payment clearing and prudential purposes .
Increased reserve holdings have absorbed perhaps half of the liquidity placed into the banking system from the Fed .
Much of the rest has almost certainly been invested into the mountain of Treasury bills the U.S Treasury has been issuing .
Only a very small proportion is left for re-lending to the real economy .
It is much safer for the banks to lend surplus funds to the Fed and the Treasury than lend to one another let alone to households and corporations .
There is no credit risk .
Nor is there any liquidity risk because reserve balances can be accessed on demand , and the Treasury bills have short maturities and can be readily re-discounted .
The Fed has made these perverse incentives worse by agreeing to start paying interest on excess reserves .
Previously , the lack of interest payments gave banks an incentive to minimize reserve balances .
But now reserves pay interest the net cost is low .
Even low returns on Fed balances start to look attractive when adjusted for the high levels of credit and liquidity risk in extending longer - term credits to other banks and real - sector borrowers .
SURPLUS MONEY , NOT ENOUGH CREDIT
Policymakers have ignored the distinction between money and credit ( or to use monetarist terminology between narrow money and broad money ) .
The Fed can create unlimited ( narrow ) money by adding reserves to the banking system .
But it cannot create credit ( broad money , or lending from the banking system and other financial institutions to one another and to end customers ) .
This is precisely the problem the Bank of Japan faced throughout the late 1990s and into the present decade .
The bank reduced interest rates close to zero , and even resorted to “ quantitativeeasing ” .
The result was a huge increase in narrow money but little or no growth in the broader money aggregates as the banks preferred to keep the increased liquidity in their vaults rather than boost lending to customers .
The problem is that credit extensions depend on healthy banks being willing and able to lend , and healthy borrowers willing to borrow and able to repay .
Once the economy is trapped into a more than usually serious recession , sound and prudently managed institutions have no incentive to take on more leverage to expand their operations , while lending to weaker institutions that need the money presents an unacceptably high credit and liquidity risk .
Yesterday ’s inter-agency statement from the Treasury , the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20081112a.htm) notes sternly “ the agencies expect all banking organizations to fulfill their fundamental role in the economy as intermediaries of credit to businesses , consumers , and other creditworthy borrowers ” .
But the stern injunction to start lending again is probably futile .
Until collateral values ( especially residential and commercial property ) stabilize and there is greater certainty about the economic outlook , there is no incentive for creditworthy institutions to borrow , or banks to lend .
But without lending , the contraction will deepen .
THE $ 700 BILLION TARP SLUSH FUND
TARP is beset by even bigger problems .
Recall the $ 700 billion fund was originally created to provide a buyer of last resort for mortgage - backed securities and other assets that had become illiquid and were allegedly trading only at firesale values , if at all , that did not reflect their fundamental underlying worth .
TARP was supposed to aid price discovery and deal with a crisis of liquidity .
But the TARP provided the Treasury secretary with almost unlimited authority over how to use the money , subject only to an oversight board composed mostly of executive branch officials and powers for Congress to invoke the “ nuclear option ” and disapprove further funding beyond an initial $ 350 billion .
The fund has quickly mutated .
The Treasury used $ 125 billion for capital injections into nine large national banks , some of whom claimed they did not want or need it .
Another $ 125 billion is being made available for capital injections smaller regional and community banks .
Some $ 40 billion is now being used to support AIG .
The Treasury now has just $ 60 billion of TARP authority before it must risk returning to Congress .
PROGRAM CREEP
Yesterday , the Treasury admitted it now has no plans to begin buying troubled assets , gutting the program ’s original purpose completely .
Congress came under intense pressure to approve TARP with the promise that asset purchases could begin within a matter of days of the president signing the bill .
Legislators show increasing signs of restiveness that TARP has transmuted into a giant $ 700 discretionary fund outside the regular appropriation process .
There is frustration that TARP funds are being used to bolster balance sheets ( and thereby take off pressure to cut dividends and bonuses ) , and perhaps pursue consolidation , while there is no new credit flow to households and corporations .
Meanwhile an ever - lengthening list of industries are bidding for TARP bailouts .
The Treasury has already extended the program to insurers .
American Express and other institutions have turned themselves into commercial banks to access all the federal support on offer .
The auto industry is pressing its own claims to be “ systemically important ” for a share of the bailout funds .
Congress and the administration are now arguing over where to draw the line .
TARP is not big enough to bail out all these industries .
But the fundamental problem is that neither Fed liquidity nor TARP deals with the root of the problem – the rising tide of defaults in the residential mortgage market , and the continued fall in home prices and collateral values .
There is a popular misconception that the renewed extension of credit will revive the real economy .
But that is putting the cart before the horse .
Credit will start flowing again only when banks and potential borrowers can see some sign that the economy , cash flows and collateral is stabilizing .
As several senior Fed officials have indicated , monetary policy has done all it can .
Only fiscal policy , combined with the systematic rescheduling of loans and write - down of debt principal , can achieve stabilization in the real economy and the housing market .
Small Integers
Small integers ( in the range 0 to 10000 ) are usually counters or enums .
If you see the value incrementing or decrementing evenly , then that indicates a counter .
If you see it oscillate between a few fixed values , then it is probably some kind of state variable .
Does this small integer seem to match anything in the game at the time of corruption ?
Some possibilities :
Score
Health
Lives
Level number
Weapon number
Button Pressed
Try to find some correlation between what is going on the game , and the value of corruption .
Large Integers
As numbers get larger , the number of uses for them decrease .
It 's unlikely that you will be managing groups of over 100,000 items .
If you have a large integers that look like they are counting , then you should consider what it might be counting .
Consider then if it might actually be a pointer , or a code address , and not an integer value at all .
Negative Integers
Example :
FFFFF3A2 of A2 F3 FF FF
Negative integers start with ‘ F 's rather than ‘ 0's .
Integers are generally used for counting things .
If you have a negative integer , then that greatly narrows down the range of things it might be used for .
Some code uses the negative form of an integer as a single kind of flag to change the behavior of the code , avoiding the need to have an additional flag .
Negative numbers are also sometimes used as error codes .
Some functions take a pointer as a parameter , and then return the error code in the location pointed to by the pointer .
If the pointer is incorrect , that will lead to memory corruption with a negative number .
Magic Hex Numbers
Example :
DEADBEEF or EF BE AD DE
A magic hex number in the context of debugging is a hex value that has been specifically chosen by the programmer to be visible in the debugger .
The numbers are also chosen so that using it inadvertently will maximize the chances of that use causing an error , and hence alerting the programmer to the illegal usage .
The most common use is in initializing a block of memory to certain values both when it is allocated and when it is freed .
This both makes the block visible in the debugger ( in the memory window ) , and also fills it with values that the programmer should notice if they are used either before the memory has been initialized correctly , or if the memory continues to be used after it has been freed .
Common Magic Hex Numbers are :
CCCCCCCC
CDCDCDCD
DEADBEEF
DEADDEAD
DDDDDDDD
FDFDFDFD
Use of magic numbers varies by platform .
Often developers use their own magic numbers , and they tend to prefer those that can be read aloud , such as DEADBEEF .
Magic ASCII
Example :
474E5089 or 89 50 4E 47 or ‰PNG
Frequently asset files are identified by a four byte ( partially ) ASCII string that indicates the file type in some human readable way .
It 's quite unlikely that this will find its way into a single word corruption , but it 's worth looking in the ASCII column in the memory window , just to check if this is the case , since if you recognize this , it should hopefully point you directly at the culprit .
Pointers
Example
00434150 or 50 41 43 00
Your program usually occupies a relatively small amount of the available four gigabyte address range of a 32 - bit pointer .
Hence , pointers usually fall within a recognizable range .
Under Win32 , your executable starts at address 00400000 ( 4MB from the start of it's virtual address space ) so function pointers , and pointers to static data will often start with 004 ( and 005 , 006 etc as your program increases in size ) .
On the PS2 , your executable start at 00100000 ( 1MB ) , so pointers will start with 001 , 002 , etc .
Function pointers are an unlikely candidate for corruption data , so if you see a pointer like this , it 's more likely a pointer to some static data .
The most common type of pointer to static data that is passed around is a pointer to a string .
If it looks like you have a pointer in your corruption data , then try following it and see if it points to a recognizable string .
Depending on your platform , pointers may be more likely to be word aligned .
On the PS2 , pointers to code or any word sized data must be word aligned .
The PC allows all data referencing at the byte level .
Random Numbers
Example
9D29F113 or 13 F1 29 9D
When you look through the memory occupied by your game , you will find surprising little data that looks random .
There are usually lots of zeros , and where the data is more closely packed , certain bytes or patterns predominate .
So when you find a number that looks random , it almost certainly has some meaning .
Here are some of the things it could be .
A floating point number - as mentioned previously , a floating point number with several significant digits will look kind of random .
The constant pi ( 3.141592654 ) comes out as 40490FDB - which looks random .
A checksum - if your code uses a checksum , such as CRC32 , for some reason , such as identifying assets , then this could be a stray one .
If you have the capability , then try seeing what string generates this checksum .
Compressed data - well compressed data should look random .
It 's unlikely that it would end up in a single word of corruption , but possible .
Text -
It looks random at first sight , but if the bytes are mostly in the range 0×30 to 0×7 F , then it is quite possible that it is a fragment of a string .
See what it says in the ASCII column of the memory window .
Next week UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , Spain 's King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero will unveil a newly decorated " Chamber for Human Rights and the Alliance of Civilizations " at UN HQ in Geneva .
The room is decorated by Spanish artist Miquel Barcelo , and is seen as one of his most important works so far .
The ceiling created by Barcelo has been compared with Michelangelo 's work at the Sistine Chapel .
It turns the room into a cave dripping with thousands of multicoloured stalactites and is swept over by a stormy sea .
" The cave is a metaphor for the agora , the first meeting place of humans , the big African tree under which to sit to talk , and the only possible future : dialogue , human rights , " Barcelo explains , who worked for 13 months on the art piece .
He used over 100 tons of paint , specially designed equipment , and got help from specialists in various disciplines , including from particle physics laboratories , engineers , architects and specialists in heritage restoration .
The renovation of the room cost nearly 20 million euros ( $ 25 million ) , 60 percent of which was covered by sponsors .
The rest was paid for by the Spanish government , including 500,000 euros ( $ 600,000 ) allegedly taken from a development aid fund .
" Art has no price , " Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said , alluding to criticism from the Spanish conservative opposition which said the money should have been used for vaccinating children or opening water holes in developing countries .

[ Ed : I am not sure if a ceiling filled with needles and pins pointing will create a conducive environment for a room destined for debates on " Human Rights and the Alliance of Civilizations " .
Spain should do well to explain if indeed the funds did come from their aid kitty .
If so , they would have done better by getting some street graffiti artists in ! ]

George W Bush has had his exit strategy from a Beijing news conference foiled by locked doors .
First broadcast 20 Nov 2005
Today is Black Friday , a day dedicated to our basest and most pathetic inclinations .
The day after giving thanks for all that we have , we turn around and jump through horrible hoops to accumulate more at the insistence of sleazy , desperate retailers .
It 's a nice summation of everything wrong with this country and the holiday season , an appropriately named cancerous mark on our calendars .
Our behavior today is the sort of thing an alien race would use as justification for our destruction .
Let 's run through the specifics , shall we ?

1. Deals in Exchange for Dignity
Advertisement
You know what sucks ?
Not being able to afford something you really want , like an HDTV , unless you sacrifice your dignity by camping out in front of a mall in below - freezing temperatures on a night that should be spent with your family .
The insane early - hour doorbuster sales force people , especially people with lower incomes who rely on discounts and sales , to physically suffer for their purchases .
No cheap Blu-ray player is worth that .
2. May the Worst Man Win
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Once you 've spent the night camped out in line in front of a store , knowing full well there are n't enough discounted plasma TVs to go around , you turn into an animal .
After all , if you leave empty handed you 've wasted your entire night .
So when those doors finally open , you do n't have a line of shoppers — you have a line of bloodthirsty , vicious monsters that are n't afraid to throw a few elbows to get to that pallet of merchandise first .
3. Everyone Stinks of Desperation
Advertisement
In previous years , it was the shoppers who were desperate on Black Friday , with retailers playing the role of sleazy opportunists .
But now , with a financial crisis in full , brutal swing , both sides are equally desperate .
The retailers need the shoppers as much as the shoppers need the deals , putting a lot more on the line for everyone involved this year .
It 's a sad situation , one that lends an extra air of patheticness to the whole ordeal .
4. Bait and Switch
Advertisement
One thing that 's consistent throughout all the Black Friday ads we 've seen is that there are n't actually many good deals to be had .
Every store offers up a handful of legit deep discounts , of which they have an inadequate supply .
They get you into the store with these deals , but unless you slept on a sidewalk the night before , you were basically suckered into coming in for nothing , nothing but the retailer 's hope that you 'll stick around and buy stuff at full price , like an idiot .
5. You Don't Really Want This Crap
Advertisement
Even if you do score what you came for , they 're probably not actually the things you want .
They 're what you 'll settle for .
You 've had your eye on a Garmin with voice command or a Samsung with LED backlighting , but they 're not on sale .
So you suck it up and instead buy the more gimped Garmin ( or even a TomTom ) or the Samsung with the crappier contrast CCFL backlight .
You can't justify buying the top product when the step - down is so insanely discounted .
Black Friday has totally removed the satisfaction of researching a particular product and buying it because you really want it .
6. Seasonal Employees are Idiots
Advertisement
Every holiday season , retailers hire fresh meat to work for a month or two to help handle the rise in demand .
Guess what ?
They do n't train them very well and these seasonal workers could give a shit about the company they 're working for .
Bad combo !
When you 're trying to buy something expensive like an HDTV , you want to ask questions from someone who both knows what they 're talking about and at least has a mild interest in you having a positive experience .
Seasonal employees provide neither of these things .
7. There Will Be Blood
Advertisement
Every year boatloads and boatloads of people show up for Black Friday sales , and every year retailers can't handle it .
Maybe they wo n't be set up for the line and it'll be disorganized , leading people to fight for spots .
Or maybe the registers will go down , leading to insanely long waits to check out .
But something will invariably go wrong — very wrong — making your shopping experience even worse , if that 's even possible .
8. The Kickoff of the Advertising Clusterfuck
Advertisement
Nothing ruins the holidays like advertising .
Every year it gets more cynical , with fat guys in Santa suits promoting everything from beers to debt consolidation .
You can't turn on the TV without being assaulted by some schmaltzy crap designed to twist your positive memories of the holiday season into an impetuous purchase .
Nothing flushes my feelings of goodwill towards my fellow man down the toilet like seeing a line of Walmart cashiers playing Christmas songs with their register lights .
9. Buying Presents Sucks
This might be a dickish point , but come on .
Deep down , you agree .
Going out and shopping for other people is no fun .
Sure , giving stuff to people feels great , but the actual act of going to a store , finding something and buying it and then not actually having anything for yourself to justify this sacrifice ?
It 's for the birds .
Holiday shopping is a hellish , hellish experience , and the warm fuzzies you get from giving someone a gift do n't quite make up for the shitshow it requires you to put up with .
Advertisement
10 . You 're Poor
Advertisement
Seriously , what the hell are you doing buying this stuff anyway ?
You do n't have any savings , you live paycheck to paycheck and if you have n't been laid off yet you probably will be soon .
Just because something is cheaper than it usually is does n't mean you have to buy it .
You can go into debt just as easily buying shit when it's on sale as you can buying shit when it 's full priced .
Do n't get suckered by advertising .
Give yourself the best gift of all this holiday season : being fiscally responsible .

It is understood the local council has received several complaints that the office is bringing down the tone of the neighbourhood .
Complainants include the brothel , a mob of drug - dealing money launderers , an international arms dealer , an arsonist , a gang of slave traders , the crew of a Somalian pirate ship and a merchant banker .
A council insider told The Sun-Herald : " We have to take all complaints seriously .
Apart from the merchant banker 's , obviously . "
The alleged electorate office was exposed by an undercover Sun-Herald reporter last week .
The reporter called in on the brothel to ask directions to Rees 's office .
An attractive Asian lady wearing only a feather boa and a snorkel told him with a knowing smile that the office was downstairs .
After watching men and women in raincoats call in to the Premier 's office over a period of several hours , the reporter walked in and was greeted by a receptionist , who brazenly asked : " How can I help ? "
The reporter left without any further interaction .
He strenuously denies that he stayed and asked when the potholes in his road would be fixed .
A spokesman for the Premier 's office pointed out that it was raining on the afternoon of the reporter 's stakeout , which would explain the number of raincoats .
However , he refused to comment on the idea that the office was blatantly offering to help people , despite the NSW Government keeping up a public front of being of absolutely no use to anyone .
Mr X said : " A week or so after moving in , staff at my brothel received a call warning them that the business downstairs was not all that it appeared to be .
They checked it out , discovered it was an electorate office and notified the local council immediately .
The council arrived straight away and the tenants were issued with a cease - and - desist [ order ] . "
A spokesman for the office said the Premier had complied with the order by immediately ceasing and desisting from spending any public money .
Mr X said he had more things to worry about than political shenanigans .
" On a nuisance factor of zero to 10 , given the other issues that I deal with day - to - day , hour - to - hour , it 's a factor of about 1 , " he said .
" OK , well maybe two .
Or three .
Four on a bad day .
Absolutely no more than five .
Well , except when it's 5 ... "
At this point the reporter 's tape ran out .
As if having their reputation tarnished by close association with a leading politician was n't bad enough , the week got worse for brothels on Tuesday when it was reported that their clients had been receiving health fund rebates for massages involving sexual services .
These services , which cost $ 60 , were billed as massages or acupuncture sessions and attracted health fund rebates of $ 40 , The Australian reported .
An undercover investigation led to 80 Sydney massage services being deregistered by health funds .
In order to keep qualifying for the rebates , massage parlour bosses said they were busy changing their signs to say " Optometrist " .
Short - sighted NSW residents who go to get new glasses , put them on , and notice that the optometrist is wearing only a feather boa and a snorkel have been asked to report the incident to the relevant authorities .
Meanwhile , NSW Opposition Leader Barry O'Farrell said the revelation concerning the Seven Hills electorate office was " typical " and called for tougher laws to outlaw Labor governments in NSW .
Despite opinion polls showing Rees to be the most unpopular NSW premier since the last one , the Government responded by insisting it was well on target for success in the next election , expected to take place on March 2011 .
A campaign manager said : " We 're sure there will be a happy ending . "

Obamamania may have swept the globe since the United States president - elect 's victory this month , but not everyone is convinced of his credentials .
A preacher in Wichita , Kansas , is refusing to take down a message outside his church that says Barack Obama is a Muslim , the MyFox Kansas City website reported last week .
This is despite the fact that he is a Christian .
The sign at the Spirit One Christian Centre reads : " America we have a Muslim president .
This is a sin against the Lord ! "
The sign then points to a chapter in Exodus that clearly shows the Lord 's position on US presidential candidates .
Obama supporters got into a shouting match with parishioners outside the church last Sunday , the website reported .
It was believed to have been along the lines of " Is too ! " , " Is not ! " and went on for several hours .
So far no church signs have been spotted saying Nathan Rees is a Muslim , though Labor campaign managers refuse to rule out the idea if polls do n't improve .
swebster@fastmail.com.au
Michael Smerconish , early morning drive time talk host for Philly 's conservative Big Talker Clear Channel radio station , who is followed on the station by Glen Beck , Rush Limbaugh , then Sean Hannity , has endorsed Barack Obama .
He reports that after interviewing both McCain and Obama , after reading both candidates memoirs , attending both the Republican and Democratic conventions and watching all the debates , after attending an Obama event in Philly last week , for the first time since registering as a Republican 28 years ago , he is voting for Obama .
Smerconish , one of the more rational and reasonable , and actually more balanced of the right wing talk radio pundit constellation , offers five reasons why .
I 've abridged and excerpted them :
He starts with terrorism , observing that we stopped chasing Osama Bin Laden when he left Tora Bora in 2001 .
Smerconish says ,
The Bush administration outsourced the hunt for bin Laden and instead invaded Iraq .
No one in Iraq caused the death of 3,000 Americans on 9/11 .
Our invasion was based on a false predicate , so we have no business being there , regardless of whether the surge is working .
Our focus must be the tribal - ruled FATA region in Pakistan .
Only recently has our military engaged al - Qaeda there in operations that mirror those Obama was ridiculed for recommending in August 2007 .
Last spring , Obama told me : " It 's not that I was opposed to war [ in Iraq ] .
It 's that I felt we had a war that we had not finished . "
Even Sen. Joe Lieberman conceded to me last Friday that " the headquarters of our opposition , our enemies today " is the FATA .
Smerconish moves next to the Economy , saying that it 's incomprehensible to most people , including himself , and that it 's time to " covet intellect . "
He recalls a recent conversation :
Jack Bogle , the legendary founder of the Vanguard Group , told me recently that McCain 's assertion that the fundamentals of the economy were " strong " was the " stupidest statement of 2008 . "
In light of the unprecedented volatility in the market , who can dispute Bogle 's characterization and the lack of understanding that McCain 's assessment portends ?
Next he brings up Sarah Palin , tells us that she passed the first assessment at the Republican National Convention , but since then , no further evidence , so " she remains an unknown quantity . "
He writes :
We are left questioning the judgment of a candidate who bypassed his reported preferred choices , Lieberman and former Gov. Tom Ridge , and instead yielded to the whims of the periphery of his party .
With two wars and a crumbling economy , Palin is too big of a risk to be a heartbeat away from a presidency held by a 72 - year - old man who has battled melanoma .
Advantage Joe Biden .
Next topic , Opportunity .
Smerconish recalls how , on Fathers day , Obama observed that too many fathers are missing from too many childrens ' and mothers ' lives .
He goes on to note ,

Barney the Dinosaur asks a very important question to Don McLeroy , chairman of the Texas State Board of Education .
The context is below .
McLeroy has made it clear he does not accept evolution :
Dr. McLeroy believes that Earth ’s appearance is a recent geologic event — thousands of years old , not 4.5 billion .
“ I believe a lot of incredible things , ” he said , “ The most incredible thing I believe is the Christmas story .
That little baby born in the manger was the god that created the universe . ”
But Dr. McLeroy says his rejection of evolution — “ I just do n’t think it ’s true or it ’s ever happened ” — is not based on religious grounds .
Courts have clearly ruled that teachings of faith are not allowed in a science classroom , but when he considers the case for evolution , Dr. McLeroy said , “ it ’s just not there . ”
“ My personal religious beliefs are going to make no difference in how well our students are going to learn science , ” he said .
Except it makes a huge difference .
Barney came to visit because the Board was listening to testimony over “ new proposed standards that would encourage middle school students to discuss alternative explanations for evolution . ”
Like Creationism .
Sandhya Bathija of Americans United for Separation of Church and State quotes another Board member :
“ All this hysteria has no basis in fact , ” said board member Terri Leo .
( Leo was amongst four board members who support introducing a Bible curriculum into public schools that has already been ruled unconstitutional . )
This “ hysteria ” is based in fact , and the fact is , we ’ve seen the Religious Right do this before .
These tactics are n’t new , and it ’s great to see many Texans have caught on .
The Discovery Institute and other Religious Right forces may think they ’ve found a constitutional loophole to sneak creationist concepts into the classroom , but it wo n’t work .
Americans United has promised that a lawsuit will be filed as soon as public schools use the “ weaknesses ” provision to introduce religion .
Wendee Holtcamp was one of the pro-science advocates who spoke out against the Creationists .
Her testimonial is incredible .
Here she is giving her speech until she gets interrupted :
Despite what the creationist members of the Board say — Ms Lowe , Ms Leo , Ms Cargill , Ms Dunbar , Mr Mercer , Dr McLeroy and others — everybody in the nation knows that this is absolutely a religious battle , that your dislike of evolution and naturalism and any changes to the TEKs that are supported by the Discovery Institute are religiously motivated .
Kitzmiller vs Dover clearly showed that ID and these issues are religious in nature .
For you to sit there and tell everyone it is not smacks of arrogance and deliberate willful deception .
In other words , lying .
I know who the Father of Lies …
At which point Chairman McLeroy interrupts me to say , flustered , “ We do n’t say that word here .
You ca n’t say that word . ”
I look at him , confused .
“ Lies .
You ca n’t say lies . ” “ I ca n’t say the words lies ? ” I ask , incredulous …
Wendee adds that a number of a pastors spoke out in favor of evolution , too .
Hopefully , more will follow .

Last week , President - elect Obama appointed Kevin Werbach , assistant professor of legal studies and business ethics at Wharton , and Susan Crawford , who teaches communications and Internet law at the University of Michigan , to co-chair his FCC transition team .
In preparation for his incoming administration , the two , both seasoned Net Neutrality advocates , will be tasked with providing information on U.S. government Internet and telecom policies , along with advising on budgetary and personnel matters .
This is clearly good news for Net advocates , and as it happens , it could also be good news for online gamers .
The Wharton professor is a hardcore World of Warcraft player , a member of two guilds :
“ One of them , ” he wrote on his blog in 2006 , “ was started by my friend and inveterate tech connector , Joi Ito … The other guild is very different — it ’s composed primarily of academics and other thinkers who study and write about virtual worlds . ”
[ digg=http://digg.com/politics/Obama_s_FCC_Transition_Team_Has_MMO_Background]
Werbach ’s involvement in WoW is worth noting as it raises the possibility that in the coming months , he and Crawford will craft strategic policy positions relevant to online games and worlds , including broadband usage , content regulation , etc .
Along with Ito and like - minded academics , Werbach sees both as important to the future of work and technology :
“ What [ Warcraft ] does , ” he continued in that post , “ is provide an incentive for people to develop new software and ideas for collaborative production .
Many of those ideas will translate to other group activities , including those within the business world .
I think MMOGs will be , at a minimum , a significant testbed for these new technologies , because users see a direct benefit and are willing to experiment with new things . ”
Unsurprisingly , this perspective extends to virtual worlds like Second Life , which has been an important component in Werbach ’s Supernova technology conference .
On her own blog , Professor Crawford , a board member at ICANN , also counts herself “ a huge fan of Second Life ” for the way it lets users retain IP rights to their content ( though she confesses to difficulty when it comes to moving her SL avatar around . )
What all this means for specific FCC policies Crawford and Werbach may recommend is too early to tell , of course , but one thing is clear :
For perhaps the first time , FCC policies will be drafted by a team who clearly understand the potential of online worlds in a fundamental , and first - hand , way .

The election race between Republican U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman and Democrat Al Franken veered suddenly into court .
The Coleman campaign on Saturday asked a Ramsey County District Court Judge to block the inclusion of 32 just - discovered absentee ballots in the vote total in Minneapolis .
Judge Kathleen Gearin denied the request .
The request filed by Coleman 's campaign said Minneapolis elections director Cynthia Reichert called Coleman 's campaign office at 7:45 p.m.
Friday and reported that the ballots had been found and would be counted the next morning .
" We were actually told they had been riding around in her car for several days , which raised all kinds of integrity questions , " said Coleman 's attorney , Fritz Knaak .
Gearin denied the campaign 's request to stop the count for an investigation of the ballots ' history , because the court does not have jurisdiction until the vote total is final and an official contest of the result has made , Knaak said .
Coleman has no plans to contest the results because he is ahead , he added .
Knaak also said a Minneapolis attorney reassured Coleman 's campaign that no one but an elected official had access to the 32 ballots and there was no tampering .
At a rare Saturday morning court hearing , the two campaigns jousted over procedure and the short notice of the hearing .
Attorney David Lillehaug , who represented Franken , called it a " Saturday morning legal sneak attack " during an afternoon press conference at Franken 's campaign headquarters in St. Paul .
He said legal action was premature .
" There is a process that we 've had in Minnesota that is embodied in Minnesota statutes and rules and that process needs to be followed .
That process is called an election , it 's called a canvas , and then there may be a recount , " said Lillehaug .
" And then finally after the end of that process , if somebody has a problem with that , they can start what 's called an election contest . "
This is likely to be just a preliminary round in what could be an extended legal battle over what is now the closest U.S. Senate race in the nation 's history .
More proceedings are likely , particularly in the days following certification of the vote by the state 's canvassing board on Nov. 18 .

The hunt for extraterrestrial life is getting a major boost from revolutionary new technology that will give some of the world 's largest telescopes the capability to detect Earth - size planets outside of our solar system , a feat not equaled even by the Hubble Space Telescope .
The technique , called interferometry , combines the light captured by several large telescopes to mimic a single giant telescope with enough power to detect a quarter on the moon from Earth .
" The goal is nothing less than finding the first ever Earth - like planet orbiting around a star , " said planet hunter Geoff Marcy of the University of California at Berkeley .
" We 've never found one . "
The smallest rocky planet detected to date has around four times the mass of Earth .
This planet , as well as most of the 300 exoplanets discovered to date , have been detected by the " wobble " or shift in the light spectrum of the star caused by the slight gravitational tug of the orbiting planet .
Another planet - hunting method , called gravitational microlensing , takes advantage of the way the gravity of an exoplanet 's star bends and focuses the light from a more distant star like a lens .
Small deviations in the light from the distant star indicate that a planet is orbiting the lensing star .
Interferometry will surpass both of these strategies in the search for smaller , earth - like worlds that orbit their star at a distance — in the " habitable zone " — that could harbor life .
The technique involves incredibly precise measurements of the position of a star , so that the minutest wobble caused by the gravity of an orbiting planet 100,000 times smaller can be detected .
" It will be able to determine if a star budges a little bit as an Earth - like planet orbits that star , " said Marcy , who is an expert in using the wobble technique , which can't detect very small planets .
" The real holy grail of planet - hunting is to find other earths and ascertain whether they are habitable . "
The array of telescopes in Chile 's Atacama Desert collectively known as the Very Large Telescope Interferometer ( VLTI ) is currently being outfitted with an interferometry device called PRIMA .
The technology will give the combined telescopes precision equivalent to the distance a human hair grows in a minute — 0.0003 millimeter — from 100 meters away .
" PRIMA will revolutionize exoplanet detection and our understanding of other solar systems , " said Fred Kamphues , a telescope expert at Dutch company TNO , which built a key part of the device called the Star Separator .
The technology consists of many smaller mirrors , moved by pistons at precise levels smaller than an atom .
The effect is to direct the light from each telescope into underground tunnels in such a way that the light waves from the star cancel each other out , revealing the faint light of an orbiting planet .
PRIMA has been tested on two of the four large telescopes in the array and will be installed on the two others as well as two smaller auxiliary telescopes .
The combined system will start hunting for planets in about six months .
The VLTI , which is run by the European Southern Observatory , will be the most effective small - planet hunting telescope on Earth .
The VLTI 's four large telescopes have mirrors that are 27 feet across , currently among the largest in the world , but it could lead the planet - hunting pack even when new , much larger telescopes are built .
" I think that with the planned new facilities and future observatories under study , it is quite likely that we will find extraterrestrial life within the next 100 years , " Kamphues said .
Marcy believes astronomy 's future over the next century " is not to build ever larger mirrors , but to build smaller mirrors separated by large distances . "
The United States had a big technological lead in interferometry earlier in the decade with plans to install a system to combine the light from the two 33 - foot Keck telescopes and a surrounding array of six smaller telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii .
The project was supposed to be completed by 2004 , but was stalled by funding cuts at NASA , allowing the Europeans to jump ahead .
" In effect , now the ball has been dropped , " Marcy said .
" There just is n't enough money right now . "
Even more unfortunate for U.S. astronomers was the drying up of funds for the Space Interferometry Mission , an effort to launch into space twin telescopes , connected by a 20 - foot - long aluminum arm that could function as an interferometer .
SIM would n't be hampered by peering though the murk of Earth 's atmosphere which would make it far more effective than ground - based systems .
A decade of work at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California to design the planet - hunting space telescope is on hold indefinitely , leaving the scientists and engineers distraught .
With the current economic situation , and the push to complete the Space Shuttle 's replacement , it could be a very long time before the project comes to fruition .
" We 're just dearly hoping that some time NASA will find the funding to build SIM , " Marcy said .
" It would literally be twenty times better than PRIMA . "
It is hard to believe the mission wo n't be completed some day , however .
The possibility that we could answer the ultimate question of whether we are alone in the universe is just too tantalizing .
" We can taste the answer to this question , " Marcy said .
" That is a quest the human spirit wo n't let go . "

Murphy v. Ramsey got garbled by a software error ; repeating :
Federal citizenship is a political FRANCHISE domiciled in D.C. :
The people of the United States *** , as sovereign owners of the national territories , have supreme power over them and their inhabitants .
...
The personal and civil rights of the inhabitants of the territories are secured to them , as to other citizens , by the principles of constitutional liberty , which restrain all the agencies of government , state and national ; their political rights are franchises which they hold as privileges in the legislative discretion of the congress of the United States **.
This doctrine was fully and forcibly declared by the chief justice , delivering the opinion of the court in National Bank v. County of Yankton , 101 U.S. 129 .

As it was the adoption of the Constitution by the Conventions of nine States that established and created the United States *** , it is obvious there could not then have existed any person who had been seven years a citizen of the United States *** , or who possessed the Presidential qualifications of being thirty - five years of age , a natural born citizen , and fourteen years a resident of the United States ***.
The United States *** in these provisions ,
means the States united .
To be twenty - five years of age , and for seven years to have been a citizen of one of the States which ratifies the Constitution , is the qualification of a representative .
To be a natural born citizen of one of the States which shall ratify the Constitution , or to be a citizen of one of said States at the time of such ratification , and to have attained the age of thirty - five years , and to have been fourteen years a resident within one of the said States , are the Presidential qualifications , according to the true meaning of the Constitution .

... citizens of the District of Columbia were not granted the privilege of litigating in the federal courts on the ground of diversity of citizenship .
Possibly no better reason for this fact exists than such citizens were not thought of when the judiciary article [ III ] of the federal Constitution was drafted .
... citizens of the United States ** ... were also not thought of ; but in any event a citizen of the United States ** , who is not a citizen of any state , is not within the language of the [ federal ] Constitution .

In the fundamental law , the notion of a " citizen of the United States " simply did not exist before the 14th Amendment ; at best , this notion is a fiction within a fiction .
In discussing the power of the States to naturalize , the California Supreme Court put it rather bluntly when it ruled that there was no such thing as a " citizen of the United States " :
A citizen of any one of the States of the union , is held to be , and called a citizen of the United States , although technically and abstractly there is no such thing .
To conceive a citizen of the United States who is not a citizen of some one of the States , is totally foreign to the idea , and inconsistent with the proper construction and common understanding of the expression as used in the Constitution , which must be deduced from its various other provisions .
The object then to be attained , by the exercise of the power of naturalization , was to make citizens of the respective States .
[ Ex Parte Knowles , 5 Cal. 300 ( 1855 ) ]
[ emphasis added ]
This decision has never been overturned !
What is the proper construction and common understanding of the term " Citizen of the United States " as used in the original U.S. Constitution , before the so - called 14th Amendment ?
This is an important question , because this status is still a qualification for the federal offices of Senator , Representative and President .
No Person can be a Representative unless he has been a Citizen of the United States for seven years ( 1:2:2 ) ; no Person can be a Senator unless he has been a Citizen of the United States for nine years ( 1:3:3 ) ; no Person can be President unless he is a natural born Citizen , or a Citizen of the United States ( 2:1:5 ) .
If these requirements had been literally obeyed , there could have been no elections for Representatives to Congress for at least seven years after the adoption of the Constitution , and no one would have been eligible to be a Senator for nine years after its adoption .
Author John S. Wise , in a rare book now available on Richard McDonald 's electronic bulletin board system ( " BBS " ) , explains away the problem very simply as follows :
The language employed by the convention was less careful than that which had been used by Congress in July of the same year , in framing the ordinance for the government of the Northwest Territory .
Congress had made the qualification rest upon citizenship of " one of the United States * ** , " and this is doubtless the intent of the convention which framed the Constitution , for it cannot have meant anything else .

Andy Martin asks Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to investigate the bizarre litigation behavior of anti-Obama lawyer Philip J. Berg ANDY MARTIN

" Factually Correct , Not
Politically Correct "
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE :
INTERNET POWERHOUSE ANDY MARTIN ASKS PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT DISCIPLINARY BOARD TO EXAMINE ATTORNEY PHILIP BERG'S PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
( NEW YORK ) ( November 12 , 2008 ) Andy Martin has asked the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania Disciplinary Board to investigate the conduct of anti-Obama attorney Philip J. Berg of Lafayette Hill , PA .
" There have been a lot of questions , and criticism , swirling around Mr. Berg 's behavior , " Martin stated .
" I thought his behavior merited a look by the Disciplinary Board .
That way there can be a fair and impartial examination of his claims and actions . "
A copy of Martin's Statement , which is part of Martin 's form complaint , ( faxed to the DB today , November 12th ) follows :
November 12 , 2008
Philip J. Berg contacted me in mid-August about a complaint he proposed to file in federal court .
He sent me the complaint to review , and I advised him the complaint was nonsense .
He was suing the wrong parties in the wrong court for the wrong relief .
Berg said he wanted to " enjoin the Democratic National Convention , " which caused me to question his sanity .
He pleaded that Barack Obama was " born in Kenya " when there is not a shred of credible evidence to support this claim .
He filed his complaint and then began issuing a series of asinine news releases about the progress of his lawsuit .
Berg is playing on the vulnerability of people who intensely dislike President - elect Barack Obama , and using his inflated accusations to solicit money from the public .
He constantly exaggerates or misrepresents the facts .
In early September persons acting on his behalf claimed there was a " court order " for Obama to produce a birth certificate .
No such order existed .
Then he claimed Obama was in " default " and had " admitted " he was born in Kenya .
This was compete nonsense .
As someone who is a genuine critic of Mr. Obama , I know firsthand what confusion Berg creates with his false and misleading claims .
Most recently he or persons acting in concert with him have suggested that the U.S. Supreme Court " ordered " a response to his nonsense .
The Court has done nothing of the sort .
The court 's rules simply provide a thirty - day period for responses .
I do n't know whether Berg suffers from an emotional disturbance , or is merely a money - grubbing huckster , or what , but Berg 's behavior is undermining public faith in the integrity of the Pennsylvania legal profession .
Berg has been disciplined in the past for misconduct :

Lawyers are entitled to engage in vigorous advocacy .
They are encouraged to extend and revise legal precedents .
But they are not entitled to file delusional claims without a scintilla of support , particularly when they then use these delusional claims as a basis to solicit money from the public .
Mr. Berg has previously claimed that the U.S. Government blew up the World Trade Center , again without shred of evidence to support his nonsense .
He is a threat to vulnerable citizens who tend to believe his false claims and give him money on the false assumption that Berg is acting in good faith .
By stealing small amounts of money from people across the nation he has flown under the radar of professional discipline .
No competent attorney could have acted as Berg did during the past three months .
His behavior in federal court , all of which is a public record , is outrageous .

The newspaper stand outside Tate Britain announced " 50,000 estate agents to lose jobs " .
My immediate thought was : imagine the loss to the nation of all that euphemism .
In this age of transferable skills , in what other field could you employ a gift for making the pinched and poky " cosy " and " charming " , or for selling the gutted and derelict as space with " scope for an imaginative buyer " ?
How else could you utilise the ability to keep a straight face while describing a flat on a flight path as " convenient for the airport " ?
Then , as I entered the gallery , one possible opening for the legion unemployed property consultants immediately became apparent : writing catalogues for the nation 's emerging conceptual artists .
Those flogging the merits of the Turner Prize hopefuls , as ever , set the standard .
In recent years the emperor 's new prize has thrown up some inspired hyperbole , but in advance of the winner being announced , this year 's crop of blurbs has already raised the bar .
Given that the visual merit of the work of the four contenders for the prize itself may not have been immediately apparent , particularly not to the casual viewer fresh from the Francis Bacon retrospective upstairs , the short introductions printed on the gallery walls have become essential reading .
It is here that the real art lies .
Each description has its surreal merits .
It would be easy to imagine that the Polish wannabe curator Goshka Macuga simply chose two artists from the Tate 's archive and cut and pasted their work together in moderately surprising collages .
The two artists she has chosen are the sometime lovers Paul Nash and Eileen Agar , which gives the work a vague romance ( she does the same trick with Mies van der Rohe and his partner Lilly Reich , too , in a more sculptural way ) .
But to appraise the display in this way would be to miss what is really going on here , and enlightenment dawns only after consultation with the blurbist 's introduction .
In this light , Macuga 's " interpretation of these relationships shapes a countercultural theme in the history of modernism based on spiritual affinities , intimacy and intuitive understandings " .
In other words , she puts one thing next to another - a swooning beauty on a bomb site , a shadowy figure on a pathway - and plays modest games with the results .
In the adjacent room , changing the tone abruptly , Cathy Wilkes exhibits a pair of unmanned supermarket checkout conveyor belts .
Next to one is a naked mannequin on a lavatory , adorned with wedding horseshoes and rose - petal confetti .
Next to the other is an identical dummy , slumped and draped with dirty towels beside an empty baby buggy .
The belts are lined with unwashed cereal bowls ; there is a disconnected cooker , a stash of empty Bonne Maman jam jars , various spent batteries and piles of roof tiles .
It is not essential to have a GCSE in sociology to deduce that this is a clunky allegory of the more dubious charms of domesticity .
Read the small print , however , and you find that what you are in the presence of is something rather more significant .
" Wilkes 's installations apprehend an end point in our understanding of things as they are - a point at which words become insufficient and the naming of objects is disconnected from our experience of them " ( that is to say , " I ca n't think of any way of describing this " ) .
And that is not all .
" These precisely placed constellations of ready mades , sculptures , found objects and manipulated images form an uncompromising questioning of the self , and a constant desire to move beyond what is known . "
That particular constant desire is also what takes you as swiftly as possible to the next room to view the three films that the Bangladeshi - born artist Runa Islam has made as her entry for the £ 25,000 top prize .
At first glance these films are likeable enough .
In one , a cruel - looking woman toys with china cups before tipping them off a table and watching them smash on the floor .
It 's the kind of thing that Bruce Nauman was doing much better 40 years ago .
In another , Islam goes to her local park with a hand - held camera ; not quite in focus , it dwells first on blowing leaves , then on a gang of lazing tuk - tuk drivers ; there is a bit of contrived fretting about where to look next .
The third shows an artist 's workshop from the vantage of a roving automatic camera , a robotic tracking shot of shelves , machinery and tools .
The smashing of crockery has its moments .
The park lacks a spark .
The studio never makes up for what it lacks in plot with what it begins to say about the voyeurism of a surveillance camera .
The discerning buyer , however , is once again invited to view these films in more of a Foxtons - inspired context .
The woman who should be more careful with her tea service in reality offers a " moment of seduction in which the viewer 's agency is relinquished to the camera in exchange for its eye and memory , its prosthetic enhancement of the nature of perception " .
That is to say : it 's a film .
The " rigorously minimal " park video " gently probes the resistant layers of unconstructed reality " ( that is to say : it wanders about a bit and wonders whether or not it is intrusive to film strangers ) , while the workshop tracking shot is all about illuminating " the darker questions of cultural self - perception by the technologies of its representation " .
Well , you might say , sort of .
To some extent , all of these descriptive efforts seem mere throat - clearing , however , before the claims made for the sometimes beguiling efforts of the Liverpudlian Mark Leckey .
In the past , Leckey has demonstrated a quietly comic gift for picking over unlikely bits of modern culture .
Which is to say , apparently , that he " has a continuing fascination with the tension that exists between image and self in the contemporary world . . .
Often using found images , footage and sound , Leckey 's work engages in a dynamic questioning of the connections between surface and dimension , appearance and self - determination , location and presence . "
Either that , or , as in this instance , he is interested in how Garfield the cat comes to life as a cartoon .
It 's not only Garfield that captures his attention .
While Leckey may use " his own identity as a filter for a wide variety of found material " , you could also claim that he has cobbled together a few basic ideas about animation and painted shoes and filmed an incoherent lecture about them in front of a half - attentive audience .
There are a couple of genuinely arresting moments in this ( the reflection of the artist 's own studio on the back of the head of one of Jeff Koons 's high - gloss steel rabbits is one ) , and by this stage of the show you are clinging to small mercies .
The bumbling lecture might even seem charming or cosy , were it not for the claims made on its behalf .
Leckey 's " ongoing practice focuses on how we might - as individuals - reclaim ideas , imagine alternative states of being and create new subversive spaces within our broader culture " .
Always beware subversive spaces , particularly if they come complete with bijou gardens , compact kitchens and pseuds ' corners .
Whoever wins it this year - Leckey probably comes closest to deserving it - the Turner Prize can surely do better than this .
Internal viewing , for once , is not highly recommended .
The winner of the 2008 Turner Prize will be announced on 1 December

SANTA CRUZ , CA -- Using one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world to simulate the halo of dark matter that envelopes our galaxy , researchers found dense clumps and streams of the mysterious stuff lurking in the inner regions of the halo , in the same neighborhood as our solar system .
" In previous simulations , this region came out smooth , but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter , " said Piero Madau , professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
The results , reported in the August 7 issue of the journal Nature , may help scientists figure out what the dark matter is .
So far , it has been detected only through its gravitational effects on stars and galaxies .
According to one theory , however , dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) , which can annihilate each other and emit gamma rays when they collide .
Gamma rays from dark matter annihilation could be detected by the recently launched Gamma -ray Large Area Space Telescope ( GLAST ) , which UCSC physicists helped build ( see http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2243).
" That 's what makes this exciting , " Madau said .
" Some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation , and it might easily be detected by GLAST . "
Juerg Diemand , a postdoctoral fellow at UCSC and first author of the Nature paper , said the simulation is based on the assumptions of " cold dark matter " theory , the leading explanation for how the universe evolved after the Big Bang .
In a separate paper that has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal , the researchers used their findings to make specific predictions about the gamma-ray signals that would be detectable by GLAST .
The lead author of this paper is Michael Kuhlen , a former UCSC graduate student now at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , N.J .
" There are several candidate particles for cold dark matter , and our predictions for GLAST depend on the assumed particle type and its properties , " Diemand said .
" For typical WIMPs , anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma-ray background after two years of observations .
That would be a big discovery for GLAST . "
Although the nature of dark matter remains a mystery , it appears to account for about 82 percent of the matter in the universe .
As a result , the evolution of structure in the universe has been driven by the gravitational interactions of dark matter .
The ordinary matter that forms stars and planets has fallen into the " gravitational wells " created by clumps of dark matter , giving rise to galaxies in the centers of dark matter halos .
According to the cold dark matter theory of cosmological evolution , gravity acted initially on slight density fluctuations present shortly after the Big Bang to pull together the first clumps of dark matter .
These grew into larger and larger clumps through the hierarchical merging of smaller progenitors .
This is the process that Diemand and Madau 's team simulated on the Jaguar supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory .
The simulation took about one month to run and followed the gravitational interactions of more than a billion parcels of dark matter over 13.7 billion years .
Running on up to 3,000 processors in parallel , the computations used about 1.1 million processor - hours .
" It simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the Big Bang until the present epoch , so practically the entire age of the universe , and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the Milky Way , " Diemand said .
" We see a lot of substructure , even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is . "
The simulation revealed numerous subhalos and streams of dark matter within the halo of the Milky Way , and more substructure appears within each subhalo , Madau said .
" Every substructure has its own sub- substructure , and so on .
There are lumps on all scales , " he said .
The most massive of the subhalos would be likely to host dwarf galaxies such as those observed orbiting the Milky Way .
By studying the motions of stars within dwarf galaxies , astronomers can calculate the density of the dark matter in the subhalos and compare that with the densities predicted by the simulation .
" We can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the Milky Way .
The appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo , " Diemand said .
The central densities in the simulated dark matter subhalos are consistent with the observations of stellar motions in dwarf galaxies , he said .
But there remains a discrepancy between the number of dark matter subhaloes in the simulation and the number of dwarf galaxies that have been observed around the Milky Way .
Some subhalos may remain dark if , for example , they are not sufficiently massive to support star formation , Madau said .

Four years ago , the governor signed Assembly Bill 1825 into law , requiring all California employers with more than 50 people to provide sexual harassment training for each of their employees .
The University of California raised no objection and submitted to its authority .
FOR THE RECORD :
Harassment : A Friday Op - Ed article on sexual harassment training said employers with more than 50 employees had to provide the training to each employee .
Only supervisors are required to take the training . —
But I did n’t .
I am a professor of molecular biology and biochemistry at UC Irvine , and I have consistently refused , on principle , to participate in the sexual harassment training that the state and my employers seem to think is so important .
For a while , it did n’t seem to matter much that I had refused .
I ( and fellow scofflaws ) were periodically notified that we were not in compliance , and we were advised to get with the program like everybody else .
Then the university began warning me that my supervisory responsibilities would be taken away if I did not promptly comply .
Last month , the university finally followed through , sending me a letter announcing that my laboratory and the students I oversaw were to be immediately turned over to other university officials and faculty .
I continued to refuse to take sexual harassment training , and do so now .
I am not normally confrontational , so I sought to find a means to resolve the conflict .
I proposed the following : I would take the training if the university would provide me with a brief , written statement absolving me of any suspicion , guilt or complicity regarding sexual harassment .
I wanted any possible stigma removed .
“ Fulfilling this requirement , ” said the statement I asked them to approve , “ in no way implies , suggests or indicates that the university currently has any reason to believe that Professor McPherson has ever sexually harassed any student or any person under his supervision during his 30 - year career with the University of California . ”
The university , however , declined to provide me with any such statement , which poses the question :
Why not ?
It is a completely innocuous , unobjectionable statement that they should have been willing to write for any faculty member whose record is as free of stain as is my own .
The immediate reply of the administration was that if I did n’t comply with the law , I would be placed on unpaid leave .
So why am I am being so inflexible on this issue ?
Why not simply take the training and be done with it ?
There are several reasons .
First of all , I believe the training is a disgraceful sham .
As far as I can tell from my colleagues , it is worthless , a childish piece of theater , an insult to anyone with a respectable IQ , primarily designed to relieve the university of liability in the case of lawsuits .
I have not been shown any evidence that this training will discourage a harasser or aid in alerting the faculty to the presence of harassment .
What ’s more , the state , acting through the university , is trying to coerce and bully me into doing something I find repugnant and offensive .
I find it offensive not only because of the insinuations it carries and the potential stigma it implies , but also because I am being required to do it for political reasons .
The fact is that there is a vocal political / cultural interest group promoting this silliness as part of a politically correct agenda that I do n’t particularly agree with .
The imposition of training that has a political cast violates my academic freedom and my rights as a tenured professor .
The university has already nullified my right to supervise my laboratory and the students I teach .
It has threatened my livelihood and , ultimately , my position at the university .
This for failing to submit to mock training in sexual harassment , a requirement that was never a condition of my employment at the University of California 30 years ago , nor when I came to UCI 11 years ago .
Interestingly , I have received many letters of encouragement -- about 25 % of them from women .
The comments have been rich with words like “ demeaning , ” “ oppressive , ” “ politically driven ” and “ indoctrination . ”
Other phrases included “ unctuous twaddle ” and “ sanctimonious half - wits . ”
Sexual harassment is a politically charged issue .
The people of California have granted no authority to the state to impose narrow political and cultural opinions on individual citizens .

454 sequencing and parsing the SFF binary format
by Ketil Malde ; November 14 , 2008
Roche ’s 454 sequencing technology can produce biological sequence data on a scale that exceeds traditional Sanger sequencing by orders of magnitude .
Due to the fundamentally different method used to generate the sequences , we would like to investigate the raw data and see if we can quantify – and maybe also reduce the number or severity of – errors .
This means reading the binary SFF format .
Below , we ’ll dissect the SFF format , and describe a Haskell implementation .
The SFF file format is documented in the GS FLX documentation , page 445-448 .
There also exist an open C implementation in io_lib from the Staden package , in addition to the proprietary implementation provided to Roche ’s customers bundled with the sequencing machine .
Structure and implementation
The SFF format is a relatively straightforward one , consisting of a header ( the common header ) , followed by a number of read blocks corresponding to the individual sequences .
Each read block contains a header block and a data block .
There is also an optional index , whose format is not defined as part of the SFF format .
Here ’s the direct translation to Haskell :
data SFF = SFF CommonHeader [ ReadBlock ] data CommonHeader = CommonHeader { magic :: Word32 , version :: Word32 , index_offset :: Int64 , index_length , num_reads :: Int32 , cheader_length , key_length , flow_length :: Int16 , flowgram_fmt :: Word8 , flow , key :: ByteString } data ReadHeader = ReadHeader { rheader_length , name_length :: Int16 , num_bases :: Int32 , clip_qual_left , clip_qual_right , clip_adapter_left , clip_adapter_right :: Int16 , read_name :: ByteString } data ReadBlock = ReadBlock { read_header :: ReadHeader --
The data block , flowgram :: [ Int16 ] , flow_index , bases , quality :: ByteString }
We can almost get by with these data structures and the straightforward Binary instances .
One slightly complicating feature is that each block must be aligned to an 8 - byte boundary .
Another one is that we will in some places need some information ( lengths and counts ) from previously read data , as none of the arrays are size - prefixed .
Note that the data structures above represent the data on disk very closely , later on , static items like the magic number and version will be removed and hardwired into the code instead .
Testing and optimization
While I love to do automated unit testing with QuickCheck , it ’s not so straightforward to generate random instances for complex structures like flowgrams .
So in order to test the program , I added two functions to the library : ‘ test ’ and ‘ convert ’ .
The former just prints the information from the CommonHeader and the two first ReadBlocks .
I can then use sffinfo or a similar tool to check that the two programs are in agreement .
The latter reads an SFF file building the SFF data structure , and then serializes it back to a file ( modulo the index ) .
I also wrote a small application , ‘ flower ’ , that reads SFF files and provides various outputs .
The first one is just a table with all the flow values , which will be useful for statistical analysis of these data .
This immediately revealed a performance problem .
( The file contains about 120 000 sequences , each with 168 flow values ) :
./ flower ../biolib/DZX0XNV01.sff > /dev/null 265.68s user 1.08s system 99 % cpu 4:28.76 total
The good news is that reading the SFF file is quite fast , the bad news is that formatting the information takes a relatively large amount of time .
Here ’s the offending code :
showread :: CommonHeader -> ReadBlock -> [ String ] showread h rd = let rn = unpack ( read_name $ read_header rd ) in map ( ( p , c , v ) -> printf " %st%dt%st % 1.2f " rn p [ c ] ( fi v ) ) $ zip3 [ ( 1:: Int ) .. ] ( unpack $ flow h ) ( flowgram rd ) fi :: Int16 -> Double fi = ( /100 ) .
fromIntegral
The main culprit turned out to be ‘ printf ’ , which I suspect needs to interpret the format string every time .
Also , we ’ll need a way to format floating point values .
showread :: CommonHeader -> ReadBlock -> [ String ] showread h rd = let rn = unpack ( read_name $ read_header rd ) in map ( ( p , c , v ) -> concat [ rn , " t " , show p , " t " , [c ] , " t " , fi v ] ) -- printf " %st%dt%st % 1.2f " rn p [ c ] ( fi v ) ) $ zip3 [ ( 1:: Int ) .. ] ( unpack $ flow h ) ( flowgram rd ) fi :: Int16 -> String fi = ( x -> show FFloat ( Just 2 ) x " " ) . ( /100 ) .
fromIntegral
Running this gives us :
./ flower ../biolib/DZX0XNV01.sff > /dev/null 192.65s user 0.69s system 99 % cpu 3:15.01 total
Of course , we ’re still building up Strings – that is , linked lists of unicode characters , which is very often a performance problem .
Let ’s try the universal string fastifier : Data .
Bytestring .
And while we could add a ‘ pack ’ to the floating point formatting , we ’ll try to build it directly :
showread :: CommonHeader -> ReadBlock -> [ ByteString ] showread h rd = let rn = read_name $ read_header rd in map ( ( p , c , v ) -> B.concat [ rn , t , B.pack ( show p ) , t, B.pack [ c ] , t , fi v ] ) $ zip3 [ ( 1:: Int ) .. ] ( unpack $ flow h ) ( flowgram rd ) fi :: Int16 -> ByteString fi i = let ( a , x ) = i `divMod` 1000 ( b , y ) = x `divMod` 100 ( c , d ) = y `divMod` 10 mkdigit = chr . ( + 48 ) . fromIntegral in B.pack [ mkdigit a , mkdigit b , '.' , mkdigit c , mkdigit d]
The variable t is just a bytestring tab .
Let ’s benchmark it again :
./ flower ../biolib/DZX0XNV01.sff > /dev/null 55.70s user 0.35s system 99 % cpu 56.217 total
It turns out that floating point formatting is still a problem .
Let ’s replace it with a table lookup :
fi = (! ) farray farray :: Array Int16 ByteString farray = listArray ( 0,10000 ) [ B.pack ( show FFloat ( Just 2 ) i " " ) | i <- [ 0,0.01..99.99 ::Double ] ]
This is about as fast as it gets :
./ flower -f ../biolib/DZX0XNV01.sff > /dev/null 39.08s user 0.26s system 99 % cpu 39.573 total
Note that it generates about half a gigabyte of output , or a rate of more than 10 MB / s – faster than wc can count it .
Flower can also extract the reads ( Fasta format , takes 0.7 seconds , approximately 200 000 seqeunces per second ) , reads with quality ( Fastq format , about same speed ) , or a histogram of flow value frequencies ( somewhat slower at 2.2 seconds ) .

The Economics of Climate Change Attention News / Environment / Economics Editors :
230 + of Canada ’s leading economists call for action on climate change
( La version française suit ci-bas ) Open Letter to leaders of Canada ’s federal political parties Release 00h01 ( EST ) Tuesday Oct. 7 , 2008 OTTAWA , Oct. 6 - More than 230 economists teaching in Canadian universities have signed an open letter to federal political leaders calling for economically coherent action on climate change .
Among the signatories are some of Canada ’s top economists , including current and past presidents of the Canadian Economics Association , and holders of Canada Research Chairs and the Order of Canada .
“ Economists disagree on many things , but on what needs to be done about climate change there is considerable agreement , ” explains Ross Finnie , one of the three authors of the letter and an Associate Professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa .
“ The signatories come from a wide range of political persuasions and will vote for different parties , but we all agree that effective policies for addressing climate change must be based on sound economic principles .
Our goal is to help inform public debate on climate change at a time when people are really paying attention to this issue – during the federal election .
Our hope is that whichever party forms the next government will act on these principles . ”
“ It ’s remarkable how much agreement there is among economists on this key point – the best climate change policy is to put a price on carbon , ” says Nancy Olewiler , another of the authors and director of SFU ’s Public Policy Program .
David Green , the third author and professor at UBC , adds “ We also want people to be clear that all policies that alter carbon emissions will affect the prices they face – some more than others . ”
The signatories agree on these 10 principles : Canada needs to act on climate change now .
Any substantive action will involve economic costs .
These economic impacts cannot be an excuse for inaction .
Pricing carbon is the best approach from an economic perspective .
Pricing allows each business and family to choose the response that is best and most efficient for them .
Pricing induces innovation .
Carbon is almost certainly under - priced right now .
Regulation is the most expensive way to meet a given climate change goal .
A carbon tax has the advantage of providing certainty in the price of carbon .
A cap and trade system provides certainty on the quantity of carbon emitted , but not on the price of carbon and can be a highly complex policy to implement .
Although carbon taxes have the most obvious effects on consumers , all carbon reduction policies increase the prices individuals face .
Price mechanisms can be regressive and our policy should address this .
A pricing mechanism can allow other taxes to be reduced and provide an opportunity to improve the tax system .

go to Top Plus de 230 économistes canadiens appellent
à l’action en matière de changements climatiques OTTAWA , 6 octobre – Plus de 230 économistes enseignant dans les universités canadiennes ont signé une lettre ouverte aux représentants des partis politiques fédéraux pour que des actions cohérentes sur le plan économique soit prises afin de lutter contre les changements climatiques .
Parmi les signataires , on retrouve certains des économistes les plus réputés comme l’actuel et d’anciens présidents de l’association canadienne des économistes , des titulaires de chaires et des membres de l’ordre du Canada . «
Les économistes ont des points de vue divergents sur beaucoup de sujets mais il existe un consensus assez remarquable sur ce qui doit être fait pour lutter contre les changements climatiques » explique Ross Finnie , un des trois auteurs de la lettre et professeur à l’université d’Ottawa .
« Les signataires ont des vues politiques très variées et vont voter pour différents partis , mais nous sommes tous d’accord qu’une politique efficace de lutte contre les changements climatiques doit s’appuyer sur des principes économiques de base .
Notre but est d’alimenter le débat public sur les changements climatiques à un moment où les gens considèrent sérieusement ce problème dans le contexte des élections fédérales .
Notre espoir est que quel que soit le parti qui forme le prochain gouvernement , celui- ci se basera sur ces principes .
» «
Il est remarquable de constater l’ampleur du consensus qui existe parmi les économistes sur un point crucial - la meilleure politique pour lutter contre les changements climatiques est de mettre un prix sur le carbone , » déclare Nancy Olewiler , une des auteurs de la lettre et directrice du programme des politiques publiques de l’Université Simon Fraser .
Les signataires appuient les 10 principes suivants : Le Canada doit agir maintenant contre les changements climatiques .
Toute action significative impliquera des coûts pour l’économie .
Ces impacts économiques ne doivent pas servir de prétexte à l’inaction .
La tarification du carbone est la meilleure approche d’un point de vue économique .
Elle permet à chaque entreprise ou ménage de choisir la réponse qui lui convient le mieux .
Elle suscite l’innovation .
Le carbone est très certainement sous - évalué à l’heure actuelle .
La réglementation est le moyen le plus dispendieux d’atteindre des réductions d’émission .
Une taxe a l ’avantage d’offrir une certitude sur le prix du carbone .
Un système de permis échangeables assure l’atteinte de cibles de réduction des émissions mais à un prix du carbone incertain et son implantation peut être complexe .
Les politiques qui imposent des coûts aux producteurs vont aussi avoir des conséquences pour les consommateurs .
Les mécanismes de contrôle des émissions par les prix peuvent avoir des effets régressifs et ce problème doit être pris en compte .
Un mécanisme basé sur les prix du carbone peut permettre la réduction d’autres taxes et ainsi améliorer notre système de taxation .

The McCain campaign pounced the other day , when Joe Biden said that his running mate would be tested by an international crisis at the start of his White House tenure .
But the chairman of a key Pentagon advisory panel is sounding a similar warning , telling the next administration to " prepare for a likely first - 270 - days crisis . "
Veteran Pentagon consultant Michael Bayer , chairman of the Defense Business Board , told his fellow panelists that the new president ’s inner circle should " set aside time in transition to identify the planning , gravitas and interagency process necessary to respond to a likely first - 270 - day crisis . "
From Kennedy ( Bay of Pigs ) to Johnson ( Gulf of Tonkin ) to Bush ( 9/11 ) , " too many presidents were ill prepared for this , " Bayer warns .
" For months , the Office of the Secretary of Defense , the service chiefs and the Joint Staff have been preparing for the first wartime transfer of Pentagon political authority in four decades , " notes Inside Defense , which broke word of Bayer ’s presentation .
" In addition to identifying defense policy issues for an incoming to understand , the military is also on high operational alert . "

LISBON , Nov 16 ( Reuters ) - A group of investors led by Iberia 's leading private equity firm has bought Portugal 's largest wind power business , Enersis , from Australian investment company Babcock & Brown Ltd BNB .
AX for 1.2 billion euros .
Magnum Capital will take over a portfolio of wind farms with installed capacity of 515 megawatts and 156 megawatts under construction .
The private equity firm said in a statement on Sunday that it was the largest deal in the European wind energy sector ever done by a private equity firm .
It showed confidence remains in the alternative energy sector in spite of the financial crisis sharply reducing investment in it in recent months .
“ This transaction was concluded during the biggest global financial crisis and highlights the consortium ’s investment capacity at a particularly complex moment , ” the statement said .
Still , electricity produced by wind power is guaranteed in a fixed - tariff regime for 15 years in Portugal , ensuring “ that the income is not affected by the current economic crisis . ”
Magnum provided 65 percent of the financing for the purchase itself and raised the rest through local institutional investors such as Espirito Santo Capital , a part of Banco Espirito Santo BES.LS bank , and a Nordic clean energy private equity fund known as Fjord Capital .
Portugal and Spain have seen strong growth of wind power in recent years and have two of the largest listed wind energy companies , Iberdrola Renovables IBE.MC and EDP Renewables EDPR.LS .
Spain's Gamesa GAM .MC is a leading producer of wind power turbines .
Investment in alternative energy has suffered during the global financial crisis and there have been concerns in the sector that enthusiasm could wane , especially now that oil prices are considerably off their record highs .
Enersis accounts for 25 percent of installed wind power capacity in Portugal .
The business is forecast to post sales of 120 million euros in 2008 and earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation of 100 million euros .

John McCain in the new stump speech yesterday :
My friends , we ’ve got them just where we want them . ”
He said that yesterday in Virginia on the same day he was campaigning in North Carolina .
Later this week , Sarah Palin is heading to Indiana :
But it ’s a measure of how the Obama - Biden campaign , rolling in money , has forced the GOP candidates to play defense far too long into the campaign .
They ’ve recently also been forced to shore up support in two other once - staunch - Republican states — Virginia and North Carolina .
Even if the Democratic ticket does n’t take Indiana on Nov. 4 , it ’s forced the Republicans to “ waste ” a precious day of candidate time defending the heartland state and not chipping away at Democratic states elsewhere .
Indiana has n’t voted Democratic in a presidential election since the year Palin was born .
I think , my friends , we ’ve got them just where we want them .
Also , Taegan Goddard has four new Quinnipiac state polls :
Colorado : Obama 52 % , McCain 43 % Michigan : Obama 54 % , McCain 38 % Minnesota : Obama 51 % , McCain 40 % Wisconsin : Obama 54 % , McCain 37 % Said pollster Peter Brown : “ Sen . Obama ’s leads in these four battleground states are as large as they have been the entire campaign .
Those margins may be insurmountable barring a reversal that has never been seen before in the modern era in which polling monitors public opinion throughout the campaign . ”
Cross those four states off your list , Sarah .
Have fun in Indiana .
You better head to North Dakota , too .
House GOP leadership , conservative media , The Crypt mocked by Rush
Rush Limbaugh opened his show today by piling on top of House Republican leadership for claiming that a crucial number of their members voted against the bailout package because of a partisan speech that Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) gave before the roll call .
“ C’mon guys .
Can ya grow up ? ” he said .
“ There were a whole lot of reasons for House Republicans to vote against this thing yesterday . ”
[ See update II below . ]
He said Democrats never intended to pass it and GOPers likely realized that as they saw Democratic ‘ no ’ votes piling up during the vote .
“ It was a set - up from the get - go , ” analyzed Limbaugh .
Count Rep. Scott Garrett ( R - N.J. ) as similarly skeptical of the explanation .
When asked whether he voted ‘ no ’ because of the partisan nature of the debate , he told NPR this morning , “ No , I was a no vote on the basic package from day one .
I could n’t tell you who those twelve were on either side of the aisle . ”
UPDATE : In response to the dozens of e-mails coming in , I changed the headline to make it clear that Limbaugh was mocking GOP House leadership for the Pelosi explanation , not the House Republican rank and file .
To the many people who have asked :
No , I have no intention of moving back to Russia .
Also , when a transcript or audio is available , I 'll post it immediately .
UPDATE II : Here 's a partial transcript of what Limbaugh said on his show in response to this post .
In the transcript , Limbaugh is clearly disagreeing with House GOP leadership 's claim that House Republicans switched their vote because of Pelosi 's partisan speech .
And he's also mocking conservative media for believing House Republican leadership .
Limbaugh is telling the conservative media to ' grow up ' and not believe what House Republican leadership was saying about the vote .
From Limbaugh 's show : " The Republicans in Congress I think went out there and said some things about Pelosi ’s speech yesterday that a lot of Republicans , a lot of conservatives said , ‘ C ’mon you guys , can you grow up ?
Do n’t tell us you changed your vote on saving the country because Pelosi delivered a partisan speech -- frankly people writing at the Corner at National Review Online , conservative media . ’
" Then I resume speaking for myself : ‘ I frankly think that ’s what they said .
But I do n’t think that ’s at all why they changed their vote , if they changed their vote at all .
I think that ’s what they went out there and said .
I was defending them .
I was not accusing them of being childish .
I was not mocking them .
I was being critical of our own media for mocking them .
When what happened here was the failure of the thing was planned -- that Pelosi wanted it to go down the tubes .
Now , I acknowledge that the Republicans went out there and made the speech — or made the comments that Pelosi ’s partisan speech had an effect on this — but then in the very comment I say here , ‘ That ’s not why they changed their vote . ’
I defended them .
They changed their vote because the saw what Democrats were doing . "
So while it 's clear that I missed the context of his critique of the conservative media -- which I regret -- it 's equally clear that he 's going after House GOP leadership by saying that they have so little credibility that it 's mockable for the conservative media to believe what they say .
UPDATE III : From Rush 's site , here 's what he said :
The Republicans in Congress , I think went out there and said some things about Pelosi 's speech yesterday that a lot of Republicans , a lot of conservatives , " Come on , you guys , can you grow up ?
Do n't tell us that you changed your vote on saving the country because Pelosi delivered a partisan speech . "
I , frankly , think that 's what they said , but I do n't think that 's at all why they changed their vote , if they changed their vote at all .
I think that 's what they went out there and said .
The speech by Pelosi was irresponsible .
She is stupid .
One trillion of wealth was lost yesterday with that 777 - point drop .
But it 's coming a little bit today as it's up 264 points at the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Now , I think what happened -- this is pure politics -- the Republicans in the House are sitting there watching the vote go , and they 're seeing all these Democrats vote " no . "
Do you know that 12 members of Barney Frank 's committee voted " no " ?
Barney Frank was n't running around trying to change any votes .
So the Republicans are watching all these Democrats vote " no " after being told all week it was their responsibility to join with Democrats to make this happen , and after knowing full well that the Democrats really wanted this to happen , they could have passed it on their own without Republican help .
That was the spin .
And then they sit there and they see all these Democrats voting against it , voting nay , and they say , wait a minute , what 's happening here , and they figured it out .
They figured out that the vast majority of public opinion around the country is dead set opposed to this , is n't even close , and they see Democrats in crucially close districts voting against it so they can run around and campaign , " I voted against that bailout , I knew it was the wrong thing to do , but our Republicans voted for it . "
It was a setup from the get - go , and however it is that the Republicans decided to change votes or to vote against it , it was the wise and smart thing to do .
What Is Cuil Theory ?
Cuil Theory Means Business
Cuil is the cutting edge .
The advances in the field are occurring at an unheard of pace .
The recovery of the world economy may very well depend on science finding a productive way of harnessing the Cuil .
Origins of Cuil Theory .
The idea was to lampoon the terrible search engine capabilities of the Cuil search engine , while providing a functionally stimulating idea about the interrelationship between tangential things .
The result was the following exchange :
HalCion : Reddit 's thumbnails have a Cuil level of effectiveness .
RedDyeNumber4
Can we make that a unit of measurement ?
One Cuil =
One level of abstraction away from the reality of a situation .
Example : You ask me for a Hamburger .
1 Cuil : if you asked me for a hamburger , and I gave you a raccoon .
2 Cuils :
If you asked me for a hamburger , but it turns out I do n't really exist .
Where I was originally standing , a picture of a hamburger rests on the ground .
3 Cuils : You awake as a hamburger .
You start screaming only to have special sauce fly from your lips .
The world is in sepia .
4 Cuils : Why are we speaking German ?
A mime cries softly as he cradles a young cow .
Your grandfather stares at you as the cow falls apart into patties .
You look down only to see me with pickles for eyes , I am singing the song that gives birth to the universe .
5 Cuils :
You ask for a hamburger , I give you a hamburger .
You raise it to your lips and take a bite .
Your eye twitches involuntarily .
Across the street a father of three falls down the stairs .
You swallow and look down at the hamburger in your hands .
I give you a hamburger .
You swallow and look down at the hamburger in your hands .
You can not swallow .
There are children at the top of the stairs .
A pickle shifts uneasily under the bun .
I give you a hamburger .
You look at my face , and I am pleading with you .

I give you a hamburger .
You are on your knees .
You plead with me to go across the street .
I hear only children 's laughter .
I give you a hamburger .
You are screaming as you fall down the stairs .
I am your child .
You can not see anything .
You take a bite of the hamburger .
The concrete rushes up to meet you .
You awake with a start in your own bed .
Your eye twitches involuntarily .
I give you a hamburger .
As you kill me , I do not make a sound .
I give you a hamburger .
6 Cuils :
You ask me for a hamburger .
My attempt to reciprocate is cut brutally short as my body experiences a sudden lack of electrons .
Across a variety of hidden dimensions you are dismayed .
John Lennon hands me an apple , but it slips through my fingers .
I am reborn as an ocelot .
You disapprove .
A crack echoes through the universe in defiance of conventional physics as cosmological background noise shifts from randomness to a perfect A Flat .
Children everywhere stop what they are doing and hum along in perfect pitch with the background radiation .
Birds fall from the sky as the sun engulfs the earth .
You hesitate momentarily before allowing yourself to assume the locus of all knowledge .
Entropy crumbles as you peruse the information contained within the universe .
A small library in Phoenix ceases to exist .
You stumble under the weight of everythingness , Your mouth opens up to cry out , and collapses around your body before blinking you out of the spatial plane .
You exist only within the fourth dimension .
The fountainhead of all knowledge rolls along the ground and collides with a small dog .
My head tastes sideways as spacetime is reestablished , you blink back into the corporeal world disoriented , only for me to hand you a hamburger as my body collapses under the strain of reconstitution .
The universe has reasserted itself .
A particular small dog is fed steak for the rest of its natural life .
You die in a freak accident moments later , and you soul works at the returns desk for the Phoenix library .

Your disapproval sends ripples through the inter - dimensional void between life and death .
A small child begins to cry as he walks toward the stairway where his father stands .

Apparently , people thought this was an interesting way to consider the relationships between objects .
This website is an attempt to explain exactly how Cuil Theory is intended to work , so that in the future we can rate world on a scale of strangeness and surrealism that actually fits a standard .
For all practical purposes , the Cuil is represented by an Interrobang : ‽
This is because the Interrobang is fearsome , awesome , and not in use for mathematical reasons to the best of my knowledge .
Anyone is welcome to join the site and help construct Cuil Theory , and we hope you use it while describing a drug trip in the very near future .
I propose 0 Cuil , or " absolute Cuil " .
0 Cuil : I ask for a hamburger , you give me the epitome of all hamburgers , to the most subjective detail .
Observers in a state of Perfect Cuil are often introduced to a phenomenon known as the Cuil Paradox , where the hamburger asked / given ratio is so near 1:1 that the observer begins to doubt the reality , suspecting that the hamburger was an artifact of their manufactured memories .
Then , in fact , they would be as far from absolute Cuil as possible .
What about the idea of negative Cuil , that head toward an infinite negative Cuil or a lower bound that is absolute realism .
If I were to present you with a unified theory of everything in the universe , it would be absolute negative Cuil .
Everything else is just grades of negative Cuil below 0 Cuil or normal reality .

HUNAN , CHINA - CFP reported on Nov 16 on a duck 's attack on a fish in a park lake in Changsa , Hunan Province .
The attack was foiled when a swarm of carps surrounded and attacked the assailant .
Greatly outnumbered , the duck was forced to pull out and fled in panic , leaving the fish victorious .
Swarms of carps gather in a bid to foil the assailant 's attack .
The swarm quickly surrounds the perpetrator and begins a counterattack .
The duck flees from the carps that begin attacking in droves .
Our attacker becomes the attacked , and is forced to flee in a panic .
No game captured my imagination when I was growing up like SimCity .
Certainly , a part of it was my God complex , but more it was the open - ended nature of a game with few rules that let you build a city .
I spent countless hours on my computer playing it , I even spent countless hours on the Super Nintendo playing it when it was ported to that console .
Now it ’s coming to the iPhone — countless hours will be lost again .
I got a chance to play a near - complete version of it today ; it looks great .
Fans of the series will recognize the SimCity 3000 look and feel , but the addition of touch screen controls makes sense for things like zoning ( creating a certain type of building zone ) .
Using the multi - touch capabilities of the iPhone to do things like zooming in and out of your city also makes the game a good fit for the device .
EA has already made two SimCity versions for Nintendo ’s portable system , the Nintendo DS , but even though I have that device as well , I ’m quickly finding the iPhone is becoming my go - top mobile gaming device .
Part of it is because I always have the device on me , but it ’s also that the iPhone is powerful , as you can tell from the fact that it can run this relatively advanced version of SimCity .
I should note that there were some loading time issues in the demo I tried .
But EA ’s reps assured me that these were being ironed out and that the game would run smoothly before it launches in the App Store at some point in December .
The price point for the game is expected to be $ 9.99 .
Update : SimCity is now available on the iPhone .
[ The photo at the top is from the computer version of SimCity 3000 not the iPhone version — though it does look very nice as well . ]
We at Gunaxin have been profiling some of the best young actresses working in entertainment today .
We started with the Top Ten Young Actresses , examining the best under thirty talent in the industry .
People were familiar with many of the names on that list , as to be expected with great young talent .
So to complement that post , we created our Top Ten Up and Coming Actresses to look at actresses on the cusp of stardom .
The idea was to give people a heads up on some of the stars of tomorrow and give them some names they might not be familiar with .
Throughout our examination , however , we ’ve overlooked one large segment of the industry , a medium where a ton of talented young actresses work .
That medium is television .
Due to grueling schedules and timing of filming a TV series , most actresses do n’t have the time to fit much feature film work in , let alone find that right movie to break out in .
With a lack of feature film work , we ended up excluding many great names from our other two posts .
Now is the time for those television actresses to get their recognition .
We think the following dozen actresses have all the necessary talent to do even greater work than they ’re doing now .
And by that we mean moving over to do feature film work .
Not that there ’s anything wrong with television work .
If anything , TV is at its creative peak , allowing for fantastic shows like Mad Men , Lost , Dexter , The Tudors , and many others .
We ’re not trying to insult television work .
Yet we recognize that movies remain the pinnacle of the entertainment industry .
You see people leave television shows to do feature films , recent examples include Jennifer Garner , Jennifer Aniston , Jessica Biel , and Jessica Alba .
You do n’t see it the other way around , unless someone needs the work .
Movies seem to be where the big money and fame is located , and the top actresses gravitate to that medium .
Of all the ladies currently working in television , we feel these twelve have the potential to do that something more .
Please note , that if you ’re looking for Amanda Seyfried , currently on HBO ’s Big Love , we already profiled over here and decided not to include her again and be repetitive .
So here are our Destined Dozen :
12 . Evangeline Lilly
Ranking Lilly on a list like this is difficult .
She has the talent and looks to be ranked much higher , but does she have the ambition ?
People around her have noted her desire for privacy and the fact that she does not seek the limelight .
In fact , she has stated that she lives in a “ bubble ” , and that she is not familiar with pop culture nor does she own a TV .
With Lost in its final few seasons , will we see Lilly move on to major motion pictures or will she fade from the public eye ?
Time will have to tell on that one .
But until her future becomes more certain , we ’ll keep her a little farther down this list than she could otherwise rank .
Major Television Roles : Lost , Kate Austen ( 2004 - present )
Select Filmography : Lilly ’s movie roles to date have amounted to little more than scenery .
Lost was her first speaking role , although she does appear in the French - Canadian psychological thriller Afterwards which is currently being released around the world .
Upcoming Project : The Hurt Locker , an intense portrayal of a bomb squad that must disarm bombs in the heat of combat .
11 . Missy Peregrym
This Canadian actress and former fashion model began modeling at the age of eighteen .
The modeling career opened doorways to appear in commercials and later a number of television guest spots .
A self described tomboy , she was heavily involved in high school athletics , including soccer , snowboarding , basketball , and other assorted outdoor sports .
The athleticism came in handy for her first film role , as it required a working knowledge of gymnastics .
She broke through at the age of twenty - five with a reoccurring role on Season 2 of Heroes , and was subsequently cast as the female lead in the CW ’s fantasy drama Reaper .
Peregrym is at the beginning of what could be a very successful career .
Major Television Roles : Heroes , Candice Wilmer ( 2007 ) ; Reaper , Andi Prendergast ( 2007 - present )
Select Filmography : Although Peregrym appeared in an uncredited role in the bomb Catwoman , she effectively made her film debut playing the lead in Stick It , a movie about a rebellious teenager who is forced to return to her former life in gymnastics .
Upcoming Project : None currently scheduled .
10 . Sophia Bush
Bush was the 2000 Tournament of Roses Parade Queen and a junior at USC before landing the role of Brooke Davis on One Tree Hill .
Like many young stars , she has sprinkled in several movies in between seasons of the CW drama .
She almost had her big break when was cast as Kate Brewster in Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , but was replaced because the director thought she was too young .
With One Tree
Hill winding down in its sixth season , Bush has the opportunity to explore other options in the near future .
The hope is that she can transition over to movies like other former UPN and WB ( now the CW ) stars such as Jessica Biel , Sarah Michelle Gellar , or Katie Holmes .
At worst , she can fall back on her sexy voice and provide voice - overs .
Major Television Roles : One Tree Hill , Brooke Davis ( 2003 - present )
Select Filmography : Like many young actresses Bush has appeared in a couple of horror films , including the remake of The Hitcher and Stay Alive .
But she ’s not just about horror as she was featured in the teen comedy John Tucker Must Die and the action flick Supercross .
Upcoming Project : Table for
Three , a comedy about a single guy who invites a couple to move into his apartment , only to become the third wheel and have them involved in all aspects of his life .
9. Katee Sackhoff
Only twenty - eight , Sackhoff is a ten year veteran of television , earning a number of guest roles and a regular gig on the Richard Dreyfuss vehicle The Education of Max Bickford before landing her current role on Battlestar Galactica .
Last season Sackhoff pulled double duty , shooting scenes for both Battlestar and her role on the Bionic Woman remake .
Her roles on both shows helped set a standard for action - heroine cool and complexity .
Still , few stars from sci - fi shows , even acclaimed ones , achieve mainstream stardom .
Odds do n’t favor Sackhoff breaking out , particularly in light of the fact that Battlestar gets low ratings despite its acclaimed status .
But do n’t count her out just yet .
Sackhoff has the rare ability to combine the qualities of strength and vulnerability at once , and already has a cult following from her sci - fi work .
With her tenure on Battlestar Galactica coming to a close , she can start the next chapter in her career .
Maybe movies are the next step ?
Major Television Roles : The Education of Max Bickford , Nell Bickford ( 2001 - 2002 ) ; Battlestar Galactica , Captain Kara ‘ Starbuck ’ Thrace ( 2004 - present ) ; Bionic Woman , Sarah Corvus ( 2007 ) .
Select Filmography : Sackhoff does not have a lengthy film history , making her motion picture debut in My First Mister , and appearing in film in Halloween : Resurrection as Jenna “ Jen ” Danzig .
She has also done a few made for television movies .
Upcoming Project : None currently scheduled .
8. Olivia Wilde
Wilde got her start on short - lived Fox show Skin ( most memorable for the line , “ His father is the district attorney ! ” in promos ) before breaking out in her role as Alex Kelly , a bisexual , who had a relationship with Mischa Barton ’s character Marissa on The O.C .
She was later cast in the midseason replacement The Black Donnellys ( aptly so because she holds both Irish and U.S. passports ) before landing her current gig on House .
Her movie career has less hits on the résumé , although she was given strong consideration to play the Bond girl Vesper Lynd in the 2006 hit Casino Royale , a role that eventually went to Eva Green .
Major Television Roles : Skin , Jewel Goldman ( 2003 - 2004 ) ; The O.C. , Alex Kelly ( 2004 -2005 ) ; The Black Donnellys , Jenny Reilly ( 2007 ) ; House , Thirteen / Dr. Remy Hadley ( 2007 - present )
Select Filmography : Wilde has appeared in minor roles in the teen comedy The Girl Next Door alongside Elisha Cuthbert and the true story turned drama Alpha Dog .
Her biggest role came in the recent adventure thriller Turistas .
Upcoming Project : The Year One , a comedy with Jack Black and Michael Cera about a couple of lazy hunter - gatherers who set off on an epic journey through the ancient world .
7. Anna Friel
This British star got her start at the age of 13 , kicking off a series of appearances on various British television shows and movies .
Her work includes two memorable moments , a lesbian kiss on the soap Brookside and a much discussed ménage à trois scene in the TV film The Tribe .
Friel then moved on to work in features , although mainly in smaller rolls , before joining the cast of the Bryan Fuller created drama Pushing Daisies .
Friel was nominated for a Golden Globe in the show ’s first season .
Sadly , as we are publishing this article , word has leaked that Pushing Daisies has been cancelled by ABC .
That puts and end to the Charlotte Charles character , but allows Friel to pursue more big screen employment .
Major Television Roles : Pushing Daisies , Charlotte ‘ Chuck ’ Charles ( 2007 - present )
Select Filmography : Friel ’s largest roles have been as Roz Harmison in the internationally successful Goal !
franchise , a series of movies about soccer , and as Lady Claire in the Michael Crichton adaptation Timeline .
Upcoming Project : Land of the Lost , a Will Ferrell comedy about a forest ranger who inadvertently stumbles into a mysterious land populated by dinosaurs and other creatures .
6. Summer Glau
A professional dancer since age 12 , Glau is a classically trained ballerina and knows several other dances .
She parlayed her skills into several television commercial appearances before being cast as a ballerina ( guess those lessons came in handy ) in an episode of Angel .
It was there that she caught the eye of writer / director and show co-creator Joss Whdeon .
Whedon would later cast her in his short - lived sci- fi series Firefly .
Glau has followed up her role on Firefly with a number of sci - fi shows , furthering her fan base .
Although relatively new to the spotlight , Glau ’s already won two Saturn Awards ( 2005 for Serenity and 2008 for Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ) and in 2008 she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards .
Seems like only a matter of time before we see Glau on the big screen more often .
Major Television Roles : Firefly , River Tam ( 2002 - 2003 ) ; The Unit , Crystal Burns ( 2006 - 2007 ) ; The 4400 , Tess Doerner ( 2005 - 2007 ) ; Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , Cameron Phillips ( 2008 - present )
Select Filmography : Glau ’s movie experience is limited to Serenity , the feature film sequel for Firefly .
Upcoming Project : None currently scheduled .
5. Hayden Panettiere
Panettiere started young .
I mean real young .
She began modeling at the age of four months and started appearing in commercials at age eleven months .
At age 6 , she landed a role on the ABC soap opera One Life to Live , and two years later landed a role on the CBS soap opera Guiding Light .
Several television guess spots , feature films , and made - for - TV movies would follow before Panettiere landed her part on Heroes as a high school cheerleader with regenerative healing powers .
And if her live acting résumé was not enough , she does voice work , including providing the voice for Dot in Pixar ’s A Bug ’s Life and assorted voices in several video games .
Oh , and in 1999 Panettiere was nominated for a Grammy .
And did I mention she ’s not even twenty yet ?
I think she has a nice career ahead of her .
Major Television Roles : One Life to Live , Sarah Victoria ‘ Flash ’ Roberts ( 1994 -1997 ) ; Guiding Light , Elizabeth ‘ Lizzie ’ Spaulding ( 1996-2000 ) ; Ally McBeal , Maddie Harrington ( 2002 ) ; Heroes , Claire Bennet ( 2006 - present )
Select Filmography :
In movies , Panettiere was first recognized for her role as Sheryl Yoast , Will Patton ’s daughter , in the Disney football film Remember the Titans .
She also starred as a ( surprise , surprise ) cheerleader in the direct to video Bring It On : All or Nothing and appeared in the Kate Hudson romancer Raising Helen .
Upcoming Project : I Love You Beth Cooper , a comedy about a nerdy valedictorian who proclaims his love for the hottest and most popular girl in school .
4. Anna Paquin
Paquin ’s inclusion on this list can certainly be debated .
At age 11 , she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Jane Campion ’s The Piano .
That made her the second - youngest Oscar winner in history after Tatum O’Neal ( and let ’s hope her career turns out better ) .
Paquin followed up her Oscar win with a series of roles , although generally in smaller films and general of a supporting nature .
The one major exception was her role as Rogue is the popular X - Men trilogy .
If you ’ve won an Oscar and appeared in major motion pictures , can you be destined for greater things ?
In this case I believe the answer is yes .
Paquin has yet to become a leading lady in Hollywood , and after headlining the popular HBO vampire drama True Blood , she may be in line for such a promotion .
Major Television Roles : True Blood , Sookie Stackhouse ( 2008 - present )
Select Filmography :
In addition to her role in the X - Men trilogy , Paquin may be most recognized for her roles in Fly Away Home , Finding Forrester , and as Polexia Aphrodisi in Almost Famous .
Upcoming Project : Margaret , Paquin co-stars in the Matt Damon drama about a young woman who witnesses a bus accident and is caught up with consequences .
3. Blake Lively
Lively can thank her brother for her career , as he made his agent send out auditions on her behalf despite her disinterest in acting .
One of the auditions landed her the role of Bridget in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movie , and Lively ’s career was launched .
Her first film was only in 2005 , but in that short time period Lively ’s star has been on a meteoric rise .
After a Teen Choice Award nomination for the Pants movie , she really began to gain in popularity last year after landing the starring role on the teen TV series Gossip Girl .
This time she won two Teen Choice Awards for her work .
With the blonde bombshell only a few years into her career , Lively should have plenty of big roles in the future .
Major Television Roles : Gossip Girl , Serena van der Woodsen ( 2007 - present )
Select Filmography :
In addition to her role in the The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movie and its sequel , Lively has starred in the college comedy Accepted .
Upcoming Project : The Private Lives of Pippa Lee , a star - studded drama about Pippa Lee a woman who engages in a period of reflection and finds herself heading toward a quiet nervous breakdown .
2. Kristen Bell
Bell rose to fame and became best known for her lead role in Veronica Mars , a detective drama where Bell plays the impossibly smart daughter of a private eye that solves crimes Nancy Drew - style .
Trust me , it ’s a lot better than it may sound .
The first season in particular is very compelling television .
Bell parlayed that success into some movie parts and a role on Heroes as the electric Elle Bishop .
She also provides the narration to the teen hit Gossip Girl .
With her Heroes future up in the air , Bell may soon crossover into feature films full time .
Major Television Roles : Veronica Mars , Veronica Mars ( 2004 -2007 ) ; Heroes , Elle Bishop ( 2007 - present ) ; Gossip Girl , Narrator ( 2007 - present ) ;
Select Filmography : Bell ’s greatest film success came this year for her role in the Judd Apatow comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall .
She had previously starred in the horror remake Pulse , and for a real treat of a movie check of her brief role in David Mamet ’s Spartan .
Bell fans may also want to know that the long awaited and long delayed Fanboys should finally be released in February next year .
Fanboys is about a group of Star Wars fans that travel to Skywalker Ranch to steal an early copy of Episode I : The Phantom Menace in 1997 .
Upcoming Project : Serious Moonlight , a high - powered attorney duct tapes her husband to the toilet right before their home is invaded by burglars .
1. Katherine Heigl
Heigl started at age nine as a model before breaking into films in smaller roles .
Her real breakthrough , however , was her role on the teen cult hit Roswell .
It introduced her to a younger audience and got her noticed in Hollywood circles .
After Roswell was cancelled , she took a role on the uber - popular medical drama Grey ’s Anatomy .
In a weird twist , her characters on Roswell and Grey ’s both are named Isabel ( although spelled differently ) .
Heigl won a Emmy last year for her work on Grey ’s and also broke out in movies with her role in the Apatow helmed comedy Knocked Up .
Her choice for number one on this list may be a bit boring due to the fact she ’s already sewing the seeds of a Hollywood breakout .
However , she ca n’t be ignored and seems primed to become a major star very soon ( and she ’s nearly already there ) .
Major Television Roles : Roswell , Isabel Evans ( 1999 -2002 ) ; Grey ’s Anatomy , Dr. Isobel ‘ Izzie ’ Stevens ( 2005 - present )
Select Filmography : In addition to Knocked Up , Heigl starred this year in the modest hit 27 Dresses .
She also starred in The Ringer , a Johnny Knoxville comedy about pretending to be retarded that has a surprising amount of heart to it .
Upcoming Project : The Ugly Truth , where Heigl stars as a romantically challenged morning show producer who gets caught up in a series of outrageous tests by her chauvinistic correspondent , played by Gerard Butler .
Olbermann just reported on a snap poll of uncommitted voters conducted by CBS : 40 % said Obama won ; 38 % said it was a draw ; and only 22 % just said McCain won .
On Iraq , 55 % said McCain would make the right decision while 49 % said Obama would .
In that poll , Obama closed that gap .

An In - depth Look at Windows 7
A few days ago , I shared my initial thoughts on Windows 7 .
After spending more time with the operating system , here ’s an update .
I agree that Microsoft ran a little faster than they knew how with Vista , which hurt them a lot .
Windows 7 better be good , or people will either stick with XP until 2013 , or switch to Linux , Mac , or the next big OS ( will there be one soon ? )
In this review , I ’ll explore some of the new features Windows 7 brings and whether I like them or not .
I ’ll take a look at updated core applications , desktop and window management , home networking , and built - in troubleshooting .
Then you decide … is Windows 7 a worthwhile upgrade ?
What Will Windows 7 Bring ?
Let ’s take a look at the new features in Windows 7 and see how they fair up .
Before I begin , I must avoid repetition by stating the Windows 7 UI is much tidier and a lot less cluttered , which is favorable for my opinion .
I still wish Windows apps would have ‘ standard ’ and ‘ advanced ’ modes , so basic users could navigate more easily , while more experienced users could use the programs to their full potential , but I ’ll overlook that for now .
Updated Core Applications
A lot of the programs that skipped an upgrade ( or did n’t change enough to count ) in Windows Vista have been overhauled in Windows 7 .
Programs like Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer are always updated to the latest version with each iteration of Windows , but programs like Paint , Calculator , and Wordpad usually remain the same .
While the three mentioned programs are simple , their UI and functionality can always be improved –which is the case in 7 , so let ’s take a look .
MS Paint
I personally use Paint a lot and usually use keyboard shortcuts ; thus , avoiding the menus .
However , with Paint ’s new look and ribbon menu system , I ’m sure I ’ll use the mouse a lot more , which is something you ca n’t really aboid in graphics software anyway .
As you can see in Figure 1 , paint now comes with a set of brushes , which are completely useless for me , but I ’m sure will come in handy for many smaller - scale graphic projects .
Figure 2 reveals the shape option : yes , you can even add fun shapes in Paint now , which will make annotating screenshots , for example , a lot easier .
Finally , in Figure 3 , you can see the Full Screen option , which allows you to view your masterpiece without any distractions –fantastic .
Overall , I like the new version of paint–a lot–and will continue to be a regular user of the software .
Wordpad
In a similar fashion to Paint , Wordpad is now equipped with the ribbon UI .
I feel the ribbon UI is just as helpful in Wordpad and by now , many users are familiar ( and in favor ) with this interface .
I ’m pretty sure there are no new features in Windows 7 ’s Wordpad , but it is easier to use and just as useful to me .
The home tab seems a little redundant in the ribbon UI , because it ’s the only tab .
Microsoft probably left this in for one of two reasons : 1 ) consistency 2 ) room for expansion in future releases .
See Figure 4 , which highlights the Home tab as the only tab .
Calculator
The most impressive update to a core application , by far , is the update to the Calculator .
The calculator now comes with a bunch of handy tools like a mortgage calculator , a gas mileage calculator ( figure 5 ) , a statistics mode , and even a programmer mode .
The new version of the calculator also comes with a history , which means you no longer have to keep 3 or more instances of the calculator open at once to retain the results of your calculations .
Previously I reviewed FreeCalc , which pretty much becomes redundant when Windows 7 is released .
Enjoy the array of screenshots of the new calculator :
Desktop and Window Management
Windows Vista did nothing in the realm of Window management .
Windows 7 puts Vista to shame and has some really cool features including Snap to Docking , Aero Shake , an Updated Taskbar , Jump Lists , and Gadgets wherever you want them .
I already find myself attempting to use these features when I boot back into Vista or Windows Server 2008 , which is a good sign that they are really useful .
Snap to Docking
By far my favorite new window management feature is snap to docking .
Basically , if you want to maximize a window , drag it to the top of the screen ( figure 6 ) ; if you want to restore the window , drag it from the top of the screen ; if you want to compare two windows side by side , drag each one to the side of the screen ( figre 7 ) –it ’s as simple as that and I absolutely love it .
With screen resolutions always increasing , the ability to easily compare two windows side by side will become an invaluable feature .
Aero Shake
When I first came across this feature , I shrugged it off as useless ; however , I ’ve already tried to use it twice since I booted back into Windows Server 2008 .
Aero shake is simple and provides a great way to focus on just one application .
Grab the Title Bar , shake the mouse , and all the other applications disappear leaving you free to focus .
I tried to capture this effect in an image as shown in Figure 8 , so hopefully you get the feel of all the other windows disappearing .
The Taskbar
I ’m not converted to the new taskbar in Windows 7 yet , and I will likely use the classic style , which you can achieve quite easily ( figure 9 . )
The one thing I really like about the new taskbar is the ability to switch the order of the windows ( figure 10 ) , which is useful when you are trying to prioritize or group tasks .
This functionality is part of Firefox , so I have found myself trying to switch windows in Vista , which of course does n’t work –without extra software .
Jump Lists
I mentioned the jump lists in my inital thoughts article because I immediately liked them .
However , I ’ve found that I never use them –hopefully I can remember they ’re there and utilize them .
Jump Lists ( figure 11 ) a smart lists of links specific to each application , such as a history of pages visited ( IE ) , opened files ( word ) , favorites ( IE ) , and more .
You can get to all these features in earlier versions of Windows , but now it ’s much easier .
Whenever you open a program , an up arrow becomes available next to the program icon ; click the list and save time .
Gadgets —
Anywhere
I ’ve never used gadgets with Vista .
As soon as I first installed Vista , I disabled the sidebar , and after making an image , I never saw it again .
Gadgets really do n’t attract me .
Vista appears to have gadgets anywhere ( shows you how familiar I am with them ) – thanks Christopher .
but Microsoft have included the ability to move gadgets anywhere you like on the desktop .
I still do n’t like them and I wont use them , but this seems like an improvement to me .
See figure 12 for my desktop gadget array .
Home Networking
I only have access to one copy of Windows 7 , so I could n’t test home networking ( Windows to Windows 7 ) out fully , but let me give you a sneak preview–home networking in Windows 7 looks good .
Networking has always been a pain in Windows , so I really hope Microsoft get it right this time … or in other words I hope Microsoft help us stop getting it wrong !
When you save a network as a home network , Windows pops up a dialog box ( figure 12 ) , which lets you decide what you want to share at home .
Connect a second Windows 7 pc to the same network , enter the key given to you by the first machine ( figure 13 ) and you have instant secure filesharing .
I ’ll write more about this as I get to test it futher .
I am a strong adovcate for home networking and believe each household with two or more supported devices ( desktops , laptops , media extenders , bluetooth - enabled devices etc. ) should utilize home networking .
Built in Troubleshooting
A computer that is self healing would put programmers like me out of a job .
Imagine a computer that self diagnoses it issues , fixes them , and gets along its way .
There is nothing I know of that can do this ; a car can highlight problems and fix some of them temporarily ( run- flat tires ) , and we can certainly repair ourselves if we get sick , but nothing can fully maintain itself forever …
I think .
Windows 7 is no exception , but the built in troubleshooting feature ( figure 14 ) is fantastic .
The new message center ( figure 15 ) highlights any issues such as anti-virus deficiencies , an unset windows update configuration etc .
so you stay on top of any vulnerabilities that can otherwise be avoided .
Below is a collection of screens that show the troubleshooting process including identifying maintenance and performance issues .
Program Compatibility Troubleshooter
The program compatibility troubleshooter ( figure 16 ) asks you a series of questions to help you get a piece of incompatible software working as is much more streamlined than in Vista ( Christopher thanks for pointing out its inclusion in Vista . )
Simply select the software that is giving you issues , list the problems associated with the software , select the operating system it does work with , run the test , and if the software works , save the settings .
I spent a LONG time trying to find software that is n’t compatible and found everything works ; thus , the screenshots below show me “ fixing ” 7 zip .
We ’ll just assume this feature works and that it will help us in the future !
For now , I ’m happy that functionality like this will be included with Windows 7 .
Conclusions
I know I said at the beginning I ’d share the things I like and dislike with the current build of Windows 7 ( 6801 ) , but this review got so long that I decided not to include many of the things I dislike .
For a short list of some of the things I dislike , read my initial thoughts .
I really do n’t want to make the decision for you , and this early , it ’s hard to tell .
However , with all these features and more on the horizon ( more about that soon ) , I can safely say I will be making the jump to Windows 7 , one release at a time .

How would you bankrupt yourself ?
You ’d want to get yourself into a position where you could not pay off your debts .
You ’d run up big credit card bills .
You ’d borrow heavily .
You ’d mortgage and re-mortgage your house .
You ’d splurge on your spending .
The money would go — to clothes , restaurants , and hairdressers .
While you were on your spending spree , you might run down your savings and assets .
You might travel to Las Vegas and drop a few thousands at the tables .
Or you might make bad investments .
Buy a stock for $ 190 and hold it until it is worth a few pennies .
Your income from your job is a big asset .
It would help the cause if you lost your job .
You ’d buy everything in sight using borrowed money .
You ’d live beyond your means , spending way more than your income .
You ’d run through your assets and you ’d lower your sources of income .
The recipe for going bankrupt is Borrow , Spend , and Run Down One ’s Assets .
When you no longer had enough cash flow to make the interest payments that are coming due , you ’d go bankrupt .
Your creditors would have losses that they could not recover , not unless you worked for them for the next 100 years , although they might recover partially by taking back some items such as your boat , car , and house .
Borrowing and national debt
Government is not different .
But a government need not become entirely bankrupt in order that its citizens suffer the ill effects of excessive borrowing and spending .
One of the most fateful first steps of any new government is funding its liabilities , that is , creating a permanent national debt .
James Jackson , on February 9 , 1790 , urged the First Congress of the United States of America to pay off its obligations then and there by taxes , and not to fund the debt .
England , he noted , began with a debt of 5 million pounds in 1706 , which by 1786 had become 236 million pounds .
England ’s experience is typical .
A national debt grows , once the government adopts the principle of funding its debts rather than pay - as - you - go , because the interest payments are shifted to future taxpayers ; and this provides an incentive to borrow now , spend now , and avoid having to pay in full for one ’s consumption .
If Congress owes $ 1,000 , we know that that sum if funded into a national debt is equivalent to a perpetual payment of $ 50 a year in interest forever after ( at an assumed 5 % rate ) .
Future generations are burdened with taxes in order to pay interest on a portion of the debts incurred by a prior generation , and they in turn have an incentive to burden future generations with having to pay taxes to support the debts that they incur .
The national debt becomes a burden on productivity , since the interest payments must be paid for with taxes on those who are producing income .
They are made that much poorer .
Those who are taxed get nothing in return for making these interest payments ; the preceding generations have already reaped the benefits of the loans .
The national debt becomes a means to sustain the immoral practice of stealing from one ’s children to sustain one ’s own consumption .
The national debt becomes a focal point of inter-generational conflict .
The U.S. national debt was 2,600 billions of dollars in 1988 .
It is now 10,000 billions .
This means that most of the existing debt has been incurred by the governments of the generations that are still alive .
The recipients of the interest payments are whoever invests in the debt obligations .
Having paid a fair price for them in the market , they get a fair return .
The debts of a sovereign are not without risk of default .
For many countries , the risk is substantial .
Eventually , the size of the debt is so large and the interest payments so great that either the government goes bankrupt ( repudiating the debt ) , or destroys its currency ( another form of repudiation ) , or is forced to reduce its programs and activities .
Spending to hold up prices
One thing governments are fond of doing is throwing money into bad investments .
Nowadays they call their spending " investment . "
Spending is bad , but investment is good , right ?
Not when the investments are lousy .
The government loves lousy investments .
Governments will buy just about anything that you and I would never go near .
In fact , their economists will argue that they are making the investments that you and I should have made and did n’t .
Baloney .
You and I are not shy at gambling on just about any venture .
How many biotech companies are there with continual deficits ?
These economists have no idea when to shift their own savings out of overpriced stocks , but they are experts at sinking our untold billions into lost causes like depreciated mortgages and depreciating currencies .
To understand this point fully , consider the case of Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt .
Their wealth was in the billion - dollar range before they went bankrupt .
They lost their fortune by overtrading , that is , buying too much of what seemed like a good thing , often on borrowed money .
Overtrading ( and overtrading via borrowing ) is the cardinal sin of successful speculators .
It is what leads to the demise of more speculators than any other single cause .
The Hunts bought futures and forward contracts in silver ( in conjunction with a Saudi Arabian syndicate . )
They also bought silver itself .
They began buying in 1973 when silver was $ 2 an ounce .
They continued buying in the 1970s when silver ranged between $ 3.75 and $ 6.25 an ounce .
Along with gold , silver began a steep ascent from 1978 until February of 1980 , when silver reached $ 50 an ounce .
The Hunt brothers owned 50 million ounces outright and had bought futures contracts on another 80 million ounces .
But precious metals prices began to plummet .
In three months , silver fell from $ 50 to $ 10 .
The Hunts held on and bought more .
According to news reports they borrowed $ 1.7 billion to maintain their futures position that was losing money .
In addition to cash collateral , they also pledged the silver they owned .
When silver fell more in price , their silver collateral declined along with the value of their futures contracts .
On March 26 , 1980 , they could not meet a margin call of $ 100 million and they did not have time to sell other assets they owned .
They were forced to liquidate .
Their fortune had disappeared .
Eventually , under the weight of lawsuits , they declared bankruptcy .
The Hunts , despite their huge wealth and silver positions , could not stop the market price of silver from declining .
It was part of a more general decline since gold also had soared and then collapsed .
The U.S. economy was entering a recessionary period , and it was not long before the world price of oil also collapsed .
These markets have very high ( negative ) price elasticity of demand .
This means that if the price is $ 10 and you will pay $ 11 , you will be inundated with an enormous supply .
The price is also elastic at $ 10 .
Traders will buy enormous amounts at $ 10 and resell them to you at $ 11 until you are bankrupt .
The government may be large .
It may be powerful .
But the markets for assets ( stocks , bonds , real estate , real assets , money market instruments , money ) are far , far larger than even the largest and most powerful government can control .
And they are certainly far larger than any typical government .
George Soros is famous for having bet against the British pound and won in 1992 .
His track record in speculation has been excellent .
When a government defends an overvalued currency by buying its own currency with other currencies it holds in reserve , it is trying to hold up the price .
Many governments are now doing this and getting the aid of the bright boys at the IMF who also like lost causes .
This is like the Hunts trying to hold up a high silver price when the market value is much less .
The government can buy and buy and buy , but it will lose if the currency is overvalued for fundamental reasons and the equilibrium price is lower .
Its buying only serves to provide a market for the traders who wish to sell out .
Soros revealed this in 1992 when he said : “ Our total position by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $ 10 billion .
We planned to sell more than that .
In fact , when Norman Lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $ 15 billion to defend sterling , we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell . ”
In the same way , the U.S. government cannot succeed in holding up real estate prices that have fallen .
If it borrows $ 700 billion and buys bank loans or invests in banks who then hold these loans , it will lose money as surely as the Hunts lost their fortune and as surely as the British government lost to Soros in trying to defend the pound at an unrealistically high value .
Buying overvalued assets is a sure way to lose money , for you , for me , and for a government !
A government has no special power to hold up the prices ( in real terms ) and prevent them from falling and no special power to cause low prices to rise to a higher level ( in real terms . )
Oh , I suppose it has the power to print money and drive its currency value down to zero ( and other prices up ) , but in the process it will destroy the government and burn up a lot of its citizens ’ wealth .
The Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury , with the aid and comfort of the Congress , are all embarked on a massive exercise in futility that is only weakening them and us .
If they push their policies of supporting the asset prices of failed assets and assets with deflated prices far enough , they will bankrupt themselves and destroy huge amounts of American wealth in the process .
Running down assets
The third link in the bankruptcy chain is to waste the money being spent and / or run down the assets .
If the government had spent the money on things of value , we ’d be able to point to them , things like roads , bridges , harbors , healthier human beings , and marble buildings .
We would not be looking at crumbling highways and bridges .
But the lion ’s share of the spending has disappeared .
It has gone to bombs , rockets , submarines , fighters , bombers , body armor , and battleships .
Great sums have gone to various groups who have spent them on their own consumption .
If current and future spending would raise the income - producing potential of Americans by more than what it costs , that would postpone bankruptcy .
It would increase the value of assets , not run them down .
There is no sign that this has happened in the past or will happen in the future .
Where the U.S. government stands
Governments go bankrupt too .
Your personal finances may be in good shape , but behind your back the government is borrowing .
Household credit in America is $ 14 trillion , but the government has borrowed $ 10 trillion more and has made promises to pay out vastly greater sums than that .
Governments have the capacity to take their citizens down with them because of their ability to ruin the currency .
The U.S. government is not near bankruptcy .
However , in all three departments , spending , borrowing , and running down its assets , it is doing an excellent job of heading for that target .
Take spending .
The annual growth rate of government spending has exceeded the growth rate of production by one - third over the last 100 years or so .
This high growth rate of federal government spending has driven spending as a percentage of total U.S. production from 2 percent to 21 percent .
There is no sign of any slowing in the government ’s rate of spending .
As Social Security and Medicare arrive for the baby boom generation , government spending will accelerate .
This spending has not been on a pay - as - you - go basis .
Instead , the government has borrowed heavily to pay for the spending spree .
This means that debt has grown even faster than government spending which in turn has grown even faster than national product .
Someone must have a copy of the bankruptcy recipe and be sending it to each new Congressman .
They are getting the message .
The federal government has an official debt of around 10,000 billion dollars .
The liabilities of programs such as Social Security and Medicare add another 60,000 billion dollars .
They will add to the debt in years to come .
This debt will never be repaid .
Think of it as a perpetual mortgage on which you and all your heirs must always pay interest forever .
Medicare spending is about $ 15,000 per person per year .
When 30,000,000 more persons are on Medicare ( the baby - boomers ) , the added spending will be 450 billions a year .
That excludes inflation .
It ’s an under -estimate .
That increase will fall on 30 million fewer people who work and pay taxes .
Some combination of higher taxes and borrowing can finance the spending , but they will depress economic growth and make the financing that much more difficult .
Benefits will probably also be cut and / or the quality of health care will decline .
There has been a slow - motion slide toward bankruptcy as the cash flows coming in fail to match the cash flows going out .
Spending keeps exceeding the income , which is not rising fast enough to prevent more and more borrowing in order to stay afloat .
At present , Uncle Sam is taking in 2,700 billions and spending 3,100 billions .
The difference is borrowed , which makes for another 400 billions of debt .
Higher debt and higher interest rates
The slide is accelerating with the financial crisis .
Income growth is slowing and government spending and debt are soaring as it plows money into bad loans and banks .
The federal debt will soon rise by 1,000 billions in one year alone .
Younger people are going to face higher taxes to pay both for social programs and the added interest on funded debt that will be issued to pay for the social programs .
It will be in their interest to fund the debt rather than pay higher taxes .
They will want to shift the burden to future Americans .
The lobby for more debt is unstoppable .
Not too far down the road , the result is going to be higher interest rates ( lower bond prices ) .
It will be the only way to induce savers to supply the additional funds that will be needed to pay for the consumption inherent in the social programs like Medicare .
The real rate of interest will rise .
The risk premium on government debt will rise because the debt is growing relative to national income .
The inflation premium will rise because there is more of a threat of inflation when there is more debt .
Productive investments will face higher costs of capital , and this will crimp the stock market and economic growth .
It ’s not a pretty picture .

British National party vows to take legal action after breach of court injunction
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
The British National party tonight vowed to take legal action after its entire membership list was published online in breach of a court injunction .
The party blamed disgruntled former employees for posting details of the names , postal and email addresses and ages of more than 10,000 supporters .
Details of the hobbies , professions and other areas of expertise of many members are thought to be included .
The membership list dates from late last year , the BNP said , and its publication had been prevented under a high court injunction obtained in April .
Embarrassed party bosses have complained to the police and are seeking legal advice to prevent the further spread of the data .
Simon Darby , the BNP 's spokesman , said he found out this morning that the injunction had been broken , describing the posting as " malevolent and spiteful " .
" This is being done to destabilise the party after a successful conference in Blackpool and before the elections for the European parliament in June next year . "
He said the membership list , which was password protected and encrypted , had been stolen from the party .
" This is n't a question of us mislaying the information , this is theft , " he said .
Darby claimed the list contained the names of people who had never been members of the party as well as the names of current and former members .
Although the party is taking action to take down the list , Darby conceded : " Once it 's out , it 's out . "
" We are worried because kids ' names are on the list .
It is not information that should be in the public domain , " he added .
" We are always receiving death threats . "
He said the party discovered the information had been leaked when its members started receiving unsolicited mail .
" We found that members were being sent propaganda .
We went to the Manchester high court and obtained an injunction .
It cost tens of thousands of pounds , " he said .
Darby said the party had complained to Dyfed Powys police – the BNP carries out much of its administration in Welshpool – but the force was unable to confirm that a complaint had been made .
The publication sparked alarm among the BNP 's membership .
" I'm also on the list , what the fuck is going on ?
I could lose my job , " posted one member on a north - west England BNP forum .
Another wrote : " God help anyone who is in the army , the prison service , health care , police officer or a teacher . "
Since 2004 , police officers have faced dismissal if found to be members of the BNP .
The Pope has criticised US bishops for their handling of sex abuse scandals
A US federal appeals court has ruled that a lawsuit against the Vatican over claims it covered up decades of child sex abuse by priests can go ahead .
The case was filed by three men from Kentucky who say they were abused by clergy in their childhood .
It centres on a 1962 directive from the Vatican - made public in 2003 - which told church officials not to disclose sex abuse complaints against priests .
The US Roman Catholic Church has been plagued by a string of abuse scandals .
On a visit to the US earlier this year , Pope Benedict XVI criticised US bishops for their handling of the child sex abuse crisis , saying their response had sometimes been very poor .
In ruling the Kentucky lawsuit could go ahead , the Sixth US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an earlier decision by a district judge .
Although the Vatican is largely protected from lawsuits , the court ruled that clergymen could be taken to court as part of their role as Roman Catholic Church employees .
The anti-piracy lobby has been putting pressure on ISPs to act against customers who download copyright infringing content .
Thus far , most ISPs have simply forwarded the takedown requests they receive , but Cox Communications is taking it one step further , by disconnecting alleged copyright infringers .
With 3.5 million Internet subscribers , Cox Communications is one of the larger ISPs in the US .
Like all the other Internet providers , Cox receives numerous copyright related takedown requests from anti-piracy organizations .
However , it ’s how they handle these requests that ’s quite unique , and disturbing to say the least .
Instead of sending their customer an email , notifying that they have received a DMCA takedown request on their behalf , Cox disables their Internet connection .
Here is a quote from the warning page customers get to see when their Internet connection is cut off ( screenshot below the article ) .
Under the DMCA , we have the responsibility to temporarily disable your Internet access , until such time as you take the necessary steps to remove the infringing files and to prevent further distribution of copyrighted material .
There are a couple of things wrong with this notification .
First of all , and most importantly , the DMCA does n’t oblige Cox to disable a customer ’s Internet access at all .
They have to notify their customer of the alleged infringement , but the measures they actually take are clearly out of proportion , and definitely not in the best interest of their customers .
Indeed , it has already led to a lot of frustration with Cox customers .
One of them told TorrentFreak that he has been struggling for two days to regain his Internet access .
The customer in question was instructed to call a phone number in order to resolve the issue , but it was impossible to get though for most of the day .
When he finally got hold of someone via the regular customer service , he was simply told that he should call the same number he was given before .
After being on hold for more than an hour he eventually got through .
The Cox customer told us what happened next : “ He [ Cox employee ] said that he is going to allow me to have the Internet enabled for 1 hour while I ‘ call my router company so they can walk me through securing my wireless network . ’
If I do n’t call back in the next hour , he will turn the Internet off again . ”
First - time offenders will eventually get their Internet access reinstated , but not without being warned that they might lose it permanently if they receive two more takedown requests .
“ If it happens three times , I will be referred to their headquarters in Atlanta , ” the Cox customer told us .
We contacted Cox ’s customer support to verify this , and we were told that there is indeed a three strikes policy in place .
When a Cox subscriber receives three takedown requests , their Internet access will be cut off entirely .
Interestingly , this is the same policy that the European Parliament voted against last week , because it “ restricts the rights and freedoms of Internet users . ”
It turns out that Cox does n’t need legislation to implement a three - strikes policy though .
“ Cox does in fact have a 3 strikes policy with regards to violations of our acceptable use policy for Internet service .
If a customer ’s service gets suspended 3 times for the same type of violation the customer risks having their Internet service terminated , ” Cox ’s customer support told TorrentFreak .
It is of course up to Cox how they handle alleged violations of their acceptable use policy .
However , the problem lies in the fact that they act upon accusations made by the MPAA , RIAA and other anti-piracy organizations who employ evidence gathering methods that are shoddy , to say the least .
In addition , there is still no law that requires a person to secure their wireless network and there are even routers that enable people to share their connection with outsiders .
We think that Cox clearly overstepped the mark here .
Customers might not make as much noise as the lawyers of the entertainment industry , but eventually , they are the ones who bring in the money .
Cox Communication currently uses the slogan “ Your friend in the digital age . ”
Some friend …
[ digg - reddit - me ] ” I just do n’t know him , ” people say .
It has become a constant refrain , by now even a cliche – as political pundits declare that Obama has not “ closed the deal . ”
At first , it was decided this was the flip side to Obama ’s new - ness .
But , after nearly two years on the national radar , countless debates , and a constant media presence , this reason seems less convincing .
And contrast this uncertainty about Obama with the certainty about Sarah Palin – who has been a national presence for just two months .
Yet many of the same people who still do n’t “ know ” Obama claim to “ know ” Sarah Palin very well .
Many commentators attribute this to racism – and I ’m sure that plays a part for some .
But I think the essential uncertainty about Obama has its root in something else – the perceived difference between the promise of Obama and his prosaic proposals .
Few would dispute that Obama ’s campaign has been imbued from the start with a sense of promise , a sense of restoration , a sense of hope , of change ( you can believe in ) , of possibility .
He invokes with prophetic resonance the essence of the American dream – “ not what is seen , but is unseen , that better place around the bend . ”
In the midst of the financial crisis , he gives a speech in the midst of a powerful storm and calls on us to stop despairing that “ the rains will never pass ” but to remember that “ these too shall pass , and a brighter day will come . ”
There is a sense that this moment is a turning point in American history , if we will seize it .
And there is a hunger for change that is palpable in America .
And yet Obama ’s policies seem small , undramatic , safe .
They certainly are change – but not enough change to reverse the tides of history .
Obama ’s policies would not re-order our society ; they would not transform America – either our foreign policy or domestic policy .
Obama is not some libertarian or liberal or progressive or socialist or neoconservative or fascist or communist ideologue .
Rather , he proposes moderate and pragmatic steps to address long - simmering issues – the squeezing of the middle class , climate change , terrorism , a broken politics , an expansive executive branch , our dependence on oil , and now , the financial crisis .
He does not propose a new ideology that will offer us all the answers .
He proposes instead to tinker – to preserve the system as it is – while tinkering with the processes where we can ; to create positive incentives for behavior we need ; to stop policies that exacerbate the problems ; to try different things , regardless of what ideology promotes them , and stick with what works .
There is great promise in this approach .
Tinkering is – as the prophet of this financial crisis , Nicholas Nassim Taleb , has said – the best we can do in a world we only imperfectly understand .
But it seems less dramatic than the promise of Obama that we sense .
It is on this perception that John McCain ’s entire campaign is based – as they describe Obama as someone with something to hide , as inauthentic and dishonest ; as they claim he is a socialist , a Marxist , a radical .
Those who do n’t “ know ” Obama fear him because they sense this contrast between promise and policy .
Some fill in this gap with stories of a “ secret Muslim ” sleeper agent or “ terrorist bloodlines ” .
Others claim he is a secret radical – a Communist or Socialist – who hates America and secretly will raise taxes on everyone once he gets into the White House .
Yet others just remain uncertain .
Many commentators warn that Obama supporters will inevitably be disappointed in him once they realize he will not re-make the world .
Yet – this precisely is the promise of Obama .
He is not a revolutionary .
He is a pragmatist , offering to put the culture war of the past decades on hold in order to focus on those serious issues that we have been hearing about for just as long , yet doing nothing about .
They are n’t fixable overnight – we know that .
But the promise of Obama is that he will begin to address them – and that we can start making progress .
The promise of Obama is not that we will create some utopia – but that we will set our country on the right path again .
The middle class will not be stabilized by Obama ’s economic policies by the end of the first term ; terrorism will still be a festering issue ; we will still be contributing to global warming – but the hope is , the promise is , we will have started going in the right direction .
For the moment , that ’s enough .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Shares of Crocs Inc CROX.
O plummeted more than 58 percent on Thursday , a day after the maker of colorful clogs posted a deep quarterly loss due to high restructuring costs .
Crocs , whose quirky shoes were once a cult hit , reported a third - quarter net loss on Wednesday of $ 1.79 per share , compared with a net profit of 66 cents per share a year earlier .
Excluding restructuring , impairment and inventory - related charges , Crocs posted a loss of 53 cents per share .
On that basis analysts had expected a profit of 2 cents per share , according to Reuters Estimates .
Sales fell 32 percent in the quarter to $ 174.2 million , below both Wall Street estimates and Croc ’s previous forecast .
One bright spot was Asian sales , which were up 14 percent , but analysts said that was not enough to convince the market that Crocs can weather the tough economic climate .
“ We see no reason to believe that Asian revenues will not follow U.S. and European revenues , lemming - like , off a cliff , ” wrote Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Jeff Mintz in a note .
Crocs ’ quirky bright and comfortable resin clogs quickly attracted a dedicated following after debuting in 2002 and the company soon became a Wall Street favorite .
But the novelty of the clogs waned , and the weak U.S. economy further crimped business and hampered investor interest in the stock .
Crocs have also been hurt by news its shoes can become caught in escalators an cause injuries , by cheaper knock - offs , and by a recent European Union ruling that a Crocs patent is invalid .
Crocs stock hit a lifetime high of $ 75.21 in October of last year .
The stock has since shed nearly 99 percent of its value .
Shares of Crocs were down 51 percent at 92 cents on Thursday morning on the Nasdaq .

Today I ’m going to be releasing a new project , called django - test - utils .
It ’s rather empty at the moment , but it does have one cool feature .
That is my Django Crawler .
I have some big plans for this little guy , but for the moment it has enough functionality to make it pretty useful .
The crawler at the moment has 4 options implemented on it .
I will outline them below and show example of the output .
It is implemented as a management command , named crawlurls .
You simply add test_utils to your INSTALLED_APPS and you are good to go .
So to run it you simply do ./manage .py crawlurls .
It crawls your site using the Django Test Client ( so no network traffic is required ! )
This allows the crawler to have intimate knowledge of your Django Code .
This allows it to have features that other crawlers can’t have .
This tells the crawler to store the response object for each site .
This used to be the default behavior , but doing this bloats up memory .
There is n’t anything useful implemented on top of this feature , but with this feature you get a dictionary of request URLs with responses as their values .
You can then go through and do whatever you want ( including examine the Templates rendered and Contexts .
This option alerts you when you have escaped HTML fragments in your templates .
This is useful for tracking down places where you are n’t applying safe correctly , and other HTML related failures .
This is n’t implemented well , and might be buggy because I did n’t have any broken pages on my site to test on :)
This option allows you to drop into pdb on an error in your site .
This lets you look around the response , context , and other things to see what happened to cause the error .
I do n’t know how useful this will be , but it seems like a neat feature to be able to have .
I stole this idea from nose tests .
The -t option , as the help says : Pass -t to time your requests .
This outputs the time it takes to run each request on your site .
This option also tells the crawler to output the top 10 URLs that took the most time at the end of it ’s run .
Here is an example output from running it on my site with -t -v 2 :
Same as most django apps .
Set it to 2 to get a lot of output .
1 is the default , which will only output errors .
The Crawler at the beginning loops through all of your URLConfs .
It then loads up all of the regular expressions from these URLConfs to examine later .
Once the crawler is done crawling your site , it will tell you what URLConf entries are not being hit .
At the moment , this crawler does n’t have a lot of end - user functionality .
However , you can go in and edit the script at the end of the crawl to do almost anything .
You are left with a dictionary of URLs crawled , and the time it took , and response ( if you use the -r option ) .
Future improvements ¶
There are a lot of future improvements that I have planned .
I want to enable the test client to login as a user , passed in from the command line .
This should be pretty simple , I just have n’t implemented it yet .
Another thing that I want to do but is n’t implemented is fixtures .
I want to be able to output a copy of the data returned from the crawler run .
This will allow for future runs of the crawler to diff against previous runs , creating a kind of regression test .
A third thing I want to implement is an option to only evaluate each URLConf entry X times .
Where you could say “ only hit / blog / [ year ] / [ month ] / 10 times ” .
This goes on the assumption that you are looking for errors in your views or templates , and you only need to hit each URL a couple of times .
This also should n’t be hard , but is n’t implemented yet .
The big pony that I want to make is to use multiprocessing on the crawler .
The crawler does n’t hit a network , so it is CPU - bound .
However , running with CPUs with multiple cores , multiprocessing will speed this up .
A problem with it is that some of the timing stuff and pdb things wo n’t be as useful .
I would love to hear some people ’s feedback and thoughts on this .
I think that this could be made into a really awesome tool .
At the moment it works well for smaller sites , but it would be nice to be able to test only certain URLs in an app .
There are lots of neat things I have planned , but I like following the release early , release often mantra .
Plan for mandatory state managed health system may be initiated
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Wednesday , Nov 19 , 2008
As if Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State was n’t an unpopular enough appointment , consider that her likely alternative is to accept a role as a senior member of the Senate team aiming to overhaul the nation ’s healthcare system , a fact that should set alarm bells ringing given her track record in this area .
Clinton was offered the role by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass. ) , who has announced plans to craft sweeping healthcare legislation next year .
Clinton has long pushed to expand the Federal government ’s role in healthcare , indeed she made the issue a centerpiece of her presidential campaign .
A little over a year ago Hillary unveiled a $ 110 billion health care reform plan that would have required that all Americans have health insurance by law .
Clinton announced that under her presidency every citizen in the U.S. would have to enroll in a state - managed socialized health care system where regular check ups , including mental screenings , would be mandatory .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Hillary later remarked that anyone wishing to opt out of such a system would have their wages “ garnished ” .
When pressed on ABC’s This Week , earlier in the year , Hillary said : “ I think there are a number of mechanisms ” that are possible , including “ going after people ’s wages , automatic enrollment . ”
Now she may have the opportunity to push the very same policy into practice .
The vision of an America where every citizen is forced by law to participate in health screenings overseen by the government should set off stark warning bells .
The level of micromanagement and the expansion of government into everyday life that this would entail represents the antithesis of the founding principles of a constitutional Republic and a free market .
It would create a government enforced legal requirement that everyone in America buy a product from a private insurance company .
There is also concern that such a mandate would be too financially burdensome for lower - income individuals and families .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
If Hillary were to pursue such a plan it would offer expanded versions of two existing government programs : Medicare , and the health insurance plan currently offered to federal employees .
Consumers have a choice between either government - run program .
Clinton previously proposed covering the cost of such a plan by ending tax cuts to people who make more than $ 200,000 per year .
Clinton has said that such a reform in the healthcare system would ensure lower premiums and higher quality , and lessen the power of drug and insurance companies over healthcare choices .
This is difficult to believe however given that Hillary has recently enjoyed a fruitful relationship with powerful health care groups , drug companies , insurance companies and their lobbyists .
Furthermore , what incentive will there be for big pharma to control prices of legally required consumer purchases ?
During her tenure as First Lady , Clinton was also at the forefront of a similar and extremely unpopular socialized medicine plan that became known by critics as “ Hillarycare “ .
One editorial in the Washington Post by University of Virginia Professor Martha Derthick stated :
“ In many years of studying American social policy , I have never read an official document that seemed so suffused with coercion and political naivete … with its drastic prescriptions for controlling the conduct of state governments , employers , drug manufacturers , doctors , hospitals and you and me . ”
U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan added “ anyone who thinks [ the Clinton health care plan ] can work in the real world as presently written is n’t living in it . ”
The plan ultimately collapsed under the weight of opposition and the fact that the Republicans won the 1994 mid terms .

Before [ Obama ] went off [ to Harvard ] , he said to some of his community - organizing buddies he needed that credential , that Harvard Law degree , to access the corridors of power and to have that credential because he was n't going to get that as a community organizer in Chicago .
It 's all about power .
It 's all about power .
When you say that , it can have a very negative connotation .
And this is one of the great questions about Obama .
When people start community organizing , and they learn that the whole ethos of the community organizer is to understand power , this can sound sort of negative .
In fact , [ in ] the seminars that Obama went through , this was drilled into his head :
Do n't think of power as a negative thing .
Power is the only thing that changes anything .
David Mendell Author , Obama : From Promise to Power
Harvard Law , I think in his own mind , really helped him establish himself as an elite person in our society .
It taught him that he could manage various worlds .
Here he was in this very rarified environment , and people took to him there .
And he was also in the projects of Chicago , and people there seemed to take to him as well -- take to his personality and what he was trying to do and his , I think , genuine sense of mission .
...
Cassandra Butts Harvard Law , class of ' 91 ; Obama adviser
When he takes over at the Law Review , how important is that ?
It was pretty significant .
He was the first African American president of the Law Review ... ascending to what was the highest , most coveted position for a student at the law school .
...
I was as close to Barack as anyone in law school .
He 'd never expressed an interest in being president of the Law Review .
It was n't something that he talked about .
Frankly , he was drafted by his colleagues on the Law Review to run .
They made the case why he should run and why they thought that he could lead the Law Review .
And they thought that he would be able to bring together the factions that had developed as a result of the ideological divisions on the Law Review , on the left and the right . …
Why ?
What was it about him ?
Barack , from the start , had a leadership style that was very embracing .
He was clearly seen as a leader , but at the same time , he did n't put himself out as a leader .
We had a lot of people who were pretty ambitious at the law school , people who had political ambition .
They were not quiet in their political ambition and putting themselves out as leaders .
That was n't Barack .
He had a very quiet , yet very calm presence .
And his leadership style was such that people were drawn to him and they embraced him as a leader , and they put him forward as a leader .
...
It 's personality , but it's also a function of his experience as a community organizer .
As a community organizer , you are not the person who 's out in front .
You want the community to be out in front .
You want the community to be the ones who are voicing the concerns and who are the leaders . …
When he 's sitting at a sort of supercharged , maybe dichotomous Harvard Law School ... yes , he 's African American ... but he can talk and be attractive to Brad Berenson [ associate White House counsel , 2001 - 2003 , ] and the Federalist Society .
Absolutely .
He essentially spent his life trying to synthesize the duality of being one person in one place and being another person in another place .
What I like to say to people is that Barack never meets a stranger , and that 's one of the things that makes him so effective as a politician .
When he meets people , when he sees people , when he 's interacting with people , he is n't inclined to stereotype people .
He ultimately has met you before in some other experience , or someone just like you . …
Barack was not and is not predictable .
He 's thoughtful .
He 'll tell you what he believes .
But it is n't always what you expect . …
His ideological approach is to the left and there was an expectation that as the president of the Law Review that he would side on the part of his more progressive colleagues .
But he recognized that his role was such that he had to bring both sides together .
And in order to publish the Law Review and to be productive in his term as president , he had to figure out how to make it work and how to make both sides work together , which meant that he was n't always going to side with his progressive colleagues , that he had to take the interests and the ideas of the people on the right into account .
It 's not to suggest that where he was on the issue was being reflected in the decision that he made .
But it did reflect what he needed to do as a leader in order to produce the Law Review . …
It is Barack 's natural inclination to reach across the aisle .
It 's personality .
And it 's also just his intellect . …
He 's not interested necessarily in dominating the conversation .
He wants to bring people into the conversation .
He wants to understand different points of view .
And understanding those different points of view informs the way he thinks about issues . …

The law school generally at that time was riven ideologically , and not just in terms of Republican / Democrat partisan politics , but there were contending schools of legal thought at the time , represented on the faculty , that really polarized both the faculty and the student body .
There was a far - left group of professors who adhered to what was known as critical legal studies , and then there were a handful of conservative professors , like Charles Fried , who had served in the Reagan administration .
There were intense debates over affirmative action and race issues .
This is , after all , just a few years after the end of the Reagan presidency .
...
That does n't mean that , day to day , people were n't friendly to one another , but the classroom was very politicized .
The debates and discussions of the law and of cases frequently pit conservatives in our class against liberals in our class , and the discussions often got quite heated .
I would say the environment at Harvard Law School back then was political in a borderline unhealthy way .
It was quite intense .
...
Interestingly , race was at the forefront of the agenda .
There were intense debates over affirmative action that sometimes got expressed through fights over tenure decisions relating to junior faculty at the law school .
There were women professors and minority professors who either had come up for tenure or were coming up for tenure , and there were big fights , on the faculty and in the law school at large , over whether they should receive tenure , whether the quality of their scholarship merited that .
...
[ A] fter [ Obama ] became president of the Review , he was under a lot of pressure to participate and lend his voice to those debates .
And he did , I think , to some degree .
But I would not have described him as a campus radical or a campus political leader .
He was the president of the Harvard Law Review , the leader of that organization .
But , in that role , his job was to manage , in essence , a publication , and the editors who brought it forth and to do a lot of close editing of academic legal articles . …
You do n't become president of the Harvard Law Review , no matter how political , or how liberal the place is , by virtue of affirmative action , or by virtue of not being at the very top of your class in terms of legal ability .
Barack was at the very top of his class in terms of legal ability .
He had a first - class legal mind and , in my view , was selected to be president of the Review entirely on his merits .
... I never regarded him as kind of a racial special pleader , or a person looking for race - based benefits , either for himself or others .
I think as a policy matter , he supported affirmative action and believed in the arguments for it .
But unlike many people on the left , he was also willing to acknowledge that it had costs , and he could at least appreciate the arguments on the other side .
...
Just in a political sense , what kind of a person were you looking for [ to serve as president ] ? ...
The block of conservatives on the Law Review my year I think was eager to avoid having any of the most political people on the left govern the Review .
I mean , the first bedrock criterion , I think for almost all of the editors , was to have somebody with an absolutely first - rate legal mind who would be able to engage competently with the nation 's top legal scholars on their scholarship and on these articles , and who would provide the intellectual leadership for the Review that it always needed .
That was non-negotiable for almost everybody right or left .
But there were a number of people that would have met that criterion .
There were at least a large handful who probably had the intellectual and personal characteristics to be good leaders of the Review .
From among those , the conservatives were eager to have somebody who would treat them fairly , who would listen to what they had to say , who would not abuse the powers of the office to favor his ideological soul mates and punish those who had different views .
Somebody who would basically play it straight , I think was really what we were looking for .
Was that hard to find ?
It was very hard to find .
And ultimately , the conservatives on the Review supported Barack as president in the final rounds of balloting because he fit that bill far better than the other people who were running .
...
We had all worked with him over the course of a year .
And we had all spent countless hours in the presence of Barack , as well as others of our colleagues who were running , in Gannett House [ the Law Review offices ] , and so you get a pretty good sense of people over the course of a year of late nights working on the Review .
You know who the rabble - rousers are .
You know who the people are who are blinded by their politics .
And you know who the people are who , despite their politics , can reach across and be friendly to and make friends with folks who have different views .
And Barack very much fell into the latter category .
...
[ After Obama is selected , ] he does a very able job as president .
Puts out what I think was a very good volume of the Review .
Does a great job managing the difficult and complicated interpersonal dynamics on the Review .
And manages somehow , in an extremely fractious group , to keep everybody almost happy .
Some of the people who are not as happy as others , I think much to their surprise , are some of the African American people who believe that now it 's their turn .
Absolutely right , absolutely right .
I think Barack took 10 times as much grief from those on the left on the Review as from those of us on the right .
And the reason was , I think there was an expectation among those editors on the left that he would affirmatively use the modest powers of his position to advance the cause , whatever that was .
They thought , you know , finally there 's an African American president of the Harvard Law Review ; it 's our turn , and he should aggressively use this position , and his authority and his bully pulpit to advance the political or philosophical causes that we all believe in .
And Barack was reluctant to do that .
It 's not that he was out of sympathy with their views , but his first and foremost goal , it always seemed to me , was to put out a first - rate publication .
And he was not going to let politics or ideology get in the way of doing that .
...
He had some discretion as president to exercise an element of choice for certain of the positions on the masthead ; it was n't wide discretion , but he had some .
And I think a lot of the minority editors on the Review expected him to use that discretion to the maximum extent possible to empower them .
To put them in leadership positions , to burnish their resumes , and to give them a chance to help him and help guide the Review .
He did n't do that .
He declined to exercise that discretion to disrupt the results of votes or of tests that were taken by various people to assess their fitness for leadership positions .
He was unwilling to undermine , based on the way I viewed it , meritocratic outcomes or democratic outcomes in order to advance a racial agenda .
That earned him a lot of recrimination and criticism from some on the left , particularly some of the minority editors of the Review .
...
It confirmed the hope that I and others had had at the time of the election that he would basically be an honest broker , that he would not let ideology or politics blind him to the enduring institutional interests of the Review .
It told me that he valued the success of his own presidency of the Review above scoring political points of currying favor with his political supporters .
Christine Spurell Harvard Law , class of ' 91
Honestly , we were just very polarized on the Law Review , we really were .
It 's like you go to a college campus , and the black students were all sitting together .
It was the same thing with the Law Review ; the black students were all sitting together .
Barack was the one who was truly able to move between the different groups and have credibility with all of them .
Why ?
I really do n't know .
He grew up in a multiracial environment .
I do n't know what he 's like now with conservatives , but I do n't know why at the time he was able to communicate so well with them , even spend social time with them , which was not something I would ever have done . …
I do n't think he was agenda - driven .
I think he genuinely thought , some of these guys are nice , all of them are smart , some of them are funny , all of them have something to say . …
Now , as you may know , I had personal hopes for my own future on the Law Review .
I was kind of hoping to get a masthead position , and I did not get a masthead position .
So we went from the high of having Barack elected -- now , this is just me speaking , as at the time I was a very narrow - minded , almost radical student .
I was 22 years old at this point , so I kind of saw everything in terms of race .
I try not to do that anymore .
So I did assume I would get the position that I thought I had coming .
I [ did ] think I had earned it as far as the quality of my work .
But I 'll tell you now , I had not earned it as far as the quality of my diplomacy with the other students .
...
He did know I was a hard worker , that he did know .
That 's why I felt betrayed , because I worked so hard .
I pulled so many all - nighters , I thought I should be rewarded .
But he put the good of the Law Review ahead of my agenda .
That 's what makes him such a great leader .
...
It 's been written that you guys were very friendly , but you 'd go at each other .
...
[ T ] hat was the period right after he appointed the masthead .
It coincided with some movement , I 'm not even sure who started it , to fix certain things about the Law Review .
...
Getting certain African American editors onto the Law Review they thought should n't be there was probably one of the issues .
Now , if I had been president and someone was wanting to change that , I would have shut them down .
But Barack , being a much better leader than me , allowed for open and robust discussion .
He actually believed and showed that he believed that when you debate things openly and intelligently , the best ideas will win .
So there were protracted debates , and he permitted them .
And he permitted things to go to votes .
Janny Scott The New York Times
Apparently , while he was an editor of the Law Review , he was involved in the editing of a piece by Michael McConnell , who was a conservative constitutional law scholar who later was appointed by President George W. Bush to the Federal Court and was considered as a Supreme Court nominee , or was one of the people listed around the time of [ Justice Samuel ] Alito and [ Chief Justice John ] Roberts ' appointments .
According to a professor at the University of Chicago , Douglas Baird , he got a call , or got a note , from Michael McConnell , who ... was definitely an alumnus of the University of Chicago Law School , saying , " I encountered this really remarkable , brilliant guy at Harvard Law Review when they were working on my piece , and you should have this guy on your radar . "
And so it was this very conservative legal scholar who brought Obama to the attention of the University of Chicago .
So Douglas Baird called Obama up at Harvard Law School -- I guess it must have been in his last year -- and said , " Do you have any interest in teaching ? "
Because , Baird said to me , " We rarely get that kind of unqualified endorsement , particularly from someone as well - known and respected as McConnell . " ...
And Obama said , " Well , no , actually .
What I want to do is write this book . "
This was at the moment where the newspaper articles and everything about his election had attracted the interest of publishers , and he'd gotten a book contract .
So his first contact at the University of Chicago , which was where he later ended up teaching , was an attempt to just bring that guy there , since he was thought to be so sharp and worth following .
The latest types of malware are so potent that organisations should forget about trying to cleanse infected systems , a top Microsoft security officer has advised .
Mike Danseglio , a program manager in Microsoft 's security group , said firms should think about establishing a process for backup and recovering rather than relying on anti-virus tools as a way of recovering from malware infection .
" When you are dealing with rootkits and some advanced spyware programs , the only solution is to rebuild from scratch .
In some cases , there really is no way to recover without nuking the systems from orbit , " Mike Danseglio , a program manager in Microsoft 's security group , told a security conference in Florida .
Rootkits - forms of malware that attempt to hide their presence on infected systems - are becoming more commonplace .
Danseglio argued that such tactics made it too difficult to ensure that infected systems were fully repaired .
He cited the example of an unnamed US government agency that found itself trying to fix 2,000 infected machines .
" In that case , it was so severe that trying to recover was meaningless .
They did not have an automated process to wipe and rebuild the systems , so it became a burden .
They had to design a process real fast , " Danseglio said , eWeek reports .
Even though anti-virus technology is improving , Danseglio conceded that traditional approaches are failing in the face of more sophisticated malware and highly - motivated profit - driven virus writers .
The threat has moved on from network worms towards Trojans and other forms of more difficult to detect malware .
" Detection is difficult , and remediation is often impossible , " he said .
Danseglio's candid admission on the inadequacies of anti-virus technologies in cleansing infected systems is surprising give Microsoft 's recent entry into the anti-virus market to say nothing of the fact that Windows PCs remain the principle malware battle ground .
However Danseglio laid the blame for the majority of malware infections on human stupidity in the face of social engineering attacks rather than the security shortcomings of Windows , as highlighted by an unpatched Internet Explorer flaw that 's become the focus of exploitation by hackers over recent days . ®
