An outstanding discussion , primer and visual lesson on toxic assets , failed banks , the Federal Reserve , HR 1207 , auditing the Fed , and the cost to taxpayers .
Dylan puts on his Banker hat and swaps a ( literal ) bag of trash , on - air , for $ 13.9 Trillion worth of Monopoly money from a guy wearing a " Fed " hat .
" The Federal Reserve just extended $ 14 Trillion of our money , our children 's money , America 's future ... and now they do n't want to talk about what 's in the bag .
And they did it because the banks created a garbage bag full of bad debts . " ( 4:45 )
" I feel as if America has suffered the greatest theft and cover - up -- ever , ... where banks created a pile of garbage , that they paid themselves billions of dollars in personal compensation , and then stuck the trillions of dollars worth of garbage with the American taxpayer .
That , to me , is stealing . " ( 7:05 )

The Federal Reserve — the quasi-autonomous body that controls the US ’s money supply — is a “ Ponzi scheme ” that created “ bubble after bubble ” in the US economy and needs to be held accountable for its actions , says Eliot Spitzer , the former governor and attorney - general of New York .
In a wide - ranging discussion of the bank bailouts on MSNBC ’s Morning Meeting , host Dylan Ratigan described the process by which the Federal Reserve exchanged $ 13.9 trillion of bad bank debt for cash that it gave to the struggling banks .
Spitzer — who built a reputation as “ the Sheriff of Wall Street ” for his zealous prosecutions of corporate crime as New York ’s attorney - general and then resigned as the state ’s governor over revelations he had paid for prostitutes — seemed to agree with Ratigan that the bank bailout amounts to “ America ’s greatest theft and cover - up ever . ”
Advocating in favor of a House bill to audit the Federal Reserve , Spitzer said : “ The Federal Reserve has benefited for decades from the notion that it is quasi- autonomous , it ’s supposed to be independent .
Let me tell you a dirty secret :
The Fed has done an absolutely disastrous job since [ former Fed Chairman ] Paul Volcker left .
“ The reality is the Fed has blown it .
Time and time again , they blew it .
Bubble after bubble , they failed to understand what they were doing to the economy .
“ The most poignant example for me is the AIG bailout , where they gave tens of billions of dollars that went right through — conduit payments — to the investment banks that are now solvent .
We [ taxpayers ] did n’t get stock in those banks , they did n’t ask what was going on — this begs and cries out for hard , tough examination .
“ You look at the governing structure of the New York [ Federal Reserve ] , it was run by the very banks that got the money .
This is a Ponzi scheme , an inside job .
It is outrageous , it is time for Congress to say enough of this .
And to give them more power now is crazy .
“ The Fed needs to be examined carefully . ”
Spitzer resigned as governor of New York in March , 2008 , after news reports stated Spitzer had paid for a $ 1,000 - an - hour New York City call girl .
At the time , Spitzer had been raising the alarm about sub - prime mortgages .
In the wake of the economic meltdown triggered last fall by sub - prime loans , some observers have suggested that Spitzer may have been targeted by law enforcement because of his high - profile opposition to Wall Street financial policies .
Investigative reporter Greg Palast wrote that federal agents ’ revealing of Spitzer ’s identity as a call - girl customer was no coincidence .
Palast wrote that the principle of “ prosecutorial discretion ” is often used to keep the names of high - profile persons out of the media when they are tangentially linked to a criminal investigation .
In the case of Spitzer , the Justice Department chose not to invoke prosecutorial discretion .
Funny thing , this ‘ discretion . ’
For example , Senator David Vitter , Republican of Louisiana , paid Washington DC prostitutes to put him in diapers ( ewww ! ) , yet the Senator was not exposed by the US prosecutors busting the pimp-ring that pampered him .
Naming and shaming and ruining Spitzer – rarely done in these cases - was made at the ‘ discretion ’ of Bush ’s Justice Department .
Spitzer recently told Bloomberg News that President Obama ’s regulatory reforms of the financial sector are “ irrelevant ” because regulatory agencies have not been enforcing corporate laws to begin with .
“ Regulatory agencies already had the power to do everything they needed to do , ” he said .
“ They just affirmatively chose not to do it . ”

The heart of Nandom is a fork in the road .
It is here , in one of the northernmost towns in Ghana , that the buses come and go .
You would call it a station if it was anything more than a triangle of reddish dust , surrounded by fast - food stalls , general stores and the rural bank .
Once a week , a market sets up .
The rest of the time , it ’s the buses themselves , privately owned mini-vans known as “ tro - tros ” , daubed with prayers for the road – “ Lord Have Mercy ” , “ My Redeemer Liveth ” – that provide the action : the logic - defying piling on of people and goods , the waiting , in midday temperatures of 40° Celsius , for enough passengers to fill a van .
The buses are important to Nandom , the administrative centre for more than 50,000 people – chiefly farmers – in one of the poorest corners of Ghana , because the population is leaving .
Migration has long been part of life in the dry reaches of west Africa , but in recent years , with economic development taking place elsewhere and erratic rains making rural life increasingly difficult , more and more people are taking to the road .
The figures are inexact , but about 20 % of those born in northern Ghana are now thought to live in the richer , more urbanised south .
In Nandom , the numbers are much higher : half the population has gone .
People from the town offer varying reasons for the exodus – lack of jobs , enticing “ greener pastures ” , deteriorating climate – but they agree that it cannot go on indefinitely , this whittling , or Nandom will never prosper .
“ What is happening , ” a local priest told me , “ is that our society is to a certain extent being disintegrated . ”
I went to Nandom to try and understand a phenomenon known these days under names that combine words like environment , migrant , displaced person and refugee .
In short , the idea that climate change is going to displace ­millions of ­people .
Since 1990 , when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) predicted that “ the gravest effects of climate change may be those on human migration ” , the prospect of rising seas , spreading deserts and a concatenation of natural disasters has been accompanied by the image of people on the move .
The logic is powerful : 10 % of the world ’s population would be inundated by a one - metre rise in sea levels – possible by the end of this century – while another 30 % , more than two billion people , live in drylands , like Nandom , that are vulnerable to endemic drought .
All these people , the argument goes , will have to end up somewhere .
In February , the British ecologist James Lovelock suggested that they might come to Britain , and that the United Kingdom will become a “ lifeboat nation ” of migrants .
Estimates of the number of environmental refugees in 2050 , when the global population is expected to peak at nine billion and the planet is forecast to be in the throes of a 2° - or - more temperature rise , vary between 50 million and one billion people .
But the most commonly repeated number – included in Britain ’s 2006 Stern Review [ on the economics of climate change ] – is between 200 million and 250 million , or around 10 times the number of refugees and internally displaced persons in the world today .
The numbers are enormous , the scenarios abstract .
And until 2005 , for most of us , they remained on the screens of Hollywood disaster films such as The Day After Tomorrow , in which American climate refugees pile across the Rio Grande , seeking shelter in Mexico .
But then came Hurricane Katrina , and the displacing power of nature was made plain .
A category 3 storm , striking a city whose vulnerability was well known , in the world ’s richest country , managed to cause the largest movement of people in the history of the United States .
In 14 days , 1.5 million people – three times more than moved during the great Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s – fled the US coast of the Gulf of Mexico .
Half the 2005 population of New Orleans , some 300,000 people , still have not come back .
Nothing spectacular like this has happened to Nandom , even if , like New Orleans , half the people are gone .
“ Our trees are still standing .
Our trees are not capsized , ” one farmer told me .
“ You can not see it .
You can even live through it and not see it .
It is only when you sit down and think that you realise . ”
And that is why places like Nandom rarely get written about .
Most stories about environmental migration have focused on three or four so - called “ canaries ” : the first human habitats set to disappear .
These range from the village of ­Shishmaref in Alaska , which is falling into the sea , to entire states , like the low - lying Maldives , which now has a fund to buy land abroad for its 400,000 citizens .
But these stark cases do not represent the future facing most people who might become climate migrants .
Friends of the Earth , which shares the 250 million estimate of environmental refugees by 2050 , puts the total number of displaced people from small island states like the Maldives at one million .
The other 249 million will come from humdrum places more like Nandom : poor , agricultural societies that have existed for a long time in marginal climates , with little room for error , but now find themselves struggling to support their populations .
It is here that the real numbers – the tens of millions of potential migrants – lie and yet it is also where the future is hard to read , where there is hope still , and where climate change is often taking place among other profound transformations , such as economic development , rapid population growth or political upheaval .
This interplay of factors makes it difficult to imagine what environmental migration is going to look like .
And since the early 1990s , when migration emerged as a ­logical corollary of climate change , academics have argued about how best to approach the problem .
On the one hand , there is the sheer enormity of human movement .
According to Professor Norman Myers , a British academic who has done more than anyone to raise the alarm over climate migration , this alone will be enough to overwhelm the world ’s current refugee laws and humanitarian agencies .
“ We do not seem to have the institutions in place that can measure up to a challenge like this , ” Myers told me .
“ We are talking about big numbers , ” he said .
“ I will be very surprised if there are n’t eventually half a billion of these environmental and climate refugees , and that will alter the basic demographics of a lot of countries . ”
Seen from this angle , the scale of future migration will be enough to cause a pulse - quickening mixture of humanitarian emergencies and security breakdowns .
And Myers has argued that the world ’s richest and most ecologically stable countries will come under increasing pressure to accommodate those seeking safety .
“ Developed countries cannot isolate themselves from distress and disaster in developing countries , ” he wrote in 2005 .
“ Already there are sizeable numbers of environmental refugees who have made their way , usually illegally , into OSCE [ Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ] countries – and today ’s stream will surely come to be regarded as a trickle when compared with the floods that will ensue in decades ahead . ”
Cutting against the anticipated scale of environmental migration , however , is the variety of ways in which it might unfold .
And this makes it hard to treat as a single problem .
Climate change is expected to hit different parts of the world in different forms and at different speeds .
The spectrum is enormous .
It stretches from increasingly frequent sudden disasters , such as Katrina , to cases like the African Sahel and Australia ’s Murray - Darling Basin , where drought and wildfires threaten large - scale forced migration over the next 30 to 40 years .
Then there are the Nandoms , the ­marginal zones where millions of people are hanging on in increasingly inhospitable climates .
While at the far end of the scale , a sea - level rise of three millimetres a year ( its current rate ) , or even considerably more , will play out over generations – the “ migration ” of a coastal community might be no more than the changing shape of their city .
All these scenarios will involve the movement of ­people , but beyond that , how far do the similarities extend ?
For some , this has made the very notion of “ environmental migration ” misleading .
Richard Black , a professor of human geography at the United Kingdom ’s University of Sussex who has studied the question for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , told me he had several problems with the idea .
In the first place , he said , it has been used to raise the spectre of massive international migration , even though ­people displaced by environmental disasters overwhelmingly tend to stay within their national borders , often as close as possible to their former homes .
This can still be a great strain , but it is not the same as hordes of people crossing borders .
It is also , incidentally , how migration from northern Ghana is playing out .
A survey of 204 families in Nandom in 2004 , for instance , found not a single relative among them who had migrated outside the country .
More broadly though , Black disputes the idea that environmental migration is somehow new , or different to other kinds of migration .
The decisions of every migrant , he argues , even those made under great stress , are shaped by a mixture of economic , social and cultural factors , and the environment is just one of these .
By imagining that climate change has some kind of special influence over migration , Black argues that we run the risk of overlooking similarities between ­people who move for environmental reasons and those who move for political or economic reasons , and those who do not move at all .
The scale of impending migrations may be alarming , but that does not mean they are exotic , or should be treated in isolation .
“ Assuming that an exceptional event must have exceptional causes is sloppy , ” said Black .
“ It ’s sloppy thinking . ”
The clashing interpretations of Myers and Black are important because , between them , they will shape how environmental migration is tackled and researched over the coming years : as security threat , humanitarian crisis or another piece of the development conundrum .
So far , however , the result has been a stalemate .
In the last major report by the IPCC , in 2007 , the two approaches cancelled each other out .
Unable to decide who was right , the IPCC predicted that nobody would be displaced by climate change at all .
Despite what the IPCC says , the buses have continued to leave Nandom .
I arrived in the town in March , expecting the landscape to look drier than it did .
The bus journey from Wa , the capital of Ghana ’s Upper West region , revealed a savannah as we approached the town : arid , golden grasses and humps of earth , waiting for planting .
But the dust was shot through with green .
This , I later found out , was because there had been a downpour in January , a full three or four months before the normal start of the rainy reason and another confusing note in the region ’s discordant climate .
Unpredictability is Nandom ’s problem .
The 1990s were a decade of steady , improving rains in northern Ghana , but since the turn of the century , the seasons have lost their shape .
The region ’s historic five - month rainy reason , from March to August , has shrunk to just two or three months , but sometimes with just as much , if not more , rain .
Last year 95 millimetres of rain – 10 % of Nandom ’s annual total – fell on a single day in August , destroying crops and houses .
Flooding , normally unheard of in northern Ghana , has occurred in each of the past two years , with the UNHCR coming to the help of 75,000 people in 2007 .
The volatility is here to stay .
Climate models predict a one - or two - degree rise in temperature in Ghana and west Africa by mid-century and a simultaneous 10 % decrease in rainfall , but the line is a jagged one .
Zinedeme Minia , the deputy director - general of Ghana ’s Meteorological Agency , told me it was much easier to map 20 - or 30 - year trends than to know what will happen in the shorter term .
“ Climate change will bring surprises , ” he said .
And for poor farmers who rely on rain - fed agriculture , that uncertainty is too much to bear .
“ You are doing a gambling game , ” said Minia .
“ You are never sure when you are likely to get something and when you will lose completely .
That is the issue . ”
Farmers in Nandom spoke in alternating tones of fatigue and bloody - mindedness about their capricious rains .
One day , around noon , I met Leo Yiryel , the 84 - year - old chief of a small village just outside the town .
“ The rain is punishing us a lot , ” he said .
“ There used to be only a hard dry season , but now there is also a rainy season that can destroy your crops . ”
Yiryel was sitting on a bench under a mango tree , surrounded by grandchildren who listened raptly .
There seemed to be dozens of them so I asked Yiryel where their parents were .
He told me he had 12 children – a 13th died young – and that 11 of them had migrated to southern Ghana .
“ I never expected that , ” admitted Yiryel .
“ I thought when they were in school and in training that all the jobs and opportunities would be here , but they are not .
They are all down there . ”
But some are determined , whatever Nandom ’s future , to stay .
Later that day , I went to Brutu , a village with a dam , where farmers try and grow vegetables all year round .
But this year , in the depths of the dry season , the water had run out .
I found Isaac Abeikpep surrounded by tomatoes , ­cabbages , peppers and yoro , a local fruit related to the watermelon , all dying .
“ The land is not all that good , ” Abeikpep said , but he was n’t going anywhere .
“ I have too many mothers and grandmothers . ”
Abeikpep , who is 29 , vowed he would never leave his plot , but talking about the months ahead , he could not suppress his anxiety .
“ I hope this year will be okay , ” he said .
“ But the longer you hope , the more you realise that you will be disappointed . ”
Nandom as a whole , however , is doing more than hope .
The district has been taking measures to adapt to its hostile climate since 1973 , when the local Catholic church set up the Nandom Agricultural Project to help farmers improve their agricultural techniques .
The date is significant because it relates to the sub-Saharan droughts of the 1970s and 1980s , which killed an estimated 100,000 people in west Africa and triggered the migration of more than a million people from the worst - affected countries of Mali , Niger and Burkina Faso to their southern neighbours , mainly Ivory Coast and Ghana .
In Nandom , the struggle to cope with a marginal climate has been going on for decades .
For much of that time , the struggle has been led by Stanislaus Nasaal .
Sitting in the offices of the Nandom Agricultural Project , with last year ’s rainfall statistics posted on the wall , Nasaal said that farmers were adapting to shorter growing seasons with new crops – quicker - maturing millets and maizes – and new methods of planting .
Unsure of the rains , farmers now spread their seeds among ridges , hillsides and low - lying ground to improve their chances of withstanding droughts , floods , or both .
“ We can always mitigate , ” said Nasaal several times , as if it was a chant .
“ We can always mitigate . ”
As we discussed adaptation , I noticed that migration , in various forms , kept coming up .
One of the new tilling techniques in Nandom , for example , in which farmers look for inclines in their fields and then build earth ramparts around each seed to catch water , is from Burkina Faso , courtesy of the migrants who fled the droughts there a generation ago .
More often , though , Nasaal mentioned migration as a way of helping families spread the risk of farming in such uncertain conditions .
Relatives are sent away to the farms and cities of southern Ghana to find a steady income .
“ If we are two brothers , ” said Nasaal .
“ I will go in case you fail .
We will complement each other . ”

CORVALLIS , Ore. - Automobile owners around the world may some day soon be driving on tires that are partly made out of trees - which could cost less , perform better and save on fuel and energy .
Wood science researchers at Oregon State University have made some surprising findings about the potential of microcrystalline cellulose - a product that can be made easily from almost any type of plant fibers - to partially replace silica as a reinforcing filler in the manufacture of rubber tires .
A new study suggests that this approach might decrease the energy required to produce the tire , reduce costs , and better resist heat buildup .
Early tests indicate that such products would have comparable traction on cold or wet pavement , be just as strong , and provide even higher fuel efficiency than traditional tires in hot weather .
" We were surprised at how favorable the results were for the use of this material , " said Kaichang Li , an associate professor of wood science and engineering in the OSU College of Forestry , who conducted this research with graduate student Wen Bai .
" This could lead to a new generation of automotive tire technology , one of the first fundamental changes to come around in a long time , " Li said .
Cellulose fiber has been used for some time as reinforcement in some types of rubber and automotive products , such as belts , hoses and insulation - but never in tires , where the preferred fillers are carbon black and silica .
Carbon black , however , is made from increasingly expensive oil , and the processing of silica is energy - intensive .
Both products are very dense and reduce the fuel efficiency of automobiles .
In the search for new types of reinforcing fillers that are inexpensive , easily available , light and renewable , OSU experts turned to microcrystalline cellulose - a micrometer - sized type of crystalline cellulose with an extremely well - organized structure .
It is produced in a low - cost process of acid hydrolysis using nature 's most abundant and sustainable natural polymer - cellulose - that comprises about 40 - 50 percent of wood .
In this study , OSU researchers replaced up to about 12 percent of the silica used in conventional tire manufacture .
This decreased the amount of energy needed to compound the rubber composite , improved the heat resistance of the product , and retained tensile strength .
Traction is always a key issue with tire performance , and the study showed that the traction of the new product was comparable to existing rubber tire technology in a wet , rainy environment .
However , at high temperatures such as in summer , the partial replacement of silica decreased the rolling resistance of the product , which would improve fuel efficiency of rubber tires made with the new approach .
More research is needed to confirm the long - term durability of tires made with partial replacement of silica , Li said .
Further commercial development of this technology by a tire manufacturer could be undertaken at any time , he said .
The newest findings were just published in a professional journal , Composites Part A : Applied Science and Manufacturing .
Tire manufacturing , a huge industry , could also provide another market for large amounts of Pacific Northwest natural fibers and the jobs and technology needed to process them
This advance is another in a series of significant discoveries in Li's research program at OSU in recent years .
He developed a non -toxic adhesive for production of wood composite panels that has dramatically changed that industry , and in 2007 received a Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award at the National Academy of Sciences for his work on new , sustainable and environmentally friendly wood products .

God has mellowed .
The God that most Americans worship occasionally gets upset about abortion and gay marriage , but he is a softy compared with the Yahweh of the Hebrew Bible .
That was a warrior God , savagely tribal , deeply insecure about his status and willing to commit mass murder to show off his powers .
But at least Yahweh had strong moral views , occasionally enlightened ones , about how the Israelites should behave .
His hunter - gatherer ancestors , by contrast , were doofus gods .
Morally clueless , they were often yelled at by their people and tended toward quirky obsessions .
One thunder god would get mad if people combed their hair during a storm or watched dogs mate .
In his brilliant new book , “ The Evolution of God , ” Robert Wright tells the story of how God grew up .
He starts with the deities of hunter - ­gatherer tribes , moves to those of chiefdoms and nations , then on to the polytheism of the early Israelites and the monotheism that followed , and then to the New Testament and the Koran , before finishing off with the modern multinational Gods of Judaism , Christianity and Islam .
Wright ’s tone is reasoned and careful , even hesitant , throughout , and it is nice to read about issues like the morality of Christ and the meaning of jihad without getting the feeling that you are being shouted at .
His views , though , are provocative and controversial .
There is something here to annoy almost everyone .
In sharp contrast to many contemporary secularists , Wright is bullish about monotheism .
In “ Nonzero : The Logic of Human Destiny ” ( 2000 ) , he argued that there is a moral direction to human history , that technological growth and expanding global interconnectedness have moved us toward ever more positive and mutually beneficial relationships with others .
In “ The Evolution of God , ” Wright tells a similar story from a religious standpoint , proposing that the increasing goodness of God reflects the increasing goodness of our species .
“ As the scope of social organization grows , God tends to eventually catch up , drawing a larger expanse of humanity under his protection , or at least a larger expanse of humanity under his toleration . ”
Wright argues that each of the major Abrahamic faiths has been forced toward moral growth as it found itself interacting with other faiths on a multinational level , and that this expansion of the moral imagination reflects “ a higher purpose , a transcendent moral order . ”

This sounds pro-religion , but do n’t expect Pope Benedict XVI to be quoting from Wright ’s book anytime soon .
Wright makes it clear that he is tracking people ’s conception of the divine , not the divine itself .
He describes this as “ a good news / bad news joke for traditionalist Christians , Muslims and Jews . ”
The bad news is that your God was born imperfect .
The good news is that he does n’t really exist .
Somewhere in China , David Li is keeping his head down .
Before the crash , his grateful admirers in Wall Street and the City declared that he deserved the Nobel Prize for Economics for discovering the wondrously enriching theory of " Gaussian copula functions " , which turned base assets into gold .
While the market for credit default swaps went from $ 920bn in 2001 to $ 62 trillion in 2007 , he was a genius .
Now that his name appears in headlines such as : " Was David Li the guy who ' blew up Wall Street ' ? " acclaim from the Swedes seems unlikely .
Mathematicians are trashing his reputation and the reputation of the banks ' other quantitative analysts .
Their critiques are , inevitably , complicated , but the quants ' basic fault is easy enough to grasp .
They assumed they could place reassuringly neat numbers on the risks of default in bundles of mortgages or bonds .
Their figures were fantasies that bore no relation to the real economy in which homeowners and companies had to fund their debts because the quants never understood that the uncertainties in calculating risk were so great , all attempts to measure them were dangerously misleading .
" They were pretending mathematics was magic , " explained Tim Johnson at Heriot - Watt University , one of a group of financial mathematicians in British universities who specialise in taking apart the models of bankers and dealers .
Ministers , led by Lord Drayson , have been wooing Johnson and his colleagues of late and I can't say I am surprised .
Tens of millions of people in the rich world and hundreds of millions in the poor are losing their livelihoods because bad maths allowed bankers to pretend to themselves that they were not being insanely reckless .
The government thinks it knows how to stop a recurrence of the folly .
It reasons that Britain is lucky enough to have a band of independent experts who can save jobs and stop the taxpayer being fleeced by pointing out the errors of the City 's calculations .
The public pays the academics ' salaries and academics can return the compliment by protecting the public .
" You have a fucking duty to speak out , " as one blunt politician explained the deal to them .
But they are not going to speak out for a reason readers of this column will guess : Johnson and his colleagues fear being hauled before the libel courts .
Academics have noted the willingness of the judiciary to allow believers in " alternative " chiropractic therapy to sue science writer Simon Singh , and can imagine all too graphically what would happen to them .
Chiropractors are small - time operators working from suburban offices , one said .
Bankers have the most expensive lawyers in the City on call .
If his colleagues were to hint that a bank was risking its investors ' money , they would be hammered .
The naive , who suppose that the law would protect mathematicians who told the truth , do not understand the wretched condition of freedom of speech in England .
The exorbitant costs of libel actions are far beyond the means of all academics and , increasingly , most newspapers ; Simon Singh can only fight the chiropractors because he is the author of four international bestsellers .
As important , the law is biased against defendants and judges put the worst possible interpretation on a writer 's words .
In all likelihood , a mathematician who criticised the models of Goldman Sachs , say , or the Royal Bank of Scotland would find himself in court defending assertions he never realised he had made .
Thus , after the worst crash since 1929 , and with the world economy in crisis , people who know what went wrong and why it went wrong are too frightened to go public .
If their fear does not make the case for reform of the libel laws on American lines , I do n't know what will .
We should have free debate on matters of public importance , as long as writers are not malicious and do not display a wild disregard for the truth .
But where is reform to come from ?
Conservative lawyers tell me that David Cameron is struck by the keenness of the judiciary to find in favour of Russian oligarchs and Middle Eastern petro-billionaires who , to put the case against them at its mildest , do not have the best interests of British democracy at heart .
I accept that you should not put your trust in promises from Tories , particularly when they are trying to woo journalists in the run-up to an election .
But I have watched a parade of grotesques from around the world marching out of English courts with fat cheques and gagging orders in their pockets and accept that at least some Conservatives have come to believe that the libel law is a threat to national security .
The attitude of the liberal - left is more ambiguous .
In theory , liberals ought to believe in freedom of speech .
In practice , Labour ministers have yet to meet campaigners for law reform and wider liberal society has yet to overcome a way of thinking that stops it reconnecting with the best parts of the liberal tradition .
Simon Singh and the mathematicians are now living with the consequences of the human rights movement of the late 20th century .
Margaret
Thatcher 's repeated election victories convinced British liberals to try to win in the courts what they could not win at the ballot box .
The trouble with the strategy has always been that British judges , like judges across the EU , do not believe in freedom of speech .
They are illiberal liberals who will defend all rights except the most fundamental right of a citizen of a free country to make his or her case without fear of the consequences .
" Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument : but facts and arguments , to produce any effect on the mind , must be brought before it , " said John Stuart Mill .
But the average British judge does not believe that free debate in the marketplace of the mind will expose " wrong opinions and practices " .
He believes they must be suppressed because he retains the fear of the old European aristocracy that the masses cannot see through dangerous ideas and bad arguments .
To speak plainly , if I may , the judiciary has an elite suspicion of democracy and the price of its elitism is becoming too high for this impoverished country to bear .
The herpes virus could help to treat the advanced stages of the most serious form of skin cancer , researchers have discovered .
Herpes simplex is the virus that causes cold sores .
Previous laboratory research has shown that a mutant form of the virus has improved the survival times of animals with malignant melanoma tumours .
The virus is also known to reproduce itself more rapidly in human cancer cells , rather than in healthy cells , leading to their death .
A team from the University of Glasgow carried out a preliminary study to discover whether a safe , genetically modified version of the virus could be safely used on patients .
I would hope that herpes simplex might be included in non-surgical therapy for this disease in the future
Two had one injection each of the modified virus , two received two injections and one was given four .
In all three patients who had two or more injections there was evidence of the virus killing tumour cells without invading or harming surrounding tissue .
The most striking effect was seen in the patient who had four injections into two tumours .
Both lumps became flattened and , under a microscope , there were clear signs of cancer cells dying .
' Encouraging ' results
Lead researcher Professor Rona MacKie said the results of the trial were " encouraging " .
But she warned that the work was still at a very early stage .
A widely available treatment could be 10 years away .
She said : " At the moment , other than surgery , we have nothing that works against late - stage melanoma .
" I would hope that herpes simplex might be included in non-surgical therapy for this disease in the future .
" We can not yet say that it will be , because a lot more work has to be done first . "
Professor MacKie said the next stage would be to test whether higher doses of the virus were safe for patients .
Nerve tissue
She said there was only evidence that herpes simplex attacked skin cancer when injected straight into tumours .
She said : " If you put the virus in direct contact with tumour cells it kills them .
" But there are many situations , such as when the cancer has spread to the liver , where this would be difficult . "
The herpes virus is naturally attracted to nerve tissue .
The cells that give rise to melanoma are derived from the developing nervous system in the foetus , which is thought to be why HSV targets skin tumours .
It also likes to attack actively dividing cells , which is another reason for its affinity with cancer .
Immune response
Dr Richard Sullivan , head of clinical programmes for the Cancer Research Campaign , said the research was one of a number of possible new treatments for melanoma .
Another method involves injecting crushed up cells from the tumour into the bloodstream to stimulate an immune response .
Dr Sullivan said the problem with using viruses was that nobody had successfully managed to penetrate beyond the outer three of four layers of a tumour .
This meant that the virus could potentially kill off small secondary growths , but not larger established primary tumours .
He said : " It may be that we have to aim for a situation where people learn to live with their cancer . "
Dr David Kirn , head of Imperial Cancer Research Fund 's Viral and Genetic Therapy Programme , said : " It is encouraging to see that a mutant herpes virus has been shown to replicate in one particular tumour type .
" However , this study is in its very early days , so it is important not to raise any false hopes among patients . "
Visualizing the Hottest 100
Today radio station Triple J finished broadcasting their Hottest 100 tracks of all time , the first all - time vote since 1998 .
For those outside Australia and not familiar with the tradition of the Hottest 100 , it began back in 1989 and results are determined by listener votes .
After two more years the format changed and votes were restricted to tracks released over the previous year , presumably because the top 10 became a list of the usual suspects .
Since then 1998 and this year have been the only all - time hottest votes .
A traditional favourite , Love Will Tear Us Apart by Joy Division , which was # 1 in two of the first three all - time charts only made it to # 4 this year , but Nirvana ’s Smells Like Teen Spirit was # 1 in the third and again in 1989 1998 and this year it made it to # 1 for a third time .
Thanks to the wonderful collaborative spirit of Web 2.0 , this year ’s full list is already up on Wikipedia , complete with the year of release of each track .
This allows me to indulge in my data mining hobby , which is why I am posting here rather than over on the The Music Blogs .
So , inspired by a suggestion from Mark Lauer , a regular Mule reader ( and careful sub- editor ) , here is a look at the distribution of the hottest 100 tracks by year of release .
Hottest 100 Track Ranking by Year of Release
While the density certainly increases after about 1995 , reflecting a lot of new entrants since the early charts , there is no clear trend along the 45 degree line ( and , for the technically - minded , the R2 is about 0.1 % ) .
So , while there are not as many oldies in the chart , those oldies that do make it in are just as likely to rank well as the newer entrants .
To make the most of the R code I wrote to produce this chart , here is the same thing showing artist name rather than track name .
Hottest 100 Artist Ranking by Year of Release
To get a better sense of the distribution of rank and year , here is a chart that just shows the location of the tracks by year and rank .
Hottest 100 Rank versus Year of Release
Seeing the data just as points like this shows a concentration of tracks released around the mid-90s .
A histogram of the year of release confirms this .
Of course , I ’m sure this says more about the demographics of voters than the preponderance of true classics in the 90s .
UPDATE : In this tweet , @nicwalmsley suggested an artist scoring system : 100 points for ranking 1st , 1 point for ranking 100th .
As he notes , this system puts Radiohead , Jeff Buckley and Nirvana in 1st , 2nd and 3rd place respectively .
Here are the top 10 artists by this measure .
Radiohead 343 Jeff Buckley 269 Nirvana 188 Powderfinger 154 Metallica 152 The Beatles 149 The Smashing Pumpkins 139 Pearl Jam 138 Michael Jackson 135 Pink Floyd 13
FURTHER UPDATE : @Warlach has laboured hard to assemble the full Hottest 100 as a blip .fm playlist .
YET ANOTHER UPDATE :
In case you are wondering about the geographic mix , as expected the list is dominated by the US and the UK .
USA 45 UK 37 Australia 15 France 2 Jamaica 1
The pedants should note that I ’ve counted System of a Down in the USA ( rather than USA / Armenia ) and Crowded House as Australia ( rather than Australia / New Zealand ) .
I hope that does n’t offend our Kiwi cousins !

Iran 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , warned today that continuing divisions would lead to the collapse of the country 's ruling elite , after a former president called for a referendum on the government 's legitimacy .
The referendum call from Mohammad Khatami appeared to be part of an opposition strategy to keep Khamenei and allied hardliners on the defensive over last month 's disputed elections .
It coincided with a demand from Mir Hossein Mousavi , the leading opposition candidate in those elections , for the release of opposition supporters detained for protesting against the official results , which gave a landslide victory to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Another former president , Hashemi Rafsanjani , gave a speech at Friday prayers in which he said the Islamic Republic was in crisis and the government had lost the trust of millions of Iranians .
Khamenei , whose previously unquestioned authority is now under daily challenge , hit back furiously .
" The elite should be watchful , since they have been faced with a big test .
Failing the test will cause their collapse , " the supreme leader said , in a speech to mark a religious holiday , attended by government officials including Ahmadinejad , who sat on the stage behind him .
Khatami's call for a referendum represented a new tactic by the opposition , in its efforts to maintain the momentum of a protest movement harshly suppressed on the streets by pro-government militias .
" I state openly that reliance upon the people 's vote and the staging of a legal referendum is the only way for the system to emerge from the current crisis , " said Khatami , a reformist cleric who was president from 1997 to 2005 .
" People must be asked whether they are happy with the situation that has taken shape . "
In remarks quoted on reformist Iranian websites , he suggested a referendum be overseen by an " impartial " body , such as the Expediency Discernment Council , which is chaired by Rafsanjani and is supposed to mediate disputes between clerical and lay organs of state .
Khatami's political organisation , the Association of Combatant Clerics , issued a statement on its website saying that a referendum should not be overseen by " bodies and centres that manipulated " the 12 June vote , a reference to the Guardian Council , a body that oversees elections and endorsed the official election result .
It is highly unlikely that either Khamenei or the Guardian Council would agree to such a referendum .
It appeared to designed principally to open a new avenue of attack on the conservative establishment .
Mousavi also raised his own rallying cry to supporters at a meeting with the families of post-election detainees .
" You are facing something new : an awakened nation , a nation that has been born again and is here to defend its achievements , " the former prime minister said .
" Arrests ... wo n't put an end to this problem .
End this game as soon as possible and return to the nation its [ arrested ] sons .
" Mousavi ridiculed the accusation repeatedly made by Khamenei and his allies that the protests were the product of foreign orchestration .
" Who believes that [ the protesters ] would conspire with foreigners and sell the interests of their own country ?
Has our country become so mean and degraded that you attribute the huge protest movement of the nation to foreigners ?
Is n't this an insult to our nation ? " Mousavi said .
Amid the uncompromising rhetoric on both sides , the government appeared to make a small concessionary gesture , allowing detainees to call their families from prison for the first time .

Following up on their report in April detailing the National Security Agency 's systemic and significant " overcollection " — that is , illegal interception — of Americans ' domestic communications , James Risen and Eric Lichtblau of the New York Times have just published a new story with even more detail about the NSA 's ongoing warrantless wiretapping and the concerns it is raising in Congress .
Thankfully , it appears that the NYT 's confirmation in April that the NSA has been exceeding its legal authority and " overcollecting " masses of Americans ' communications has spurred some closed - door investigations on Capitol Hill .
Today 's story focuses on this renewed concern from Congress over the wiretapping program , and what Congress ' latest closed - door inquiries have revealed about the ongoing spying :
Those inquiries have led to concerns in Congress about the agency ’s ability to collect and read domestic e-mail messages of Americans on a widespread basis , officials said .
Supporting that conclusion is the account of a former N.S.A. analyst who , in a series of interviews , described being trained in 2005 for a program in which the agency routinely examined large volumes of Americans ’ e-mail messages without court warrants .
Two intelligence officials confirmed that the program was still in operation .
The anonymous NSA analyst had some very interesting things to tell the Times .
In particular , we now have a name for the secret database program where the NSA stores the millions of foreign and domestic emails that its surveillance vacuum sucks up : it 's called " Pinwale " .
[ The NSA ] appears to have tolerated significant collection and examination of domestic e-mail messages without warrants , according to the former analyst , who spoke only on condition of anonymity .
He said he and other analysts were trained to use a secret database , code - named Pinwale , in 2005 that archived foreign and domestic e-mail messages .
He said Pinwale allowed N.S.A. analysts to read large volumes of e-mail messages to and from Americans as long as they fell within certain limits — no more than 30 percent of any database search , he recalled being told — and Americans were not explicitly singled out in the searches .
The former analyst added that his instructors had warned against committing any abuses , telling his class that another analyst had been investigated because he had improperly accessed the personal e-mail of former President Bill Clinton .
Other intelligence officials confirmed the existence of the Pinwale e-mail database , but declined to provide further details .
These details are new , but the conclusion is still the same as we 've been saying for years now : ordinary Americans ' most private emails — even President Clinton 's emails ! — have been and still are being intercepted in bulk and then stored in secret NSA databases , without probable cause .
That 's why we 're suing the government in our case Jewel v. NSA , and that 's why one of the remedies we 're asking for in that case is the destruction of the domestic communications and records that the NSA has been illegally hoarding in databases like Pinwale .
Help us rein in this blatant violation of your privacy rights and support our litigation to stop the NSA spying by joining EFF today .
With your help , someday your emails , my emails , and even President Clinton 's emails may finally be wiped from the NSA 's memory banks .
UPDATE : Marc Ambinder at The Atlantic 's blog has an interesting follow - up on the NYT story with additional details about the Pinwale database program .

tagged encoding , rails , ruby , and ruby19 .
Just out of curiosity , I took two of my recent Rails applications today and tried them with Ruby 1.9 .
It was surprisingly easy to make all tests pass without any warnings or errors .
Rails 2.3 already has quite good support for Ruby 1.9 .
The main gotcha however was about file encodings .
If you have source files which contain non-ASCII characters , Ruby 1.9 now needs to know which encoding the file was saved with .
If you do n't specify the encoding for a file with non-ASCII characters , you 'll get an invalid multibyte char ( US - ASCII ) error message .
File encoding
So Ruby 1.9 rejects to parse any file with non-ASCII characters if you do n't specify the encoding .
You can do so by adding a Ruby comment at the top of the file :
# encoding : utf -8
This tells the Ruby parser to interpret the file content using UTF - 8 encoding .
Of course , you need to specify the correct encoding ( meaningly the encoding your editor used when the file was saved ) .
Most Posix systems like Linux and Mac use UTF - 8 by default nowadays .
Windows however defaults to Latin - 1 ( ISO - 8859 -1 ) .
Why bother ?
Previously , Ruby did n't care about the encoding .
The Ruby parser read everything in the source file byte by byte .
E.g. try asking for the length of a string that contains Unicode characters .
With Ruby 1.8 , it returns the number of bytes the string occopies :
" ä " . length # returns 2 since ' ä ' occupies 2 bytes in UTF - 8
If you put " ä " . length into a text file and save it using UTF - 8 encoding , the letter 'ä ' is stored as the two - bytes - sequence C3 , A4 ( that 's how ' ä ' is represented in UTF - 8 ) .
So since Ruby 1.8 does n't know encodings and just reads bytes from the file , it sees two " letters " when parsing the file .
In Ruby 1.8 , bytes and characters are the same ( meaning one character is considered one byte and vice versa ) .
This is fine for ASCII , but does n't work with multibyte encodings like Unicode UTF - 8 .
If you would save the same file using Latin - 1 encoding , the letter ' ä ' would be stored as a single byte E4 and Ruby 1.8 would return 1 when asking for the length .
Ruby 1.9 however distinguishes between bytes and characters .
If the parser encounters the byte sequence C3 , A4 in a file , and you told it before that this file uses UTF - 8 encoding , the parser knows that these two bytes are the representation of the single character 'ä ' .
Therefore Ruby 1.9 can correctly count the number of characters in a string , even if it contains multibyte characters :
# encoding : utf - 8 " ä " . length # returns 1 since Ruby 1.9 knows the encoding
Since there are several encoding standards , Ruby needs to know which one the file was saved with to correctly parse multibyte characters .
This also means that with different encodings , the length of a string is not anymore equal to the number of bytes the string occupies .
However this is by design , since with every multibyte encoding , a character can not neccessarily be represented by a single byte .
In Ruby applications , you usually do n't care about the number of bytes a string occupies .
The most useful length measurement to know is the number of characters a string has .
So String #length and String #size both return the number of characters in Ruby 1.9 , not the number of bytes like Ruby 1.8 did before .
To get the number of bytes a string occupies , Ruby 1.9 has as String # bytesize method ( which however is rarely used , I suppose ) .
Does it affect Rails ?
Rarely , I 'd say .
I tried two Rails applications I wrote a while ago ( which heavily use UTF - 8 strings for German characters ) and did n't notice any problems .
However , there could be some minor differences in behavior , e.g. if using validates_length_of in a model class , it previously checked against the byte count while with Ruby 1.9 , the real character count is checked .
If the underlying storage / database engine is n't aware of the encoding , this may lead strange length problems .
I 'm a little surprised that Ruby 1.9 does not use a default encoding of UTF - 8 ( convention over configuration -- UTF - 8 seems to be the most wide spread used encoding nowadays and it would be nice if it would be assumed the default ) .
But then , this might lead to weird problems if you do n't use UTF - 8 and Ruby does n't detect it ( detecting non-ASCII is easy , detecting non-UTF - 8 however would n't be reliable ) .
Btw , besides file encodings , there are a lot of other changes in Ruby 1.9 .
Check out the Changelog to find out more .
And beware that you can do some strange things with encodings .
The Iraqi government originally tried last year to award oil fields to Western companies through a no - bid process .
That prompted objections from a group of United States senators , who wanted greater transparency , and the plan was replaced with the auction , which had the effect of letting Chinese companies play a much larger role .
China ’s leaders were surprised by the steep rise in commodity prices early last year , which exposed the vulnerability of their country ’s huge manufacturing sector to high raw material prices .
When oil prices plunged in the autumn , China began buying , importing and storing oil in huge quantities , helping to drive a partial rebound in world oil prices in spring .
And China stepped up its hunt to acquire foreign oil .
Chinese officials , economists and advisers have been almost unanimous in recent weeks in saying that their country needed to invest more in natural resources , while also voicing concerns about the long - term creditworthiness of the United States and the buying power of the dollar .
China has $ 2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves , mostly invested in dollar - denominated bonds , and has been looking for ways to diversify gradually into other assets like commodities , said a Chinese government adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the secrecy of Chinese reserve policies .
China ’s central bank , the People ’s Bank of China , called Friday for the development of an international currency other than the dollar that would be a safe repository of value , in the latest sign of China ’s search for other ways to invest its international reserves .
Philip Andrews - Speed , a specialist in China ’s oil industry at the University of Dundee in Scotland , said Iraq was clearly attractive for China and its oil industry .
“ All , or nearly all , oil companies who have the courage want to be in Iraq because of the large size of the proven resource base and the potential for new discoveries , ” he wrote in an e-mail message .
“ So , in this respect , the Chinese are part of the herd . ”

Updated , June 7 , 2009 : Rajeev Motwani , one of the savviest angel investors in Silicon Valley , a Stanford professor and most importantly a close and personal friend passed away earlier today .
He was 47 and is left behind by his wife Asha and kids .
It is hard for me to write this post — this morning the news of Steve Jobs ’ improving health put me in a good mood .
My day is ending with a broken heart and tears in my eyes .
It is the day which reminds you of the unpredictability of life .
Rajeev and I had been swapping emails , hoping to get together for a cup of coffee and discussions about technology .
Alas , that shall never be .
After working tirelessly in anonymity , his tutelage of two Stanford University young grad students , Larry Page and Sergey Brin , made him a household name in Silicon Valley .
He started the Mining Data at Stanford project ( MIDAS ) and was one of the earliest backers of Google .
He was an early investor in Paypal and a special adviser to Sequoia Captial .
That success never came in the way of Rajeev ’s quest for knowledge and innate desire to help others .
There was n’t a startup he did n’t love .
Like his chosen specialization of search , Rajeev was searching for the unknown .
He was still active as a professor and was teaching a couple of classes as recently as the last semester .
I have known Rajeev , his wife Asha and their family for a long time .
Rajeev , like me , was from New Delhi .
In my professional career ( and personal moments of crisis ) Rajeev was only a phone call away , sharing his vast rolodex .
Just like a true friend .
Only a few weeks back , I had a simple Indian lunch in his house with his family .
I am sure , I am not the only one who has benefited from his generosity of time and knowledge and his ability to create connections and help others .
My prayers go to his young family .
I hope god gives them strength and courage to navigate through these rough seas of life .
Update , June 7 , 2009 : The San Jose Mercury News reports that the Artherton police are waiting for an autopost report on Rajeev ’s accidental drowning .
The Silicon Valley chapter of TIE is planning a memorial service on Wednesday .
Details of a memorial service to follow .
In addition , there were will be a visitation event on Monday June 8th at their home between 5 - and - 8 pm .
Instead of flowers and gifts , family would like you to make contribution , please mail checks made out to “ Rajeev Motwani Foundation ” c /o Ash Chopra , Merrill Lynch , 101 California Street , Suite 2100 , San Francisco CA 94111 .
Tributes from around the tech community :
Sergey Brin pays his tribute on his blog .
“ … Yet his legacy and personality lives on in the students , projects , and companies he has touched .
Today , whenever you use a piece of technology , there is a good chance a little bit of Rajeev Motwani is behind it , ” he writes .
David Hornik of August Capital writes : Rajeev just wanted to be helpful .
And he was .
To so many of us .
Perhaps that is why so many of us thought of Rajeev as a friend .
It is one thing to be friendly with someone in the business world .
It is another thing altogether to consider them a friend .
Rajeev genuinely liked people and people genuinely liked him .
Dan Gould , co-founder of Newroo , emailed this story about Rajeev and wanted me to share it with you : “ I did n’t know Rajeev well , but he was a great guy who helped us quite a bit .
We were the classic two kids with some software who had just moved to California .
I only knew him from using his Randomized Algorithms book in school , but he spent a bunch of time with us .
He helped us improve our algorithms and ideas and introduced us to Ron Conway and to other folks which led to the acquisition of our startup .
I ran into him several times since and he was always both kind and brilliant .
I had hoped to work with him on a future project .
While that ’s not to be , I imagine dozens of other computer scientists - turned - entrepreneurs can tell the same story . ”
If you have a Rajeev story you would like to share with rest of us so we can all remember and grieve together , please leave it in the comments section or email me .
What ’s Vimacs ?
In a nutshell , Vimacs is Vim emulating Emacs .
( If you ’ve never heard of Vim nor Emacs , you ’re probably in the wrong place right now ; ) .
To give slightly more detail , Vimacs ( Vim- improved Emacs ) is a Vim plugin , which brings Emacs ’s extensive key bindings and modeless editing features to the the Vim world , while completely retaining Vim ’s powerful moded editing style .
It ’s an emulation of Emacs using Vim : you get modeless editing inside moded editing .
If you ’re familiar with Vim , do n’t worry : Emacs emulation only operates while you ’re in Vim ’s Insert mode .
Vimacs is based on the keymaps of GNU Emacs 21 and XEmacs , so if you ’re familiar with them , you ’ll feel right at home in Vimacs .
< C - Space >
< C-w >
< C-y >
< C-x >
<C-f >
< C-x >
< Esc >
Why use Vimacs ?
Most ( if not all ) of the common key maps in Emacs are present in Vimacs , such asandto mark , kill and yank regions , to find a file , and 2 to split a window .
However , you can now take advantage of the incredible power of Vim ’s Normal and Command modes with a touch of thekey .
If you ’re a long - time Vim user , you retain Vi ’s powerful moded editing paradigm while gaining all the benefits of Emacs ’s modeless editing .
You have nothing to lose !
Since Vimacs only emulates Emacs when you ’re in Insert mode , you may not even notice that it ’s there .
Of course , after a while , you may find that the < C - a > and < C - e > keys become second nature to you , just as you ’re used to the h , j , k , and l keys for movement .
Some of the keys familiar to you in Insert mode have been changed , but you wo n’t take long to get used to Emacs ’s keys : just like Vim , Emacs ’s initially obscure key layout will reward you later on for its efficiency .
Emacs experts are just as fast as Vim experts in manipulating text , and as a bonus , you start becoming familiar with Emacs keybindings , which are gradually becoming more pervasive in Unix applications .
( Even Mac OS X supports some Emacs keys in its dialog boxes ! )
If you ’re an Emacs user , you ’ll find that Vimacs offers most of the comforts that you ’re used to in Emacs , with one significant advantage : blazing speed .
Vim is optimised for efficient text editing , whereas Emacs is optimised for extensibility , and sacrifices speed because of it .
In addition , I feel that Vim is much more straightforward to customise than Emacs , it has better documentation , and has better cross-platform support .
Of course , a major disadvantage of Vim compared to Emacs is that you do n’t have the enormous number of Emacs add - ons that have been integrated into the editor over the last few decades .
However , you may be surprised at how many of those add - ons are incorporated into Vim itself , for speed .
For example , dynamic abbreviation , parenthesis highlighting , and C indenting are all built into Vim .
Even complex add - ons , such as Emacs ’ Grand Unified Debugger , have been implemented in Vim via add - on scripts .
Vim does offer its own scripting language if you want to extend it , and if that is n’t enough , Vim 6.1 supports Perl , Python , Tcl , OLE , and Ruby as scripting languages : far more choices than just LISP !
< Esc >
The History of Vimacs
Speed .
Emacs does n’t even begin to approach Vim for raw speed ;
Vim can load and fully syntax - colour a file before Emacs even displays its window .
( Using gnuclient does n’t count ! )
One of the reasons for Emacs ’s slow speed compared to many other text editors is that it uses LISP for everything .
Now , using LISP for everything has many advantages , including making Emacs is completely extensible .
I ’m all for extensibility , but in this case , Emacs is too slow ( for me ) because of it .
In my eyes , you use an editor so much in the UNIX environment that you really want it to be as fast as possible .
Even though Emacs is extensible ++ , it ’s slow enough that I never load it for quick editing jobs .
Customisation is too hard .
Emacs exposed so much of its complexity and internals to you that it would befuddle your average user who just wanted to change a few settings .
I did n’t feel like learning LISP just to customise the editor a bit ; M-x customize made this much better , but it ’s still still unnecessarily hard to change something which is n’t in that list of options .
Try writing your own syntax file or colour scheme , for instance ; other editors usually make this much easier .
Of course , you can argue that learning the language of Emacs ( i.e. LISP ) leads to learning a powerful generic language which can be used in many places outside of Emacs , but hey , some of us want to get other work done , too .
Ultimately , the differences between the two editors come down to different design goals : Emacs is aimed at being everything for everyone , and Vim is aimed at being a pure text editor .
Vimacs opens up Vim to Emacs users ( and everyone else ) by allowing you to work with it without having to pressall the time , so you are n’t forced to work with Vi ’s moded editing style .
If you ’ve shied away from Vim because of its Vi-style editing , give Vimacs a shot !
In classic open - source spirit , Vimacs was created to “ scratch an itch ” .
I used to use Emacs all the time ; it ’s a fantastic tool for doing all kinds of things ( even text editing … ) .
However , it suffers from some problems which I feel are unsolvable without a drastic redesign :
Please do n’t get me wrong —
I ’m not flaming Emacs , and I ’m definitely not saying that it ’s a bad editor .
It ’s a fantastic editor ; it ’s arguably one of the most powerful pieces of software on the planet .
It ’s just not the kind of editor that I like to use on a daily basis .
I do n’t need most of its ninja - fu abilities , but some of them are incredibly helpful .
I ca n’t live without things like dynamic abbreviation ( the magical M -/ key ) , and having the editor understand the syntax of the file you ’re editing .
Once you ’re used to those features , life is simply miserable without them .
Vimacs was created because I was looking for an alternative to Emacs , and I found none .
I wanted a cross- platform editor , since I work a lot on both Win32 and UNIX systems , and I wanted it to be fast and easy to customise , yet still have most of the power that Emacs gave me when I was editing text files , or coding .
I tried every single editor I found on Freshmeat and Ibiblio , but I still could n’t find one that I liked .
Vim would have been perfect , but I could never get used to the moded style of editing .
Pressing < Esc > all the time drove me nuts .
( I ’m not saying that moded editing sucks , mind you , I ’m just saying that I personally hated being forced into that kind of editing style . )
After toying around with Vim ’s scripting language , I decided to do something to end my misery , and I figured that Vim ’s scripting capabilities were powerful enough that it could be used to emulate Emacs quite well .
I would n’t be able to emulate everything , of course , but I ’d be able to emulate Emacs well enough that it ’d have all the key bindings that I was used to .
So , Vimacs was born .
Vim by itself is a powerful editor ; I loved everything about it except for the moded editing paradigm .
Vimacs is simply something which makes
Vim more accessible to the non-Vi crowd , and it does so in a way which impacts existing Vim users in a very small way .
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission hosts long - awaited network management hearings this week , pitting Canada ’s telecom and cable companies against a broad range of consumer , creator , and technology groups in a fight that may help clarify whether Canada has – or should have – net neutrality laws .
The telecom and cable companies will likely maintain that managing their networks , which may include using " deep packet inspection " to identify subscriber activity and limiting available bandwidth for certain applications ( a practice known as throttling ) , is essential to ensure optimal access for all subscribers .
Consumer associations , independent Internet service providers ( ISPs ) , broadcasters , creator groups , and technology companies are likely to warn against network management practices that raise competition , privacy , and consumer rights concerns .
My weekly technology law column ( Toronto Star version , homepage version ) notes that as the Commission weighs the various claims , it would do well to consider the testimony it heard just a few months ago during the February new media hearings .
The issue at play at those hearings was whether ISPs should face a levy to fund new media or be required to prioritize Canadian content ( the CRTC declined to do both in its decision released last month ) .
Interestingly , the same telecom and cable companies that will now argue that managing their networks is essential , offered a somewhat different take when confronted with the prospect of doing so in the name of supporting Canadian content .
For example , Shaw Communications 's network management submission states " traffic management is necessary to ensure that Shaw 's customers continue to have access to fast , reliable and affordable service . "
It adds the " traffic shaping process uses deep packet inspection ( DPI ) technology to identify packets that are associated with P2P file - sharing applications and to slow those packets down , limiting the amount of available capacity P2P traffic consumes . "
Yet when CEO Jim Shaw was asked about the prospect of identifying traffic during the new media hearings , he told the Commission , " we can only tell you how many bits are coming in or out .
We do n't know what kind of bit it is .
It could be anything from an e-mail to a porno .
We do n't know that .
We spend no time trying to figure out what bits are going to your house .
We just do n't know . "
The same inconsistencies arise within the context of the technological capability of discriminating against certain content .
While the telecom and cable companies will argue their network management practices do not target specific content , when asked about the issue during the new media hearings , an expert witness for MTS Allstream told the CRTC " now it does happen on some basis .
It happens , for instance , under the purview of intelligence agencies quietly .
There are things that go on ; however , the consumers have n't been directly told ‘ We are going to start sniffing your packets . ' "
In fact , when net neutrality supporters point to the need for an " open Internet " that treats content and applications in an equal manner , they might remind the CRTC that they are not alone in making that case .
During the new media hearings , Rogers Communications told the Commission " there is no walled garden , there is no preferred content , it 's just a pipe .
We are moving to a big , wide - open pipe , " while the same MTS Allstream expert , perhaps foreshadowing the outcome of the network management hearings , acknowledged " when a commercial interest attempts to violate the principle of openness , as it is defined by the open culture movement , there tends to be a very dramatic and forceful rebuking . "
Few things are as tasty and satisfying a good piece of beef jerky .
Whether you ’re into spicy , black pepper or teriyaki flavored , one thing that everyone can agree on is that store - bought jerky is really expensive .
What ’s a road tripper to do without this staple of the American highway ?
The answer : Make your own .
Most people think that to make proper beef jerky you have to buy a big , fancy and expensive food dehydrator .
But man has been drying meat without kitchen gadgets for thousands and thousands of years , so if your ancestors could do it , so can you .
Oven Method
Although it ’s possible to make great beef jerky by simply hanging your meat in the sun , the easiest method for making it is using an appliance you already have : your home oven .
The recipes for the marinade might change , but the cooking method is the same .
Ingredients :
2 pounds top round beef
2/3 cup light soy or tamari sauce
1/4 cup regular cola
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons freshly cracked black pepper
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
Cotton butcher ’s string
First thing you want to do is stick your meat in the freezer to chill while you work on the marinade .
This will make the meat easier to slice into thin strips later .
Next combine all the ingredients except the butcher ’s string in a bowl and mix well .
Taste it .
If you like your jerky spicier , add more pepper or pepper flakes .
If you like it smokier you can add liquid smoke or even a bit of your favorite BBQ sauce .
If you ’re wondering what the cola is for , it will help break down the fibers of the meat and make your jerky more tender .
It ’s a great trick to try on steak marinades as well , just do n’t over marinate your meat or it will be mushy .
Next , remove the meat from the freezer .
It should be firm but not frozen ( 20 to 30 minutes is all it takes ) .
Now take your longest , sharpest knife and cut the meat into long , thin strips .
The thinner they are the faster they will dry .
( Just keep in mind that they will also marinate faster . )
Put your meat in the bowl with the mixture , combine thoroughly and cover with plastic wrap .
Set the bowl in the fridge for three to four hours .
In the meantime you ’ll want to prepare your oven .
Remove all but the bottom shelf and cover it with foil to catch the drippings from the meat .
Now take your string and tie it around one end of your strips of meat and then tie the other end of the string to the rungs of your top rack ( which you ’ve removed ) .
Repeat with the other strips of meat making sure that none of them touch .
Now carefully slide your rack into the top most slot in your oven .
Set the oven temp to warm or to the lowest setting and close the door most of the way .
You ’ll want to leave it slightly ajar to let out any damp air .
After six to 10 hours , depending on your local humidity , you should have a heap of delicious jerky .
Make sure that it is dry and hard but not overly brittle .
Store it in an airtight container or freeze it if you do n't think you ’re going to eat it in the first few weeks .
Biltong
Dried beef is not a uniquely American creation .
The South Africans have been making a version of jerky for hundreds of years , called biltong .
Although it is traditionally dried out in a special “ biltong box ” made of wood and and heated using a light bulb , you can make it every bit as well using the oven method above .
Ingredents :
2 pounds bottom round beef
1 1/2 cups rock salt
1/4 cup coarsely ground black pepper
1/4 cup coarsely ground coriander seed
2 cups cider vinegar
The point of American jerky is to get it as thin as possible .
Biltong is exactly the opposite .
Cut your bottom round into 1 /2 inch thick slices and then toss with the rock salt and refrigerate for about an hour .
The longer it sits in the salt , the saltier it will be .
Remove the meat from the salt and scrape it off with the back of a knife .
Next rinse the meat slices in the cider vinegar and then season each piece with the mixture of coriander seed and black pepper pressing it into the meat slightly if it does n’t stick .
Now tie off the pieces to your oven rack as before , and dry .
Because biltong is much thicker , drying time may be as long as 12 hours .
Remove the meat when it is dry and firm but with a bit of give .
Because biltong has more moisture , I recommend storing it wrapped in wax paper in the refrigerator .
Pemmican
What do you do with a batch of homemade jerky that might not have turned out so great ?
Pemmican !
Pemmican is a traditional Northwestern food made from ground up jerky , suet ( that ’s rendered beef fat ) and dried fruit .
Simply grind your jerky in a meat grinder or food processor and combine with the suet .
The ratio of meat to suet should be about three to one .
I like to add a bit of dried cherries and even some roasted salted cashews .
Then I press them into bars using my hands and wrap them in wax paper .
It ’s some truly satisfying trail food .
Picking Your Ingredients
Keep in mind that the flavor of your jerky will depend on the quality of your ingredients .
I like to use beef from mature , properly raised cows .
Try to find a small independent butcher that gets good beef , preferably from local ranchers .
Alternatively , you can ask around at work and see if anyone you know is a hunter with a glut of venison .
Although venison steak is n’t for everyone , your venison jerky will be very popular !

In an impromptu news conference in the Jordanian capital , Amman , on 12 July , Fatah Secretary - General Farouk Kaddumi revealed that Palestinian Authority ( PA ) leader Mahmoud Abbas and former Gaza strong man Muhammed Dahlan conspired to murder Yasser Arafat in connivance with Israel and the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .
Kaddumi disclosed that Arafat had confided to him the transcript of a secret meeting involving Abbas , Dahlan , US intelligence officials as well as former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon .
The meeting allegedly took place in March 22 , 2004 .
According to the document , whose authenticity could n’t be verified independently , Sharon told Abbas and Dahlan during the meeting that Arafat should be killed by way of poisoning .
The transcript showed that Abbas protested , saying that murdering Arafat could complicate things and cause serious difficulties .
The Arabic version of the transcript showed Sharon saying the following to Abbas and Dahlan : ' To start with , we should kill all the military and political leaders of Hamas , Jihad , al - Aqsa Brigades and the Popular Front in order to create chaos within their ranks which would make it easier for you to finish them off . '
Sharon then allegedly responded to a suggestion by Dahlan to first abide by a ' period of calm ' by saying :
' As long as Arafat is still sitting in the Muqata 'a in Ramallah , you will definitely fail , because this cunning fox will surprise you all , as he has done in the past , because he knows exactly what you want to do and he will work to make it fail . '
Sharon then added the following : ' The first step therefore should be to poison Arafat and to kill him .
I do n't want to send him into exile unless there are guarantees from the country that will take him to place him under house arrest ...'
Later on in the transcript , Sharon allegedly mentions the names of senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders to be assassinated , including Abdel Aziz Rantisi , who was murdered by Israel on April 17 , 2004 .
The document presented by Kaddumi does n’t spell out the ultimate Israeli - American goal behind the liquidation of Arafat and the top leaders of the resistance .
However , it is probably safe to deduce that endgame envisaged behind the alleged conspiracy was the creation of a collaborationist Palestinian regime whose central mission and raison d’etre would be to bully the Palestinian masses into accepting a “ peace deal ” with Israel that would allow the latter to impose its will and conditions on the Palestinians .
Kaddumi is an important figure in Fatah , and it is difficult to dismiss his revelations as hallucinations as his opponents have done .
Non the less , it is hard to indict Abbas based on these revelations .
However , it is also difficult to grant him a certificate of innocence , because Abbas is not beyond suspicion and is certainly not an impeccable figure .
I remember I spoke with Sakhr Habash , a close confidante of Yasser Arafat , two days before the latter ’s death , who told me that he was 100 % sure that “ they killed him . ”
I pressed him to identify the killers , the people he was referring to .
He said “ you know them , these people around him , the agents of Israel . ”
Dahlan
While one is prompted to speak cautiously about Abbas ’s alleged role in poisoning Arafat , that is if indeed the late Palestinian leader died of poisoning , one feels freer and more confident to speak about Dahlan ’s not - so - secret treacherous dealings with the Israelis and the Americans .
A few years ago , I remember I listened to a secret audio - taped briefing by Dahlan to some of his supporters at the al - Hurriya Radio in Gaza .
In the briefing , Dahlan was heard swearing to make Hamas regret the day it decided to take part in the elections of 2006 .
“ I will make them eat .. expletive .. , and if any Fatah guy dares participate in the Hamas government , I will know how to deal with him . ”
Dahlan made more horrifying remarks which one would prefer not mentioning because of their poor taste .
In 2008 , the American magazine “ Vanity Fair ” published an extensive investigative report titled “ How the Bush Administration Lied to Congress and Armed Fatah to Provoke Palestinian Civil War Aiming to overthrow Hamas . ”
The report pointed out that the White House tried to organize the armed overthrow of the Hamas - led government after the Islamic liberation group swept Palestinian elections in 2006 .
Obviously , Dahlan was the would - be coup leader whose job was to destroy Hamas , arrest or kill its leaders in collaboration with Israel .
According to the report , the Bush administration lied to Congress and boosted military support for Fatah in the aim of provoking a Palestinian civil war they thought Hamas would lose .
Vanity Fair dubbed the episode “ Iran Contra 2 ” - a reference to the Reagan administration ’s funding of the Nicaraguan Contras by covertly selling arms to Iran .
David Wurmser , a Bush administration official , was quoted in the report as saying hat he believed that “ Hamas ’s seizure of power in Gaza last year might have likely been a preemptive measure against the anticipated US - backed coup . ”
In light , there is overwhelming evidence that Dahlan brazenly collaborated with the Israeli and American intelligence services against his own people just as it is amply clear that the current regime in Ramallah is collaborating , coordinating and conspiring with Israel to liquidate the resistance in the West Bank .
True , Abbas might argue that he played no part in plotting to murder Yasser Arafat .
However , he and his regime in Ramallah ca n’t deny the fact that their security agencies , now trained and armed under the supervision of the American intelligence officer Keith Dayton , have been closely collaborating with Israel for the purpose of eradicating all resistance activists in the West Bank .
Indeed , the recent killings in Qalqilya recently was a damning proof , if a proof were needed , that the PA regime is just another layer of the Israeli occupation .
This , coupled with the unmitigated inquisition of hounding , repression , arrest , dismissal from jobs , seizure and closure of institutions as well as the rampancy of torture which in many instances lead to cruel death demonstrates that the PA is working in concert with Israel to harm and undermine national Palestinian interests .
This alone , and irrespective of who poisoned Arafat , is sufficient to indict the present leadership in Ramallah for collaboration with Israel and treason .

What will Jack and Jill do while their parents go to Europe ...
What will Jack and Jill do while their parents go to Europe this summer ?
The 5 fun ways the kids are already planning to spend their summer in your penthouse and expense account …
Well , let ’s cut to the chase , Jack and Jill are horny , thoroughly corrupted by the current cultural domain ( or the lack of one ) and have been waiting lustfully for the opportunity to get their hands on your suite .
You probably think the kids are all just going to watch TV , go camping and have well tamed lunch parties .
Loser - let ’s get to the truth , and find out what the kids have got planned as soon as your ass is flying over Charles de Gaulle Airport .
First fun activity Jack and Jill are planning to do -
1/ Bring all their cool friends from the Jane st Hotel and convince them them doing ‘ blow ’ in the lavatory at Jane st is hardly as much fun as doing long ‘ fun ’ lines on ‘ daddy ’s ’ prized desk with sweeping views of Central Park .
2/ Finally find the courage to invite the ‘ nerd ’ from facebook over for a tantalizing session of ‘ let ’s catch up on summer homework . ’
Of course there will be a revised definition of what ‘ homework ’ actually means …
3/ Jack and Jill this summer for two long weeks will host their own reality show out of your apartment called - “ Jack and Jill get dirty on Park Avenue . ’
Special guest hosts may include Adrien Field and Devorah Rose , assuming you ’re photogenic enough …
Expect to see disgruntled but ( nearly ) good looking pre- adolescents assuaging their pedigree , their plight into investment banking and high ranking modeling careers , and how they manage to be brilliant and make it to a guest of a guest picture series on a daily basis ( yes we know it ’s a hard slog - but these kids have tenacity )
4 / Will invite a prominent personality from the Upper East Side – someone like Kristian LaLiberte where they will exchange phone numbers and think of fun things to say to each other and how to concoct clever ways to becoming an uber celebrity like Kristian at only the tender age of seventeen .
We think Kristian will manage to inspire the kids … .
5/ Invite prominent editors like us ( yes we are open for bribes ) to come and write feature length stories about their lives as ‘ angst but photogenic pre adolescents destined to do good things , host reality shows alongside Kristian , and eventually run their own fantastic blog like us .
This in short are the top things we are certain to see come to fruition now that mom and dad are in Marthas Vineyard , on their trial separation or quick jaunt to the Hamptons .
After all ‘ kids will be kids ’ and Jack and Jill are very savvy kids to be sure …

The " Dilophosaurus " in the film had a retractable frill around its neck and was able to spit poison , aiming for the eyes to blind and paralyze its prey .
While there is no evidence to support this representation , in the film it 's stated when the group is on the tour and approach the holding facility of the Dilophosaurus , the announcer states that recently , they discovered that the venom and the frill were part of what it was capable of .
Meaning , clearly the " facts " were just simply exaggerated for the film , since they came upon discovering this through bringing it to life , when , outside of the film , of course that never happened .
It was probably added for dramatic effect for the later scene when Dennis would encounter the dinosaur .

He ’s a war hero who became a media mogul , celebrity pitchman , pop icon and philanthropist .
He ’s so famous he was given his own ZIP Code , 20252 , to handle the fan mail .
He is 65 years old but has no intention of retiring .
In fact , he looks fitter than ever .
Working outdoors with a shovel will do that .
Smokey Bear was born in August 1944 , sired by a committee of ad men and government bureaucrats hoping to safeguard a key war material : wood .
Smokey today remains the face of the longest - running public service campaign in U.S. history -- a simple message delivered by an anthropomorphic bear .
But Smokey ’s story is anything but simple .
His uncompromising stance -- “ Only you can prevent forest fires ” -- helped alter the landscape by reinforcing the idea that fire was an enemy that should be eliminated , that the price to be paid for living in the path of wildfire was vigilance and will .
Smokey ’s critics say decades of fire suppression helped create forests unnaturally thick with fuel , setting the stage for the infernos that march across the West every year .
A sign on forestry professor Ron Wakimoto ’s office door at the University of Montana sums up this thinking : “ Smokey is dead -- prescribe forest fires . ”
“ The forest conditions we have today are directly the result of that campaign , ” said Wakimoto , a wildfire policy expert who has testified before Congress .
“ Historically , it ’s done its damage by creating a very flammable forest . ”
A few years ago , Smokey ’s message was tweaked .
“ Only you can prevent wildfires ” makes a subtle distinction intended to reinforce that there are bad fires ( intentionally or accidentally set ) and fires that promote healthy , less - combustible forests .
Still , Smokey seems a slightly out - of - step missionary in the ever - evolving politics of fire in the West .
His message avoids the complex social issues surrounding wildfire .
What should be allowed to burn and what should be burned on purpose ?
If we choose to live in fire country , who should protect us and at what cost ?
“ I ’m not an ad man , ” Wakimoto said .
“ With all the different messages that should be conveyed , I ca n’t see Smokey laying out something that nuanced . ”
Bring this up with one of Smokey ’s legion of adoring fans -- baby boomers who see him as an emblem of a wholesome bygone era -- and you risk getting punched in the snout .
And please do n’t call him Smokey the Bear , because the big fella has no middle name .
The protectiveness afforded Smokey begins with the government .
His image is tightly controlled .
Unauthorized use violates federal law ( 88 Stat. 244 ; 31 U.S.C. 488a ; 488b-6 ; 18 U.S.C. 711 , 711a ) .
Those who tread on the government ’s trademark risk a visit from the FBI and a $ 150,000 fine .
But most cases are solved with a stern letter from the company contracted to license Smokey ’s image .
“ We take it very seriously , ” said Libby Kavoulakis , who oversees Smokey for the Metis Group , a marketing firm in Washington , D.C. “ It ’s ridiculous what you see people do with Smokey .
There ’s always someone out there who has Smokey with a joint .
Or different signs in bars in which he is encouraging cigarette smoking .
. . .
Rude actions in the forest -- Smokey going to the bathroom .
It was on a greeting card .
We stopped that one too . ”
Smokey Bear is a $ 1 - million - a - year - plus industry .
About 100 manufacturers slap Smokey ’s image on apparel and tchotchkes , home furnishings and jewelry .
A 6 - foot , three - dimensional fiberglass figure with steel frame from an Idaho company will set you back $ 3,500 .
Licensing fees , which range from 5 % to 10 % , support fire - prevention education .
Smokey works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and does n’t shill for anyone .
His appearance in 1998 at several car shows as part of a deal between Subaru and a nonprofit foundation that raises money for the Forest Service prompted a federal investigation and criticism in Congress .
Subaru dropped out .
“ If someone wants to make candles or gas - fired lanterns , we ’re going to say no , ” Kavoulakis said .
“ Certain types of apparel like halters and underwear are out too . ”
Entrepreneur Robin
Sykes recalls the moment inspiration hit her husband , Bill , like a pine cone to the head .
It was 1980 , and the couple were driving to Montana past miles and miles of forest blackened by wildfire .
“ We were talking about how you have all these idiots throwing cigarettes out the window , ” Sykes said .
“ And my husband says : ‘ I got an idea : Smokey Bear antenna balls ! ’ ”
With those words , their company , Smokey Signals , was born .
“ My husband figured if he could sell a million Smokey antenna balls for a dollar apiece , he could retire , ” she said .
Did it work ?
“ Hell , no ! ”
Nevertheless , their Northern California business has become one of the largest distributors of Smokey Bear products .
From their home in Wildwood , a tiny community in Trinity County about halfway between Knob and Peanut , the couple design new items every year -- binoculars and business - card holders , watches and whistles .
They outsource much of the manufacturing to China and keep all 120 catalog items in 14 large storage containers on their property .
They ’ve had to knock down rumors that the containers are used to cultivate marijuana .
“ It pays our bills , ” Robin Sykes said .
“ You have to be in this for the love of the program and not the money .
Sometimes we work seven days a week . ”
Robin , 55 , was once a clerk for the Forest Service .
Bill , 60 , owned a liquor store in Southern California before moving north .
They are among the generation that reveres Smokey as an American icon , a patriot .
Bill used to don a Smokey costume at public events .
Smokey Signals is one of only three companies authorized to manufacture and sell the Smokey Bear costume .
It comes with washable “ fur , ” Smokey - size jeans , a cooling vest with reusable gel packs and an optional battery - operated fan built into the plastic head .
The costume can be sold only to government agencies or approved groups that agree to follow the explicit rules spelled out in the “ Smokey Bear Guidelines ” at www.smokeybear.com:
DO NOT SPEAK during appearances .
Appear dignified and friendly .
Avoid clowning and horseplay .
Do not use alcohol or illicit drugs prior to and during the Smokey Bear appearance .
Express sincerity and interest in the appearance by moving paws , head and legs .
Is the zipper out of sight ?
Is the belt firmly fastened to the pants ?
Is the fur brushed generously ?
The costumed bear should not force itself on anyone .
Do not walk rapidly toward small children .
“ I ’ve heard him cry inside that costume , ” Robin Sykes said of her husband .
“ We were at kids ’ day at the county fair in Humboldt and there was this little girl who just fell in love with Smokey .
She cried .
He cried .
Then I cried and her parents cried . ”
The couple routinely get inquiries about selling the business .
They ’d like to retire but ca n’t let go .
“ Whoever takes this over needs to understand what this is all about .
This is not about selling trinkets .
It ’s about Smokey ’s message , ” Robin said .
“ This is personal for us .
It ’s our baby . ”
The public ’s relationship with wildfire has changed dramatically through the years .
Government fire - prevention ad campaigns date back more than a century .
Early efforts were sporadic and unimaginative and failed to penetrate the public consciousness .
The shelling of an oil field near Santa Barbara by a Japanese submarine in 1942 got people ’s attention .
Just inland was nearly 2 million acres of the Los Padres National Forest .
The nation ’s war machine relied on wood for everything from rifle stocks to ships .
Manpower to fight forest fires was scarce .
The first wartime fire - prevention ads included fiendish caricatures of Hitler and Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo with the admonition , “ Our Carelessness , Their Secret Weapon . ”
Next up was Bambi , star of the 1942 hit movie , on loan from Walt Disney for a year .
A creative team working under the auspices of the Wartime Advertising Council , today ’s Ad Council , considered a number of forest animals to replace Bambi .
A prototype of a poster featuring a squirrel was drawn , then withdrawn .
Who would believe a squirrel could fight a forest fire ?
But a big bear with a shovel ?
Absolutely .
Albert Staehle , a popular commercial illustrator and magazine cover artist , drew the first bear .
There was one problem :
He was naked .
Staehle was told to give the bear pants , a hat and a name : Smokey .
What began as war propaganda transitioned easily to the postwar era as the West boomed , subdivisions sprouted in fire country and television brought Smokey ’s message into the nation ’s living rooms .
But can a retirement - age icon stay relevant in today ’s frenetic media landscape ?
Last year , Smokey was one of 26 advertising characters nominated for induction into the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame .
When the public online vote was tallied , the Geico Caveman and the Serta Sheep got in .
Smokey was snubbed .
Hilary Hamer ’s job is to breathe new life into Smokey .
She is a senior vice president with the global advertising and marketing firm DraftFCB , which has handled the Smokey account pro bono from its Southern California office since the beginning .
“ It ’s the account I ’m most proud of , ” said Hamer , 47 , who also works on campaigns for Taco Bell and Del Monte pet products .
“ When I tell people outside the office I work with Smokey Bear , they get very excited and want to know all about it . ”
She acknowledges that keeping in vogue a character that dates to the Roosevelt administration is challenging , particularly among the 25 - to 34 - year - olds who cause the majority of non-natural fires .
Hamer and her team spent two years developing Smokey ’s latest campaign , which began airing last month .
Smokey , who looks as if he ’s been spending a lot of time in the gym , shape - shifts into human form in the commercials .
He admonishes a slacker to snuff out his campfire in one spot ; in another , Smokey calls out a fool who had tossed his cigarette into the brush .
The result is a serious message wrapped in the knowing banter of a light beer commercial .
“ We wanted to bring him into the pop culture of today , ” Hamer said .
“ Even though it ’s his 65th birthday , we do n’t want people to think of him as a 65 - year - old bear .
We want him to be seen as a very cool bear . ”

A new study finds Amazon deforestation fails to sustain long - term economic growth for rural populations .
The findings come as development interests in Brazil push for government support to bolster infrastructure projects and agricultural expansion in the world ’s largest rainforest .
Deforestation generates short - term benefits but fails to increase affluence and quality of life in the long - run , reports a new study based an analysis of forest clearing in 286 municipalities across the Brazilian Amazon .
The research , published in Friday ’s issue of the journal Science , casts doubt on the argument that deforestation is a critical step towards development and suggests that mechanisms to compensate communities for keeping forests standing may be a better approach to improving human welfare , while simultaneously sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem services , in rainforest areas .
Rainforest and soy in the Brazilian Amazon .
To reach this conclusion , Ana Rodrigues , a researcher formerly with University of Cambridge and currently at the Centre of Functional and Evolutionary Ecology in France , and colleagues used the United Nations Development Program ’s Human Development Index , a metric that combines life expectancy , literacy , and standard of living , to assess the welfare of 286 municipalities with varying degrees of deforestation .
They found that relative welfare increases as deforestation begins , but then declines as the frontier progresses on to other areas , leaving pre- and post - deforestation levels of human development statistically equal .
In other words , the boom - and - bust cycle generates few lasting benefits for local permanent populations .
Most gains accrue to a population of migrants — loggers , ranchers , speculators , land squatters , miners , and farmers — that move with the frontier as resources are exhausted and land is degraded .
“ The Amazon is globally recognized for its unparalleled natural value , but it is also a very poor region .
It is generally assumed that replacing the forest with crops and pastureland is the best approach for fulfilling the region ’s legitimate aspirations to development , ” Rodrigues explained .
“ This study tested that assumption .
We found although the deforestation frontier does bring initial improvements in income , life expectancy , and literacy , such gains are not sustained . ”
Circles from left to right correspond classes of deforestation defined by the authors ( A=low deforestation extent and activity ; D=very active deforestation activity and 40 - 60 % deforestation extent ; G=inactive deforestation activity and less than 10 percent forest cover .
Circles indicate median values ; bars indicate first and third quartiles ; horizontal dashed line indicates the median across all Brazilian municipalities .
Charts adapted from Rodriquez et al. 2009 .

“ The ‘ boom ’ in development that deforestation brings to these areas is clear , but our data show that in the long run these benefits are not sustained .
Along with environmental concerns , this is another good reason to restrict further deforestation in the Amazon , ” added co-author Rob Ewers from Imperial College London .
“ However , in areas that are currently being deforested , the process needs to be better managed to ensure that for local people boom is n’t necessarily followed by ‘ bust ’ . ”
But slowing deforestation is will not be easy .
Those who benefit most from short - term exploitation — large - scale ranchers , industrial logging , agricultural giants , and absentee land barons — have considerable political clout in Brazil and have lately been pushing measures that will drive more Amazon deforestation , including a bill ( HB 458 ) passed by the Senate last week that will grant legal title to 600,000 square kilometers of illegally occupied Amazon rainforest land .
The bill favors industrial developers over small landholders , allowing those controlling 400 - 1500 ha to sell their holdings after three years , but requiring farmers with smaller plots to wait 10 years to sell .
Brazil has also committed to spend upwards of $ 40 billion on new infrastructure projects — including dams , ports , and road improvement — in the Amazon to support development in the region .
For all their promise , payments - for - ecosystem - services schemes will only be effective where there is the institutional capacity to deliver benefits to local people .
Presently , the lack of the governance in frontier regions is a hindrance to slowing deforestation .
But this may be is changing .
While critics says HB 458 favors big industry and may drive new deforestation , the bill will “ regularize ” land holdings , potentially improving land tenure systems .
While this political pressure remains a challenge , the authors suggest a solution may lie in a multifaceted approach that includes both boosting returns on already deforested lands and limiting further deforestation .
“ A combined approach might include supporting the better use of areas that have already been deforested ( e.g. , via the intensification of ranching and agriculture ) alongside restricting further deforestation [ e.g. , through protected areas and appropriate land use zoning ] and promoting reforestation in degraded landscapes ; direct incentives to encourage forest - based livelihoods based on the sustainable harvest of timber and nontimber forest products , within and beyond forest concessions ; and targeted policies to improve literacy , health , and land tenure security , ” they write .
The authors argue that emerging payments - for - ecosystem - services schemes could become a key mechanism for delivering benefits to local populations as an incentive for preserving forests as viable and productive ecosystems .
A handful of ecosystem services programs are already being implemented in the Brazilian Amazon , including Bolsa Floresta in the state of Amazonas , an initiative that offers payment and access to education and healthcare to families that voluntary agree to reduce deforestation .
Such programs would benefit from a proposed climate change mitigation mechanism , known as reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation ( REDD ) , currently under discussion for the next international climate treaty , which will be hammered out this December at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen .
REDD would pay tropical countries to keep their forests standing .
Click image to enlarge Since 2003 Brazil has set aside 523,592 square kilometers of protected areas , accounting for 74 percent of the total land area protected worldwide during that period .
“ New financial mechanisms and policies are paving the way for more sustained development trajectories and creating the conditions in which the largest tropical forest in the world can be recognized as more valuable standing than felled , ” the authors conclude .
Brazil houses more than 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest , the world ’s largest tropical forest .
Over the past 30 years nearly one - fifth of the forest area have been cleared , largely for agriculture and cattle pasture .
Scientists estimate the forest may be home to one quarter of the world ’s land - based plant and animal species as well as the largest population of indigenous people still living in traditional ways .
Some researchers fear that continued clearing , together with increased incidence and severity of drought and fire due to climate change , could result in a large scale die - off of the Amazon by the end of the century .

Brazil ’s plan to save the Amazon rainforest
( 06/02/2009 ) Accounting for roughly half of tropical deforestation between 2000 and 2005 , Brazil is the most important supply - side player when it comes to developing a climate framework that includes reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( REDD ) .
But Brazil ’s position on REDD contrasts with proposals put forth by other tropical forest countries , including the Coalition for Rainforest Nations , a negotiating block of 15 countries .
Instead of advocating a market - based approach to REDD , where credits generated from forest conservation would be traded between countries , Brazil is calling for a giant fund financed with donations from industrialized nations .
Contributors would not be eligible for carbon credits that could be used to meet emission reduction obligations under a binding climate treaty .

An industry - led moratorium on soy plantings on recently deforested rainforest land continues to show success in the Brazilian Amazon , reports a study released Tuesday by environmental groups and Abiove , the soy industry group that formed the initiative and represents about 90 percent of Brazil ’s soy crush .
The satellite - based study showed that only 12 of 630 sample areas ( 1,389 of 157,896 hectares ) deforested since July 2006 — the date the moratorium took effect — were planted with soy .
37,000 sq km of Amazon rainforest destroyed or damaged in 2008
( 03/19/2009 ) Logging and fires damaged nearly 25,000 square kilometers ( 9,650 square miles ) of Amazon rainforest in the August 2007 - July 2008 period , an increase of 67 percent over the prior year period , according to a new mapping system developed by Brazil ’s National Institute for Space Research ( INPE ) .
The damage comes on top of the nearly 12,000 sq km ( 4,600 sq mi ) of rainforest that was cleared during the year .
Pushghar , Afghanistan
I confess , I find it hard to come to Afghanistan and not ask :
Why are we here ?
Who cares about the Taliban ?
Al Qaeda is gone .
And if its leaders come back , well , that ’s why God created cruise missiles .
But every time I start writing that column , something stills my hand .
This week it was something very powerful .
I watched Greg Mortenson , the famed author of “ Three Cups of Tea , ” open one of his schools for girls in this remote Afghan village in the Hindu Kush mountains .
I must say , after witnessing the delight in the faces of those little Afghan girls crowded three to a desk waiting to learn , I found it very hard to write , “ Let ’s just get out of here . ”
Indeed , Mortenson ’s efforts remind us what the essence of the “ war on terrorism ” is about .
It ’s about the war of ideas within Islam  a war between religious zealots who glorify martyrdom and want to keep Islam untouched by modernity and isolated from other faiths , with its women disempowered , and those who want to embrace modernity , open Islam to new ideas and empower Muslim women as much as men .
America ’s invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were , in part , an effort to create the space for the Muslim progressives to fight and win so that the real engine of change , something that takes nine months and 21 years to produce  a new generation  can be educated and raised differently .
Which is why it was no accident that Adm .
Mike Mullen , the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  spent half a day in order to reach Mortenson ’s newest school and cut the ribbon .
Getting there was fun .
Our Chinook helicopter threaded its way between mountain peaks , from Kabul up through the Panjshir Valley , before landing in a cloud of dust at the village of Pushghar .
Imagine if someone put a new , one - story school on the moon , and you ’ll appreciate the rocky desolateness of this landscape .

A queen and worker Argentine ant have many , many relatives
A single mega-colony of ants has colonised much of the world , scientists have discovered .
Argentine ants living in vast numbers across Europe , the US and Japan belong to the same inter-related colony , and will refuse to fight one another .
The colony may be the largest of its type ever known for any insect species , and could rival humans in the scale of its world domination .
What 's more , people are unwittingly helping the mega - colony stick together .
Argentine ants ( Linepithema humile ) were once native to South America .
But people have unintentionally introduced the ants to all continents except Antarctica .
These introduced Argentine ants are renowned for forming large colonies , and for becoming a significant pest , attacking native animals and crops .
In Europe , one vast colony of Argentine ants is thought to stretch for 6,000 km ( 3,700 miles ) along the Mediterranean coast , while another in the US , known as the " Californian large " , extends over 900 km ( 560 miles ) along the coast of California .
A third huge colony exists on the west coast of Japan .
The enormous extent of this population is paralleled only by human society
Entomologists reveal the ant colony 's true size
While ants are usually highly territorial , those living within each super - colony are tolerant of one another , even if they live tens or hundreds of kilometres apart .
Each super - colony , however , was thought to be quite distinct .
But it now appears that billions of Argentine ants around the world all actually belong to one single global mega-colony .
Researchers in Japan and Spain led by Eiriki Sunamura of the University of Tokyo found that Argentine ants living in Europe , Japan and California shared a strikingly similar chemical profile of hydrocarbons on their cuticles .
But further experiments revealed the true extent of the insects ' global ambition .
The team selected wild ants from the main European super - colony , from another smaller one called the Catalonian super - colony which lives on the Iberian coast , the Californian super - colony and from the super - colony in west Japan , as well as another in Kobe , Japan .
They then matched up the ants in a series of one - on - one tests to see how aggressive individuals from different colonies would be to one another .
Ants from the smaller super - colonies were always aggressive to one another .
So ants from the west coast of Japan fought their rivals from Kobe , while ants from the European super - colony did n't get on with those from the Iberian colony .
One big family
But whenever ants from the main European and Californian super - colonies and those from the largest colony in Japan came into contact , they acted as if they were old friends .
These ants rubbed antennae with one another and never became aggressive or tried to avoid one another .
In short , they acted as if they all belonged to the same colony , despite living on different continents separated by vast oceans .
The most plausible explanation is that ants from these three super - colonies are indeed family , and are all genetically related , say the researchers .
When they come into contact , they recognise each other by the chemical composition of their cuticles .
" The enormous extent of this population is paralleled only by human society , " the researchers write in the journal Insect Sociaux , in which they report their findings .
However , the irony is that it is us who likely created the ant mega- colony by initially transporting the insects around the world , and by continually introducing ants from the three continents to each other , ensuring the mega - colony continues to mingle .
" Humans created this great non-aggressive ant population , " the researchers write .

In an article discussing competition between Acer And Asustek , DigiTimes sheds some light on the launch date of the first Acer Android Phone which is rumored to be called the A1 , saying it will launch in November .
DigiTimes has a hit - or - miss record with rumore but the November timing provided by their source would certainly fall into the frame of what Acer officials themselves have announded – 4th Quarter 2009 launch .
Acer is expected to launch 9 smartphones in 2009 , one of them being the Acer A1 .
Considering Acer has already unveiled phones this year called the F1 and L1 I would not be surprised in the least if the Acer A1 name is accurate – it follows the naming convention and gives an “ A for Android ” branding .
The article also contrasts the success and growth of Acer ’s mobile strategy to that of Asustek .
Apparently Asustek approached the adoption of 3G improperly and was forced to partner up with a 3rd party – Garmin – to form Garmin - ASUS .
The Garmin - ASUS Nuvifones have faced delays and the outlook has n’t been too rosey .
Meanwhile , Acer aquired E - Ten information systems which has panned out much better .
Analysts are suggesting Acer could overtake Asustek in smartphone marketshare this year .
If they do it with Android phones , I ’m all for it !
Garmin - ASUS also has an Android Phone on the way but the way things are going , it does n’t seem like it will ever reach the market .

Conrad ’s novella takes place one night on a boat by the Thames , a mesmerising tale of one man ’s search for another .
Published in 1899 , it sprang from his experience in the Congo nine years before .
What became Heart of Darkness begins then , with Conrad noting the rapacious , violent nature of ivory - trading and colonialism .
In July 1890 he spent day after day looking at decomposing bodies , skeletons tied to posts , men shot : he wrote , when a 13 - year - old boy came in with a gun wound to his head , that he would be “ glad to see the end of this stupid tramp ” .
The “ tramp ” went on , and Conrad watched men die , dreams end and , as his Congo journey came to its close , he noted in a letter : “ I have lived long enough to realise that life is full of griefs and sorrows which no one can escape . ”
Afterwards , he was spent : there was a cost – weakened physical health and an exhausted mental state that would bubble up into breakdown 20 years later but which , a decade after , strangely became a defining work of our literature .
Historian says US backed “ efficacious terror ” in 1965 Indonesian massacre
By John Braddock
7 July 2009
The United States and British governments , supported by Australia , were deeply complicit in the murder of more than half a million alleged communist sympathisers in the wake of the 1965 Indonesian coup , a prominent historian told an international conference in Singapore last month .
Brad Simpson , Assistant Professor of History and International Studies at Princeton University and author of “ Economists with Guns : Authoritarian Development and US - Indonesian Relations , 1960 - 1968 ” , said the US and British governments did “ everything in their power ” to ensure that the Indonesian army would carry out the mass killings .
The conference , entitled “ The 1965 - 1966 Indonesian Killings Revisited ” , held at the National University of Singapore from June 17 - 19 , was a rare forum on the subject .
The event , co-hosted by the university , the Asia Research Institute and the Australian Research Council , involved some 30 scholars from around the world .
Within Indonesia , the history of the political slaughter carried out between October and December 1965 has been suppressed for decades .
The massacre of at least 500,000 people , the jailing without trial of about a million others and the widespread use of torture and rape , ranks as one of the great crimes of the twentieth century .
Despite the official secrecy surrounding the events , the consequences still reverberate within the country ’s social and political life .
The current ruling elite can trace its history back to the 1965 events .
President Susil Bambang Yudhoyono , for instance , is a former general while his father - in - law , Sarwo Edhie Wibowo , was an Australian - trained officer who led the killings in Central Java .
No such conference could be held in Indonesia and most of the participants were non-Indonesian .
Since the fall of the Suharto regime in 1998 , tentative attempts to examine the coup have foundered on opposition from the military .
A truth and reconciliation commission set up by parliament never got off the ground and the Constitutional Court has now ruled it unlawful .
School textbooks reflect the military propaganda , which maintains that the killings were part of a “ patriotic campaign ” against communism .
Marxism remains officially proscribed .
The Age interviewed two elderly survivors of the massacre , Sumini and Anwar Umar , who maintain a weekly vigil across the road from the president ’s offices in Jakarta .
Sumini , a former kindergarten teacher was arrested , tortured and imprisoned for ten years for being a member of Gerwani , a women ’s movement linked with the Indonesian Communist Party ( PKI ) .
Anwar , who had been secretary - general of a civil servants union , spent 12 years in prison and was also tortured .
Even after their eventual release , their identity papers were marked to show they were former political prisoners and they were unable to work .
The coup followed a period of sustained political upheaval following World War II .
The Indonesian masses were determined to throw off the desperate poverty and oppression that had been imposed for over 350 years , firstly by the Dutch , then the Japanese .
During the struggles for independence , hundreds of thousands of workers had joined the Stalinist PKI , erroneously believing that it still represented the revolutionary socialist traditions of the Bolshevik revolution .
Following independence , President Sukarno precariously balanced between the various demands of the ruling elites and widespread social unrest among workers and the poor .
Posturing as an “ anti-imperialist ” and a “ man of the people ” , Sukarno increasingly relied on the PKI to contain the demands of masses .
In 1957 , foreign domination over the economy was shaken by a massive eruption of workers and peasants who seized or occupied factories , plantations , banks and ships .
Sukarno relied on the PKI to ensure that the property was handed over to the army , which was sent to suppress the movement .
Following further unrest in 1962 , and again in early 1965 , Sukarno brought the army commanders and PKI leadership into his cabinet .
In the midst of the Cold War , as it became involved in Vietnam , Washington was increasingly concerned at the PKI ’s size and influence .
In 1965 , however , as preparations for a military coup became evident , the PKI continued to subordinate the masses to Sukarno , in line with the reactionary Stalinist theory of a “ two - stage ” revolution , and insisted on the “ peaceful road ” to socialism , promoting deadly illusions in the armed forces .
Even as Sukarno banned all strikes , the PKI blocked any independent movement of the working class , thereby encouraging the military to act with the backing of the US and its allies .
According Simpson ’s paper , “ Capitalists come back !
The Political Economy of the 1965 - 1966 Killings , ” there was “ a lot of evidence that the US was engaged in covert operations ... to provoke a clash between the army and the PKI ... to wipe them out . ”
Even at the height of the massacre , and while harboring deep reservations about the military ’s willingness to enact the sweeping political and economic changes Washington deemed necessary , US officials and their regional allies were “ weighing the conditions under which they would resume assistance to Jakarta ” .
In an interview with the Darwin - based Southeast Asian Times on June 7 , Simpson said US and other Western officials viewed the mass killings as “ efficacious terror ” , an essential building block of the “ quasi neo-liberal policies that the West would attempt to impose on Indonesia after Sukarno ’s ouster ” .
They viewed the wholesale annihilation of the PKI and its supporters as “ an indispensable prerequisite to Indonesia ’s reintegration into the regional political economy and international system , the ascendance of a military modernising regime and the crippling or overthrow of Sukarno ” .
Immediately after the coup , the US administration rushed to express political support for the Suharto regime .
It provided covert monetary assistance to the Indonesian armed forces , while the CIA organised arms from Thailand .
The US government also provided communications equipment , medicine and a range of other items , including shoes and uniforms .
“ The United States was directly involved to the extent that they provided the Indonesian Armed Forces with assistance that they introduced to help facilitate the mass killings , ” Simpson told the conference .
The British government also extended an emergency loan of 1 million pounds to Indonesia in late 1965 and promised not to attack Borneo if Indonesia withdrew soldiers engaged in a conflict with British - backed Malaysia , Simpson said .
While Simpson claimed that he found “ zero evidence ” that the US government masterminded the coup itself , it is unlikely that the military plotters proceeded without assurances from the US and its allies .
The full story of US involvement remains to be told .
The pretext for the coup was the kidnapping and murder on September 30 of six generals , allegedly at the PKI ’s instigation .
Suharto swiftly rounded up the “ rebels ” , took control of the capital and launched his anti-communist pogrom , which was designed to exterminate every known member and supporter of the PKI , along with thousands of trade union members and ordinary workers , peasants and students .
US diplomats and CIA officers , including the former US ambassador to Indonesia and Australia , Marshall Green , subsequently admitted working hand - in - glove with Suharto and his butchers in carrying through the massacres .
They personally provided the names of thousands of PKI members from CIA files for the death lists .
In another paper to the conference , David Jenkins , former foreign editor of the Sydney Morning Herald , said that the Australian , British and US embassies were aware of the mass killings , but did not raise a single protest to the systemic slaughter .
All the embassies knew the PKI had not initiated the coup but did nothing to protect the victims from the military .
Archive documents released in Australia in 1999 proved that the Johnson administration in Washington was actively agitating for the formation of a military regime , and urging its embassy in Jakarta to co-ordinate closely with the army and insist that the generals act ruthlessly to crush the PKI .
When , at the end of October , Washington determined that Suharto should establish a military government , it did so in close consultation with both the British and Australian governments ( see “ US orchestrated Suharto ’s 1965 - 66 slaughter in Indonesia ” ) .
Other conference speakers highlighted the significant role played by the Muslim organisations Nahdlatul Ulama ( NU ) and Muhammadiyah in the killings .
These right - wing organisations , acting at the behest of and at times organised by the military , willingly participated in the eradication of workers and peasants who were seen as a threat to traditional landowners and vested religious interests .
Historian Greg Fealy from the Australian National University cited instructions from NU leaders to its members exhorting them to physically eliminate all traces of communism .
According to Fealy , “ they made frequent references to terms such as menumpas [ eradicate or annihilate ] , membersihkan [ cleanse ] , mengganyang [ crush ] , and mengikis habis [ eliminate ] . ”
Muslim clerics played central roles in overseeing and directing the killings , and coordinated with military officers .
The killings were notable for their gruesome character .
Many victims were either beheaded , garrotted or had their throats slit with knives or machetes wielded by the Islamic militias .
“ It was done face - to - face , ” Fealy said .
Unlike the “ mechanical ” processes employed by the Nazis , or Pol Pot ’s farms , the executions were “ done by hand ” .
American anthropologist Mark Woodward said that in Yogyakarta , leaders of Muhammadiyah , the dominant Islamic group in the area at the time , issued statements declaring the destruction of the Communist Party an individual religious obligation , not just a collective one .
Katharine McGregor of the University of Melbourne said that following the killings , NU members touted their participation as “ a form of patriotic service to the nation ” and reminded Suharto ’s New Order regime of the debt owed to the religious community .
In 2000 , President Abdurrahman Wahid , who was a senior member of NU , issued an apology to people affected by the violence and proposed to officially lift the ban on communism .
The move met vehement opposition from senior NU members and the military .
During a recent interview conducted by McGregor , NU chairman Hasyim Muzadi declined to comment on the role of NU in the 1965 violence , saying “ all that happened must be considered history and not opened up again , otherwise another civil war might occur . ”
The sensitivity of the Indonesian ruling elites to the airing of these terrible crimes underscores the need for workers and young people to learn the political lessons of the PKI ’s betrayal that led to this strategic defeat for the working class .

Manipulation : How Markets Really Work THE FIX IS IN : Manipulation : How Markets Really Work by Stephen Lendman Friday , 29 May 2009
The government 's visible hand and insiders control markets and manipulate them up or down for profit - all of them , including stocks , bonds , commodities and currencies .
Wall Street 's mantra is that markets move randomly and reflect the collective wisdom of investors .
The truth is quite opposite .
The government 's visible hand and insiders control markets and manipulate them up or down for profit - all of them , including stocks , bonds , commodities and currencies .
It 's financial fraud or what former high - level Wall Street insider and former Assistant HUD Secretary Catherine Austin Fitts calls " pump and dump , " defined as " artificially inflating the price of a stock or other security through promotion , in order to sell at the inflated price , " then profit more on the downside by short - selling .
" This practice is illegal under securities law , yet it is particularly common , " and in today 's volatile markets likely ongoing daily .
Why ?
Because the profits are enormous , in good and bad times , and when carried to extremes like now , Fitts calls it " pump ( ing ) and dump ( ing ) of the entire American economy , " duping the public , fleecing trillions from them , and it's more than just " a process designed to wipe out the middle class .
This is genocide ( by other means ) - a much more subtle and lethal version than ever before perpetrated by the scoundrels of our history texts . "
Fitts explains that much more than market manipulation goes on .
She describes a " financial coup d'etat , including fraudulent housing ( and other bubbles ) , pump and dump schemes , naked short selling , precious metals price suppression , and active intervention in the markets by the government and central bank " along with insiders .
It 's a government - business partnership for enormous profits through " legislation , contracts , regulation ( or lack of it ) , financing , ( and ) subsidies . "
More still overall by rigging the game for the powerful , while at the same time harming the public so cleverly that few understand what 's happening .
Market Rigging Mechanisms - The Plunge Protection Team On March 18 , 1989 , Ronald Reagan 's Executive Order 12631 created the Working Group on Financial Markets ( WGFM ) commonly known as the Plunge Protection Team ( PPT ) .
It consisted of the following officials or their designees : the President ;
the Treasury Secretary as chairman ;
the Fed chairman ;
the SEC chairman ; and
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman .
Under Sec. 2 , its " Purposes and Functions " were stated as follows : ( 2 ) " Recognizing the goals of enhancing the integrity , efficiency , orderliness , and competitiveness of our Nation 's financial markets and maintaining investor confidence , the Working Group shall identify and consider : the major issues raised by the numerous studies on the events ( pertaining to the ) October 19 , 1987 ( market crash and consider ) recommendations that have the potential to achieve the goals noted above ; and .... governmental ( and other ) actions under existing laws and regulations .... that are appropriate to carry out these recommendations . "
In August 2005 , Canada - based Sprott Asset Management ( SAM ) principals John Embry and Andrew Hepburn headlined their report on the US government 's " surreptitious " market interventions : " Move Over , Adam Smith - The Visible Hand of Uncle Sam " to prevent " destabilizing stock market declines .
Comprising key government agencies , stock exchanges and large Wall Street firms , " this group " is significant because the government has never admitted to private - sector membership in the Working Group , " nor is it hinting that manipulation works both ways - to stop or create panic .
" Current mythology holds that ( equity ) prices rise and fall on the basis of market forces alone .
Such sentiments appear to be seriously mistaken ....
And as official rhetoric continues to toe the free market line , manipulation has become increasingly apparent .... with the active participation of selected investment banks and brokerage houses " - the Wall Street giants .
In 2004 , Texas Hedge Report principals Steven McIntyre and Todd Stein said " Almost every floor trader on the NYSE , NYMEX , CBOT and CME will admit to having seen the PPT in action in one form or another over the years " - violating the traditional notion that markets move randomly and reflect popular sentiment .
Worse still , according to SAM principals Embry and Hepburn , " the government 's unwillingness to disclose its activities has rendered it very difficult to have a debate on the merits of such a policy , " if there are any .
Further , " virtually no one ever mentions government intervention publicly ....
Our primary concern is that what apparently started as a stopgap measure may have morphed into a serious moral hazard situation . "
Worst of all , if government and Wall Street collude to pump and dump markets , individuals and small investment firms can get trampled , and that 's exactly what happened in late 2008 and early 2009 , with much more to come as the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression plays out over many more months .
That said , the PPT might more aptly be called the PPDT - The Plunge Protection / Destruction Team , depending on which way it moves markets at any time .
Investors beware .
Manipulating markets is commonplace and as old as investing .
Only the tools are more sophisticated and amounts involved greater .
In her book , " Morgan : American Financier , " Jean Strouse explained his role in the Panic of 1907 , the result of stock market and real estate speculation that caused a market crash , bank runs , and hysteria .
To restore confidence , JP Morgan and the Treasury Secretary organized a group of financiers to transfer funds to troubled banks and buy stocks .
At the time , rumors were rampant that they orchestrated the panic for speculative profits and their main goals : the 1908 National Monetary Commission to stabilize financial markets as a precursor to the Federal Reserve ; and
the 1910 Jekyll Island meeting where powerful financial figures met in secret for nine days and created the private banking cartel Federal Reserve System , later congressionally established on December 23 , 1913 and signed into law by Woodrow Wilson .
Morgan died early that year but profited hugely from the 1907 Panic .
It let him expand his steel empire by buying the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company for about $ 45 million , an asset thought to be worth around $ 700 million .
Today , similar schemes are more than ever common in the wake of the global economic crisis creating opportunities to buy assets cheap by bankers flush with bailout cash .
Aided by PPT market rigging , it 's simpler than ever .
Wharton Professor Itay Goldstein and Said Business School and Lincoln College , Oxford University Professor Alexander Guembel discussed price manipulation in their paper titled " Manipulation and the Allocational Role of Prices . "
They showed how traders effect prices on the downside through " bear raids , " and concluded : " We basically describe a theory of how bear raid manipulation works .... What we show here is that by selling ( a stock or more effectively short - selling it ) , you have a real effect on the firm .
The connection with real value is the new thing .... This is the crucial element , " but they claim the process only works on the downside , not driving shares up .
In fact , high - volume program trading , analyst recommendations , positive or negative media reports , and other devices do it both ways .
Also key is that a company 's stock price and true worth can be highly divergent .
In other words , healthy or sick firms may be way - over or under - valued depending on market and economic conditions and how manipulative traders wish to price them , short or longer term .
The idea that equity prices reflect true value or that markets move randomly ( up or down ) is rubbish .
They never have and more than ever do n't now .
The Exchange Stabilization Fund ( ESF ) The 1934 Gold Reserve Act created the US Treasury 's ESF .
Section 7 of the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreements made its operations permanent .
As originally established , the Treasury ran the Fund outside of congressional oversight " to keep sharp swings in the dollar 's exchange rate from ( disrupting ) financial markets " through manipulation .
Its operations now include stabilizing foreign currencies , extending credit lines to foreign governments , and last September to guaranteeing money market funds against losses for up to $ 50 billion .
In 1995 , the Clinton administration used the fund to provide Mexico a $ 20 billion credit line to stabilize the peso at a time of economic crisis , and earlier administrations extended loans or credit lines to China , Brazil , Ecuador , Iceland and Liberia .
The Treasury 's web site also states that : " By law , the Secretary has considerable discretion in the use of ESF resources .
The legal basis of the ESF is the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 .
As amended in the late 1970s .... the Secretary ( per ) approval of the President , may deal in gold , foreign exchange , and other instruments of credit and securities . "
In other words , ESF is a slush fund for whatever purposes the Treasury wishes , including ones it may not wish to disclose , such as manipulating markets , directing funds to the IMF and providing them with strings to borrowers as the Treasury 's site explains : " .... Treasury has often linked the availability of ESF financing to a borrower 's use of the credit facilities of the IMF , both to support the IMF 's role and to strengthen assurances that there will be timely repayment of ESF financing . "
The Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group ( CRMPG ) Established in 1999 in the wake of the Long Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) crisis , it manipulates markets to benefit giant Wall Street firms and high - level insiders .
According to one account , it was to curb future crises by : letting giant financial institutions collude through large - scale program trading to move markets up or down as they wish ;
bailing out its members in financial trouble ; and
manipulating markets short or longer - term with government approval at the expense of small investors none the wiser and often getting trampled .
In August 2008 , CRMPG III issued a report titled " Containing Systemic Risk : The Road to Reform . "
It was deceptive on its face in stating that CRMPG " was designed to focus its primary attention on the steps that must be taken by the private sector to reduce the frequency and / or severity of future financial shocks while recognizing that such future shocks are inevitable , in part because it is literally impossible to anticipate the specific timing and triggers of such events . "
In fact , the " private sector " creates " financial shocks " to open markets , remove competition , and consolidate for greater power by buying damaged assets cheap .
Financial history has numerous examples of preying on the weak , crushing competition , socializing risks , privatizing profits , redistributing wealth upward to a financial oligarchy , creating " tollbooth economies " in debt bondage according to Michael Hudson , and overall getting a " free lunch " at the public 's expense .
CRMPG explains financial excesses and crises this way : " At the end of the day , ( their ) root cause .... on both the upside and the downside of the cycle is collective human behavior : unbridled optimism on the upside and fear on the downside , all in a setting in which it is literally impossible to anticipate when optimism gives rise to fear or fear gives rise to optimism .... "
" What is needed , therefore , is a form of private initiative that will complement official oversight in encouraging industry - wide practices that will help mitigate systemic risk .
The recommendations of the Report have been framed with that objective in mind . "
In other words , let foxes guard the henhouse to keep inventing new ways to extract gains ( a " free lunch " ) in increasingly larger amounts - " in the interest of helping to contain systemic risk factors and promote greater stability . "
Or as Orwell might have said : instability is stability , creating systemic risk is containing it , sloping playing fields are level ones , extracting the greatest profit is sharing it , and what benefits the few helps everyone .
Michel Chossudovsky explains that : " triggering market collapse (s ) can be a very profitable undertaking .
( Evidence suggests ) that the Security and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regulators have created an environment which supports speculative transactions ( through ) futures , options , index funds , derivative securities ( and short - selling ) , etc. ( that ) make money when the stock market crumbles .... foreknowledge and inside information ( create golden profit opportunities for ) powerful speculators " able to move markets up or down with the public none the wiser .
As a result , concentrated wealth and " financial power resulting from market manipulation is unprecedented " with small investors ' savings , IRAs , pensions , 401ks , and futures being decimated from it .
Deconstructing So - Called " Green Shoots "
Daily the corporate media trumpet them to lull the unwary into believing the global economic crisis is ebbing and recovery is on the way .
Not according to longtime market analyst Bob Chapman who calls green shoots " Poison Ivy " and economist Nouriel Roubini saying they 're " yellow weeds " at a time there 's lots more pain ahead .
For many months and in a recent commentary he refers to " the worst financial crisis , economic crisis and recession since the Great Depression .... the consensus is now becoming optimistic again and says that we are going to go from minus 6 percent growth to positive growth in the second half of the year .... my views are much more bearish .... The problems of the financial system are severe .
Many banks are still insolvent . "
We 're " piling public debt on top of private debt to socialize the losses ; and at some point the back of ( the ) government ( 's ) balance sheet is going to break , and if that happens , it 's going to be a disaster . "
Short of that , he , Chapman , and others see the risks going forward as daunting .
As for the recent stock market rise , they both call it a " sucker 's rally " that will reverse as the US economy keeps contracting and the financial system suffers unexpected or manipulated shocks .
Highly respected market analyst Louise Yamada agrees .
As Randall Forsyth reported in the May 25 issue of Barron 's Up and Down Wall Street column : " It is almost uncanny the degree to which 2002 - 08 has tracked 1932 - 38 , ' Yamada writes in her latest note to clients . ' " Her " Alternate Hypothesis " compares this structural bear market to 1929 - 42 : " the dot - com collapse parallels the Great Crash and its aftermath , " followed by the 2003 - 07 recovery , similar to 1933 - 37 ;
then the late 2008 - early March 2009 collapse tracks a similar 1937 - 38 trajectory , after which a strong rally followed much like today ;
then in November 1938 , the market dropped 22 % followed by a 26 % rise and a series of further ups and downs - down 28 % , up 23 % , down 16 % , up 13 % , and a final 29 % decline ending in 1942 ;
from the 1938 high ( " analogous to where we are now , " she says ) , stock prices fell 41 % to a final bottom .
Are we at one today as market touts claim ?
No according to Yamada - top - ranked among her peers in 2001 , 2002 , 2003 and 2004 when she worked at Citigroup 's Smith Barney division .
Since 2005 , she 's headed her own independent research company .
She says structural bear markets typically last 13 - 16 years so this one has a long way to go before " complet ( ing ) the repair process . "
She calls the current rebound " a bungee jump , " very typical of bear markets .
Numerous ones occurred during the Great Depression , 8 alone from 1929 - 1932 , some deceptively strong .
Expect market manipulators today to produce similar price action going forward - to enrich themselves while trampling on the unwary , well - advised to protect their dollars from becoming quarters or dimes .

Bruno is n't very good .
I laughed a couple of times , but there 's a lot of shit I laugh at that is n't very good .
Like The Weather Channel .
Give me a carton of expired Robitussin and six hours with storm warnings and I guarantee I 'll piss my pants and fall on the shag carpet in tears .
You try explaining to somebody later what was so funny about seeing a poor family in Ohio sitting on the roof of their flooded home , though .
Bruno is the follow - up - - and essentially the exact same idea executed shittier -- as Borat , Sacha Baron Cohen 's big hit from three years ago .
In that movie , and this one , Cohen assumes the role of a dimwitted stereotype in hopes of exposing ignorance and bigotry America .
Here , he mostly fails .
And when he succeeds , it 's of targets that are way to easy to even count as a score .
Cohen 's Bruno character is a gay Austrian fashionista .
He 's not likeable .
In fact , he 's a self - absorbed asshole .
This is meant to be funny , but it 's also fucking obvious and one - note .
There is nothing about Bruno to distinguish him from a bad SNL skit except there 's no NBC censor to keep it from being tasteless .
So he can show his balls , say dirty words and blur out simulated anal sex in hopes of tricking us into thinking this is daring .
Hell , I can see real anal sex for $ 7 every 15 minutes on my computer and it ain't daring at all .
It is sort of gross , though .
What makes Bruno especially painful to hang out with is that while we 're supposed to laugh at how mean he is one moment and then give a shit when his feelings get hurt .
It 's a really crappy and indulgent way to write a character : demand the audience to react how you want without justification .
Granted , Bruno 's plot is just a clothesline to hang gags on .
Still , if you want to pretend you are n't just doing a bunch of sketches , why not put some fucking effort into the story and the character who drives it ?
While it still would n't have been good , the movie would have improved if they admitted it was just sketches , not a story .
The ostensible story is Cohen 's gay Austrian has come to America to become famous .
He attempts fame many different ways , each a rather obvious riff on something that 's happened and already been mocked ad nauseum on late night TV .
He adopts a black child like Madonna , he visits a minister who converts gays into straights , he interviews famous people and he goes to a psychic .
He interviews Paula Abdul ( really ?
That 's the best they could do - make fun of Paula Abdul ?
Is n't that about as hard as hunting legless goats in an empty swimming pool ? ) .
When she arrives he has no furniture and has his Mexican gardeners assume the positions of benches to be sat on .
Abdul does , but is quite uncomfortable and leaves quickly .
There is no punchline , no funny bits , and the scene ends after a few awkward minutes with Abdul being sped away by a publicist .
Well , where 's the fucking surprise ?
How else could this have possibly ended ?
Who is this supposed to make look bad ?
Actually , the skit reminded me of those smug , fake anti-smoking ads where some supposedly hip teenagers do some street performance to illustrate Big Tobacco 's bad behavior , and a bunch of fake innocent bystanders look appalled .
Same smugness with same easiness of a foregone conclusion .
When talking to an anti-gay minister , Cohen gets off precisely one funny line , about the man 's blow - job lips .
Otherwise the minister is a very patient man who truly believes he 's doing God 's work and trying quite hard at it .
He does n't sound stupid or mean .
And Cohen never does or says anything insightful or revealing about trying to convert gays .
He just sits there , for far too long , thinking the premise itself is hilarious .
Cohen ( not Bruno ) looks worst in the scene , for first not revealing anything and second for failing to get an unlikeable subject to laugh at .
In three other scenes , Cohen comes off worst .
He goes hunting with three good old boys , and then hits on them in a tent , naked .
The men have a hell of a lot of restraint , yet are supposed to be the butt of the joke .
Tee hee , country bumpkins are afraid of homos !
Only , they sure do n't seem to be .
They just appear to be worn out by the Bruno character 's obnoxiousness and aggressiveness .
They do n't call him names , do n't hurt him , just tell him to get out of their tent when he tries to snuggle naked at four a .m.
Man , is that gag weak , and boy does Cohen come across as trying too fucking hard to stereotype the hunters .
Cohen goes to a swinger 's party and again acts outrageous in hopes of provoking a reaction .
I do n't know what he 's trying to say about swingers , but I know the obvious things that he fails to .
I sympathize with the victims for behaving very kindly and for him trying to make them a punchline in exchange .
Again , they do n't look bad , he does .
Finally , Cohen comes on to libertarian nutjob and closet - racist Ron Paul in a hotel room .
In the process , he makes that wacko seem reasonable , and he reveals nothing about how fucking out there that guy is .
That seems like it would n't be hard to do , yet he fails .
The problem is all of these skits , and much of the movie , have no satire .
They just have Cohen behaving badly and people responding not quite as stereotypically as I 'm sure Cohen hoped .
He fails to prick any overstuffed targets , or reveal any truths about some hidden hatred .
We just see more and more of Cohen acting obnoxious without result .
Bruno is 82 minutes and it's too long at that .
Where Borat was stuffed with funny gags and it felt like there was a lot more where it came from , this one is stretched thin .
I got the sense they had to really scrape the cutting room floor to get it to feature length .
The skits I described are overlong and go on past what they 're worth .
The monotony of Cohen 's Bruno gets reinforced skit after skit .
He 's not offensive , as I 'm sure he hopes , he 's just repetitive .
Bruno is just weak .
It 's not funny , it 's not revealing and it's far from clever .
I do n't know that there is a good movie in this character .
He 's not interesting enough .
If he wants to expose bigotry or the cruelty of others , he probably ought to try harder and find better targets .
Two Fingers .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama on Friday announced a competition for $ 4 billion in federal grants to improve academic achievement and reverse a decline in U.S. public schools .
“ In an economy where knowledge is the most valuable commodity a person and a country have to offer , the best jobs will go to the best educated , whether they live in the United States , or India , or China , ” Obama said .
The president wants states to use funds from the competition , dubbed the “ Race to the Top , ” to ease limits on so - called charter schools , link teacher pay to student achievement and move toward common U.S. academic standards .
Charter schools receive public funding but generally are exempt from some state or local rules and regulations .
They are operated as an alternative to traditional public schools .
“ America will not succeed in the 21st century unless we do a far better job in educating our sons and daughters , ” Obama said in an address at the Department of Education .
The $ 4 billion education grant program was created under the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan passed by Congress and signed into law by Obama in February .
“ Rather than divvying it up and handing it out , we are letting states and districts compete for it .
That ’s how we can incentivize excellence and spur reform and launch a race for the top in America ’s public schools , ” he said .
The United States has one of the worst high school dropout rates in the industrialized world , and its students often rank below those in other Western nations in reading and math .
Obama has portrayed the drive to improve education as part of a broader push to promote economic growth in the face of a deep recession and the worst U.S. financial crisis in decades .
They are the record companies ' bogeyman : the 15 - year - old in their bedroom ripping off a star 's latest album and sharing it with their friends has been blamed for bringing an industry to its knees .
But new research shows that the number of teenagers illegally sharing music has fallen dramatically in the past year .
The survey of 1,000 fans also shows that many 14 to 18 year olds are now streaming music regularly online using services such as YouTube and Spotify .
At the same time less than a third of teenagers are now illegally downloading music , the survey suggests .
In January this year 26 % of 14 to 18 year olds admitted filesharing at least once a month compared with 42 % in December 2007 .
The research revealed that many teenagers ( 65 % ) are streaming music regularly , with more 14 to 18 year olds ( 31 % ) listening to streamed music on their computer every day compared with music fans overall ( 18 % ) .
The picture may be more complex than a simple shift from filesharing to streaming , with people sharing music in new ways such as via bluetooth technology , on blogs , and through copying , also known as ripping content from friends ' MP3 devices .
Even though users of streaming services are not necessarily buying more music , the industry benefits by learning more about fans ' tastes .
Steve Purdham , CEO and founder of We7 , a music streaming service and download store , said : " They may not buy an album , though they have that opportunity , but you can sell them tour tickets and a T - shirt of their favourite band . "
We7 has 2 million users a month and works with artists including Florence and the Machine and Jarvis Cocker to stream new albums before they are available to buy .
Paul Brindley , CEO of Music
Ally , which carried out the survey with media and technology research company , The Leading Question , said : " These figures challenge the idea that filesharing will just continue to grow .
While we do n't think for a second that it shows the war against piracy is won , it does at least suggest that there is encouraging news for the music industry . "
The government has pledged tougher measures to crack down on illegal filesharing , including sending warning letters to people making illegal downloads of music and films .
Repeat offenders could also have their internet connections slowed down .
Music fan Dominique Wakefield , 24 , said she had stopped downloading music because of concern that it would infect her computer .
" I did n't even realise it was illegal for a long time , until I heard that the government were trying to stop it .
That did put me off , but one of the big reasons I stopped doing it was because I would get viruses , more pop ups on my computer .
While I was at uni I started listening to streamed music using MySpace .
Bands would be friends with other bands and it was a great way of discovering new music .
I do n't really feel the need to own all that music , I know it 's always there .
" I still buy the occasional CD , and sometimes use iTunes .
If I find myself loving a whole album and listening to it again and again , then I will buy it .
But it has to be quite special . "
The rise of streaming sites is far from assured .
Daniel Ek , the founder of Spotify – an ad - funded streaming site which also offers a premium subscription model – recently admitted that the service , which launched in October 2008 and now has 2 million registered users , was not on target to make its revenue forecasts .
We7 , which launched six months ago and relies on selling adverts of between three to seven seconds before each song , is yet to break even .
But Jim Butcher , a spokesman for Spotify , said the company was confident that the quality of the product would win over users , premium subscribers and advertisers .
" One of the fundamental aims of Spotify was to develop a service that was better than piracy , " he said .
" We 've always maintained that music fans do n't want to fileshare illegally but they do want to have everything at their fingertips instantly . "
Legal digital sales are also seeing an unprecedented boom , although sales are far from making up from the shortfall created by the collapse of the physical market .
Digital singles were up 41.5 % in 2008 , while physical singles sales plunged 43.5 % , according to the BPI .
Last year three albums – Coldplay 's Viva La Vida , Kings of Leon 's Only By Night and Duffy 's Rockferry – sold more than 100,000 digital copies , and the impact of digital is nowhere more apparent than in the UK singles top 40 , where Michael Jackson has 12 posthumous entries in the current chart .
The new research – which involved 1,000 face - to - face interviews and a series of focus groups – also revealed that a fraction more music fans are regularly buying single track downloads ( 19 % ) than filesharing single tracks ( 17 % ) .
Geoff Taylor , CEO of the BPI called the figures " absolutely encouraging " .
He said : " The industry has worked hard to licence new services , they are great music discovery tools and a new way for artists to get paid and drive new sales . "
Francis Keeling , vice president of digital at Universal , welcomed the news but said streaming had to be combined with new services , such as the company 's new deal with Virgin Media which will offer broadband users unlimited downloads for a monthly fee .
" We are confident that the numerous legal alternatives to filesharing will result in a long term reduction in piracy , " he said .
In the years between Back to the Future and Back to the Future II , Michael J. Fox visibly aged and the actress playing his girlfriend was replaced by Elizabeth Shue .
Thus , to show the closing scene from the first film as the opening of the second , it was necessary to completely reshoot it .
Dig ?
Anyway , as you can see above , someone has made a side - by - side comparison of the sequence so you can now needlessly critique how well Robert Zemeckis and crew recreated the scene .
The audio is layered together as well , and for some reason hearing a duet of Docs saying , in unison , " Roads ?
Where we 're going , we do n't need ... roads , " is utterly hypnotizing :
Luckily , the rest of the film holds up to intense scrutiny , and this is the only slight flaw .
Bill Kristol Says Things That Are The Opposite of True
" One reason the price of health care is going up so fast is because of government programs , " says Kristol .
" The price of Medicare and Medicaid have gone up faster than private insurance .
That 's well - documented . "
It is true that the growth rates of Medicare , Medicaid , and private insurance are well - documented .
But the documentation shows the opposite of what Bill Kristol says it shows .
The price of Medicare and Medicaid have gone up much more slowly than private insurance .
Take Medicare :
That does n't require much explanation .
Suffice to say , the growth in per-person spending for Medicare has been significantly slower than private health insurance over the past 20 years , and its advantage has widened in recent years .
But wait , you say .
Kristol mentioned both Medicare and Medicaid .
Maybe he just meant Medicaid ?
Nope !
Bill Kristol , who writes frequently about health care and advises the Republican Party about how to vote on bills , is misinformed on the basic facts of the situation .
And even his misinformation is n't terribly coherent : Later in the interview , he says that the Army health - care system -- which is fully socialized -- is the best health - care system we 've got , and the reason we can't give it to all Americans is that it 's too expensive .
Socialized medicine , in other words , works .
The rest of us just do n't deserve it .
To be fair , I do n't believe that Kristol believes that .
When he says that the danger with Obama 's plan is that it " would put us well on the road to government - run health care , " I take him at his word .
But it is interesting to watch what happens when his adoration for all things military collides with the distrust of all things federal .
Turns out that the conservative in Kristol is no match for the militarist .

John -- John Meacham - ⑆repetae.net ⑆john⑈ - http://notanumber.net/
On Wednesday , the Senate is expected to vote on the latest assault on public safety in the name of gun ownership .
Introduced as an amendment to the military ’s budget bill by Senator John Thune , a Republican of South Dakota , this radical measure would nullify the laws of almost every state , subjecting police officers to greater risk and increasing the potential for gun violence .
Nearly all states issue licenses to carry concealed firearms , but the criteria for granting such permits vary widely , and it is now , sensibly , up to each state to decide whether to accept another state ’s permits .
At least 35 states prevent people from carrying concealed weapons if they have certain misdemeanor convictions .
At least 31 states prohibit alcohol abusers from obtaining a concealed carry permit and require gun safety training .
The Thune amendment would force states with more restrictive standards to accept concealed carry permits from states with less stringent rules  in effect giving the lax rules national reach .
Passage of the amendment would make it much harder for law enforcement to distinguish between legal and illegal possession of a firearm .
It would be a boon for illegal gun traffickers , making it easier to transport weapons across state lines without being caught .
RALEIGH , North Carolina ( CNN ) --
A woman whose husband and two sons are accused of plotting " violent jihad " overseas said federal authorities tricked her into leaving her home so they could search it .
Sabrina Boyd says terrorism allegations against her husband , Daniel , and two sons are false .
Sabrina Boyd said Tuesday that she rushed out to a hospital earlier this week after being told her loved ones had been in a serious car accident .
The FBI declined to comment on the allegation .
Boyd 's claims came the day before an eighth suspect in this North Carolina group of alleged terrorism supporters was identified as Jude Kenan Mohammad , a knowledgeable source told CNN Wednesday .
Authorities had said Tuesday that they were seeking an eighth suspect in the case , although they would not identify the person , who is described as a U.S. citizen and North Carolina resident in an indictment .
Seven men already arrested in the case face charges of supporting terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder abroad .
They are scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday .
Officials identified three of the men as U.S. native Daniel Patrick Boyd , 39 , -- who according to the indictment had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan -- and Boyd 's sons , Dylan Boyd , 22 , also known as " Mohammed , " and Zakariya Boyd , 20 .
The four others are : Mohammad Omar Aly Hassan , also a U.S. - born citizen ; Hysen Sherifi , identified as a native of Kosovo who is a legal permanent resident of the United States ; and Hiyad Yaghi and Anes Subasic , both naturalized U.S. citizens .
Sabrina Boyd , the wife of Daniel Patrick Boyd and the mother of the two younger Boyds , said the allegations against her family are false .
" I know that my husband and my sons are free of guilt , " she told CNN Tuesday .
" I 'm hopeful that the truth will come to light . "
Watch as Sabrina Boyd says she 's proud of her husband and sons »
She said she had not spoken to her husband or to her son Dylan , but had spoken to Zakariya .
" He seemed OK , " she said .
" He said , ' They 're innocent , the truth will come out . ' "
Learning about the arrest of her husband and sons had been particularly distressing because of the manner in which she found out , she said .
She said federal authorities sent a person the family knew to her door this week to tell her that her husband and three sons had been sideswiped by a tractor - trailer .
The person was wearing a shirt that appeared to be covered in blood , she said , and told her " it was grave and they were bleeding , and I needed to be rushed immediately to Duke Hospital , " she said .
For Sabrina Boyd , the news was all too familiar :
In 2007 , her 16 - year - old son , Luqman , was killed in a car crash .
" I had already been through this two years prior , " she said .
She said authorities took her , her daughter and pregnant daughter - in - law to the hospital , where she learned that her husband and sons had not been in a car accident .
" When we got to the hospital they brought us around back , separated us , handcuffed us , including my 8 - month pregnant daughter [ - in - law ] , and were very rude and then told us , ' They 're not dying , they 're detained .
And you better cooperate with us . ' "
She added , " They used the death of my son to trick me into getting out of my own house so they could just serve a warrant with nobody there . "
All eight suspects are accused of plotting " violent jihad " overseas , according to the indictment , and are charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and conspiracy to murder , kidnap , maim and injure people .
The indictment makes no reference to a direct threat to individuals or property in the United States , but said the men had practiced military tactics in a North Carolina county that borders Virginia .
The court document also mentions overseas trips taken by several of the men .
According to the indictment , Daniel Boyd and his sons left the United States for Israel in June 2007 to " engage in violent jihad , but ultimately returned to the United States after failing in their efforts . "
It said Yaghi and Hassan also traveled to Israel in June 2007 , and that Daniel Boyd lied to Customs and Border Protection agents at the Atlanta , Georgia , and Raleigh airports about intending to meet the two men in the Jewish state .
The indictment also said Daniel Boyd traveled to Gaza in March 2006 " to introduce his son to individuals who also believed that violent jihad was a personal obligation on the part of every good Muslim . "
Sabrina Boyd said her husband flew to Israel in 2007 with Zakariya after Luqman 's death .
Both sons were to have gone , she said .
" They 'd always wanted to go to the Holy Land , " she said .
However , she said , Zakariya and Daniel Boyd were detained by Israeli authorities and were deported to France .
She offered no details .
About a year earlier , Daniel Boyd had taken the couple 's youngest son , Noah , to Jerusalem to visit holy sites , she said , saying the trips were not unusual for Muslims , Christians or Jews .
The indictment alleges that Daniel Boyd traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan during 1989 to 1992 , and learned military - style training in terrorist camps there .
He also fought the Soviets in Afghanistan , the indictment says .
According to The Washington Post , Daniel Boyd and his brother , Charles , had been sentenced in 1991 in Pakistan to have their right hands and left feet cut off after being convicted of bank robbery .
The newspaper reported in October 1991 that the brothers and their families had moved to Peshawar to work with a Muslim relief agency .
The country 's Supreme Court overturned their convictions , the newspaper reported .
CNN 's David Mattingly , Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report .
All About Terrorism • Federal Bureau of Investigation • North Carolina
A former hospital employee may have exposed hundreds , or even thousands , of surgical patients to hepatitis C after taking their fentanyl injections and replacing them with used syringes filled with saline solution .
Kristen Diane Parker , who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver , has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients , investigators said .
She had hepatitis C , which she believes she contracted through using heroin and sharing dirty needles while she lived in New Jersey in 2008 …
Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker .
According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration , Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C .
She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients .
Parker quit after she was found to be in an operating room where she was not allowed to be .
She subsequently tested positive for fentanyl .
Hospital officials then contacted the DEA .
I ’ve worked for several firms where we performed random drug tests on employees who drove company vehicles .
The question and cost of liability took precedence over the price of testing .
Here , we ’re looking at hospitals that had technicians distributing drugs and medications to patients – and did n’t have random drug test procedures in place ?
And no one noticed patients were n’t responding to the shots they supposedly had ?
Cripes !
I realize they ’ll use privacy as the excuse ; but , there ’s really only one reason why managers in any business skimp on safety .
They ’re cheapskates .
Beancounters instead of for - real managers .

It said Qatar and adviser Credit Suisse have already completed their due diligence on June 8 .
The Porsche and Piech families own the common shares in the company and have so far never allowed outsiders to acquire any of it .
Der Spiegel said Porsche chief executive Wendelin Wiedeking ’s timetable would be for the Porsche supervisory board to hold a special meeting in early July to approve a capital increase .
Porsche shareholders would then approve the capital hike in a general shareholders meeting in early September so that 4 - 5 billion euros ( $ 5.63 billion ) in new money could be raised by November at the latest .
The new capital could help lift Porsche SE 's balance sheet , which is saddled with nine billion euros of net debt it had incurred to pave the way for the now aborted plan to take over Volkswagen VOWG .DE .

Can Toke Away Woes Group hits airwaves touting marijuana legalization , taxation to fix budget woes .
July 18 , 2009  -- California 's budget crisis does n't call for a bailout -- it calls for a blunt , according to one advocacy group pushing the state to legalize marijuana .
The Marijuana Policy Project hit the streets and the airwaves earlier this month , saying California is missing out on millions of dollars in taxes .
" We are marijuana consumers , " says retired state worker Nadene Herndon in a 30 - second commercial aired across California .
" Instead of being treated like criminals for using a substance safer than alcohol , we want to pay our fair share . "
Advocates of marijuana rights see the state 's $ 26.3 billion budget gap as their chance to be heard .
If the state legalizes marijuana , they say , it wo n't have to trim budgets in public sectors like education and law enforcement .
" Every problem is an opportunity , " said Bruce Mirken , the spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project .
" And clearly [ the economic crisis ] has helped provoke the discussion . "
That discussion is reaching the public .
A Field Poll in April found 56 percent of California voters supported legalizing marijuana .
" Where public opinion goes , eventually politicians are going to follow , " Mirken said .
Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , D - San Francisco , introduced a bill in February to tax and regulate marijuana like alcohol and tax it at $ 50 per ounce .
Earlier this year , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said legalizing marijuana should be considered , but now says the move should not be based simply on money .
Opposition to legal marijuana comes from those concerned about its recreational use , and it 's even those who sell it speaking out .
Marijuana has been labeled a " gateway drug " and , therefore , concerns arise about drug abuse , which could lead to addictions and more serious narcotics .
" Some people , they abuse it , " said Ryan Gaspar , manager of the Holland House dispensary .
" And they are going to ruin it for people who really need it . "
Advocates of legalization say marijuana must be regulated and sold by licensed merchants like beer , wine or liquor .
Even so , they still acknowledge certain inherent dangers .
" Nothing is absolutely risk free , " Mirken said .
" But when you look at the so - called recreational drugs , marijuana is actually comparatively benign . "
Pot Genie Already
Out of the Bottle ?
The fact is that Californians are getting a hold of the drug .
Last year , more than $ 11 billion in marijuana was seized in California according to the attorney general 's office .
Today , there are more medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles than Starbucks coffee shops , after the state legalized the drug for medical purposes in 1996 .
Advocates say the state is missing out on the action .
" What we have in prohibition is the worst of all possible worlds , " said Mirken .
" A drug that is as common as dirt , and totally unregulated and totally untaxed and it makes no sense . "
Legal marijuana could not just increase revenue through taxes , it could decrease millions spent on jailing drug abusers , according to supporters .
As much as the drug may seem decriminalized , 74,000 Californians were arrested for marijuana in 2007 .
" The amount of money that would be saved in terms of incarceration and not enforcing of minor marijuana crimes , I imagine , would be another few million if not more , " Ammiano said .

We are now looking at unemployment numbers that undermine any confidence that we might be nearing the bottom of the recession .
The appropriate metaphor is not the green shoots of new growth .
A better image is to look at the true total of jobless people as a prudent navigator looks at an iceberg .
What we see on the surface is disconcerting enough .
The estimate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics of job losses for June is 467,000 .
That increases by 7.2 million the number of unemployed since the start of the recession .
The cumulative job losses over the past six months have been greater than for any other half - year period since World War II , including demobilization .
What 's more , the job losses are now equal to the net job gains over the previous nine years , making this the only recession since the Great Depression to wipe out all employment growth from the previous business cycle .
That 's bad enough .
But here are nine reasons we are in even more trouble than the 9.5 percent unemployment rate indicates .
One .
June 's total included 185,000 people who were assumed to be at work , many of whom probably were not .
The government could not identify them ; it made an assumption about trends .
But many of the mythical jobs are in industries that have absolutely no job creation : finance , for example .
When the official numbers are adjusted over the next several months , look to some of the 185,000 boosting the unemployment totals .
Two .
More companies are asking employees to take unpaid leave .
These people do n't count on the unemployment roll .
Three .
No fewer than 1.4 million people wanted or were available for work in the past 12 months .
They were not counted .
Why ?
Because they had n't searched for work in the four weeks preceding the survey .
The assumption is that they had found work or do n't want it , but there are other explanations : school attendance , family responsibilities , sheer exhaustion .
Four .
The number of workers taking part - time jobs because of the slack economy , a kind of stealth underemployment , has doubled in this recession to about 9 million , or 5.8 percent of the workforce .
Add those whose hours have been cut to those who cannot find a full - time job , and the total of unemployed and underemployed rises to 16.5 percent , putting the number of involuntarily idle workers in the range of an overwhelming 25 million .
Five .
The inside numbers are just as bad .
The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory private - sector employees , around 80 percent of the workforce , dropped to 33 hours .
That 's 48 minutes a week less than before the recession began , the lowest level of activity since the government began tracking such data 45 years ago .
Full - time workers are being downgraded to part time as businesses slash labor costs to remain above water and factories operate at only 65 percent of capacity .
If American workers were still putting in those extra 48 minutes a week now , 3.3 million fewer employees could perform the same aggregate amount of work .
With a longer workweek , the unemployment rate would reach 11.7 percent , not the official 9.5 percent ( which in turn dramatically exceeds the 8 percent rate projected by the Obama administration ) .
Six .
The average length of official unemployment increased to 24.5 weeks .
This is the longest term since the government started to track these data in 1948 .
The number of long - term unemployed ( those out of a job for 27 weeks or more ) has now jumped to 4.4 million , an all - time high .
Seven .
The average worker saw no wage gains in June , with average compensation running flat at $ 18.53 an hour .
Eight .
The jobs report is even uglier when you consider that the sector producing goods is losing the most jobs — 223,000 in the last report alone .
Nine .
The prospects for job creation are equally distressing .
The likelihood is that when economic activity picks up , employers will first choose to increase hours for existing workers and bring part - time workers to full - time status .
Many unemployed workers looking for jobs once the recovery begins will discover that jobs as good as the ones they lost are almost impossible to find because more layoffs in this recession have been permanent and not temporary .
Instead of shrinking operations , companies have closed whole business units or made sweeping structural changes in the way they conduct their business .
For example , General Motors and Chrysler shut down hundreds of dealerships and reduced brands ; Citigroup and Bank of America cut tens of thousands of jobs and exited many parts of the world of finance .
In other words , we could face a very low upswing in terms of the creation of new jobs , and we may be facing a much higher level of joblessness on an ongoing basis .
Job losses may last well into 2010 to hit an unemployment peak close to 11 percent .
And then joblessness may be sustained for an extended period .
Can we find comfort in knowing that employment has long been considered a lagging indicator ?
It is conventionally seen as having limited predictive power because employment reflects decisions taken earlier in the business cycle .
But today is different .
Unemployment has doubled from 4.8 to 9.5 percent in just 16 months , a record rate so fast it may influence future economic behaviors and outlooks .
Bear in mind that the lackluster increase in inventories suggests that there 's little prospect in the pipeline of real growth in consumption , investment , and exports .
So the terrible state of the labor market is likely to be a strong head wind against consumer spending for a long time as wages and overall income growth are decelerating and households , within a fairly short period , will have received their full portion of the stimulus package .
How could this happen when Washington has thrown trillions of dollars into the pot , including the famous $ 787 billion in spending that was supposed to yield $ 1.50 in growth for every dollar spent ?
For a start , too much of the money went to transfer payments —
Medicaid , jobless benefits , and the like — that do nothing for jobs and growth .
The spending that creates new jobs is new spending , particularly on infrastructure .
It amounts to less than 10 percent of the stimulus package today .
Second , the stimulus package may have been well intentioned , but it was too small and too badly constructed to get money into the economy fast enough to replace lost consumer and business spending and to slow unemployment .
Workers ' pessimism is justified : About 40 percent believe the recession will continue for another full year .
As paychecks shrink and disappear , consumers are more hesitant to spend and wo n't lead the economy out of the doldrums quickly enough .
It may have made him unpopular in parts of the Obama administration , but Vice President Joe Biden told it as it is when he said the administration misread how bad the economy was .
The administration inherited the problem , but then it failed to understand how ineffective its solution would be .
The program was supposed to be about jobs , jobs , and jobs .
It was n't .
The recovery act may have been a single piece of legislation , but it included thousands of funding schemes for tens of thousands of projects , and those programs are stuck in the bureaucracy as the government releases the funds with typical inefficiency .
An additional $ 150 billion , which was allocated to state coffers so as to continue existing programs like Medicaid , did not add new jobs .
Hundreds of billions of dollars were set aside for tax cuts and for new benefits for the poor and the unemployed , and that did not add new jobs .
Now state budgets are drowning in red ink as jobless claims and Medicaid bills climb .
Next year , state budgets will have depleted their initial rescue dollars .
Absent another rescue plan , they will have no choice but to slash spending or raise taxes , or both .
The complete state and local government sector , which makes up about 15 percent of the economy , is beginning the worst contraction in postwar history in the face of a deficit gap of $ 166 billion for fiscal year 2010 , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , and a cumulative gap of $ 350 billion in fiscal year 2011 .
Similarly , households overburdened with historic levels of debt will be saving more .
The savings rate has already jumped from zero in 2007 to almost 7 percent of after - tax income now , and it is still rising .
Every dollar of saving comes out of consumption .
Because consumer spending is the economy 's main driver , we are going to have a weak consumer sector , and many businesses simply wo n't have the means or the need to hire employees .
In the aftermath of the 1990 - 1991 recession , Americans bought houses , cars , and other expensive goods .
This time , the combination of a weak job picture and a severe credit crunch means that people wo n't be able to get the financing for big expenditures , and those who can borrow will be reluctant to do so .
In recent times , Americans found myriad ways to fuel spending , even as incomes stagnated : borrowing against the once rising price of their homes and tapping plentiful credit cards .
No longer .
The paycheck has returned as the primary source of spending , and pay is eroding even for those who have jobs .
This process is nowhere near complete , and , until it is , the economy will barely grow , if at all , and may well oscillate between sluggish growth and modest decline for the next several years until the rebalancing of the excessive debt has been completed .
Until then , the private economy will be deprived of adequate profits and cash flow , and businesses will not start to hire .
Nor will they race to make capital expenditures when they have vast idle capacity .
In other words , there are many more reasons today to expect the downturn to continue than to expect a turnaround .
Consumer spending and residential investment could be even weaker than most estimates , and , as the level of fiscal stimulus begins its decline in the second half of 2010 , we may be facing an even more difficult future .
No wonder poll after poll shows a steady erosion of confidence in the stimulus measures .
One survey even showed 45 percent believe the limited results suggest they should simply be abandoned midway .
The disappointment is understandable — but that would only make things worse .
So what kind of second - act stimulus program should we look for ?
This time , it should not be an excuse to pass a lot of programs like those in the first stimulus package that do not really have the kind of multiplier effect on job creation and on economic growth that was intended .
In any event , given the trends , it is absolutely critical that the Obama administration not play politics with the issue but really begin to prepare a second stimulus program , so that if the economy does take a major downturn , it will be possible this time to provide much more rapid government support to infrastructure spending that will maximize the creation of jobs .
The time to get ready is now .

Cross John Ensign Off of the 2012 Hopeful List
Created : June 16 , 2009 17:52 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Chris Cillizza and Paul Kane report that the junior senator from Nevada , the chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee , will admit that he had an extramarital affair .
Two senior GOP political strategists , speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter , said the announcement was imminent .
They declined to say with whom Ensign had the affair .
Eleven years ago , Ensign voted to impeach President Bill Clinton on two counts related to the cover - up of his affair with Monica Lewinsky .
Five years ago , Ensign took to the floor of the Senate and said this :
Marriage recognizes the ideal of a father and mother living together to raise their children .
Marriage is the cornerstone on which our society was founded .
For those who say that the Constitution is so sacred that we cannot or should not adopt the Federal Marriage Amendment , I would simply point out that marriage , and the sanctity of that institution , predates the American Constitution and the founding of our nation .
Marriage , as a social institution , predates every other institution on which ordered society in America has relied .
We ’ll know later if he said this before or after his affair , although Cillizza and Kane note that Ensign took a short , mysterious absence from work in 2002 .

Microsoft has announced that it will ship a special version of Vista 's successor in Europe , titled Windows 7 E , without Internet Explorer 8 .
The browser - less version , a reaction to an antitrust investigation by the EU into whether Microsoft is abusing its dominant position with Windows and Internet Explorer , will be distributed in all member nations of the European Economic Area as well as Croatia and Switzerland .
Windows 7
E is reminiscent of media - player - free Windows XP N and Windows Vista N , which Microsoft offered in Europe also in response to an EU antitrust investigation .
Unlike the N versions , which proved to be very unsuccessful — as Europeans simply purchased the full retail versions and OEMs refused to include them on their systems —
Microsoft is not planning to offer a version of Windows 7 in Europe that includes IE8 .
This means that none of the versions of Windows 7 sold in Europe will include a Microsoft 's browser .
As first reported by CNET and confirmed by Microsoft , OEMs will have the option to add the browser back in , ship another browser , or ship multiple browsers .
" The E versions of Windows 7 will include all the features and functionality of Windows 7 in the rest of the world , other than browsing with Internet Explorer , " Microsoft notes .
" Computer manufacturers will be able to add any browser they want to their Windows 7 machines , including Internet Explorer , so European consumers who purchase new PCs will be able to access the Internet without any problem .
Consumers will also be able to add any Web browser to their PCs , to supplement or replace the browsers preinstalled by their computer manufacturer . "
Microsoft notes that the decision affects both OEM and Retail versions of Windows 7 products .
While OEMs will have access to a free " IE8 pack " that allows them to add the browser back in , consumers who purchase retail copies will not have a browser that they can use to download a browser .
Therefore , Microsoft will offer IE8 via CD , FTP , and retail channels .
It looks like Mozilla , Opera , Google , and Apple will have to do the same if they want European Windows 7 adopters to have access to their browsers .
Microsoft does not currently have plans to remove Internet Explorer from any versions of Windows XP or Windows Vista , nor from the Windows XP mode add - on for Windows 7 Professional and Windows 7 Ultimate .
Recently , the EU has been asking companies what they saw as the best way to remedy the browser - bundling situation , and was even considering a way to get Microsoft to bundle third - party browsers with the operating system , forcing users to choose which browsers to download and install as well as which to set as the default .
Microsoft was n't so keen on the idea of distributing third - party browsers , so it has apparently taken the matter into its own hands and decided to remove IE8 altogether , knowing that the EU already approved of the N editions .
This is n't what the software giant originally wanted to do , as it had previously argued in its legal filings with the EU that the browser was an integral part of the operating system .
With the release of the Windows 7 Release Candidate , Microsoft has made it possible to remove IE8 ( the beta did not allow this ) , along with many other Windows components .
[ W ] e ’re committed to launching Windows 7 on time in Europe , so we need to address the legal realities in Europe , including the risk of large fines , " says Microsoft .
" We believe that this new approach , while not our first choice , is the best path forward given the ongoing legal case in Europe . "
The European Commission is of two minds on Microsoft 's move , pleased by the possibility of OEMs being able to offer multiple browsers , but disappointed that Microsoft itself is not providing consumers with the choice .
" As for retail sales , which amount to less than 5 percent of total sales , the Commission had suggested to Microsoft that consumers be provided with a choice of Web browsers , " the EC said in a statement .
" Instead Microsoft has apparently decided to supply retail consumers with a version of Windows without a Web browser at all .
Rather than more choice , Microsoft seems to have chosen to provide less . "
The timing of this decision is quite ironic : the browser space has never been as competitive as it is now .
Furthermore , rivals continue to chip away at Internet Explorer 's market share month after month .
Still , third - party browser makers like Opera , Mozilla , and Google have been pushing the EU for tough sanctions against Microsoft .
Unless the EU has objections to Microsoft 's decision , it looks like new Windows 7 PCs sold in the EU will be IE - free .
Electrical engineer Martin Piotte and software engineer Martin Chabbert of Montreal decided to enter a million - dollar contest to improve Netflix 's recommendation engine after they read about it in a 2008 Wired magazinearticle .
Now , the duo is in the lead , having nearly achieved the contest 's objective of creating a recommendation engine 10 percent more accurate at predicting user ratings than the company 's own Cinematch system .
Team Pragmatic
Theory 's most recent submission , posted in the wee hours of Tuesday morning , shows a current improvement of 9.78 percent , giving the pair a slim lead over last year 's leaders , BellKor in BigChaos , a team that includes AT&T engineers , with Netflix ' seven - figure prize tantalizingly close to being won .
" For a long time , we were n't sure if 10 percent was even achievable , " said Piotte by e-mail .
" Now that we 're getting closer , it seems highly probable that it can be done .
Right now , we 're feeling very motivated and excited .
The focus for us is no longer ' if ' someone will make it to 10 percent , but rather ' when . ' "
He credits his team 's " ability to translate intuition about user behavior into usable equations " for its top position on the leader board , as well as accurate coding .
" In a sense , formulating equations for collaborative filtering is like the game of Go : Although the rules are the simplest possible , the depth and the complexity of the game is phenomenal , " he explained .
The home stretch , as the top teams draw near the prize - winning 10 percent marker , is proving difficult .
" They 're dramatically close to the finish line , but it 's kind of like the last 100 yards on Everest , where you 're low on oxygen , " said Steve Swasey , Netflix vice president of corporate communications .
" This is not easy , which is why whoever does this is going to get a million dollars . "
The rules of the Netflix Prize , initially offered in 2006 , are simple : Using anonymous user data provided by Netflix , the contest 's nearly 50,000 entrants , from 183 countries , are attempting to create an automated system that predicts how users will rate a sample set of films 10 percent more accurately than Netflix 's in - house system does .
Before claiming the $ 1 million prize , the winning team will have to share its method with Netflix and " describe to the world how you did it and why it works . "
Netflix , whose business revolves around the delivery of shiny discs , is looking for new ways to stave off growing competition from on - demand cable and internet video as it pursues its own streaming strategy .
A more - accurate recommendation system would help the company deliver more on - demand movies and television shows , in whatever form customers prefer , giving it a crucial advantage over the competition .
The teams competing for the Netflix prize shared their techniques with one another earlier in the competition .
Although they remain on friendly terms , according to Piotte , as the top teams have drawn closer to the magical 10 percent number they 're more reluctant to share their findings .
After all , $ 1 million is a lot of scratch .
This contest is the latest example of companies successfully crowdsourcing R&D work by offering a prize for the best solution .
Other examples include the X Prize for reusable space vehicles , and the DARPA Urban Challenge , whose winner once chauffeured me around in Las Vegas .
( Even Obama 's people are following suit , minus the cash incentive . )
The winners of the NetFlix Prize will grant the company a nonexclusive license to use their algorithm , meaning that after winning , they can turn around and license their algorithm to Netflix 's competitors — quite a generous policy , on top of the cool million it will pay to the winning team .
" It 's part of our belief that the internet should be open , " said Swasey .
" First , we want to verify for everyone that the code did what was claimed ; that means looking at it , " reads Netflix 's FAQ .
" And then we want to use it if we can .
We 're a business , and we want to make sure we can capitalize on the discovery .
But we do n't want to impede the winner ’s ability to capitalize on it as well .
Actually , we hope they can build their own business and license it to others as well .
That is the point , after all . "
Netflix 's rules originally forbade Quebec residents from entering the contest , due to a local law against contests involving money .
Luckily for the Pragmatic
Theory team , the company amended its rules after determining that Quebec residents are in fact eligible under the law .
When asked what they might do with the $ 1 million if they win , Piotte responded , " Il ne faut pas vendre la peau de l'ours avant de l'avoir tué , " which roughly translates as , " One should not sell the bearskin before the bear has been killed . "

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele has been roundly criticized by members of his party over his first 100 days in office .
GOP to rebrand Dems as ' socialists '
A member of the Republican National Committee told me Tuesday that when the RNC meets in an extraordinary special session next week , it will approve a resolution rebranding Democrats as the “ Democrat Socialist Party . ”
When I asked if such a resolution would force RNC Chairman Michael Steele to use that label when talking about Democrats in all his speeches and press releases , the RNC member replied : “ Who cares ? ”
Advertisement
Which pretty much sums up the attitude some members of the RNC have toward their chairman these days .
Steele wrote a memo last month opposing the resolution .
Steele said that while he believes Democrats “ are indeed marching America toward European - style socialism , ” he also said in a ( rare ) flash of insight that officially referring to them as the Democrat Socialist Party “ will accomplish little than to give the media and our opponents the opportunity to mischaracterize Republicans . ”
Two other resolutions — to urge Republican lawmakers to reject earmarks and to commend them for opposing “ bailouts and reckless spending bills ” — are also on the agenda , but language that would have denounced Sen.
Arlen Specter , a Republican turned Democrat , and Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins for voting for President Obama ’s stimulus package has been dropped .
Steele did n’t want the special session to be held at all .
The RNC will hold its regular summer meeting in July , and all matters could have waited until then .
But the special session is being viewed by some in the party as a “ comeuppance ” for Steele and an implied criticism of his performance and behavior in his first 100 days in office .
Exercising a rarely used party rule that allows any 16 RNC members from 16 different states to demand a special meeting , conservatives in the party forced Steele ’s hand , and now the special meeting will be tacked onto the end of a previously scheduled meeting of state party chairmen that will convene next week at National Harbor outside Washington .
A further comeuppance — a vote of “ no confidence ” in Steele — is not being contemplated , I am informed , because Steele ’s opponents in the RNC have already won a major victory by forcing him to accept greater controls on how he spends party funds .
Also , while there has been some talk about replacing Steele , few consider that likely , at least in the near future .
“ Without a Republican president to decide on that change , that wo n’t happen , ” the RNC member said .
But Steele is not a popular chairman within the RNC , and his recent statements that appeared to attack Mitt Romney and the Republican base have undermined his popularity even further .
Steele was elected to a two - year term as party chairman on Jan. 30 on the sixth ballot , but instead of quietly trying to consolidate power within the party and build up his image , he embarked on a publicity tour that included statements that some in the party considered baffling at best and incendiary at worst .
“ He has a tin ear , ” the RNC member told me when I asked him to name Steele ’s worst problem .
“ He has a tin ear when it comes to the building ( i.e. , the RNC staff ) , the RNC and the party . ”
Last Friday , when Steele was guest - hosting conservative pundit Bill Bennett ’s radio show , a caller suggested that Romney would have been a stronger candidate against Barack Obama than John McCain but that liberals and the media had pushed for McCain to win the Republican nomination .
The caller was , perhaps , not making the most intellectually rigorous of arguments , but in his answer Steele seemed to outdo the caller .
“ Remember , it was the base that rejected Mitt because of his switch on pro-life , from pro-choice to pro-life , ” Steele replied .
“ It was the base that rejected Mitt because it had issues with Mormonism .
It was the base that rejected Mitt because they thought he was back and forth and waffling on those very economic issues you ’re talking about . ”
Steele , who himself has said that abortion is a matter of “ individual choice , ” was opening old wounds not only by attacking Romney but also by suggesting the Republican base is bigoted when it comes to Mormons .
“ His job should be to get everybody to sit down and focus on a message for the party and then get them to be the messengers , ” the RNC member told me .
“ Steele wants to do the right thing , but he is clueless as to how the RNC really runs . ”

Here ’s how : set up a quiz application and throw on advertisements which promote IQ tests that you purchase through your phone and you ’ll be headed in the right direction .
That ’s the current state of the Facebook platform since Facebook is not aggressively policing it .
Yesterday I posted about the latest developer trick and a number of commenters came to the same conclusion : Facebook needs to enforce the developer terms .
The Race To The Bottom Started When The Platform Launched
Back when the platform launched , SocialMedia emerged as the leading ad network by providing crush advertisements which lead to somewhat misleading survey sites .
While Facebook told SocialMedia to stop displaying the advertisements , many other companies decided that they were going to keep using them , ultimately making things more difficult for SocialMedia .
Within a short period of time hundreds of millions of dollars were being generated through crush ads , and companies like Tatto Media , which later paid a $ 500,000 settlement , began raking in the cash .
While crush advertisements eventually saw a decrease in click through rates , the banner advertising networks continued to evolve their creative .
SocialMedia lead the charge with putting users ’ profile images in advertisements and many ad networks followed suit .
Tatto Media has moved on to other sites and as of Wednesday that company claimed to become the “ third largest ad network worldwide according to the March 2009 comScore Worldwide Key Measures Media Metrix report . ”
Now millions of “ satisfied ” customers can vouch for the valuable IQ quizzes that they ’ve signed up for , right ?
Why The Race To The Bottom Happened
Before you dismiss the value of social advertising , you first need to understand how the landscape emerged and what the general advertising economy is like .
When Facebook launched the platform back in 2007 , it was the beginning of a phenomenon which has generated the most advertising inventory for any single company in a long time .
No other social platform has come close to reaching the total number of users that Facebook has and the number of page views being generated by the site .
The result is that the value of the “ average impression ” has been reduced and as many published in the media , the CPMs began falling drastically .
So how on earth can developers boost their CPM ?
That ’s easy !
Install one ads from the most aggressive ad networks and you ’ll see your CPMs double at a minimum .
Many developers are even seeing drastic increases in CPMs recently as these networks become more prevalent .
That ’s why you ’ll see a number of hate comments in my article about aggressive advertisements last week .
The bottom line is that these advertisements work and they exist all over the web , not just on Facebook .
The difference however is that Facebook is trying to build a “ secure ” and “ safe ” environment for users in which they generate trust with each user .
Internet users already know not to click on every link they see on the web and they choose to avoid specific sites because they know they could end up with spyware or something worse .
That ’s exactly what Facebook needs to avoid because they ’re damaging users ’ trust .
How To Make A Business Out Of Applications
Not all advertisers on Facebook are misleading users however .
On Wednesday I posted an interview with Murti Hussain of Peanut Labs .
During the conversation I discussed how choosing the “ moral high ground ” has impacted his business .
He said business is booming and now he can count numerous large brands that are using their service for getting valuable market research completed .
Some of the ad networks which are pushing the limits also claim to be developing their own in house algorithms for optimizing advertisements but unfortunately those “ socially optimized ” ads ca n’t compete ( on a revenue basis ) with the aggressive ads .
So can developers build sustainable businesses without these aggressive ad networks ?
Yes !
If the developers have a long - term vision , there is a huge opportunity present but when short - sighted app developers are only focused on making a quick buck , there ends up being a bad environment for everybody .
Origami ( æŠ˜ã ‚Šç´™–oru means “ folding ” , and kami means “ paper ” ) is the art of folding paper to look like real - life objects such as animals , plants , flowers , etc .
This is done by using geometric folding and creasing , and the traditional method dictates that you not use any glue , tape , or cutting to assist you , although there are now certain origami designs that require it , plus you ’re only supposed to use a single piece of paper .
The surprising thing is that origami only uses a very few different types of folds and creases , but they can be combined into an almost infinite number of beautiful creations .
Now , we ’ve got a lovely instructional video here to get you started in origami by making a pretty , and pretty simple , origami heart for
your sweetie ( enjoy the talking hands , I loved that –that and the exceptionally clear and detailed instructions are why I picked this specific video ) .
Oh , and if you like this be sure to check out the little bonus I did to go along with this on how to make an origami money heart ( you make a little origami heart like below , but with a
dollar bill instead of traditional paper ) , here ’s the video :

BIRMINGHAM , England ( Reuters ) - Taunted by racists as a “ Paki ” and “ terrorist , ” Haroon bin Khaled spent his teenaged years feeling rejected by mainstream Britain and increasingly drawn to al Qaeda extremism .

But the young Muslim of Pakistani descent found an unexpected answer to his alienation the day he heard the story of how Muslim soldiers , many from what is now Pakistan , fought and died alongside Britons against the Nazis in World War Two .
Almost at a stroke , the jobless young man with an unpromising future felt a sense of belonging .
As he examined the facts , he began to shed his belief Britain despised him or that fighting with the Taliban in Afghanistan was a worthwhile idea .
“ Truthfully , it touched me , ” said the former gang member , now 21 and with a prison stretch for fraud behind him .
“ If that could be shown to other youths it could make a big difference . ”
That “ difference ” could be better community relations , hurt in the years after the September11 , 2001 attacks on the United States and especially after four young British Islamists carried out suicide bombings in London in July 2005 , killing 52 people .
It could also help security by dissuading Muslim men from joining the Taliban war against Western forces in Afghanistan , or from taking part in attacks at home such as the London bombings or attacks in Madrid in 2004 that killed 191 people .
“ WE USED TO ADMIRE THE TALIBAN ”
Bin Khaled is one of dozens of youths of Pakistani descent in the industrial second city of Birmingham to have attended a workshop by academic Jahan Mahmood that uses the Muslim role in the war to wean young men away from extremism and alienation .
Jahan says his presentation is intended to counter the notion of perennial confrontation between Christians and Muslims that al Qaeda seeks to present as an immutable fact of history .
Another attendee was Sabeel Saddique , 19 , who used to watch videos of al Qaeda beheadings on his mobile phone for kicks and still feels Britain does not fully accept him .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ I ’ve always thought that we were on our own , ” the burly former gang member said in an interview in the largely immigrant Sparkbrook district , a drab district renowned for drug dealing .
“ We used to think , ‘ Taliban - yeah ! ’
We admired them , we just wanted to be like them because everyone was always on about ‘ Muslims are terrorists ’ and it just used to make us angry . ”
Saddique said when New York ’s World Trade Center was attacked “ we all thought it was cool ...
But now I see it in a different way .
That ’s all just wrong .
It ’s killing innocents . ”
He still opposes Western armed action in Muslim countries .
But he says his sense of belonging to Britain and his distaste for al Qaeda is real and stems from Jahan ’s lecture , which showed “ what our grandparents have done for the country . ”
He just wishes white Britons knew that history as well .
“ We are part of this country no matter what , because we did fight .
You just do n’t feel like it , because the people do n’t know about it , and they do n’t treat us like we ’re part of it , ” he added .
Bash Arat Najib , a youth counselor in the nearby town of West Bromwich , said Jahan ’s workshop got a “ very , very positive ” reaction among the alienated young men he works with , many of whom are of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin .
Many often ask why they were n’t taught this information about the war at school .
“ The vision they had from school was Germany on one side , Britain on the other , and the Americans coming in at the end , ” he said .
“ They have no affinity with Britain though they may be born here .
But the soldiers ’ story gives them a sense of belonging .
It gives the missing ingredient of affection for the country . ”
The workshop tells how soldiers volunteered in the army of Britain ’s then Indian colony and fought in north Africa and Italy .
India ’s army grew from 200,000 in 1939 to 2.5 million in 1945 , with Muslims making up about a third of the numbers at any one time .
Most Muslim recruits came from what is now Pakistan .
“ A SENSE OF PRIDE ”
In all , 87,000 Indian army soldiers were killed in the war , according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission .
Jahan ’s study , which focuses on 5,500 Indian army deaths in Italy , fascinates its audiences because it breaks down Muslim casualties according to recruitment areas within British India , and then traces links between today ’s British Pakistani communities and the areas where recruitment took place .
Young Muslims specially identify with Jahan ’s finding that of the 122 deaths of soldiers under 18 in Italy , 90 were Muslim .
Among them were three 15 - year - olds -- Amir Khan , from Attock , Gulab Khan , from Rawalpindi , and Mian Khan , from Kohat .
In a lecture at Oxford University in April , Jahan spoke of a “ a pressing need to restore a sense of identity and self esteem for young British Muslims today . ”
“ If more was known about the contribution of so many Muslim soldiers of the British Indian Army , it would help to restore a sense of pride , cement the social bonds of different communities in British society , and turn the idea of a shared heritage into a meaningful weapon against prejudice , ” he said .
The workshop was funded by a state program called “ Positive Futures ” which supports local initiatives to help disengaged and vulnerable young people .
Susan Rice , the US ambassador to the UN , said that " based on past experience and a pattern that North Korea has of reckless and dangerous actions , it would not be a surprise if North Korea reacted to this very tough sanctions regime in a fashion that would be further provocation . "
Finally : free Xubuntu CDs !
Xubuntu users have long clamoured for their beloved Linux distribution to be available in Ubuntu ’s ShipIt service , but to no avail : Xubuntu ’s user base was too marginal and , as a community - run project , Canonical could not provide support for it .
Thus , they refrained from offering free Xubuntu CDs .
They still do , but there now is an alternative !
Xubuntu is from now on available under the Quick Ship service run by On - Disk.com .
As listed on the “ Get Xubuntu ” page , shipping is available for the USA and the rest of the world .
Unfortunately , despite the CDs being free of charge , you still have to pay for shipping them ( as opposed to ShipIt ) .
Still , for people suffering from a slow internet connection this is a great alternative , and the Xubuntu developers are very pleased that this service is still being made available to users .
I should mention expicitly , though , that this service is not run by the Xubuntu developers , neither is it run by Canonical .
This is an independent service provided by a home - based family business with heart for the open source community .
Pasi Lallinaho , who is currently “ the artwork guy ” of Xubuntu , has expressed interest in providing graphics for the CD to make sure they match the Xubuntu style .
Still , I think this is a great development for Xubuntu and its users , and I want to thank On - Disk.com for doing this .
There is nothing like science for giving that objective , white - coat flavoured legitimacy to your prejudices , so it must have been a great day for Telegraph readers when they came across the headline : " Women who dress provocatively more likely to be raped , claim scientists . "
Ah , scientists .
" Women who drink alcohol , wear short skirts and are outgoing are more likely to be raped , claim scientists at the University of Leicester . "
Well there you go .
Oddly , though , the title of the press release for the same research was : " Promiscuous men more likely to rape . "
Normally we berate journalists for rewriting press releases .
Had the Telegraph found some news ?
I rang Sophia Shaw at the University of Leicester .
She was surprised to have been presented as an expert scientist on the pages of the Daily Telegraph , as she is an MSc student , and this was her dissertation project .
Also it was not finished .
" My findings are very preliminary , " she said .
She had been discussing her dissertation at an academic conference when the British Psychological Society 's PR team picked it up , and put out the press release .
We will discuss that later .
But first , the science .
Shaw spoke to about 100 men , presenting them with " being with a woman " , and asking them when they would " call it a night " .
The idea was to explore men's attitudes towards coercing women into sex .
" I 'm very aware that there are limitations to my study .
It 's self - report data about sensitive issues , so that 's got its flaws , and participants were answering when sober , and so on , " she said .
But more than that , she told me , every single one of the first four statements made by the Telegraph was an unambiguous , incorrect , misrepresentation of her findings .
Women who drink alcohol , wear short skirts and are outgoing are more likely to be raped ?
" This is completely inaccurate , " Shaw said .
" We found no difference whatsoever .
The alcohol thing is also completely wrong : if anything , we found that men reported they were willing to go further with women who are completely sober . "
And what about the Telegraph 's next claim , or rather , the paper 's reassuringly objective assertion , that it is scientists who claim that women who dress provocatively are more likely to be raped ?
" We have found that people will go slightly further with women who are provocatively dressed , but this result is not statistically significant .
Basically you can't say that 's an effect , it could easily be the play of chance .
I told the journalist it is n't one of our main findings , you can't say that .
It 's not significant , which is why we 're not reporting it in our main analysis . "
So who do we blame for this story , and what do we do about it ?
Shaw said : " When I saw the article my heart sank , and it made me really angry , given how sensitive this subject is .
To be making claims like the Telegraph did , in my name , places all the blame on women , which is not what we were doing at all .
I just felt really angry about how wrong they 'd got this study . "
Since I started sniffing around , and since Shaw 's complaint , the Telegraph has quietly changed the online copy of the article , although there has been no formal correction , and in any case , it remains inaccurate .
But there is a second , less obvious problem .
Repeatedly , unpublished work , often of a highly speculative and eye - catching nature , is shepherded into newspapers by the press officers of the British Psychological Society , and other organisations .
A rash of news coverage and popular speculation ensues , in a situation where no one can read the academic work .
In this case I could only get to the reality of what was measured , and how , by personally tracking down and speaking to an MSc student about her dissertation on the phone .
In any situation this type of coverage would be ridiculous , but with a sensitive subject such as rape , it is blind , irresponsible foolishness .
Did David Beckham bring the crowd down on his own head Sunday night by taunting , challenging and perhaps even insulting Galaxy fans at the Home Depot Center ?
That was the contention of several fans Monday in the wake of the Galaxy ’s 2 - 2 tie with AC Milan in a sold - out friendly match in Carson .
It was Beckham ’s first home game back with the Galaxy after his five - month loan spell with AC Milan , and he was visibly angry at the anti-Beckham banners in the stadium and at the verbal abuse he received from those who question his loyalty to the Major League Soccer team .
Matters came to a head at halftime , when Beckham approached the corner of the stadium where the Galaxy ’s most vociferous support group , the Riot Squad , gathers .

A widely circulated video of undetermined origin shows Beckham confronting the crowd , pointing his finger at fans , and trying to climb over an advertising board to get closer to whatever angered him before being stopped by security personnel .
One fan , identified only as Josh , responded to whatever Beckham said by coming down out of the crowd .
He was collared by security officers , escorted away with one arm twisted behind his back , and later cited for trespassing .
“ One of the guys was saying things that really was n’t very nice , ” Beckham said after the game .
“ It was stepping over the line .
I said , ‘ You need to calm down and come shake my hand , ’ and he jumped over . ”
But fans on the scene strongly disputed that interpretation .

“ We boo a lot of players , ” Riot Squad member Ricardo Vigil of Los Angeles said on the video .
“ They do n’t come out and challenge our guys .
We ’re just here as fans .
He was saying , ‘ Come down here , come down here , come down here . ’
The guy came down there . ”
Eric Lewis , also from Los Angeles and another member of the fan group , had harsher words .
“ He called the guy out , ” Lewis said .
“ He called out a drunk fan .
How stupid is that ?
He ’s the player .
He ’s the professional .
He should have kept himself under control .
He did n’t . ”
Galaxy fan Jeff Austin of Highland Park , in an e-mail , described Beckham ’s actions as “ way out of line for a professional athlete , ” adding that “ anything that he says putting the blame entirely on the fan is nothing short of a complete lie . ”

In an interview with The Times on Monday , Bob Ramsey , a theology professor , minister and Riot Squad member from Glendora , said something had set Beckham off .
Ramsey said he had been surveying fans who were closest to the one who leaped over the wall .
“ I have n’t talked to everybody , but no one remembers hearing anything beyond ‘ scum , ’ ‘ traitor , ’ those kinds of things .
Nothing about his family , ” Ramsey said .
“ The thing that really seems to have triggered it is one of the guys was holding a Beckham jersey that he was kind of abusing , hitting it down against the wall , basically disrespecting Beckham ’s shirt .
Which is kind of an apt metaphor for what happened because he ’s been predominantly just a shirt - seller for our team .
. . .
“ We were giving him the business as soon as he came out for warmups , ” Ramsey said .
“ His first reaction was to give us a thumbs - up and I thought , ‘ OK , he ’s going to play along with it and just realize that we ’re going to kind of give him a hard time here and he ’s going to have to play through it . ’
Advertisement
“ I honestly think if he had done that everything would have been fine .
At halftime , he seemed to see something when he was running off the field and he came over and was challenging the guys in the front of our section . ”
Ramsey , and others , said Beckham repeatedly used particularly foul language .
“ Not to put too strong a point on it , but in Beckham ’s postgame comments , he ’s lying about what happened , ” Ramsey said .
“ There is no way that he was coming over there to shake hands .
‘ Come down here ’ . . . is not what you say to someone that you want to make friends with . ”
Beckham further angered the fans when , after setting up the tying goal with a corner kick , he turned to the Riot Squad and made a shushing gesture .
Advertisement
“ I think if he had just shrugged his shoulders , like , ‘ What can I do ? ’ that would have won us over , ” Ramsey said .
“ But the shush signal just put the knife in deeper .
“ My sense right now is that we might again give him the business in the Barcelona match [ Aug. 1 at the Rose Bowl ] , but when it ’s a league match and it matters , it ’s going to be over , unless there ’s a fresh provocation . ”
The Galaxy issued a four - paragraph statement Monday afternoon in which Bruce Arena , the team ’s coach and general manager , said , in part , “ We regret the incident that happened at the end of the first half ” but made no mention of Beckham ’s behavior .
“ While it is important that our fans remain free to voice their opinions , they must do so in an appropriate manner .
We appreciate our players and our fans ’ passion for the team , but we all must aim to hold ourselves to higher standards . ”

More than 100,000 stars in Kepler ’s field of view have been selected as ideal candidates for planet hunting ( Image : Carter Roberts )
Hard - up astronomers are raising funds for research by selling the only wares they have : the stars .
A nonprofit organisation has started an adopt - a - star programme to raise money for an international research consortium to analyse data from NASA ’s planet - hunting Kepler mission .
The programme , which is not affiliated with NASA , is called “ Pale Blue Dot ” to echo Carl Sagan ’s description of Earth as seen from space .
It encourages donors to pick one of 100,000 stars in Kepler ’s field of view that show promise for hosting planets .
Advertisement
For $ 10 , you – and you alone – can plant your personal flag in that star on Google Sky .
As Kepler makes new discoveries , you will get email updates about your star and its potential planets .
“ There are plenty of phony name - a - star things on the web , but I think we were the first scientists to use this sort of model for fundraising , and as a public outreach tool , ” says project leader Travis Metcalfe of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado .
“ We ’re trying to educate people about what the Kepler mission does , and to get them excited about the quest for other Earths . ”
Measuring sizes
The money raised will go to the Kepler Astroseismic Science Consortium , an international group of researchers who study the seismology of stars .
The group cannot get NASA funding to support its research because the agency can’t fund foreign organisations .
“ We ’re always short of funding , of course , as scientists , ” says consortium leader Jorgen Christensen - Dalsgaard of Aarhus University in Denmark .
The consortium will help the Kepler mission pin down the size of the planets it finds .
Kepler finds planets by watching for the dip in a star ’s brightness when the planet crosses in front of it .
Known as transits , these events can only reveal the ratio between the planet ’s size and that of its star .
To find the planet ’s absolute size , they ’ll need to know the size of the star .
Sound waves
But Kepler will observe some stars frequently enough that scientists will be able to detect pulsations in the star .
Convection on the star ’s surface can cause these pulsations by sending waves echoing through the star ’s interior .
“ We ’ll use those pulsations the way seismologists use earthquakes on Earth to measure the internal properties of the star , ” Metcalfe says .
Scientists can use pulsations to measure the radius of the star to within a few per cent , giving NASA a way to determine the size of the planet .
Pulsations can also help determine the stars ’ ages , which can help give an idea of how planetary systems form over time .
The researchers may even be able to detect non-transiting planets that the main Kepler team would miss , if the planet is massive enough to make the star wobble towards and away from Earth .
Stellar scientists see Kepler ’s data as a windfall .
“ We see this as a fantastic opportunity to get data on stellar interiors and stellar processes basically for free , because it ’s the same kind of data we ’re using , ” Christensen - Dalsgaard says .
$ 1 million
“ With Kepler ’s sensitivity , we ’ll get unprecedented observations of these variable stars that we ’ve tried to understand from the ground , ” Metcalfe says .
Christensen - Dalsgaard roughly estimates that the consortium will need about $ 1 million , give or take a factor of two , to pay scientists ’ salaries and bring them together at conferences .
If all 100,000 stars sell , they ’ll make exactly that .
Interest has been high so far , but Christensen - Dalsgaard doubts they ’ll sell all of them .
What about the planets that Kepler has already detected ?
Last week , the Kepler team announced they had detected three previously known planets , confirming that the telescope is operating as it should .
“ Those are reserved for a special purpose , ” Metcalfe says .
Initially he tried to get television personality Steven Colbert to adopt one , but the comedian has n’t responded .
Metcalfe is n’t sure what to do with those planets yet – but he says , “ it ’s gonna be good ” .
Summary : OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) is increasingly adopted and the latest dealings in Portugal give reasons for concern
MORE AND MORE countries have recently embraced OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) , despite Microsoft ’s many abuses that it declines / refuses to address .
Microsoft is still causing damage to ODF [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] .
Glyn Moody notes that the FSF has this world map of ODF adoption and Christian Einfeldt added to it ( in Twitter ) : “ Dear Linus , it ’s not that we hate Microsoft , but it is annoying how MSFT is still goofing up ODF . ”
Hungary is one of the latest European countries to embrace ODF ( Norway was probably inevitable ) , but one country we remain particularly concerned about is Portugal .
We wrote about it earlier today because of the government ’s intimate relationship with Microsoft .
According to this blog ( translation to English from Google ) , chances of ODF adoption in Portugal seem slim , so a Switzerland - like action may be needed ( see links at the bottom ) .
As Tony Manco from Portugal puts it , despite being warned for illegalities that they make , the people in the government just do n’t give a damn .
They continue as if nothing was mentioned . █

Adobe is , in my opinion , intentionally deceptive on a number of levels about the privacy - invading cookies that Flash stores on your machine .
These are NOT the cookies that get deleted when you clear your browser cache .
These cookies remain on your machine until you MANUALLY DELETE THEM .
And Adobe know that most users are not technically proficient enough to even find where they exist .
There is a good site that describes how to get rid of them here :
http://www.ghacks.net/2008/07/30/delete-flash-cookies/
The Flash cookies :
Stay on your computer for an unlimited amount of time
Store 100 kb of data by default , with an unlimited max
Ca n’t be deleted by your browser
Send previous visit information and history , by default , without your permission
This type of cookie exists on 98 % of global computers , across all operating systems .
it ’s the Adobe Flash Player .
The news about these cookies needs to be spread far and wide .
Furthermore , the lame website that Adobe provides seems intentionally designed to make you THINK that you are deleting these cookies , when in fact the folders in which they are contained - which list EVERY WEBSITE YOU EVER VISITED THAT USED FLASH - remain on your machine .
Moreover , when you clear your private data from your browser , THE FLASH SETTINGS ARE RESET AGAIN TO THE PRIVACY - INVADING DEFAULTS , AND THE COOKIES WILL CONTINUE TO COME IN .
I believe that Adobe is being intentionally and criminally deceptive about the privacy - invading nature of what they , in conjunction with the companies they obviously have some kind of arrangement with , are putting on your computer .
To get rid of Adobe 's deceptive privacy - invading cookies , go to the following locations on your machine , and MANUALLY DELETE THEM .
It is the ONLY way to get rid of the privacy - invading TRASH that Adobe puts on your machine , without your knowledge or permission :
Windows : LSO files are stored typically with a “ . SOL ” extension , within each user ’s Application Data directory , under Macromedia \Flash Player \ #SharedObjects .

But wait - there 's more !
Adobe goes one step farther - there is yet ANOTHER folder where YOUR ENTIRE BROWSING HISTORY OF WEBSITES THAT USED FLASH is stored :
On Mac OSX , to finally get rid of all the web history tracking that Adobe does , you must also go to the following location :
~/ Library / Preferences / Macromedia / Flash Player / macromedia.com/Support/flashplayer/sys
For Windows :
Application Data ( hidden file - be sure to turn on hidden files and folders in Windows to see it ) / macromedia.com/Support/flashplayer/sys
There you will find YET AGAIN , another complete list of all the sites you visited , and all the time you wasted dicking around with Adobe 's fake " settings manager " thing will not make a single bit of difference .
This is not the first time Adobe has been busted installing , without user knowledge or permission , spyware , and other items that " phone home " , for example , Photoshop , Dreamweaver .
etc .
They both phone home to a very shady , in my opinion , company , using an INTENTIONALLY DECEPTIVE IP address that mimics a local network call .
Just google " photoshop and spyware " to get the details .
Personally , I will not ever be giving ONE PENNY of my money to this company ever again .
At work , or at home , I am NEVER going to buy or download another application made by this totally , in my opinion , untrustworthy company .
If you need to edit photos , without scumware and shady companies that want to track your online behavior , download the open source tool called GIMP .
If you nee to read PDFs , there are loads of apps besides Adobe 's reader that will do the same thing much better .
I think these people belong in court to explain why they are so intentionally invading users ' privacy .
I hope someone starts a class - action suit against these dirtbags .
To the apologists who will come here and try to say how wonderful it is that Adobe tracks your every move on the Internet :
Go find someone who gives a damn about your moron brain - damaged alcoholic opinion .
Here is one you do n’t hear every day – exploding breast implants ( partially ) caused by flying .
Irena D. was on her way from Moscow to Los Angeles on an unnamed airline .
When she boarded the plane , she was not feeling too well , but things really got out of hand when she stepped off the plane and collapsed .
Apparently , one of her size F silicone implants had ruptured .
Doctors were quick to point out that the plane may not have been the main reason for the damage , but that the pressure difference could have accelerated an existing defect in the silicone product .
She is out of danger now , but is stuck in bed for at least a week .
Doctors explained that she wo n’t be able to have the breast implant replaced , though I ’m not enough of an expert to know why , nor was I aware that a simple defect in a silicone implant could cause it to rupture like this .
You really do learn something new every day .
Think Irena D made waves on her flight ?

The House Blue Dogs were formed under the basic premise of fiscal responsibility , but have morphed into a money - amassing machine , cozying up to industry to get more Blue Dogs elected to betray Democrats .
The latest , the details from the deal they struck with E&C Chair Henry Waxman have emerged , and they belie the claims of fiscal responsibility :
Despite Blue - Dog claims that a compromise they engineered Wednesday would trim $ 100 billion from the cost of health - care legislation , their weakening of the public option for insurance coverage could end up erasing those savings ....
They got the headlines they wanted -- " House Democrats Trim $ 100B From Health Bill , " The Washington Post wrote - but sources on Capitol Hill and outside of government say the changes to the public plan could actually increase the cost of the bill anywhere between $ 60 billion and $ 100 billion , wiping out all or most of the ostensible savings ....
The Congressional Budget Office has not yet made an estimate of how cost - effective the revised public option would be .
But The Walker Report blog , which has done detailed analysis of all variations of health care legislation , noted that the new public option is similar to that put forward by the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions ( HELP ) Committee .
The CBO was vague on how much the HELP Committee 's public option would cost , but Walker writes that it " would not be noticeably cheaper than private insurance or save the government much money . "
Politico , meanwhile , reported on Wednesday night that the savings lost by switching to the Blue Dog public plan would be $ 60 billion .
On the far end of cost - savings analysis is a June 2009 report issued by the Common Wealth Fund , a private foundation that conducts health care analysis and promotes a better performing health care system .
Titled " Fork In The Road , " the report concluded that a public option paying providers Medicare rates ( which are lower than any proposal put forward to date ) would produce savings for the government of roughly $ 3 trillion .
A public plan that provided rates somewhere between Medicare and private plan rates ( where the Blue Dog approach would likely be ) would yield only $ 2 trillion in savings .
As slinkerwink and shevas01 have noted , the CPC has protested this agreement , and met with leadership to reinforce their refusal to support any bill that does not meet the criteria they 've established for a public option .
Keep in mind as well that the bill E&C comes up with will be reconciled during recess with the Tri-Committee chairs , Waxman , Miller , and Rangel .
With enough pressure from the larger voting blocs of the progressive and minority caucuses -- who 's voting power is much larger than the Blue Dogs -- the Blue Dog provisions could be stripped out .
As if to signal leadership 's approach on this , Pelosi today blasted the insurance industry :
" It 's almost immoral what they are doing , " Pelosi said to reporters , referring to insurance companies .
" Of course they 've been immoral all along in how they have treated the people that they insure , " she said , adding , " They are the villains .
They have been part of the problem in a major way .
They are doing everything in their power to stop a public option from happening . "
Meanwhile , this is the thanks Waxman gets for negotiating with the Blue Dogs :
On Thursday , some of the Blue Dogs continued to stray , aligning with Republicans on amendment votes .
Waxman only narrowly beat back , 28 - 29 , one GOP amendment that would have imposed new identity proof requirements on Medicaid patients seeking care .
Five Blue Dogs voted for the amendment .
Waxman and other foes of the proposal said it would force people to provide proof of citizenship in the emergency room and deny them needed care .
They 're still enabling the Republicans .

Apollomania is sweeping the nation !
Well , not quite mania , perhaps just Apollostalgia .
That 's defined as showing an interest in the Apollo program history , while lacking the will to actually recommit to exploring space .
As we look at the 40th anniversary of humankind 's first setting foot on a celestial body other than the Earth , I will state clearly that Apollo 12 was the peak of the Apollo program .
Now , it 's true Apollo 11 is when humans first set foot on the moon .
It 's Apollo 11's anniversary , it 's getting the lion 's share of the attention right now .
But I maintain Apollo 12 , launched a scant 4 months later , was the most important moon landing in all of history .
Let 's review :
First humans set foot on the moon ?
That was Apollo 11 .
Biggest space rescue ?
Apollo 13 .
First seismic studies ?
And first golf shot ?
Apollo 14 .
First moon buggy ?
Apollo 15 .
First visit to the lunar highlands ?
Apollo 16 .
First geologist on the moon ?
Apollo 17 .
So what the heck distinguishes Apollo 12 , what makes it so tremendously important in the scheme of scientific history ?
Apollo 12 proved that landing people on the moon was repeatable .
It taught us that Apollo 11 was not just a fluke , not a single ascent
The moon became , with Apollo 12 , a viable , revisitable destination .
And if we can do it twice , we can keep doing it forever .
Science is all about repeatability .
A result observed just once is nigh useless .
At the risk of being repetitious , if it can't be repeated , it is n't science .
It helped that Apollo 12 was hit by lightning 36.5 seconds after launch .
Yes , helped -- it showed toughness .
Reliability .
Success in the face of adversity .
If a Saturn V can survive a lightning hit and still get 3 men to the Moon , why , nothing can stop us !
Nothing other than economics and politics , at least .
From a technical standpoint , the moon is a solved problem .
Apollo 12 proved that .
So I offer my thanks to Conrad , Gordon , Bean , and their ground crew , who showed us that the Moon truly can belong to anyone .

A Fresno hospital denied Teresa Rowe access to her partner Kristin Orbin who suffered a seizure and collapsed after Meet in the Middle 4 Equality march on May 30th .
The discrimination began shortly after the paramedics arrived .
Orbin described her ordeal on Examiner.com .
“ By that time , I was going in and out of consciousness .
The paramedics wanted nothing to do with Teresa and she had to practically fight them to be allowed to ride in the ambulance .
I remember one of them was very nice and agreed to let her ride with me in the back .
Once we got to the hospital , they wheeled me into a hallway and left me , refusing to allow Teresa to be with me . ”
Orbin said the paramedic told the nurse on duty that she had collapsed after marching 14 miles for civil rights , and the nurse gave her a dirty look and said “ ooooh . ”
She continued , “ I asked if Teresa could come back with me , but the nurse told me I was in a no visitor zone .
When I asked her why everyone else had visitors , she said ‘ those people are different ’ . ”
They refused to take my medical cards from her .
They refused Teresa ’s offer to have my advance directive and power of attorney faxed over from UCSF . ”
Orbin said she asked the nurses several times if Rowe could join her , but each time they refused .
“ They just kept looking at my Marriage Equality shirt and giving me dirty looks , ” she said .
Orbin and Rowe were not reunited until a doctor intervened a few hours later .
As a result of the incident the couple is considering legal action and has contacted the ACLU for advice .
There are laws on books here in California that protect not just gays and lesbians from this kind of discrimination , but everyone .
Except apparently , in Fresno .

Rathfriland fire station in County Down has been badly damaged in an overnight fire .
Two fire appliances were also destroyed in the blaze which was reported at about 0400 BST .
Twenty firefighters managed to bring the fire under control but it was well advanced when they arrived , destroying the appliance bay .
" It just goes to show that fire can attack anybody , " said fire service area commander Don McKay .
" We have measures in place to make sure that we have adequate fire cover in the area .
" So the local community need not worry - a fire appliance will arrive if they need one . "
Mr McKay said the incident was a little embarrassing , but said it was not the first time a fire station had been damaged by fire .
There was no smoke alarm fitted in the building .
A Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service ( NIFRS ) spokesperson said " the primary purpose of a smoke alarm is to alert the occupants at the early stage of fire and give people early warning to plan their escape " .
" Smoke alarms do not prevent fires , " the NIFRS spokesperson said .
" Rathfriland Fire Station is a retained fire station with no sleeping accommodation .
" There would therefore be no - one in the building overnight to be alerted to the fire by a smoke alarm . "
It was confirmed the blaze destroyed two fire appliances and caused extensive damage to the building .
" The appliance bay has been destroyed but firefighters stopped the fire from spreading to other parts of the building , which have suffered smoke and water damage , " the NIFRS spokesperson added .
" Four fire appliances , two from Newry , one from Banbridge and one from Warrenpoint fire stations attended the incident . "
The police are investigating the cause of the blaze .

We wish Governor Sanford the best . "
Prior to revelations of an extramarital affair that effectively brought an end to his political career , the South Carolina governor had been preparing to publish a book outlining his policy beliefs .
RHIANON – CELT GODDESS OF THE HORSES
The Horse Totem
The Horse Totem indicates travel and new journeys and directions in life .
They also represent a guide to overcoming obstacles , the advent of adventure and the spirit of personal freedom .
The Horse shows up in every cultures folklore and mythological symbolism .
The winged Pegasus , the legend of the Unicorn , the eight legged horse of the Norse God Odin and the Stallions of the Hindu Sun God and of Apollo , are but a few of the mysterious myths surrounding the Noble Horse .
There is also the myth of the Centaurs , who posses the upper body of a man and the lower body of a horse .
Horses are said to be able to sense those with magical powers and can see the good or evil in people .
They will warn humans of dangers from those who seek to harm them .
They are very intelligent animals and are sensitive to a multitude of human emotions from happiness to anger , and they respond to these emotions in various ways .
Horses were , for many centuries , the only form of transportation in the world .
People guarded and honored their horse as they did their family and homes .
They were cared for protected and venerated .
They have been the inspiration of countless modern and ancient artistic endeavors , books , poems , songs , and lore .
The legs of a horse makes them the powerful travelers that they are .
They are able to bear great weight upon their backs while running long distances .
They come in many colors and sizes .
They are the helpers and guides of humankind and much can be learned from their strong animal magic .
Horses have been bread for various reasons throughout the ages .
There are over 350 different breeds of horse and pony .
They are often bred for racing in modern times .
A stallion is the male , a mare is the female , a fowl is a baby horse , a filly is a young female and a colt is a young male .
They are long lived animals and can live as long as sixty - five years old .
Horses come in a variety of colors , including , brown , black , white , grey , chestnut , cream ; there are also the painted horses which display a variety of colors and the spotted Appaloosa .
They also come in many sizes and are sized by “ hand ” or the width of the human hand , from ground to back .
There are approximately seven - hundred and fifty million horses in the world today and while no longer a favored means of transportation they are a favored from of recreational activity .
People become just as attached to their horses in modern times as they did in ancient times .
To watch an Horse in the wild is to truly experience its grace and magnetism .
Their galloping flight is majestic and graceful .
The Horse possesses many virtues that are powerful and valuable and which any person would be wise to emulate or divine .
One who has the power of the Horse will see enhanced insight and intuition ; a better sense of self control allowing one the ability to use strong self - confidence to move in new directions .
Travel , friendship , devotion to family , nobility and grace are all part of this amazing animals totems .
The Magnificent Horse Totem possesses the following virtues :
Friendship , adventure , travel , new journeys , high - spiritness , stamina , mobility , freedom , power , loyalty , devotion , bravery , warrior spirit , faith , cooperation , inter - species communication , astral travel , warning of danger , unquestioning love , and overcoming of obstacles .

Death is the mother of beauty ; hence from her ,
Alone , shall come fulfilment to our dreams
And our desires .
— Wallace Stevens , Sunday Morning
What is love ?
Perhaps just one of the ways we shield ourselves from fear of death and dying .
From Vaughan Bell at Mind Hacks :
We have a burning instinct for life and yet we know , ultimately , that we will die .
We fear the one thing we cannot escape .
The question ‘ why live ? ’ has preoccupied thinkers from the alpha to the omega of human history , but only relatively recently have we considered the question of ‘ how ’ – how do we live with this fear , this knowledge of our own demise ?
We recognise love as our companion and protector and we now think that it may even shield us from death itself , at least while we ’re alive .
‘ Terror management theory ’ sounds oddly militaristic to the modern ear , but it was never intended to makes us think of politics .
It was developed by psychologist Sheldon Solomon and his colleagues to help explain how we live with existential angst .
The theory suggests we have various ways of keeping the fear of death out of our conscious mind , and of understanding what makes our life meaningful .
…
[ C ] lose relationships help us manage the anxiety of mortality , partly through the strength of the bond , but partly through the fact that romantic partnerships give us a symbolic way of transcending death – as families provide a way for our contribution to ‘ live on ’ after the final curtain .
The post links to studies showing that people reminded of their mortality tended to ascribe greater significance and intensity to their romantic and social attachments .
This behavior is consistent with the broader “ mortality salience hypothesis , ” which states that if an arbitrary belief serves to protect an individual from their fear of death , reminding them of their mortality will cause them to cling to and elaborate this belief .
( The underlying edifice , terror management theory , deals with the way in which human minds navigate the double - bind of being simultaneously aware of our desire to preserve our lives and the technical impossibility of doing so . )
The classical example of such a belief would be a religion promising an afterlife , though the hypothesis would work just as well with a belief in which a person was “ part of something bigger than themselves ” .
It also works just fine with a belief in which the individual , by dint of some combination of industry , sagacity and / or having been born in the right century , has a chance of not dying at all .
A prediction : life extension advocates might tend to increase their estimation of the feasibility of significant longevity enhancement after being confronted by reminders of their own finite lifespans .
( I know I feel a twinge even writing those words , so I suspect this prediction has some real teeth . )
Another prediction :
If love is a way of managing our fear of death , those of us who are dealing with that fear in other ways ( even rationally motivated and potentially productive ways , e.g. , working as biogerontologists ) might not need love as badly – basically , because we have someplace else to run when we ’re confronted by the Reaper ’s grim visage — and therefore form weaker romantic and / or family bonds .
Distressing , but testable .
General Motors is using its huge pension fund in a way it never intended .
It had planned  and put money aside  for a steady march of retirees over time .
But instead , tens of thousands of blue - collar workers , most in their 40s and 50s , are all becoming eligible for retirement benefits now , as the company rapidly downsizes .
And even as its pension fund faces this giant bulge in payouts , G.M. is not putting any new money in  the company is not required to make any contributions to the fund until 2013 .
The longer this goes on , the weaker the fund will be and the more uncertain its long - term viability .
For now , the pension payments to its younger “ retirees , ” part of a deal G.M. negotiated with the United Automobile Workers union in 2007 , allow the company to drastically shrink its work force without having to come up with the cash to pay severance .
The payments also relieve some of the burden on social service programs in the countless factory towns and counties around the country with large numbers of G.M. ’s newly jobless .
While some physicists are known for their hearty support of atheism , even they can have some personal dieties .
High in the physicist ’s pantheon sits Richard Feynman , due not only to his obvious smarts and good work , but also to an outsized personality chonicled in a wealth of popular writings ( and even a movie ! ) .
I ’ve always had mixed feelings about Feynman as a cult figurehead , however .
It ’s nothing personal against Feynman in particular , but about the hero worship he represents .
During high school or college , many aspiring physicists latch onto Feynman or Einstein or Hawking as representing all they hope to become .
The problem is , the vast majority of us are just not that smart .
Oh sure , we ’re plenty clever , and are whizzes at figuring out the tip when the check comes due , but we ’re not Feynman - Einstein - Hawking smart .
We go through a phase where we hope that we are , and then reality sets in , and we either ( 1 ) deal , ( 2 ) spend the rest of our career trying to hide the fact that we ’re not , or ( 3 ) drop out .
It ’s always bugged the crap out of me that physicists ’ worship of genius conveys the simultaneous message that if you ’re not F - E - H smart , then what good are you ?
In physics recommendation land , there is no more damning praise than saying someone is a “ hard worker ” .
Well , screw that .
Yes , you have to be clever , but if you have good taste in problems , an ability to forge intellectual connections , an eye for untapped opportunities , drive , and yes , a willingness to work hard , you can have major impacts on the field .
While my guess is that this is broadly understood to be true by those of us clever - but - not - F - E - H - smart folks who ’ve survived the weeding of graduate school , postdoctoral positions , and assistant professorhood , we do a lousy job of communicating this fact to our students .
I ’ve always suspected that we lose talent from the field because people opt for Door # 3 ( drop out ) when they face up to the fact that physics is frequently hard , even for very clever people .
The idea that you have to be F - E - H smart to succeed gives little encouragement to continue when the going gets rough .
( I have no idea if other fields have this same problem — my guess is that physicists are particularly prone to it , since we are trained early on to think that physicists are simply smarter than chemists or biologists .
Those other fields are for the hard workers .
We do n’t put mathemeticians on this scale , because we secretly believe they ’re smarter than us .
Note to the biologist lynch mob : tounge is in cheek . )
Anyways , I ’ve been thinking about this again in light of Po Bronson ’s excellent article in New York Magazine about Carol Dweck ’s research ( which I read via Nordette in Blogher is coming out in a popular book Mindset : The New Psychology of Success ) .
The article is focused on how to effectively handle praise for smart kids .
The upshot ( verified by a number of clever experiments ) , is that when you praise a kid for being smart in general , rather than for specific accomplishments or efforts , you risk paralyzing the kid with a fear of not looking smart , to the point where they will tend to shun challenges .
In follow - up interviews , Dweck discovered that those who think that innate intelligence is the key to success begin to discount the importance of effort .
I am smart , the kids ’ reasoning goes ; I do n’t need to put out effort .
Expending effort becomes stigmatizedâ € ” it ’s public proof that you ca n’t cut it on your natural gifts .
Repeating her experiments , Dweck found this effect of praise on performance held true for students of every socioeconomic class .
It hit both boys and girlsâ€ ” the very brightest girls especially ( they collapsed the most following failure ) .
While Dweck is working primarily with preK - 12 students , everything covered in the article rings true for what I ’ve seen at the higher levels ( both for myself , my colleagues , and students ) .
Those of us who are fortunate enough to sail through high school often crumple when the stuff we ’re allegedly good at finally becomes hard .
Whether you “ make it ” as a physicist after that has a lot to do with how you respond at that moment .
Do you take it as a sign that you ’re not cut out for the game ?
Do you feel like a failure , and stop enjoying physics as a whole ?
Do you buck up and forge ahead ?
( Like a neutrino , you ’ll probably wind up oscillating among the three mixed states for a while , before collapsing into one of them . )
I was most struck in Bronson ’s article by a description of an experiment by Lisa Blackwell and Dweck on the impact on performance of how one perceives intelligence .
In a science magnet school with low acheiving students , Blackwell studied 700 students , all of whom were taught a multi-session unit on study skills .
One half of the group , however , also received a “ special module on how intelligence is not inate ” :
The teachersâ€ ” who had n’t known which students had been assigned to which workshopâ€ ” could pick out the students who had been taught that intelligence can be developed .
They improved their study habits and grades .
In a single semester , Blackwell reversed the students ’ longtime trend of decreasing math grades .
The only difference between the control group and the test group were two lessons , a total of 50 minutes spent teaching not math but a single idea : that the brain is a muscle .
Giving it a harder workout makes you smarter .
That alone improved their math scores .
These studies have lots of implications for higher ed in the sciences .
Physics , with its strong cult of genius , is probably the canary in the coal mine .
Paul Krugman has looked at Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle and found it wanting .
First , he mistakenly calls it a " hangover theory " when , in fact , it is a theory of easy credit leading to malinvestments .
Second , he really does not understand that government cannot sustain a boom once the financial wave has crested .
Third , he has no understanding of the heterogeneity of assets , assuming that capital and other assets are homogeneous for the purposes of economic policy .
However , in his recent column , he did make a ( sort of ) reference to malinvestments .
He does not call them as such , but does make a reference to assets that could not be sustained in the boom :
Financial firms , we now know , directed vast quantities of capital into the construction of unsellable houses and empty shopping malls .
They increased risk rather than reducing it , and concentrated risk rather than spreading it .
In effect , the industry was selling dangerous patent medicine to gullible consumers .
Granted , this is pretty stern stuff from someone who called for then - President Bush and the Fed to start a housing bubble ( and then say later he only was kidding ) .
However , what he said has some truth to it , as it was not just the “ banksters ” that were selling the snake oil , but the “ elite ” economists as well .
( One remembers how Arthur Laffer excoriated Peter Schiff for sounding the alarm in 2006 . )
The other thing to keep in mind is that Krugman actually seems to be differentiating between assets that are sustainable and those that can not be sustained .
Can he be saying that assets and capital really are heterogeneous as say the Austrians versus the belief of Keynesians that assets are homogeneous , as the Keynesians claim in their policy prescriptions ?
( Indeed , that seems to be a fundamental tenet of Krugman ’s claim that " depression economics " changes the rules . )
Unfortunately , he never takes that statement to its logical conclusions .
Instead , he uses it as a lead - in to his usual point : banks must be both cartelized and regulated :
The huge bonuses Goldman will soon hand out show that financial - industry highfliers are still operating under a system of heads they win , tails other people lose .
If you ’re a banker , and you generate big short - term profits , you get lavishly rewarded — and you do n’t have to give the money back if and when those profits turn out to have been a mirage .
You have every reason , then , to steer investors into taking risks they do n’t understand .
And the events of the past year have skewed those incentives even more , by putting taxpayers as well as investors on the hook if things go wrong .
I wo n’t try to parse the competing claims about how much direct benefit Goldman received from recent financial bailouts , especially the government ’s assumption of A.I.G. ’s liabilities .
What ’s clear is that Wall Street in general , Goldman very much included , benefited hugely from the government ’s provision of a financial backstop — an assurance that it will rescue major financial players whenever things go wrong .
All of this is ( gasp ! ) true .
Indeed , the famed " Greenspan Put " always was in the back of the minds of the banksters when they were playing the high - roller game .
But , alas , Krugman does not seem to understand the logical implications of his statement ( again ) :
You can argue that such rescues are necessary if we ’re to avoid a replay of the Great Depression .
In fact , I agree .
But the result is that the financial system ’s liabilities are now backed by an implicit government guarantee .
Now the last time there was a comparable expansion of the financial safety net , the creation of federal deposit insurance in the 1930s , it was accompanied by much tighter regulation , to ensure that banks did n’t abuse their privileges .
This time , new regulations are still in the drawing - board stage — and the finance lobby is already fighting against even the most basic protections for consumers .
The problem , of course , is that government regulation creates real - live cartels that , while regulated , still are not going to serve consumers in a way that free - market firms would do .
As I have stated elsewhere , the " Land of Oz " banking system that Krugman so touts actually fell apart in the late 1970s because of inflation and its inability to deal with the new technologies that were waiting to have investments made .
Thus , it fell to people like Michael Milken and others who operated outside the financial cartel to set the stage for the high - tech revolution .
To Krugman the Keynesian , however , all of this is gibberish .
Economies grow , in his view , because people increase spending , and if people hold back and investors do n’t invest , then government steps in and fills the void .
It is all so easy — and all so wrong .
There is another way , called profit and loss .
In the real world , profits and losses serve as the bellwethers of regulation .
Furthermore , if financial firms know that they are not operating with the government covering their losses , then the investment decisions that they make will differ greatly from those made when the " put " is at their backs .
Unfortunately , Krugman and most other " elite " economists do n’t come close to understanding this simple point .
Instead , they really seem to believe that banking and finance are different , and must be both cartelized and protected .
So , while Krugman seems to understand , if only for a fleeting moment , that assets might be heterogeneous and that government guarantees create huge moral hazards , nonetheless in the end his Keynesianism bleeds through .
Like the Bourbons of France , he learns nothing and he forgets nothing .

Is it actually a faulty perception of time causing rowdy behaviour in children suffering from ADHD ?
( Image : Fotex / Rex Features )
CHILDREN with attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder might appear rowdy and indisciplined , but they are actually trying to cope with a faulty perception of time .
What to most of us seems like a short stretch of time would drag unbearably for someone with ADHD , says Katya Rubia of the Institute of Psychiatry at King ’s College London .
Her team ’s research , reported this week , adds to a growing body of evidence for the importance of time perception in a wide range of psychological …
Homeowners in one north Dallas neighborhood have a message for vandals : Stop the flag burnings !
So far , vandals have torched four flags in a neighborhood off Spring Valley and Preston roads .
Sunday afternoon marks the second time in as many weeks that vandals set fire to the American flag flying outside Marine Corps veteran Ed Jordan ’s house .
“ It takes a pretty low - minded person to do something like that , ” Jordan said on June 30 , after the first incident .
” To be that disrespectful , to burn the flag , I just do n’t understand it , ” neighbor Bill Sendelaback said .
“ I fully intend to fly this flag whether there is other flag burnings or not . ”
While the burnings are sparking outrage among homeowners , it ’s also sparking a renewed sense of patriotism .
Sendelaback has started flying his flag in light of the recent vandalism .
" It ’s kind of like an ' in your face ' to these punks that are doing this , ” he said .
“ I ’m letting them know there are a lot of people that value the American flag . ”
The first time Jordan 's flag was burned , a soldier from Coppell donated the American flag he flew on his base during two tours of duty in Iraq .
According to neighbors , Jordan decided to keep that flag somewhere safe , so Sunday 's torching was of a different replacement flag .

Open source software is created by enthusiasts for free
There is no doubt that free technologies , mainly open source software , are proving more popular both inside and outside the computer industry .
Behind this growing acceptance is a non-commercial movement of independent developers that are putting together the open source software that anyone can use .
Paul Allen , editor of ComputerActive magazine , said the defining feature of open source software was that the set of tools and systems were developed by enthusiasts rather than big companies .
But he added it should be treated as " free thinking rather than a free lunch " because it is not always free of charge .
Out of this movement have come fully - fledged programs , such as Open Office for e-mail , spreadsheets , word processing and presentations , and VLC for video , that were put together for free by a community of people .
" The entire source code for the software is made available to the community and anyone can modify it , " said Phil Andrews from open source software provider Red Hat .
' Catching up '
While the core software may be free to download and install , some companies are making money from open source by offering support services .
This can be in the form of a helpdesk or more technical aid to troubleshoot problems once the software is being used .
Paul Allen said open source is unknown to many computer users " In the same way that you would take purchase software and have a maintenance contract we supply a support contract for open source software , " said Mr Andrews .
Despite many businesses turning to open source and its use becoming widespread , it remains relatively unknown to the masses of computer users , said Mr Allen .
He said consumers were particularly unaware of the free versions of operating systems , largely Linux , that are available .
This could be because many appear in different versions that can look fragmented to those unfamiliar with them .
Beyond operating systems , many do use open source programs even if they may not know them as such .
" On the applications side , programs like Firefox and Thunderbird are immensely popular and are catching up Microsoft in some places , " said Mr Allen .
Many of the open source applications have millions of users .
For instance , statistics suggest that there are about 40 to 50 million users of Linux desktops , while Open Office has been downloaded 60 million times since October 2008 .
The browser Firefox has been gaining popularity with web users and the organisation behind it claims it now has 270 million users .
Lawful or not ?
Independent developers use some code from big firms
One factor driving the acceptance of open source software has been the success of small form factor notebook computers that shipped with a version of Linux installed .
One pioneer of this approach was Asus whose netbooks originally shipped with Linux and Open Office installed .
Now they are just as likely to have Windows XP and Office installed .
Mr Andrews believes the open source community could have made more of that opportunity .
" But when you have someone like Microsoft who suddenly decides they want that market - they have the war chest to take that market , " he said .
The growing popularity of commercial applications has driven the creation of open source equivalents - these are often based on other people 's software , Mr Allen said .
" If a company wanted to have compatibility with a certain type of device or service , it has to reverse engineer its standards , so they are actually breaking into the technology " .
" Whether or not it 's legal for them to do so , is not for me to say , " he said .
When big companies feel threatened by others tweaking their technology , they have been know to consult their lawyers , he added .

The grim but not unexpected housing data shows U.S. Foreclosure Filings Hit Record 1.5 Million in First Half .
U.S. foreclosure filings hit a record in the first half , a sign that job losses and falling property prices deepened the housing recession , according to RealtyTrac Inc .
More than 1.5 million properties received a default or auction notice or were seized by banks in the six months through June , the Irvine , California - based seller of default data said today in a statement .
That ’s a 15 percent increase from the year earlier .
One in 84 U.S. households received a filing .
The Mortgage Bankers Association said May 28 that prime fixed - rate home loans to the most creditworthy borrowers accounted for 29 percent of new foreclosures in the first quarter , the biggest share of any type of loan .
One in eight Americans is now late on a payment or already in foreclosure , the Washington - based mortgage group said .
Twenty of the 50 U.S. counties with the highest foreclosure rates were in California and 12 were in Florida , Realty Trac said .
“ I do n’t see any turning of the tide , ” said Donald Haurin , an economics professor at Ohio State University in Columbus .
“ The effect of more foreclosures will be continued downward pressure on house prices , and lead to difficulty making mortgage payments that are continuing to reset . ”
Payment - option adjustable rate mortgages will contribute to higher defaults , said Rick Sharga , executive vice president of RealtyTrac .
About three quarters of those loans will adjust to require higher payments next year and in 2011 , with the peak coming in August 2011 when about 54,000 loans recast , according to data from First American CoreLogic of Santa Ana , California .
More than 8.3 million U.S. mortgage holders owed more than their homes were worth and an additional 2.2 million borrowers will be “ underwater ” on their loans if prices decline another 5 percent , First American said March 4 .
Obama Creates Confusion
The Obama administration stokes “ confusion and delay ” among mortgage lenders when it announces anti-foreclosure plans before completing the program details , a Bank of America Corp. executive will tell Congress .
Announcing programs without providing the rules for how borrowers and lenders should proceed , “ creates immediate demand with insufficient lead time for operational readiness , ” Allen Jones , a default - management policy executive at Bank of America , said in prepared testimony to be delivered before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington today .
Borrowers are still awaiting the final details of a plan announced in April that would let homeowners rework home - equity debt .
Other elements of a broader plan announced in February have been slow to reach the public .
The administration said last month that the program , intended to help as many as 4 million people , had only extended modification offers to about 150,000 .
U.S. mulling mortgage aid for unemployed
President Barack Obama is mulling new ways to delay foreclosure for jobless homeowners who are unable to keep up with monthly payments , an administration official said on Monday .
But the official said the idea , which is still evolving , was difficult from a policy perspective and carries potential hazards .
It could help more people struggling with economic difficulty , but it also could create perverse incentives that distort the housing market , said the official , who did not want to speak on the record about internal administration debates .
" All these numbers keep going up .
We are not anywhere near the bottom , " said Jay Brinkmann , chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association .
The Treasury Department asked the largest 25 mortgage service companies last week to appoint a special liaison officer to work directly with government officials trying to stem defaults .
Voluntary And Involuntary Defaults Rise
Given that the Fed 's first mission is to delay , confuse , hope , and otherwise attempt to buy time while engaging in wishful thinking along the way , that Bernanke is willing to admit this may be a jobless recovery is a sign that things will likely be at least that bad .
In other words , prepare for a job loss recovery .
( Updates with death in Los Angeles )
WASHINGTON , June 1 ( Reuters ) - Cases of the new H1N1 flu virus have been found in all 50 U.S. states and tests have confirmed the virus in more than 10,000 people across the nation , U.S. officials said on Monday .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the confirmed tests represent about one in 20 of the actual number of infections , which would bring the total number of U.S. cases to around 200,000 .
In Los Angeles , health officials reported the county 's first death from the disease , a middle - aged woman who had underlying health problems .
The woman , whose name was not released , died in May and was one of 102 cases of the swine flu virus in Los Angeles County .
" Every death is regrettable , but given the number of H1N1 cases in Los Angeles , identifying the new H1N1 strain in someone who passed away with severe respiratory disease is not unexpected , " Los Angeles County Health Officer Jonathan Fielding said .
Seventeen deaths in the United States have been definitively linked to the swine flu virus , the CDC said .
It was not immediately clear if that total included the Los Angeles County case .
The virus , which spreads easily and causes mostly mild disease , has been diagnosed in 17,564 people in 64 countries , killing 115 , according to the World Health Organization .
It was newly found this week in patients in Bulgaria , Vietnam and Jamaica .
Although H1N1 swine flu appears mild , it affects mostly older children and young adults , and experts worry it could change into a more dangerous form .

He added that it was likely to have been copied from earlier drawings .
“ The image is somewhat based on Roelandt Savery 's 1626 image of the dodo standing by a rock .
We know so little about the number of transported live dodo specimens , and coupled with repeated plagiarism of images , factual determination is almost impossible to obtain . ”
Cameramen posing as tourists shot more than 250,000 photographs and hours of video , used by producers of Da Vinci Code prequel to get around ban on filming in Rome 's churches
How do you film a movie set largely in the Vatican when the Holy See itself has banned you from shooting within its walls ?
If you are the producers of Angels and Demons , the prequel to the church - baiting worldwide blockbuster The Da Vinci Code , you send in cameramen posing as tourists to take more than 250,000 photographs and shoot hours of video footage .
The team behind the new film , which is based on an earlier book by Dan Brown , used the surreptitiously - gathered material to digitally recreate many of the famous papal buildings , Tuscan colonnades , fountains and monuments within St Peter 's Square .
Special effects supervisor Ryan Cook told Italian film magazine Ciak : " The ban on filming put us in serious difficulty because we were not able to carry out the photographic surveys necessary to reconstruct the setting .
So for weeks we sent a team of people who mixed with tourists and took thousands of photos and video footage . "
The move was necessary because leaders of the Catholic church , still smarting from The Da Vinci Code 's assertion that Christ married and fathered children with Mary Magdalene , had banned the film - makers from filming in or around any of Rome 's churches .
Father Marco Fibbi , spokesman for the diocese of Rome , said at the time : " Normally we read the script , but this time it was not necessary .
The name Dan Brown was enough . "
Angels and Demons director Ron Howard hinted in an interview in December on US TV show Shootout that his team had been forced into unusual measures by the ban .
" We did n't shoot at the Vatican officially .
But cameras can be made really small , " he said .
The new film once again stars Tom Hanks as symbologist Robert Langdon , who finds himself in a race against time to stop a sinister secret society , the Illuminati , from destroying the Vatican using technology that harnesses antimatter .
Ewan McGregor and Stellan Skarsgard co-star .
The film is set for release in the UK and US on the 14 and 15 May .
Cracking down on medical industry payments to doctors , the Vermont legislature has passed a law requiring drug and device makers to publicly disclose all money given to physicians and other health care providers , naming names and listing dollar amounts .
The law , scheduled to take effect on July 1 , is believed to be the most stringent state effort to regulate the marketing of medical products to doctors .
It would also ban nearly all industry gifts , including meals , to doctors , nurses , medical staff , pharmacists , health plan administrators and health care facilities .
In practice , the new law would let Vermonters learn each year which doctors have been paid , and how much , by the makers of the brand - name drugs for which they wrote prescriptions  or how much money certain surgeons have received from the makers of the stents , pacemakers , artificial knees and such that the doctors implanted .
The action by Vermont has been watched around the country , as national legislators and medical groups look for links between industry marketing and health care costs .
The Obama administration has opened the way for foreign women who are victims of severe domestic beatings and sexual abuse to receive asylum in the United States .
The action reverses a Bush administration stance in a protracted and passionate legal battle over the possibilities for battered women to become refugees .
In addition to meeting other strict conditions for asylum , abused women will need to show that they are treated by their abuser as subordinates and little better than property , according to an immigration court filing by the administration , and that domestic abuse is widely tolerated in their country .
They must show that they could not find protection from institutions at home or by moving to another place within their own country .
The administration laid out its position in an immigration appeals court filing in the case of a woman from Mexico who requested asylum , saying she feared she would be murdered by her common - law husband there .
According to court documents filed in San Francisco , the man repeatedly raped her at gunpoint , held her captive , stole from her and at one point tried to burn her alive when he learned she was pregnant .
The government submitted its legal brief in April , but the woman only recently gave her consent for the confidential case documents to be disclosed to The New York Times .
The government has marked a clear , although narrow , pathway for battered women seeking asylum , lawyers said , after 13 years of tangled court arguments , including resistance from the Bush administration to recognize any of those claims .
" Now , you stop and think about this : 183 times , six times a day , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was waterboarded .
His lawyers never complained .
He did n't complain to whatever civil rights organizations there were .
And I 'll tell you , the bottom -- if somebody can be water - tortured six times a day , then it is n't torture , " - April 20 , 2009 .
" I just slapped myself !

NEW YORK - Six New York City mothers are suing the maker of a baby sex test that touted its product as " infallibly accurate , " saying the test results they received were wrong .
In papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court , the women claim they received incorrect results from the $ 275 Baby Gender Mentor test by Acu - Gen Biolab Inc. , of Lowell , Mass .
The suit says the test maker advertised its product as the " gold standard for prenatal gender detection . "
The company 's website says the test can determine a baby 's sex as early as five to eight weeks ' gestation .
Lawyer Barry Gainey says the lawsuit charges the product 's makers and marketers with negligence and fraud , and seeks unspecified damages .
Officials at Acu - Gen Biolab Inc. could not be reached for comment Monday night .

" Oregon companies ' pensions are in peril "
U.S. Bancorp and Weyerhaeuser try unconventional approaches with their pension money and get burned
Most investment gurus recommend balancing retirement savings invested in volatile stocks with stable bonds or cash .
That 's not what U.S. Bancorp does .
The Minneapolis - based bank , Oregon 's largest by market share , put 100 percent of its $ 2.9 billion employee pension plan in stocklike investments , its annual report showed .
The result :
The plan plunged from being 50 percent overfunded at the start of 2008 to 19 percent underfunded by the end -- a $ 1.4 billion loss .
Weyerhaeuser Co. does n't adhere to convention either .
It had 86 percent of its $ 6.9 billion pension in hedge funds and private equity .
The Federal Way , Wash .- based forest products company once boasted to workers that its strategy returned a stunning 17 percent a year .
Last year , the plan lost 40 percent , or $ 2.7 billion , of its value .
It went from being 40 percent overfunded to 7 percent underfunded .
In April , the company suspended its 401 ( k ) match .
Both illustrate the risks of aggressively investing worker retirement funds .
Most companies plug between one - half and two - thirds of their assets in stocks or equities .
They put far less -- 4 percent to 7 percent -- in hedge funds and private equity .
" It 's unlike other pension funds I 've seen , that 's for sure , " said Diane DelGuirco about Weyerhaeuser .
DelGuirco is a University of Oregon associate finance professor who has studied pension accounting .
Weyerhaeuser spokesman Bruce Amundson declined comment .
U.S. Bank spokeswoman Teri Charest , when questioned about the bank 's investment allocation , referred to the company 's annual report .
In it , the company said that while investing in bonds might lead to less volatility , it also " limits the pension plan 's long - term up - side potential . "
So , the bank 's compensation committee based its all - equity strategy on its plans ' " investment horizon and the financial viability of the company to meet its funding objectives . "
More corporate pensions , lured by high returns , have dabbled in hedge funds and private equity but none to the extent of Weyerhaeuser .
Such alternative investments pose different risks from stocks and bonds because they often require long - term commitments and their exotic holdings can be hard to value .
" Just by their definition , they 're not transparent , " said Jennifer Koski , a finance professor at the University of Washington .
" You can't know what 's going on inside of them .
So when you invest in a hedge fund , you basically end up investing in the manager .
To me that raises red flags .
In general , it violates my rule of ' Do n't buy anything you do n't understand . ' "
Weyerhaeuser loaned its pensions $ 200 million last year after some funds blocked withdrawals , or redemptions , leaving its plans with less cash than expected to pay workers wanting lump - sum benefits , the company said .
Workers did n't understand Weyerhaeuser 's strategy but were n't concerned because returns were high and the company was liable for any problems , one union leader said .
" The sense I got out of it is they were using their pension fund almost as a large hedge fund , " said Don Draeger , who represented 220 union workers at a former Weyerhaeuser plant in Albany .
" I do n't think any of us really understood the logic behind the instruments they were talking about . "
Federal law does not prohibit alternative investments , but it requires pension managers to invest prudently .
Still , federal officials have taken note of the practice .
U.S. Labor Department officials recently threatened to penalize a New York company unless it improved how it valued its pension investments in private equity .
Outside experts have recommended the agency develop guidelines for such investments , but not adopt new regulations .
" There 's lots of risks , " said Susan Mangiero , founder of Pension Governance Inc. , a research firm .
" But on the flip side , if you do n't look at ( investment ) alternatives like hedge funds , you may be leaving money on the table . "
Some economists allege companies use aggressive pension investing to inflate earnings .
A 2006 study by Harvard University and University of Chicago researchers found evidence that corporate managers facing mergers , worsening performance or large compensation contracts appeared to alter pension accounting to goose earnings .
Despite last year 's market turmoil , pension advisers think pension plans will turn even more to alternative investments to make up losses or to offset risks in stocks .
Hedge funds are responding by lowering fees and offering better reporting .
" We 're seeing hedge fund managers offer their existing clients more information on the underlying portfolios , " said Janine Baldridge , director of investment strategy at Russell Investments in Tacoma .
Weyerhaeuser has since sold mills in Albany and Springfield to International Paper Co. , which has one - tenth of its pension in hedge funds and derivatives .
" May was the best month we 've ever had in our hedge fund portfolio , " company pension manager Robert Hunkeler said .
Draeger is fine with Hunkeler 's plans to expand that strategy .
" At least when their investment managers talked to us , they gave you the feeling that it was n't just ' Trust us on this , ' " Draeger said .

Like all human action , our economic behavior is purposeful .
By this I mean we work because we want to achieve something .
We want to improve conditions .
We want to be more satisfied with life , and more happy .
Some are happy working for security and comfort , while others are happy working for creativity or independence .
Neither preference is right or wrong .
Most of us lay somewhere in the middle .
Value is ultimately subjective to your own personal viewpoint .
Someone may be willing to work 80 + hours a week because they like the extra money , while someone else may prefer to work only 20 hours a week and enjoy a more modest living .
Again , neither is right or wrong .
You have to ask yourself , “ What am I working for ? ”
However , sometimes we substitute our values for someone else ’s values without realizing it .
We are raised to believe that listening to our schools and parents is the only means to financial success .
We are told to be obedient , to adopt their world views , to go to college , get a degree , and then get a job that fits our studies .
That is the path of today ’s so - called “ American dream . ”
And if we are really good at following orders , we will end up with a decent salary .
However , renowned teacher John Taylor Gatto describes here how our learning institutions are designed to inhibit independence , self - determination , and creativity , and instead their purpose is to process children like “ human resources , ” and to categorize children according to the demands of the economy .
The problem with this arrangement is that we are conditioned and led to fulfill the economic vision of someone else , perhaps a corporate boss , or a politician , or a bureaucrat , instead of pursuing our own demands .
Of course , it is never easy to pursue our own demands , especially when we are so used to being cogs in a machine , not thinking enough for ourselves , and instead following some predetermined path .
Do n’t get me wrong – people are n’t automatons – we have our own free will .
But we often inhibit our own will from being expressed , often to avoid conflict , because we are afraid of the consequences if we step out of the current system .
This is why I would like to see a call to action among individuals who want to live more freely .
I want to see more people follow their own vision , become an entrepreneur , or organize with friends of family to create alternative sources of income and sustainability .
Do n’t leave yourself completely at the whim of some corporate executive or bureaucrat .
Be productive in a way that is meaningful to you .
This is why I tell people all of the time , “ build your career around your life , not your life around your career . ”
You have a responsibility for how you live your life .
You can choose to work underneath other people , even those who you despise , or you can choose a line of work that is more fulfilling .
Again , value is subjective , so i ca n’t speak for you on exactly what you should want .
But when I see people complaining about their everyday routine I have to ask myself , “ Why not do something about it ? ”
Here are some questions you may want to ask yourself to see if you should pursue a career change :
How happy am I with my current job ?
Do I believe in this company ’s ethics and the value they offer to society ?
Do I respect my boss ?
Do I get along with most of my coworkers ?
If something is lacking , is the extra income or security worth the trade - off ?
What are some realistic alternatives ?
If I could be doing anything I wanted , what would it be ?
Is there a way I can make a transition to something better ?
I ’m not saying you need to make a change , but it is never a bad idea to consider one .
Sometimes if we do n’t take a step back , we find ourselves pursuing long - term goals we never had any intention of pursuing .
Years down the line we may wonder , “ What was it all for ? ”
And to avoid this situation , we should live more consciously , by asking ourselves what we value and what we want .
Sometimes a more meaningful life can triumph a more economically prosperous one .
And other times a more meaningful life can even lead to more economic prosperity .
Those decisions are up to each individual .
If you find you want to make a major change , or you want to be a visionary , or an entrepreneur , try coming up with a business idea and seeing how feasible it is .
It may be the most liberating thing you can do right now .
If not , maybe just focus on the smaller changes .
Find out the little ways you can make your career more focused on improving your livelihood .
Try to negotiate better hours , or ask for tasks you find more interesting , or see if you can have any influence over the structure of the business , like new developments or projects .
Be more lively at business meetings , share your opinion , and be more concerned about the well - being of the company .
If you can take on a greater role , or if you can understand why your job is so important , you will feel more internally satisfied at work .
This is a big step in building your career around your own values .
The overarching theme in this post is to be more flexible about your career in a way that best suits your lifestyle and preference .
No more being a slave to hateful Mr. Boss , find a workplace where you fit in and feel productive .
I hope this helps .

It does n’t matter how you feel about it , whether you think it ’s ok , whether the thought of it repulses you , whether your god tells you it ’s ok or not , whether you think your kids will be negatively or positively affected by it .
As United States Citizens , we do n’t have a choice on whether to accept or tolerate it or not .
This is not about your choice or your vote , it ’s simply about the Constitution .
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states the following ;
Section 1 .
All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside .
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .
That ’s right , all citizens have the right to equal protection , it does n’t say all straight citizens and it does n’t say all gay citizens , it simply says all persons born or naturalized in the United States , in other words all citizens .
Now some people might argue that marriage is a church ritual that should not change to accommodate what they view as a sin , well the minute that marriage was given all the federal and state benefits that it now holds , was the minute it stopped being an exclusive right of the church .
Once rights are given to even just 1 person , those rights must be given to the other citizens as well , equal protection of the laws .
If the government wants to restrict the rights of a certain group of citizens , or even 1 single citizen for that matter , then the only fair thing to do is to restrict the rights of all citizens that are currently enjoying the benefit of said law .
In other words , take away all the federal and state benefits and protections currently afforded under the law regarding marriage and make it only a church ritual , only then can they call it their own .
WASHINGTON  The Senate has agreed to expand the definition of hate crimes to those committed because of a victim ’s sexual orientation and gender identity as part of a Pentagon policy measure that is becoming a magnet for tough social issues .
Senators added the anti-bias provisions to the bill Thursday night after voting 63 to 28 to shut off debate on the proposal by Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee .
The measure would also allow the federal government to intervene in cases where the local authorities lacked the resources for such criminal investigations .
“ We need a strong federal law to serve as a backstop to prevent hate - motivated violence in America , ” Mr. Leahy said .
Republicans countered that the hate crimes expansion should not be part of a Pentagon measure and argued that it would usurp the rights of states to pursue such crimes since most have their own versions of the law .
In a long anticipated and major ruling the high court in India has determined that consensual homosexual sex should no longer be against the law .
The ruling overturns the previous law known as section 377 which banned gay sex .
This historic ruling marks a new chapter in gay rights in the country that is home to over 17 % of the world 's population .
“ Discrimination is antithesis of equality , ” the judges of the Delhi High Court wrote in a 105 - page decision that is the first in India to directly guarantee rights for gay people .
“ It is the recognition of equality which will foster dignity of every individual , ” the decision said .
The ruling applies only to India ’s capital city , but it will force the national government to either appeal the decision to the Supreme Courtor repeal the law nationwide , lawyers said ( NY Times ) .
This ruling brings the total number of countries that criminalize homosexuality down to 84 .
The punishment for homosexuality varies in countries from prison time , fines , public humiliation , and in many cases the death penalty .
UPDATED : 9:44 p.m .
ANAHEIM , Calif . --
This will be remembered as the Indians trip where only the club 's luggage made it home .
In the span of this nine - game , nine - day swing through Toronto , Seattle and Anaheim , Calif. , the Indians traded four players off their big - league roster .
The fire sale culminated Wednesday in Cliff Lee , last year 's Cy Young winner and the team 's first 20 - game winner since 1974 , being sent to Philadelphia , along with outfielder Ben Francisco , for four prospects .
The biggest surprise of the trip was that Victor Martinez made it from start to finish .
There 's still a chance , however , Martinez could be traded before Friday 's 4 p.m. non-waiver deadline .
Boston , Detroit and Tampa Bay are among the clubs looking for a proven hitter .
The Indians waited 35 years for a Cy Young winner following Gaylord Perry winning the award in 1972 .
CC Sabathia ended the wait in 2007 .
Lee gave the franchise its second straight Cy Young award in 2008 .
Now they 're gone for eight prospects , none of whom are in the big leagues at this time .
The trading started in Toronto with right - hander Rafael Betancourt being dealt to Colorado on July 23 for right - hander Connor Graham .
Monday night , they sent DH / first baseman Ryan Garko to San Francisco for left - hander Scott Barnes .
The Lee-Francisco trade story broke Wednesday morning , before the Indians lost to the Angels , 9 - 3 .
The Indians did n't make it official until after the game when manager Eric Wedge told Lee and Francisco what they already knew .
The Phillies sent the Indians right - hander Carlos Carrasco , middle infielder Jason Donald , right - hander Jason Knapp and catcher Lou Marson .
Carrasco , Donald and Marson will report to Class AAA Columbus .
Knapp , currently on the disabled list with biceps tendinitis in his right arm , will report to Class A Lake County .
Shapiro said he made the decision to trade Lee because he was not convinced the Indians could contend next year .
He said Lee 's trade , along with the talent the Indians have added to the system over the last two years , will make them a consistent contender for years to come rather than taking a improbable shot in 2010 before Lee , Martinez and Jake Westbrook leave through free agency .
To keep Lee the Indians would have had to exercise his $ 9 million club option for 2010 .
Martinez has a similar $ 7 million option for 2010 .
" We are under no orders from ownership to move payroll or trim payroll , " said Shapiro .
Shapiro did make it clear that if he entered next season with Lee and , presumably Martinez , still on the roster , he could add nothing to the club this winter because of the losses in revenue the Indians have taken due to their poor record and subsequent drop in attendance .
" We would not have done this without getting compelling value in return , " said Shapiro .
Here 's how the Indians see their new players :
• Carrasco , 22 , 6 - 9 with a 5.18 ERA in 20 starts at Class AAA Lehigh Valley :
They believe he can come into spring training next year and compete for a job in the big - league rotation .
He throws 92 - 93 mph and has 112 strikeouts in 114 2/3 innings this year .
The Indians realize he has some work to do .
They also realize he 's 22 and pitching at Triple - A .
• Donald , 24 , .236 ( 49 - for - 208 ) with one homer and 15 RBI at Lehigh Valley :
He just returned from knee surgery .
The Indians plan to use him at second , short and third .
They expect him to compete with Luis Valbuena in spring training for the second base job .
They see him as good right - handed complement to Valbuena and shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera .
At the very least , he could be next year 's utility infielder .
• Marson , 23 , who had 17 at - bats with the Phillies this year , is hitting .294 ( 52 - for - 211 ) with one homer and 24 RBI at Leigh Valley :
He 's closer to catching in the big leagues than Class AA prospect Carlos Santana , who still needs another year in the minors .
Marson does n't have much pop , but he 's a good receiver with an average arm .
He could complement Martinez or Kelly Shoppach next year .
• Knapp , 18 , is 2 - 7 with a 4.01 ERA at Class A Lakewood of the Sally League : He has 111 strikeouts and 39 walks in 85 1/3 innings .
Without Knapp , the deal would n't have happened .
He 's still a long way from the big leagues , but the Indians feel he has the potential to be a front - of - the - rotation starting pitcher .
The Indians could have gotten outfielder Dominic Brown or Michael Taylor in the deal , but at the expense of Marson or Knapp .
The Indians wanted Knapp and feel they have enough corner outfielders .
That 's why they agreed to trade Francisco .
Ok , so many this is a bit of inside baseball for most of you — but for me , the thrashing death spasms civil war over at the Republican National Committee is just too delicious to not point out :
A battle over control of the party ’s purse strings has erupted at the troubled Republican National Committee , with defenders of Chairman Michael S. Steele accusing dissident RNC members of trying to “ embarrass and neuter ” the party ’s new leader .
Randy Pullen , the RNC ’s elected treasurer , former RNC General Counsel David Norcross and three other former top RNC officers have presented Mr. Steele with a resolution , calling for a new set of checks and balances on the chairman ’s power to dole out money …
The resolution prompted a top Steele supporter to issue a scathing attack against Mr. Pullen and his allies after they had asked Mr. Steele to support the “ good governance ” resolution at a special meeting of the full national committee set for next month .
The party spent about $ 300 million in last year ’s elections .
“ I urge you to reject this hostile attempt to embarrass and neuter the chairman of the RNC , ” Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus wrote in an e-mail to the 168 - member national committee .
I know that dancing on the newly dug grave of your enemy can be seen as a bit unseemly but , well , all I can say is that they did it to themselves .
I wonder how Michael Steele is feeling about his ultra-hip , postmodern push to re-brand the GOP using urban - suburban hip - hop flava ?
Update : Civil war breaks out in the Midwest too !
Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. ’s appearance at a Michigan county Republican Party event was scrapped this week after the county chairwoman said that hosting the moderate Utah governor would mean abandoning the party ’s conservative principles .
Kent County Republican Party Chairwoman Joanne Voorhees abruptly canceled the party fundraiser scheduled for Saturday .
“ The voters want and expect us to stand on principle and return to our roots .
Unfortunately , by holding an event with Governor Huntsman , we would be doing the exact opposite , ” Voorhees wrote in an e-mail quoted in The Grand Rapids Press .
Voorhees did not specify which issues she felt were contrary to the party ’s principles and did not return messages left at the party headquarters and on her cell phone .
The group Campaign for Michigan Families praised the cancellation , attributing it to Huntsman ’s support of civil unions , and urged the Oakland and Kalamazoo county parties , where Huntsman is also scheduled to speak this weekend , to do the same .
As John Cole opines :
Jon Huntsman , you all will recall , is the Governor of Utah , and who has an 82 % approval rating as Governor and is a very viable way forward for the current GOP .
But because he supports civil unions , he is n’t pure enough for the current GOP .
This is the big problem for Republicans .
The entire party apparatus at the state level has been taken over by a bunch of lunatics .
The reason Specter switched yesterday was because the dwindling band of sociopaths who still call themselves Republican in Pennsylvania are so detached from reality , so far removed from the mainstream , and so convinced of the utter infallibility of their own bizarre brand of “ conservatism , ” that someone like Jon Huntsman or Arlen Specter , who deviated slightly on a few issues here and there , just is n’t pure enough for them .
Update 2 : I ca n’t help quoting Dick Cheney on the GOP death spiral :
“ I think the GOP may well have some kind of presence over a period of time , ” Cheney said .
“ The level of activity that we see today from a political standpoint , I think , will clearly decline .
I think they ’re in the last throes , if you will , of the insurgency . ”
Oops , that was a shamefully misquoted clip from Cheney talking about the Iraq insurgency back in 2003 , not the Republican insurgency Rep. Pete Sessions instigated .
Evan Weaver , Lead Engineer in the Services Team at Twitter , who ’s primarily job is optimization and scalability , talked about Twitter ’s architecture and especially the optimizations performed over the last year to improve the web site during QCon London 2009 .
Most of the tools used by Twitter are open source .
The stack is made up of Rails for the front side , C , Scala and Java for the middle business layer , and MySQL for storing data .
Everything is kept in RAM and the database is just a backup .
The Rails front end handles rendering , cache composition , DB querying and synchronous inserts .
This front end mostly glues together several client services , many written in C : MySQL client , Memcached client , a JSON one , and others .
The middleware uses Memcached , Varnish for page caching , Kestrel , a MQ written in Scala , and a Comet server is in the works , also written in Scala and used for clients that want to track a large number of tweets .
Twitter started as a “ content management platform not a messaging platform ” so many optimizations were needed to change the initial model based on aggregated reads to the current messaging model where all users need to be updated with the latest tweets .
The changes were done in three areas : cache , MQ and Memcached client .
Cache
Each tweet is tracked in average by 126 users , so there is clearly a need for caching .
In the original configuration , only the API had a page cache that was invalidated each time a tweet was coming from an user , the rest of the application being cacheless :
The first architectural change was to create a write - through Vector Cache containing an array of tweet IDs which are serialized 64 bit integers .
This cache has a 99 % hit rate .
The second change was adding another write - through Row Cache containing database records : users and tweets .
This one has a 95 % hit rate and it is using Nick Kallen ’s Rails plug - in called Cache Money .
Nick is a Systems Architect at Twitter .
The third change was introducing a read - through Fragment Cache containing serialized versions of the tweets accessed through API clients which could be packaged in JSON , XML or Atom , with the same 95 % hit rate .
The fragment cache “ consumes the vectors directly , and if a serialized fragment is currently cached it does n’t load the actual row for the tweet you are trying to see so it short - circuits the database the vast majority of times ” , said Evan .
Yet another change was creating a separate cache pool for the page cache .
According to Evan , the page cache pool uses a generational key scheme rather than direct invalidation because clients can
send HTTPs if - modified - since and put any time stamp they want in the request path and we need to slice the array and present them with only the tweets they want to see but we do n’t want to track all the possible keys that the clients have used .
There was a big problem with this generational scheme because it did n’t delete all the invalid keys .
Each page that was added which corresponding to the number of tweets people were receiving would push out valid data in the cache and it turned out that our cache only had a 5 hour effective life time because of all these page caches flowing through .
When the page cache was moved into its own pool , the cache misses dropped about 50 % .
This is the current cache scheme employed by Twitter :
Since 80 % of the Twitter traffic comes through the API , there are 2 additional levels of cache , each servicing up to 95 % of the requests coming from the preceding layer .
The overall cache changes , in total between 20 and 30 optimizations , brought a
10 x capacity improvement , and it would have been more but we hit another bottleneck at that point …
Our strategy was to add the read - through cache first , make sure it invalidates OK , and then move to a write - through cache and repair it online rather than destroying it every time a new tweet ID comes in .
Message Queue
Since , on average , each user has 126 followers , it means there are 126 messages placed in the queue for each tweet .
Beside that , there are times when the traffic peaks , as it was during Obama ’s inauguration when it reached several hundreds of tweets / second or tens of thousands messages into the queue , 3 times the normal traffic at that time .
The MQ is meant to take the peak and disperse it over time so they would not have to add lots of extra hardware .
Twitter ’s MQ is simple : based on Memcached protocol , no ordering of jobs , no shared state between servers , all is kept in RAM and it is transactional .
The first implementation of the MQ was using Starling , written in Ruby , and did not scale well especially because Ruby ’s GC which is not generational .
That lead to MQ crashes because at some point the entire queue processing stopped for the GC to finish its job .
A decision was made to port the MQ to Scala which is using the more mature JVM GC .
The current MQ is only 1,200 lines and it runs on 3 servers .
Memcached Client
The Memcached client optimization was intended to optimize cluster load .
The current client used is libmemcached , Twitter being its most important user and contributor to the code base .
Based on it , the Fragment Cache optimization over one year led to a 50 x increase in page requests served per second .
Because of poor request locality , the fastest way to deal with requests is to precompute data and store it on network RAM , rather than recompute it on each server when necessary .
This approach is used by the majority of Web 2.0 sites running almost completely directly from memory .
The next step is “ scaling writes , after scaling reads for one year .
Then comes the multi co-location issue ” according to Evan .
The slides of the QCon presentation have been published on Evan ’s site .
People like to go fast and film themselves doing so .
Modern technology offers a variety of ways to both go faster than ever before and record that speed for posterity .
But for something to look fast on video , there needs to be a frame of reference for the viewer — something to hurtle past or whoosh by — and maybe even a hint of danger .
Here are a selection of videos of people doing just that : traveling at high speeds in cars , on train tracks , through the air , and down mountains in close proximity to traffic , large rocks , and thin atmospheres .
Most of these videos are filmed from a first - person perspective so that when you watch them , you can imagine that you ’re the one zooming along .
In 1976 , Claude Lelouch mounted a camera on the front of his Mercedes - Benz 450SEL 6.9 and drove through the streets of Paris — running red lights , jumping curbs and possibly reaching speeds upwards of 120 mph — before reaching his date near the Sacré Coeur .
The result is the film C’était un rendez - vous , 8 uncut minutes of insane urban driving .
Base jumpers equipped with wingsuits can glide very fast very close to the ground .
Perhaps the most insane videos on the page … they ’re not doing 1200 mph or anything , but they are awfully close to the ground with few safety options if they slip up .
The lads at Top Gear took the Bugatti Veyron to its top speed of 253 mph on a test track .
The test driver seems to have had what I would term a religious experience at the top speed .
Two gents in powder - blue suits speed down a California hill on skateboards .
Holy crap !
240 mph on a Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle .
Oh , and he does a wheelie from 70 to 140 mph .
( Note : Wikipedia says the bike has an “ electronically restricted ” top speed of 188 mph .
Either the owner a ) removed the restriction , or b ) tweaked the speedometer to display higher than normal speeds . )
In 1960 , Joseph Kittinger reached a speed of 714 mph after jumping from a helium balloon at an altitude of 102,800 feet .
A French TGV train reaches a top speed of 357 mph in a 2007 test .
A camera mounted on the external tank records the launch of the Space Shuttle Atlantis in May 2009 .
There ’s not a lot to whoosh past here , but at an eventual 18,000 mph , the pace at which the Shuttle leaves the Earth behind is astounding .
While skydiving , both of Michael Holmes ’ chutes failed as his helmet camera recorded his crash landing into some thick bushes .

Understanding Symbolic Links
What are they ?
Symbolic links are like shortcuts or references to the actual file or directory .
Most of the time these links are transparent when working with them through other programs .
For example you could have a link to a directory to one hard drive inside a directory that lies on a different hard drive and an application will still treat it the same .
Symbolic links are used all the time to link libraries and make sure files are in consistent places without moving or copying the original .
Links are often used to “ store ” multiple copies of the same file in different places but still reference to one file .
Creating a Symbolic Link
To create a symbolic link in Linux we use this syntax :
ln -s / path/to/original/ /path/to/linkName
What happens if I edit the link ?
Any modifications to the linked file will be changed on the original file .
What happens if I delete the link ?
If you delete the link the original file is unchanged .
It will still exist .
What happens if I delete the original file but not the link ?
The link will remain but will point to a file that does not exist .
This is called an orphaned or dangling link .
Creating a Hard Link
You can create a hard link like so :
ln / path/to/original.file /path/to/link.file
The Difference Between Soft and Hard Links
Hard links
Only link to a file not a directory
Can not reference a file on a different disk / volume
Links will reference a file even if it is moved
Links reference inode / physical locations on the disk
Symbolic ( soft ) links
Can link to directories
Can reference a file / folder on a different hard disk / volume
Links remain if the original file is deleted
Links will NOT reference the file anymore if it is moved
Links reference abstract filenames / directories and NOT physical locations .
They are given their own inode
Practice Makes Perfect
To really grasp the concept of symbolic links lets give it a shot .
Go into the tmp directory :
cd /tmp
Make a directory
mkdir original
Copy over the host .
conf file or any file to test with .
cd original cp /etc/host.conf .
List the contents and take note of the inode ( first column )
ls -ila
Create a symbolic link to host .conf called linkhost.conf
ln -s host.conf linkhost.conf
Now do list out the inodes
ln - ila
Notice how the inode for the link is different .
Now create a hard link to the same file
ln host.conf hardhost.conf
Now list the inoes one more time
ln - ila
Notice how the inode numbers are exactly the same for the hard link and the actual file .
Lets try some file operations now
Open up linkhost.conf and edit it and save it
Now look in host.conf and notice that the changes were made
Lets move host .
conf now and see if it causes any problems
mv host.conf ../
Uh oh , now when we list the directory our link turned red lets see what is in side it
cat linkhost.conf cat : linkhost.conf :
No such file or directory
It looks like our symbolic link is now broken as it linked to a file name and not the inode .
What about our hard link ?
cat hardhost.conf
Looks like our hard link still works even though we moved the original file .
This is because the hard link was linked to the inode the physical reference on the hard drive where the file resides .
The soft link ( symbolic link ) on the other hand was linked to the abstract file name and was broken the moment we moved the file .
This leads to an interesting question .
What happens if I delete a hard link ?
Even though the hard link is referenced to the physical location of the file on the hard drive though an inode , removing a hard link will not delete the original file .
Symbolic links will remain intact but will point to a non existent file .
On Monday , July 13th the C++ standards committee voted " Concepts " out of consideration for C++0x .
First , skepticism regarding the feasibility and usefulness of concepts intensified the antipathy towards this proposal .
Some people expressed concerns about compile - time and runtime overhead .
Second , the creators of the Concepts proposal tried desperately to improve and patch Concepts .
The last nail in the coffin was Bjarne Stroustrup 's paper " Simplifying the Use of Concepts " from June .
It 's a masterpiece in terms of presenting Concepts but it also scared folks .
The general sense was that concepts were broken , the committee was not sure what the correct direction was to fix them , and it would probably take several more years to come up with a reasonable fix that would achieve consensus .
Considering that Concepts were originally designed to simplify C++ , a critical mass of committee members agreed in July 2009 that it was time to bid Concepts goodbye .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A recession - driven income slide ?
Or a brand in terminal decline ?
Whatever the origin of its money worries , al Qaeda ’s latest appeal for funds reveals a group struggling with a fall in donations for its attacks on the West .
In an audio message posted in militant web forums on Wednesday , the group ’s leader in Afghanistan Mustafa Abu al - Yazid said militants were short of food , weapons and other supplies needed to fight foreign forces there .
The complaint , the latest appeal by Qaeda leaders in the past 18 months , echoes a June 3 request from Osama bin Laden for supporters ’ “ charity and support ” for the militant network ’s operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
So little is known about current al Qaeda operations that analysts can only speculate about the reasons for the troubles in its fund - raising , which provided an estimated annual budget of $ 30 million at the time of the 2001 attacks on U.S. targets .
But most agree it is a combination of tighter curbs on charities in the Arab world , a drop in lucrative al Qaeda kidnapping and extortion campaigns in Iraq and the wallet - thinning effect of recession on donors and sympathizers .
CASH SHORTAGES
Some speculate it also shows a drop in ideological support .
“ Money ’s in short supply .
It ’s a real issue , ” said Sajjan Gohel of the Asia - Pacific Foundation security think - tank .
Cash shortages are nothing new for al Qaeda , but this is its first in a deep global recession , and some suspect a period of penny - pinching may see the group rely more on local affiliates better able to tap funds in their own communities and economies .
Like - minded militants in Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen appear to have little difficulty in soliciting or extorting donations both at home and in the West and the Gulf , experts say .
“ Al - Qaeda leaders , unlike their Taliban hosts who are heavily involved in the lucrative drug trade , do not currently have significant financial resources , ” wrote Richard Barrett , coordinator of the U.N. ’s al Qaeda - Taliban monitoring team .
He said al Qaeda was now routinely telling followers that donating was a perfectly acceptable alternative to fighting .
While the direct operational costs of al Qaeda attacks usually run only to the tens of thousands of dollars , other activities such as training , recruitment , travel and communications impose substantially greater burdens .
“ Even the group ’s leadership in the Afghan - Pakistani border area must pay for food , living quarters , accommodations for families of fallen comrades , and security , both in terms of hiring guards and in buying the silence of their neighbors , ” Barrett wrote in a March article for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
The decline of al Qaeda in Iraq appears to have been a serious blow because it had sometimes provided funds for the group ’s leadership in the Pakistan / Afghanistan border region .
“ Iraq was very important for them .
The fact that they are doing less kidnapping , extortion and smuggling in Iraq means less money in circulation , ” said Paul Cruickshank , a Fellow at New York University ’s Center on Law and Security .
In a 2005 letter attributed by the United States to al Qaeda second in command Ayman al - Zawahri , the group ’s leaders sought $ 100,000 from Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , then al Qaeda head in Iraq .
Al Qaeda has denied the letter ’s authenticity but the intelligence community consensus is that it was genuine .
Without substantial funds , al Qaeda ’s clout is muted .
MILITANTS PAY TRAINING FEES
Robert Grenier , managing director of the Kroll corporate security company , said he suspected al Qaeda was still able to provide training , expertise and religious teaching to any “ home - grown ” cells in the West that sought such support .
“ But if al Qaeda central is not in a position to provide financial support as well , that makes their support much less potent and effective than it otherwise might be , ” he said .
The group has long garnered lesser amounts from aspiring militants who travel to northwest Pakistan to train .
In a study of al Qaeda recruitment , Cruickshank reported that a group of European recruits in 2008 were required to pay their Arab trainers 400 euros ( $ 563 ) a head , plus 900 euros for equipment and weapons , for a two - week paramilitary course .
They also had to pay 2,000 euros each to smugglers for transportation to the remote mountain refuge .
But the flow of donations from some charities and individuals in the oil - rich Gulf have traditionally been regarded as the largest single source of al Qaeda funding .
European Union anti-terrorism chief Gilles de Kerchove told Reuters in May that more needed to be done to combat money laundering that could benefit militants .
But Mustafa Alani , an analyst at Dubai ’s Gulf Research Center , said big improvements had been made .
He said : “ People now think twice .
They think about legal liability . ”
He and other observers said an apparent decline in popular support for al Qaeda among Arabs because of its brutal tactics in Iraq may also be having an effect on donations .
Grenier said he suspected the shift in opinion was taking place not just among the broader community but also among some individual financiers of al Qaeda who constituted a “ very informal and highly personalized ” source of funds .

BODY WEIGHT : 95 kg
Friday 13:00 : After about a week of planning my dealer  and I are getting ready to embark on an adventure of epic proportions .
We pack the car and do a final check of essentials .
We plan to attend a psytrance / music festival and consume some of and sell the rest of the following , over the 2 nights 3 days of the festival : 20 tabs LSD30 grams shrooms5 gram extracted mescaline 500 mg of 2c - b5 - 6 grams MDMA500mg DMT3grams Ketamine
What I ended up consuming myself : 5 tabs LSD10 grams shrooms1 gram extracted mescalineabout 100 mg of 2c - b1.5 grams MDMA3 hits DMT ( smoked , not sure of dosage , but I was fuckered up ) and lastly 6 bumps of K.15:00 :
We arrived set up tent etc. and consume 2 grams of mushrooms each .
They come on fairly quick and seem to be nice and mellow .
The rest of the afternoon was spent hiking in the mountains surrounding the venue .
We meditated on a rock at sunset and I felt good about obliterating my mind .
18:30 Upon returning to our tent the music had started and I was feeling very cool , my mind was at ease and my body felt good I had not had many visuals yet .
We consumed another 3 grams of mushrooms each and 3 tabs of LSD .
We decided to go explore the dance area .
I could feel both the LSD and the mushrooms fighting for dominance and had to lie down .
I explained to my friend dealer  who I will call D from here on .
I found a soft spot and lay back .
As my body hit the ground it felt as though everything was sinking in beneath me ( in a good way ) as waves of euphoria and that tingly acid sensation washed over my body .
I have no idea how long I lay there , but I traversed time and space in my mind , I was soaring with nebulas and dancing with the cosmos .
I eventually felt energetic and jumped up , a head rush followed that can only be described as my soul trying to pop out my skull .+- 21:00 I found D , after roaming around like a madman for I dont know how long .
He was happy to see me and handed me 2 more tabs of acid and gave me a cap of 2 c - b. I downed them all .
We went for another walk up the mountains .
It was pitch dark so we needed to bring a torch .
The torchlight on the grass was insane it kept jumping up and dancing in the sky .
We reached the rock we had meditated at earlier and I needed to sit down as I was feeling a little woozy .
As I looked around everything seemed a lot more evil than it was earlier , even Ds demeanor had changed .
I asked him something and he just mumbled back .
I had a sudden fear that a demon or something had dragged me here to this rock .
I kept seeing flashes of blood splattered every where , and I swore I could hear myself scream .
I was breathing very heavily , and D said I should sit down .
He took out some MDMA and said we should sniff some to clear the bad vibes .
I sniffed 2 medium sized lines , and almost instantly felt like a purple cloud had descended on me .
Everything was so happy and different to how it was not 2 minutes earlier .
I could talk easier and we even hugged for a few minutes .
We began talking about our lives and how him and I are so different , yet are the same people on psychedelics .
I swear I could feel his thoughts at this point .
I tried to explore this more but got a very sharp metallic taste in my mouth , and an intense headache .
We decided we needed some water and headed back to the tent .
01:00 We are back at the tent , and there are a few other people sitting around talking to the other people we met there .
I was surprised at how easy I was talking to people .
Eventually D decided we should all smoke some DMT .
I have only done it twice before , and was a bit unsure , but we went into the tent and he took out a pipe a lighter and a small baggie of DMT .
He said I should go first .
He held the pipe and lit the small amount of DMT sitting on top of some parsley looking stuff .
I inhaled deeply .
The first taste was the distinctly acrid plasticy taste of DMT , I almost vomited but managed to keep it all in .
I exhaled , but before the smoke had even left my mouth I could feel the pull of the floor .
The tent swirled like ice cream at a parlour and before I knew it I was engulfed in whiteness and marbled lines like the architecture of a distant world far beyond our understanding .
I could hear singing / ringing everywhere .
And could hear my name ( although it wasnt , but I simply recognized it as my name ) .
It was a womans voice and I tried to locate it , but there were patterns swirling everywhere in my vision , it was getting hard to focus on anything for longer than a second before it moved away .
There were pulsating ( not correct word , but closest to what I saw ) colours everywhere , bright yellows and oranges they were changing shades and eventually I managed to move past them and was met by a massive tower like structure , the womans voice was coming from inside the tower .
I tried to walk but was held back by something .
The colours were fading and as I turned to see what it was the tent became clear again .
I remember sitting up and I was sweating quite a bit .
I relaxed for the next 10 minutes trying to understand what was going on .
I tried to write down the experience , in point form but lost interest half way through .
01:45 I thanked D and left the tent to go walk around as I was leaving D shouted and asked if I wanted more drugs .
I said I would take some with me in case we got separated .
He gave me some more 2c - b and a capsule of MDMA .
I took the 2c - b and went to the stream nearby to relax and try to think .
I lay on the ground , I could hear frogs croaking , but they sounded like machines or something , I closed my eyes and focused on their croaks .
They seemed to get louder until it was unbearable , I screamed and they stopped .
In my head I imagined that my scream had ended everything .
I wanted to see what I had done , as it was so quiet , I could not even hear the sound of the music , only my heartbeat .
Instead I decided I would re-create the world in my mind .
At this point I became immersed in my own mind , I was creating the earth like a god it was swirling masses of rocks and I compacted them .
I formed mountains , I flew through canyons I was carving with my mind .
All in all I was the Universe , I was God , I was The Gods , I could understand everything that had happened , everything that was to happen and why .
I knew I had a place in the world , and that I was just as important as a god because I came from something resembling a god .
I gripped the grass around me tightly and ripped up handfuls of earth .
The ground was cold and damp , as I made the connection to what I had done , the frogs croaking became clear again , and I opened my eyes .
The first signs of dawn were clearly visible as orangey pinky glows in the distance .
I washed my hands in the stream and ventured off to find D . When I found him he told me I had been gone for about 3 hours .
I was surprised as I thought I had been gone about an hour tops .
We relaxed at the tent and spoke to each other about a lot of shit .
05:30 We decided to go for a swim and clear our heads .
I took the other MDMA cap and had another line , hoping to keep up a happy mindset as things were starting to turn nasty again .
I stepped into the stream and my feet felt like they had been dipped in liquid nitrogen , the sensation persisted as I went in deeper .
I washed quickly as it was freezing .
While drying myself
It felt like the towel was re-juvinating me while I rubbed it vigorously over my body .
I felt great .
I looked at D and we plodded off again .06:30
We returned to the tent and debated trying to sleep ; we decided it would be impossible .
We decided however that it was now time to go dance .
But not before some K. I had a small bump .
It burned a little .
It was beginning to take effect almost instantly as it felt like my head was expanding and floating at the same time I lay down and tried to forget about it .
I noticed small clouds in the dawn light of the sky , they comforted me .
There were disturbances in my peripheral vision , there had been all night .
These were different though .
I suddenly felt very uncomfortable and my head started to float away  again , I looked down at my shoes and they seemed like I was looking through binoculars backwards .
I immediately jumped up , wobbled and fell over again .
I was kneeling with my head in my hands .
I could feel my face moving further away from my head , I couldnt stop it .
I was trying so hard to keep it from disappearing , I imagined myself running after it like a kid chasing a helium balloon .
I cried out for D he came up and pulled me to my feet .
He kept saying it would be ok , I believed him .
He helped me walk to the tent .
I lay there for quite some time , playing in my mind .
I eventually felt good enough to stand up , but for some reason wanted more K. I had another 2 bumps and collapsed onto the bed .
For the next hour I was obliterated I cant even begin to describe the things that went on in my head .
The tent wasnt real , I wasnt real .
Nothing was real .
I watched the Universe being born and then traveled through millions of years of the Universes development in split seconds .
I arrived at the exact point I was at and jolted upright .
I got up and needed to go outside .
09:00 I went to dance for a bit and found D sitting playing with one of those you open and its a ball of interconnected plastic , and you close it and it like a star .
He gave it to me and I danced with it .
I felt so good , and could feel the MDMA slightly .
I asked D for more as I was enjoying dancing so much .
He gave me what was my last 2 capsules .
I gobbled them up and went to sit down as I felt sick , they hit me so quickly , it couldnt have been more than 10 minutes .
I jumped and danced for what must have been close to an hour .
10:30 I needed to eat even though I wasnt hungry , but I felt weak .
I opted for some fruit ,
It didnt taste of much , but I could feel the goodness coursing thru my veins .
After a fair amount of watermelon and some mango .
I was ready to vomit , so I walked it off .
I was feeling bouncy and lively , and danced for a short while , until my stomach started to cramp .
I needed to lie down .
I went to the first soft spot I had found the previous evening and lay there rubbing my stomach .
It felt so good , and was helping a lot .
I got up and went back to the dance floor D was gone .
I went to the tent and found him sorting out shrooms to go sell .
We sold shrooms and some acid for a while .
14:00
We got back to the tent after walking around and selling the drugs .
We decided the best thing to do was to eat some shrooms and veg out for the rest of the afternoon .
We both ate 5 grams each and lay in the shade waiting for them to take effect .
Most of the acid was still going but everything else had faded , the MDMA was still giving me very nice euphoria .
I felt the familiar leg spasms of mushrooms and the discomfort in my stomach .
My vision started to go all soft and hazy , I realized my eyes were trying to close , so I closed them and voyaged into my mind again .
I assumed D was going thru the same thing as he was quiet as well .
I tried to delve into my mind and as I traversed the corridors of my mind it became apparent that I needed to change .
I was a disgusting person , who had destroyed my life with drugs .
I argued with this thought and figured it could go very awry at this point .
I opened my eyes and the same evil from earlier had returned .
I was freaking out , I looked at my hands and didnt believe they were mine .
I looked at D lying next to me , he looked happy with a smile on his face , I was jealous I wanted to be happy .
I got up and went into the tent and lay down again .
Everything was closing in on me , I could hear people laughing at me outside .
The world was mocking me .
I closed my eyes and tried to break through this funk .
I came to the conclusion that I was feeling guilty because of all the drugs I had taken , and promised myself never to do it again .
I couldnt have been very honest with myself as the feelings of anger and guilt grew stronger .
D opened the tent and I almost fucking died of fright .
He burst out laughing , and eventually so did I .
I asked him if I could have more K to shift the focus of my trip .
He obliged with 2 small bumps .
I did one .
The same feelings as before persisted , but they were looping in my mind , I could look at them from another perspective .
I snorted the other bump and lay down again .
This time my mind collapsed in on itself , and I forget the details , but I remember the tent vibrating and the stretcher that I was lying on felt like pillows stuffed with polystyrene chunks , I rolled onto the floor , and lay on my stomach .
My stomach started growling , and mumbling I tried to listen to what it was saying , but it was obviously alien .
I even tried communication but failed .
I was cramping severely , and in a wave of brilliance decided my stomach was grumbling .
But then it spoke almost an English word .
For the next however long I was confused , angered and worried about my stomach .
I think I may have fallen asleep , because when I opened my eyes the feeling of the K was almost gone .
The mushrooms had mellowed out and D was nowhere to be seen .
16:00 I ate some more food and prepared myself for the mescaline and impending vomit from the come - up .
At this point I was unsure of proceeding with this ludicrous weekend .
D convinced me that we had gotten this close to infinity that we had to go on .
We spent the rest of the afternoon talking cod shit and mellowing out .
18:45 We prepared ourselves mentally for the mescaline and I took 2 capsules which was about 500 mg .
We went to dance while we waited for the mescaline .
I know it takes a while so I was not impatient .
The shrooms were still going slightly and my visuals were pretty and soft like cotton wool spirals .
We danced for about an hour , but my legs were starting to feel like lead so I sat down on a hay bail .
I could feel the mescaline coming on slowly and felt anxious .
It was like waves of warmth moving through my limbs .
My vision was getting sharper and I tried to focus on a piece of hay , I moved it around and it left long lasting trails .
I was definitely fucked on the mescaline .
As I became aware of the high , I felt sick and ran off to a tree where I vomited .
After I washed my face I surveyed my surroundings .
I was feeling really happy and noticed a crowd gathering near the dance floor .
I went over and there was a fire dancer show starting .
I sat in awe for at least 45 minutes , the flames seemed like molten gold and amber being flung around and controlled by some magical force .
I noticed D and called him over , he was well and truly high .
He was also amazed at the flames and we sat talking about how it warmed our souls to see something like that .
I asked one of the girls with the fire staff if I could have a go , she obliged .
I focused myself and tried my best to look confident .
I managed a few spins before dropping it .
I returned it to her , and was quite impressed , D was laughing , as he reckons I made the dumbest faces .
We both walked to the dance floor and just swayed in the awesomeness of the beats .
I had to go stand next to the speaker and feel the power of the bass .
The speaker set - up was 65 K turbo sound rig , and was fucking loud .
I pressed my back to one of the bass bins , and closed my eyes .
What came next was truly amazing .
It felt like I was floating .
I couldnt feel the ground at all I had to open my eyes to make sure I hadnt floated off .
My visuals were getting more intense and people were melting and moving to the music .
I focused on one girl in particular who was dancing like she was loving life to the max .
I watched her for ages , she was a goddess , a nymph , my ultimate desire .
I snapped out of it and lost site of her .
I had to find her I plodded off and eventually was lost near the stream , I have no idea how I had got there .
I lay down as I felt I might be a little overwhelmed .
I faded in and out of this reality and into the next , Orbs of good  were swirling around my head , they were almost humming a peaceful tune , although I could have been doing this .
I was in touch with myself , my inner beauty .
I was electric , and amazing I felt like I could shoot lightning from my fingertips .
I got up and had to find D to see if he was feeling amazing as well .
He was at the tent .
23:00
We had been chatting for ages about random things , and how psychedelics could really be the answer to a lot of the worlds problems , if anyone had ever felt like we did they would never want to harm anyone else .
Let alone destroy whole countries .
I had another bump of K for shits and giggles , it didnt do much apart from give me some disturbing CEVs of flashing lights and lightning .
D asked if I wanted to hit the DMT again , I agreed .
I sat on the stretcher and breathed deeply , he held the pipe to my mouth I inhaled held it and breathed out .
I could feel the smoke swirling in my chest and throat , I coughed and shattered my vision , I focused on one piece at it fell to the floor it was getting closer and I was almost right on it .
I kept falling and put my hand out to stop myself but was stopped by something .
I saw fractals of infinite complexity , lines so thin a million of them would fit into a single strand of spider web .
I heard the womans voice from earlier , it was very distant this time .
I turned and could see nothing but pulsating glowing colours and architectural fractals .
I turned once more and there she was , a woman naked and dripping water / mercury .
She was pure , she was beautiful .
I reached for her and tried to grab her hand , it was impossible to , she moved away as I moved towards her .
I was getting frustrated , she whispered the word no .
I felt happy as I knew now that she was unobtainable .
Slowly the tent was coming back and I could hear ringing in my ears .
I woke up slumped on the floor .
D was laughing , and said I was doing some fucked up things , like growling and shaking .
I lit the pipe for him , and left the tent so he could enjoy the privacy .
I couldnt believe how awesome I felt .
My soul was glowing with love and peace , it came of waves of euphoria that can only described as god touching me .
I thought back to the feelings I had on the mushrooms , and could understand them more clearly , they were dirty and horrible .
The mescaline explained  that I was not entirely ready for this weekend and that I was not to do it again as my life would indeed become dirty like those thoughts .
It continued saying that I was experienced enough to do it , but that anything in excess is bad .
I felt ashamed , and the presence grew stronger .
I could feel love , pain , anger , happiness , and all my emotions as one emotion it was given a word by the presence but I have forgotten it .
I was told that I have a lot to give to this world and should not let the pursuit of a high stop me from being the best person I can .
I agreed .
I snapped out of it as D walked up behind me .
He handed me another 2 capsules of mescaline and said he was going to go fuck out in the tent .
I took them and decided to go do the same .
05:00 I awoke out of a haze of unconscious consciousness .
I have no idea how long I lay there in tent for .
I cant even describe the things I had done in my mind .
I looked at my watch and freaked out , I had been lying there for the whole night .
I think my bodies tiredness was too much to handle .
I was still very clearly fucked on the mescaline and went to watch the sunrise .
I yanked D out of his sleeping bag , and we went up to the rock .
He was not talkative , and neither was I but we seemed to communicate without words .
We sat in awe of the sunrise .
He pulled out the rest of the K and I refused any more .
He had a bump and we both just sat in silence for what seemed like ages , I could see ants working , bugs doing there thing , and suddenly felt guilty about work .
Which was the next day .
I put it out my mind and continued to watch things going about their comical business .
For the rest of the morning we didnt do much apart from smoke a few joints and eat some food .
D was convinced some of his soul had been stolen .
I on the other hand felt like my soul had been given a second chance , another chance to be great .
I told him he was being silly and that it was probably the K .
He agreed , and started laughing .
I said we should do it again next week jokingly , I think he almost fell off his chair , until I said it was a joke .
He seemed very serious , and I was starting to feel uncomfortable .
I said I was going to bathe in the stream .
When I returned everyone was packing up , I helped and we left shortly afterwards .
I was still very high in the car on the way home and watched as the scenery flitted by .
I was relieved to get home , and have a shower .
I felt like the shower cleansed me inside .
I thought back to what the mescaline had told me and smiled .
I knew I would be ok .
I watched tv for the rest of the day until I fell fast asleep .
Conclusion : I feel I seriously over did it , but things like this dont happen very often .
I will be taking a years break from psychedelics , and hope to only do Mescaline and LSD when I start again .
I came to the realization , that although psychedelics can reveal truths about myself and the world , it is still a drug , and will be used in the pursuit of a high .
I vow never to look at psychedelics in this way again , and treat them with the respect they deserve .
Police will soon be able to arrest people who do n't leave town under mandatory evacuation orders thanks to a new state law that goes into effect in the heart of Texas ' hurricane season .
The law was passed this year and is effective Sept.
1 . It also applies to other disasters , such as fires or floods .
As it stands , officials can't compel people to evacuate .
They can only warn that those who stay behind wo n't have any emergency services at their disposal .
The Corpus Christi Caller - Times reports the new law gives county judges and mayors the power to authorize use of " reasonable force " to remove people from the area .

Rochelle and Adam Wallis in Wales . ( ( CBC ) )
A Canadian woman faces deportation from the United Kingdom and an 18 - month separation from her husband because of a British law aimed at preventing forced marriages .
Rochelle Wallis , 19 , says her life is in flux after learning she may have to leave her husband , Adam , and their new home in Wales until she turns 21 in 2011 .
" It 's quite scary .
I mean , I 'm living on edge because I do n't know if they 're going to turn up at six o'clock in the morning and chuck me out of the country , " she said .
The pair decided to get married last year when she visited him in his village of Pontrhydygroes , Wales .
The couple met two years earlier in Canada and remained in touch .
They applied to be married a month before her six - month visa expired , but wedding plans had to be delayed after officials lost their passport photos .
By the time the couple married in November 2008 , she had outstayed her visa , meaning she would have to return to Canada and apply for a spousal visa before coming back to Wales .
However , under the U.K.'s new Forced Marriages
Act , if she left Britain , she would n't be allowed to return until she was 21 .
The law is supposed to protect women — primarily from South Asia — from being forced into an arranged marriage .
Women from outside the European Union must be at least 21 years old before they are permitted to join their husbands in the U.K .
The couple can move to another EU country and live together .
MP supports couple
A letter from the U.K. Border Agency called the 18 - month separation an " inconvenience " for the couple .
British officials told BBC she now faces deportation because she overstayed her visa .
The couple have written to their MP , Mark Williams , and their situation has also caught the attention of Keith Vaz , the MP who chairs the British Parliament 's home affairs committee .
Vaz says this was clearly not a forced marriage and he 's prepared to take up the Wallis case .
" Sometimes when legislation is passed for a good reason , with all the best intentions of the world , it has the consequence that was totally unintended , " said Vaz .
Rochelle Wallis does n't dispute the fact that she overstayed her visa , but says they were n't warned about the new law when their marriage licence was approved .
" We found out through our own research because nobody told us that they had enforced the law four days after we got married , " she said .
" It 's not right .
There should n't be an age limit on when I should and should not be able to get married and be in love . "
She says the MPs have been helpful .
" They ’ve been very supportive and they ’ve done a lot with us and they ’ve just been really great , " she said .
Rochelle Wallis says moving as a couple to Canada for 18 months is n't really an option because they do n't have jobs there .
Adam Wallis , 28 , recently got a job as an electrical technician in Wales , Britain 's Guardian newspaper reported .
China has been in a bind for a while .
Thanks to its smart strategy of lending us money to buy its products and services , China owns $ 2.2 trillion in Treasuries and other foreign paper .
This makes China rich , but it has also left it exposed to getting clobbered if inflation destroys the value of the dollar .
If China starts dumping Treasuries to protect itself from inflation , meanwhile , it will destroy the value of the rest of the paper it holds .
So now China has a new plan .
Use those dollars to buy stuff .
Companies , land , natural resources , you name it .
Smart !
The moment China tries to buy stuff in the US , of course , everyone will freak .
We 're cool with European countries buying up our companies , resources , and land , but when Asian or Middle Eastern countries start doing it , we scream in horror and outrage ( recall when China 's CNOOC tried to buy our rinky dink oil company Unocal a few years back , as well as the Japan - is - buying - us ! scare of the late 1980s ) .
So , for the time being , most of China 's buying will likely take place elsewhere in the world .
As least until we wake up and realize that China 's money ( which used to be our money , before we sent it to them ) is green , and that if we want to get the highest price for our land , companies , and resources , we might want to open our market to them .
John Mauldin explains China 's new plan :
The important news out of China this week was the assertion that China was getting ready to use its massive $ 2.2 trillion reserves .
From the Financial Times :
" Beijing will use its foreign exchange reserves , the largest in the world , to support and accelerate overseas expansion and acquisitions by Chinese companies , Wen Jiabao , the country 's premier , said in comments published on Tuesday .
' We should hasten the implementation of our " going out " strategy and combine the utilization of foreign exchange reserves with the " going out " of our enterprises , ' he told Chinese diplomats late on Monday .
Mr. Wen said Beijing also wanted Chinese companies to increase its share of global exports .
The ' going out ' strategy is a slogan for encouraging investment and acquisitions abroad , particularly by big state - owned industrial groups such as PetroChina , Chinalco , China Telecom and Bank of China . "
This is a very big deal , and from the Chinese point of view , quite smart .
Right now they are stuck with $ 2 trillion in US Treasuries , agency paper , etc .
They can't sell their dollars without really hurting the dollar , thereby forcing the renminbi to rise and hurting their own exports .
But they , and much of the world , feel that the US is pursuing policies that are going to be harmful to the value of the dollar and therefore to China 's largest reserve exposure .
What to do ?
Take those dollars and buy physical assets .
Companies , natural resources , maybe a few small countries .
( To my Chinese readers : that 's a joke , although some in the West worry about that . )
In the card game called Old Maid we played as kids , the loser was the one who ended up with the " Old Maid " at the end of the game .
For the past decade , the Chinese sent us " stuff " and we sent them dollars in the form of electrons .
They in turn invested those dollars in our debt so we could buy more stuff .
It was a form of vendor financing .
And now the Chinese have apparently decided to pass the Old Maid of the dollar on to other parties , who will sell them their assets for dollars .
Seriously , did anyone not think they would do this ?
Massively selling the dollar , which so many conspiracy - theory types keep saying they will , was never really a rational option .
But using those dollars to acquire productive assets ?
Very smart , very rational .
If you figure out what they want to buy and get there first , there are profits to be had .
Attention should be paid .
$ 2.2 trillion in reserves and growing can cover a lot of economic sins and bad bank loans .
It can buy time for the companies with too much production capacity in China to find new customers .
Will it be a smooth ride ?
Of course not .
There will be a lot of bankrupt companies and a lot of angst among the entrepreneurial class .
That is part of the process .
But in five or ten years , China will be larger and stronger than it is today .
Count on it .

“ Money related issues in marriage can draw a husband and wife closer together . ”
Following this phrase a laugh typically ensues .
People think someone is obviously trying to humor them by speaking such ridiculous words .
Money brings about intimacy in marriage ?
I want to plead with you to accept this premise – all married couples have the potential to a healthy and intimate financial relationship .
Here are some of the common complaints about money in marriage : “ My husband and I are never on the same page with money . ”
“ My wife wants to tithe , but I do n’t think we can afford it . ”
“ My husband keeps doing business deals that cost our family a lot of money . ”
“ My wife keeps buying things for our kids even though we cannot afford it . ”
Not surprisingly , money fights are one of the leading causes of divorce .
I believe financial tension in relationships can be improved if not alleviated if couples commit themselves to following these ten suggestions on how to improve the financial intimacy in their marriage .
Ten ways to improve your financial intimacy in marriage
1. Pray for guidance and wisdom :
Few couples invite God into their financial lives .
I think God has some amazing things he can do with our finances if we allow him to enter into the process .
Marriage is always a joint relationship between husband , wife , and God .
In your prayers focus on the following :
Pray that God would allow you to put the marriage above any individual concerns .
Ask God to guide you in how he wants the funds earned , used , and distributed .
Request a double portion of humility so you can be prepared to accept God ’s guidance .
Plead with God to give you the necessary strength to release control of your money and give God control .
If any of you lacks wisdom , he should ask God , who gives generously to all without finding fault , and it will be given to him .
( James 1:5 NIV )
2 . Be partners
Marriage is an amalgamation of all the pieces of life .
The husband and the wife lose their individual identity and become one .
“ I ” is dropped from the vocabulary and replaced with “ We . ”
The married couple no longer uses “ my ” , but “ our ” .
This includes finances .
Every dollar brought into the home is a dollar that belongs to the home .
Every dollar that goes out the door is a dollar that the household spent .
Erase all notions of individual finances .
Forget about who bought what .
It does n’t matter who first signed for the loan .
From now on we are in this financial situation together .
We have an equal responsibility and an equal opportunity .
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife , and they will become one flesh .
( Genesis 2:24 NIV )
3. Define Goals
Goal setting is a form of practical dreaming – and who does n’t like to dream about what the future could be ?
This goal setting is not just about finances , but it is about all things in life .
Where do you want to be ?
What do you want to be doing ?
What do you want people to say about your life accomplishments ?
Goal setting is where a husband and wife look at each other and say , “ Where do we want to be in 5 years ?
In 10 years ?
In 15 years ? ” Husband and wife then look at the financial implications of those goals they have jointly set .
If a husband and a wife have separate goals it will be nearly impossible to have financial intimacy in marriage .
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined , and every city or household divided against itself will not stand .
( Matthew 12:25 NIV )
4. Combine it
Since there is a union between husband and wife it is essential that couples combine bank accounts and all other financial items .
It is difficult , but possible , to function financially with separate bank accounts .
However , what do you seek for in your marriage ?
To ‘ function ’ or to thrive ?
I do not believe a marriage can thrive until there is intimacy on all levels .
This involves combining all financial resources .
It does n’t matter who earns it .
Some couples think that the one who earns the money spends the money or dictates how it ought to be spent .
Instead , you should respect your unique contributions to the home .
Our family has made the decision that my wife will stay home and raise our children .
She is well educated and easily marketable in the professional world , but we made a choice , and we each make a contribution to the decisions we made .
The wife ’s body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband .
In the same way , the husband ’s body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife .
( 1 Corinthians 7:4 NIV ) *
* While this passage speaks of the physical relationship between husband and wife the principle of joint ownership applies .
What previously belonged to the wife / husband ( his and her body ) is now shared with the spouse as he is now a joint - owner of his / her body .
5. Distribute Responsibilities :
Money management takes time , energy , knowledge , and wisdom .
One of the common complaints about the modern family is the burden of so many responsibilities and commitments .
This makes its way into the home as couples are forced to decide who will take care of the different tasks related to personal finances .
Here is what I suggest :
Take out a blank piece of paper ( or open a Word document on your computer ) and list all of the the jobs related to personal finances .
This list might include things like balancing the check book , transferring funds , paying bills , researching retirement options , making investment decisions …
Make a copy of that list .
Both spouses should write on of the following phrases by each tasks : ( a) I enjoy doing that , ( b ) I am willing to do that , ( c ) Blahh .
Please do n’t make me do that .
Compare your lists .
Assign responsibilities first according to the task you each enjoy .
Next , assign responsibilities by rotating every other task in the “ willing to do that ” list .
Then finally , if both of you are “ blahh ” for the same task , consider ( a ) outsourcing it if possible , ( b ) splitting the responsibility 50 / 50 , or ( c ) assigning the task to one partner and the other will assume another household responsibility that you both rate as ‘ blahh ’ .
Proverbs 31:10 - 31 outlines the responsibilities assumed by the wife of noble character .
6. Budget Jointly and Meet Regularly :
When you have defined your goals you now have a broad or general direction that you would like to follow in your lives .
In addition , you have figured out the financial implications of those goals .
Now your job is to apply those long term goals to the short term – this month ’s budget .
If you have first agreed on your long term goals your dollars should more easily fall into a natural pattern for short term usage .
The budget represents the small goals you meet along the way to achieving your ultimate goals .
Once the budget is set it is important that you track your progress .
The best way is to meet together regularly .
Imagine if Junior got sick and I bought a bunch of medication .
My spouse needs to know that happened because we may need to adjust another budget item to make the budget work .
Here is what my wife and I do .
Every Monday night is budget night .
After the kids go to bed we sit down at the dinning room table together .
We take all the receipts we collected from the previous week .
She reads them and I type them into our budget program .
One of us could do the job , but as she reads and I type , we are both aware of all the week ’s expenditures .
We then take a quick look over the budget to be sure the dollars we allocated to each category still seems sufficient .
If we have overspent on a category we take the money from somewhere else in the budget .
The meeting should n’t take any more than 15 – 20 min per week .
However , each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself , and the wife must respect her husband .
( Ephesians 5:33 NIV )
7. Work at Removing Financial pressure :
Too many money discussions in marriage happen in high - stress situations .
Chuck Bentley at Crown Financial Ministries frequently talks about creating financial margin .
Where there is margin , stress is removed from the situation .
Imagine this scenario : you are on your way to work on a day that every second counts because you did n’t leave a spare moment anywhere on your agenda .
Then you end up getting stuck in traffic .
Every moment is torturous because you have no margin , no space to delay .
I guarantee that if you made that same drive on a Saturday morning visit to see friends you would not be nearly as stressed .
You need to take away the pressure that every financial decision could break you .
This must be done by paying off debt and saving for emergencies .
Once you have taken care of those financial pressures you will find that all your financial discussions are suddenly so much easier because there is now space to breathe and even room for error .
The rich rule over the poor , and the borrower is servant to the lender .
( Proverbs 22:7 NIV )
8. Agree on Some Guiding Principles :
You should only need to make some decisions in your marriage once .
Unfortunately , many couples have not put those boundaries in place so when it comes to making financial decisions they are forced to keep re-addressing the same issues .
Here are some examples of guidelines you might have :
We will give a least 10 % of our income to our local church or other charities .
We will save 15 % of every paycheck towards retirement .
We will buy things with cash and will not borrow .
We will always make a car payment to ourselves .
We always put down at least 25 % when buying a home .
The list could continue .
The point is when you set your goals some decisions only need to be made once and then you budget according to these guidelines .
Commit to the Lord whatever you do , and your plans will succeed .
( Proverbs 16:3 NIV )
9 . Seek outside help :
Sometimes a third party can be an invaluable resource .
Couples who find themselves at an impasse often just need someone to help them hear what the other spouse is saying .
When communication in marriage has failed , find a church counselor or minister who can guide you back on track .
This does not need to be a costly endeavor as many churches have resources available to offer you assistance free of charge .
Perhaps you need a different type of outside help .
Ask a friend or parent to watch the kids for an evening or day so you and your spouse can discuss these issues without the children distracting you .
Plans fail for lack of counsel , but with many advisers they succeed .
( Proverbs 15:22 NIV )
10 .
Put the needs of your spouse above your own .
Often our financial discussions are a sign of our immaturity and our carnal self .
We hunger and lust for things .
We desire those things even above the welfare of our marriage .
Give up the insignificant things of life so that you can gain the greater reward of a unified marriage .
Each of you should look not only to your own interests , but also to the interests of others .
( Philippians 2:4 NIV )
Which of these have been most helpful in your relationship ?
Is there something I neglected to mention that you think would be a valuable suggestion for couples ?
Tuesday ’s Senate vote to cut off funding for the F - 22 Raptor stealth fighter was a big blow against the " military - industrial complex , " said Fred Kaplan in Slate .
The 58 – 40 vote was “ much wider than expected . ”
There 's no denying this was a " major victory ” for Defense Secretary Robert Gates and President Obama , who pledged his first veto over this ridiculously costly “ Cold War relic . ”
The F - 22 is “ perhaps the most misunderstood weapon system in history , ” said John Noonan in The Weekly Standard .
Critics say the “ hyper - advanced fighter ” is no longer needed in the post–Cold War world of “ small wars , ” but the Raptor ’s goal is n’t about “ winning small wars ” — it ’s about ensuring that those wars stay small , by guaranteeing our now - compromised air supremacy .
There are strong strategic reasons to save “ bar none the best fighter jet in the skies , ” said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial .
Sadly , the F - 22 backers in Congress seem only interested in saving defense spending for their districts .
Now , while “ China and Russia are building up their conventional forces , ” the U.S. Air Force “ will have to live with 187 F - 22s ” already funded .
Yes , let ’s look at China and Russia , said David Axe in Wired .
China just started producing J - 10 fighters roughly as advanced as the 20 - year - old U.S. F - 16C ; Russia ca n’t advance past its “ 1980s Su - 27 . ”

While at the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit , an impromptu graphic and UI design session erupted in the hotel hackfest room .
We worked on GNOME artwork and design related subject matter .
A few of us discussed and sketched wireframe mockups of gnome - shell and Nautilus .
This hackweek , I decided to start fleshing out the mockups .
I tried getting gnome - shell properly working on my machine ( running openSUSE 11.1 ) , and was mostly unsuccessful there .
I have a lot of ideas based on the BetterDesktop usability studies we did at Novell ( years ago ) and would be interested in helping out the gnome - shell crew . (:
I saw David ’s recent blog post on a simplified Nautilus and decided to skip past gnome - shell ( for now ) and produce something that should hopefully benefit all users of GNOME ( regardless of using gnome - shell or not ) : Streamlining Nautilus .
These somewhat - polished mockups are based on the wireframes and discussions ( that we unfortunately did not write down ) from GCDS .
They are not pixel perfect ( but should be somewhat close ) .
A menu bar is not included in the mockups ( similar to David ’s screenshot ) — but the menus do need to be retooled as well .
Icons not in the toolbar would be configurable somehow .
Keyboard shortcuts would all work the same .
… There are many more notes in the actual mockup , so click the thumbnail teaser graphic and view the full thing at 1:1 size already ! (:
As stated in the mockup , you can contact me via @garrett on Twitter , over email , or in IRC .
( I prefer Twitter and IRC over email , by - the - way ) … or you could post a comment on this blog post too .

Impact
Konqueror ( Ubuntu ) - allocates 2GB of memory then either crashes the Browser or ( most often ) the OS reboots .
Ubuntu 's memory management system is configured as to NOT stop the process that consumes too much memory , but a random process .
This sometimes leads to processes that are vital for the OS to be killed , hence the reboot .
I am not kidding .
Thanks to ' FX ' for the memory management hint .
Chrome : allocates 2GB of memory then crashes tab with a null pointer
Firefox : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes
IE5,6,7,8 : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes
Opera : Allocated and commits as much memory as available , will not crash but other applications will become unstable

Proof of concept
Quoting Wikipedia " ECMAScript is a scripting language , standardized by Ecma International in the ECMA - 262 specification and ISO / IEC 16262 .
The language is widely used on the web , especially in the form of its three best - known dialects , JavaScript , ActionScript , and JScript .
" Calling the select ( ) method with a large integer , results in continuous allocation of x+n bytes of memory exhausting memory after a while .
The impact varies from null pointer dereference ( no more memory , hence crashing the browser ) to the reboot of the complete Operation System ( Konqueror & Ubuntu ) .
There had never been a limit specified as to how many html elements the select call should handle , after the report of this Bug , vendors apparently agreed to a limit of 10.000 elements :
" Talked to some Apple and Opera guys at the WHATWG social , and we decided this was a good number " The impact varies from browser to browser and sometimes from OS to OS function poc( o ) {e = document.createElement ( " select " ) ;e.length=2147483647 ;
function go ( ) {
poc(0 ) ;
}
</script >
URL : http://www.crashthisthing.com/select.html
Some have not understood what this code does , it does NOT loop as some vendors claimed , it just calls select.
lenght ( ) ONCE with a huge integer .
One might wonder if over the 9 last years that this bug existed , nobody ever entered a large number in a select .
lenght ( ) call .

Indeed , grays have exhibited a degree of resiliency and adaptability that suggests , among other things , that their sociability in Baja is far more than a reflexive , moth - to - flame - like behavior .
Elizabeth Alter , a marine biologist at the N.R.D.C. , has done research , for example , that indicates that grays have what she describes as “ a great degree of behavioral flexibility . ”
With time and shifting circumstances , they have switched from exclusive bottom - feeding to occasionally foraging higher up in the water column , and they have been able to seek out a variety of different feeding grounds depending on the conditions and obstacles with which they are confronted .
A good percentage of the gray - whale population , Alter also says , may have avoided the Baja lagoons during the peak hunting years and found other areas to calve and nurse .
“ Some naysayers , ” Toni Frohoff told me , “ might claim that these whales do n’t have the intelligence to know the difference between the present peaceful climate in the lagoon and what transpired in the past , that they ’re not smart enough to remember that humans can inflict pain and cause death .
However , historical evidence , as well as the limited data we do have on these whales , compels us to think otherwise .
I mean , there are numerous stories of how they avoid certain areas and learn to stay away from particular trouble spots , as well as the simple fact that they have to be intelligent and have good memories to survive the way they have , especially navigating along their migratory route , which involves not only memory but making quick assessments and decisions that go beyond just instinctual behaviors .
So for me the most plausible explanation , without having any data indicating otherwise , is that they ’ve now come to consider us as safe in these areas . ”
TO DATE , NO neurological studies of the gray - whale brain have been done .
In 2006 , however , researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine analyzed the brains of two other baleen species — humpback and finback whales — as well as those of a number of toothed whales like dolphins and killer and sperm whales .
The study revealed brain structures surprisingly similar to our own .
Some , in fact , contained large concentrations of spindle cells — often referred to as the cells that make us human because of their link to higher cognitive functions like self - awareness , a sense of compassion and linguistic expression — with the added kick that whales evolved these same highly specialized neurons as many as 15 million years before we humans did , a stunning instance of a phenomenon biologists refer to as parallel evolution .
“ In spite of the relative scarcity of information on many cetacean species , ” the Mount Sinai scientists concluded in a report in the November 2006 edition of the journal The Anatomical Record , “ it is important to note in this context that sperm whales , killer whales and certainly humpback whales exhibit complex social patterns that include intricate communication skills , coalition formation , cooperation , cultural transmission and tool usage . ”
They added that it is therefore “ likely that some of these abilities ” are related to the comparable complexity in the brain structures of whales and hominids .
The sperm whale , for example , which has the largest brain on earth , weighing as much as 19 pounds , has been found to live in large , elaborately structured societal groups , or clans , that typically number in the tens of thousands and wander over many thousands of miles of ocean .
The whales of a clan are not all related , but within each clan there are smaller , close - knit , matriarchal family units .
Young whales are raised within an extended , multitiered network of doting female caregivers , including the mother , aunts and grandmothers , who help in the nurturing of babies and , researchers suspect , in teaching them patterns of movement , hunting techniques and communication skills .
“ It ’s like they ’re living in these massive , multicultural , undersea societies , ” says Hal Whitehead , a marine biologist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia and the world ’s foremost expert on the sperm whale .
“ It ’s sort of strange .
Really the closest analogy we have for it would be ourselves . ”
Whitehead has even discovered distinct clan dialects using different codas , what he describes as a “ Morse code - like pattern of clicks ” that the whales make with their long head cavities and use to communicate with one another over many miles , reinforcing social bonds and declaring clan affiliation .
Whitehead , who has been tracking and recording sperm whales around the globe since the early 1980s , has positively identified five distinct clan dialects and studied two extensively .
“ The regular clan , ” he told me in a phone conversation from his lab in Nova Scotia , “ makes three to eight equally spaced clicks .
And then there are the Plus - One clans .
They have two to eight clicks and then a pause and an added click at the end , kind of like the Canadian ‘ eh . ’
We ’ve also noticed that these clans ply the water differently .
Regular groups move in wiggly tracks closer to shore , while the Plus - Ones swim further from shore in straight lines . ”
Whales display an incredible degree of coordination and cooperation in their efforts .
Aaron Thode , an associate research scientist from the Scripps Institution , who was in Baja doing acoustical studies of grays , told me of another project he is involved in , using the latest research tools to gain insights into how whales perceive the world .
He showed me an extraordinary video of sperm whales pilfering catch from fishermen ’s lines in Alaska , 50 - foot - long , massive - jawed behemoths delicately snatching a single black cod from a longline ’s dangling hook , like an hors d’oeuvre from a cocktail toothpick .
Fishermen are currently losing 5 to 10 percent of their yearly haul and fear the problem could become worse because whales who have mastered the technique are busily teaching it to others .
The news seems to be rapidly spreading , as reports of similar fish - snatching are coming in from fishermen all over the world .
Babies must crawl before they walk , parents and pediatricians agree .
Crawling has also been held up as a prerequisite to the normal progression of other aspects of neuromuscular and neurological development , such as hand - eye coordination and social maturation .
But new research may knock the legs out from under this conventional wisdom .
According to anthropologist David Tracer of the University of Colorado at Boulder , babies of the Au hunter - gatherers of Pa­pua New Guinea do not go through a crawling stage .
Instead their parents and other caregivers carry them until they can walk .
Yet Au children do not appear to suffer any ill effects from skipping this phase .
In a presentation given to the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in Chicago this past April , Tracer argued that , in fact , not crawling may be entirely normal and possibly even adaptive .
In his observations of 113 Au mother - child pairs , Tracer found that babies up to 12 months old were carried upright in a sling 86 percent of the time .
On the rare occasions when the mothers put their infants on the ground , they propped them up in a sitting position , rather than placing them down on their stomachs .
As a result of spending all of that time upright , Au kids never learn to crawl .
( They do , however , go through a scoot phase in which they sit upright and propel themselves along on their bottoms .
Tracer says the Au believe that this scooting , rather than crawling , is the universal human prewalking phase . )
The Au are not alone in discouraging their children from crawling .
Tracer notes that babies in a number of other traditional societies — including ones in Paraguay , Mali and Indonesia — are raised this way .
Furthermore , he observes , neither do our closest living relatives , chimpanzees and gorillas , put their youngsters on the ground very often .
Thus , it may well be that our early hominid ancestors toted their babies around , too , rather than letting them crawl .
Citing a study of Bangladeshi children showing that crawling significantly increases the risk of contracting diarrhea , Tracer proposes that carrying infants limits their exposure to ground pathogens .
It also protects them from predators .
He therefore contends that the crawling stage is a recent invention — one that emerged only within the past century or two , after humans began living in elevated houses with flooring , which would have been much more hygienic than dirt .
Wenda Trevathan , an anthropologist at New Mexico State University , agrees that babies were probably rarely placed on the ground in the past , adding glowing embers as another potential hazard .
Tracer ’s work “ highlights how narrowly we view normal infant development , ” she remarks , “ and calls into question the tendency to judge all human infants on the basis of Western infants . ”

A Different Perspective on the Iranian Elections Iran is in a very strategic location for the expansion of US imperialism and control of oil in the Middle East .
Military Force by the United States has already been threatened , but has drawbacks .
However , the CIA is an expert at fixing elections and stirring up violence and street demonstrations in other countries until an overthrow of that government occurs and one more favorable to US imperialism takes its place .
Now , let us turn to recent events and the elections in Iran .
The United States and the corporate elite definitely want a change of government in Iran .
Under George W. Bush the idea of an open invasion or a bombing campaign like the one against Yugoslavia that would bring them to their knees was openly discussed .
Why is Iran so important to US foreign policy ?
One of the main reasons can be deduced by simply looking at a map .
Iran lies directly between their military conquest in Iraq and all the profits that will bring to US and British oil companies and Afghanistan and the oil rich republics of Central Asia .
Iran itself has a large quantity of oil .
Iran is a large country , and it simply can not be overemphasized , situated between the military bases and the world 's largest US embassy , which looks like a fort , in Iraq and the US military bases in Afghanistan , which not surprisingly are located on the once proposed Unocal pipeline from Central Asia to the Indian Ocean .
Remember Zbigniew Brezezinski's grand chessboard of the Middle East and all the countries US imperialism should control for maximum US domination of the region .
Iran is a gigantic missing piece .
Iran is definitely not a US puppet state , its oil is nationalized and it has formed alliances with countries like Venezuela and Bolivia , which the United States and its corporate elite despise because of their socialistic policies .
All of these things aggravate the United States intensely .
This whole situation presents a great dilemma to US foreign policy .
They can't openly invade because the American people would be adverse to a major war , which this would entail .
Iran has some modern weapons , which could probably sink US ships and aircraft carriers and cause large US casualties , which the American people would definitely oppose , even if a major propaganda campaign was unleashed in the media .
Therefore , the other options are a coup or an election strongly influenced by the United States , which would bring a regime sympathetic to US foreign policy and corporate desires to power in Iran .
When I saw the pictures on television of the riots in Iran , it brought back memories of similar riots I saw occur , which were orchestrated by the CIA and caused the overthrow of Mossadegh and the installation of the Shah , who naturally privatized the oil and invited US oil companies back into the country .
I realize that there is a difference between a coup like the one that brought the Shah to power and an election , but with the exceedingly sophisticated methods the United States uses to influence foreign elections , I think the difference is rapidly evaporating .
I am not a supporter of theocracy or lack of true democracy .
In fact , I would love true democracy all over the world , but that would entail the dissolution of corporations and imperialism , and US imperialism is far from dying .
I suspect the hand of US imperialism in the Iranian elections and the riots immediately following .
It seems I am all alone in this opinion as every leftist publication I am aware of or leftist pundit is strongly of the opposite opinion .
Every time there is an election against a regime which is oppressive to some degree , these people get all excited and forget that there is something called imperialism , which has been operating for hundreds of years and should be the immediate thought of every true leftist .
Some regimes like those with socialist governments must be repressive to some degree because the CIA spends every waking moment trying to devise a method to overthrow them .
Maybe I am wrong .
Maybe the new government in Iran , if it had been elected , would have been just as antagonistic to US imperialism as the previous one .
However , I am very , very suspicious because of all the reasons I have mentioned in this article .
As a post script to this article , I have just researched the opposition candidate to Ahmadinejad , Mr Mousavi , on Wikipedia and found that he favors privatization and also that he ordered the execution of 30,000 political prisoners from various leftist parties in Iraq in 1988 , including the Tudeh or Iranian Communist Party .
This fact alone would make the CIA very happy .
Is this the candidate leftists in the United States should be supporting ?
Emma Goldman , Joe Hill and a thousand other real leftists must be rolling in their graves .
Is n't there something terribly wrong with the so - called left in this country ?
Hell , we are n't even strong enough to get single payer health insurance , which almost all industrialized capitalist countries have had for many years .
It is pathetic .
I do n't even know why I continue to write .
Indymedia is the only place that dares publish my writings .
I have spinal stenosis and no insurance and little money , so my writings may be coming to a close , I am sure to the great glee of those who love capitalism .
I gave it my best effort on behalf of justice , peace and a decent standard of living for all humans on Earth .
It is utterly amazing how liberals and some who consider themselves even radical leftists get confused over the relationship between elections and democracy .
Have n't the two elections involving George W. Bush proved that all sorts of tricks can be used to give a false result .
The United States through various government agencies like the CIA and Agency for International Development and many others , some which are supposed to be NGOs , pumps enormous amounts of money into foreign elections to get the result they want .
They want to get a government into power in these countries which is totally sympathetic to US foreign policy and the penetration by US corporations into their economy .
They definitely do not want any country which is unsympathetic to total privatization and has any ideas about nationalization of anything - particularly very valuable natural resources like oil .
Hence , we have the so - called Rose revolution in Georgia , the Orange revolution in the Ukraine and the Velvet revolution in Lebanon .
In case , there are some who get confused by all the repetitious propaganda and think the US would never influence foreign elections , there is the very well documented case where the CIA used every trick in their book , including vast amounts of money , to prevent the Italian Communist Party from winning the election in Italy immediately following World War 2 .
When the election turns out the way the United States desires , a very nice sounding name is given to it like Rose or Velvet .
Since these elections are so far from anything resembling true democracy , why not call them skunk , outhouse or rotting corpse revolutions .
It would be exceedingly more appropriate .
If the US puppet gets a little imperialistic like the one in Georgia and attempts to expand its influence by military force , it sometimes gets a pummeling by a state like Russia , which is now very nationalistic and not completely a US puppet , like it was under Yeltsin .
Then , the US and most of the corporate controlled media call it an invasion by Russia , which it was not , but a response to an invasion by Georgia and massacres of civilians by Georgian troops , recently trained by the US military and CIA .
Now , let us turn to recent events and the elections in Iran .
The United States and the corporate elite definitely want a change of government in Iran .
Under George W. Bush the idea of an open invasion or a bombing campaign like the one against Yugoslavia that would bring them to their knees was openly discussed .

Judge Gives Control of Michael Jackson Estate to Executors

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) – A Los Angeles judge handed temporary control of Michael Jackson 's multimillion dollar estate on Monday to a lawyer and music industry executive named as co-executors in his 2002 will .
Lawyer John Branca and executive John McClain were named executors in a will Jackson signed in 2002 that left his estate , valued at more than $ 500 million , to a trust benefiting his three children , his mother , and charities .
The judge last week had given temporary control to Jackson 's mother , Katherine Jackson , before the will surfaced .
" I think the law compels that result .
I think that Mr. Jackson had felt comfortable , at least in 2002 , with these individuals , " Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said at a hearing .
Another date was set for August 3 .
Separately , thousands of fans were picking up coveted tickets for the singer 's memorial on Tuesday .
Singers Mariah Carey , Jennifer Hudson and Stevie Wonder were among entertainers expected to perform or attend the event at the Staples Center sports arena in downtown Los Angeles .
The acting mayor of Los Angeles , Jan Perry , told NBC4 television that Jackson 's family would hold a private burial at the city 's Forest Lawn cemetery at 8 a.m. on Tuesday -- a couple of hours before the arena memorial .
About 1.6 million people registered to be among the 8,750 to receive two free tickets to the event .
Successful fans lined up early on Monday to collect their tickets , although some tried to auction their vouchers on websites like eBay and Craigslist .
Both websites were swiftly removing the listings , which carried asking prices of up to $ 10,000 .
Jackson , 50 , died on June 25 of cardiac arrest .
Toxicology reports , expected in about four weeks time , are pending on the precise cause of death .

Chimps may never build a rocket engine but do pass on food foraging skills ( Image : James Balog / Getty )
For all their cognitive prowess , chimpanzees will never build four - stroke engines , stone pyramids , or even a simple wheel .
Technological innovation and improvement seem to be uniquely human traits , despite culture and ample tool use in chimpanzees and other animals .
New research on children and chimpanzees might explain why .
“ For culture to accumulate – to become more and more complex – requires innovations and one of the first ways in which hominins clearly went beyond chimpanzees was in making stone tools , ” says Andrew Whiten , a psychologist at St Andrew ’s University , UK .

He and researchers in Germany argue that this difference comes down to the distinct ways in which humans and chimpanzees learn new tricks from others .

For chimpanzees , culturally transmitted skills tend to focus on food , whether cracking nuts with rocks , or fishing insects out of the dirt with sticks .
Overwhelming evidence now suggests that chimpanzees pass these traditions onto their brethren .
For instance , individuals in Taï National Park in Ivory Coast feast on nuts , while chimpanzees in Gombe National Park in Tanzania ignore them .
Less clear is what chimpanzees learn by watching another animal demonstrate a new trick .
Claudio Tennie and Michael Tomasello , of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , contend that chimps focus on the outcome of a demonstration – a cracked nut – rather than the bodily actions that produce the treat .
Yet humans imitate the sequence of body movements : raising a stone or hammer above their shoulder before slamming it down .
This difference , Tennie argues , helps humans learn feats they never would have come up with , left to their own devices .
Chimps , instead , adopt only new technologies that they might stumble on .
Seeing another chimp perform the action sparks a sort of “ a - ha ” moment , after which it seems obvious .
Learning to lasso
Tennie ’s team recently tested whether several species of apes and four - year - old children could learn to fold a piece of string into a loop to tug on a block with a nail in it , behind a cage .
If successful , the apes got access to grapes , the children got stickers .
His team intended the task to be complex enough that neither children nor apes could instantly solve it , but not so complicated that it demanded extensive dexterity or memory .
Indeed , when playing around with the string , none of 24 children , seven chimpanzees , six gorillas , eight orang - utans and five bonobos made so much as a loop .
Even after Tennie ’s team showed half the children and apes that the block could move , just one child managed to pull the stickers within reach .
However , after the researchers demonstrated the entire trick to the other 12 children , 9 managed to make a loop and 4 succeeded in obtaining the prize .
After watching five demonstrations , none of the apes ever made a loop .
Because apes focused on the outcome , rather than the process of creating a loop and bringing the block closer , they did not – and will never – transcend their inability to discover the solution on their own , Tennie says .
Whiten thinks things are a little more complicated .
“ I do n’t think that simple dichotomy works , ” he says .
Student and teacher
In 2005 , Whiten ’s team published work suggesting that chimpanzees learned specific movements and passed them onto others .
Beginning with two chimpanzees from different groups ,
Whiten taught each a different way to get a treat out of a special box .
One approach relied on poking a stick into the box to make the treat available .
In the other method , the chimp learned to pull on a lever on the outside of the box that releases the treat – same outcome , different actions .
Not only did the two chimps learn whichever approach they observed , but they also passed on the trick to other members of their group .
This would suggest that chimpanzees can pay attention to – and imitate – the actions of others , Whiten says .
He favours more nuanced explanations for the culture gap between humans .
For one , children imitate step - by - step actions with far more fidelity than chimps , particularly when some of the steps are superfluous .
“ We are such a cultural species that it pays children to copy everything that adults do , ” he says .
And second , children seem more willing than chimpanzees to upgrade their approach to solving a problem .
‘ Curious ’ limitations
Recently , Whiten and colleague Sarah Marshall - Pescini taught 11 young chimps to scoop honey from inside a box by dipping a stick into a hole in the box .
Five of them either figured out this approach on their own or learned it after watching a demonstration .
Next ,
Whiten ’s team showed the same five chimps how moving the stick around the hole releases a latch that opens the box .
This offered up all the honey at once , plus peanuts that were previously hidden .
Yet , none of the apes adopted the more efficient approach .
“ They did n’t get it .
They did n’t show any kind of cumulative cultural evolution , ” Whiten says .
“ There ’s something rather curious going on in these non-human species , where they get stuck on simpler techniques . ”
Most three - and four - year old children , by contrast , had no trouble jettisoning the less efficient approach for a better solution .
Experiments such as these may be far removed from the African jungles where chimpanzee culture flourishes and the urban jungles where we humans innovate .
Yet they provide hard data to questions once addressed with just - so stories and speculation , the researchers contend .
Testing different theories of culture in real animals – be they chimp or child – has also brought the two once - disparate camps into closer sync , if not total agreement .
“ I think we ’re both converging on how things are , ” Whiten says .

173 Java Memory Puzzle
Author : Dr. Heinz M. Kabutz Date : 2009 -05 - 28 Java Version : 1.1 - 1.7 Category : Performance
Abstract :
In this newsletter we show you a puzzle , where a simple request causes memory to be released , that otherwise could not .
Solution will be shown in the next newsletter .
Welcome to the 173rd issue of The Java( tm ) Specialists '
Newsletter , sent to you from Zürich in Switzerland .
This is the 12th week I 'm away from Crete this year alone , with another 2 weeks away before the middle of June .
So out of 26 weeks in the first half of 2009 , I will have been away for 14 , which is more than 50 % .
Due to the economic crisis , I fully expected at least half of my engagements to get cancelled , but that did not happen .
Our Java Specialist Master Course and Design Patterns Course are just way too popular .
HOWEVER , as from the middle of June , I 'll be on " holiday " in Crete for a few months , coinciding with my kids 14 week school holiday .
This will give me more time to think and produce some nice newsletters .
Also , I am talking to a publisher to perhaps put together a book of my most popular newsletters , so you will have something to take to the beach .

Java Memory Puzzle
Instead of telling you some mystery of Java memory , it is time for you to put on your thinking caps .
I had a discussion a few weeks ago with one of my subscribers of whether you should null your local variables , to make things easier for the garbage collector .
His understanding was that the local variables will be stored on the stack and thus popped off at the end of the method call anyway , so nulling them was a waste of time .
In almost all situations , he is right .
However , he had a class that did something most peculiar , something like this :
public class JavaMemoryPuzzle { private final int dataSize = ( int ) ( Runtime.getRuntime ( ).maxMemory ( ) * 0.6 ) ; public void f( ) { { byte [ ] data = new byte [ dataSize ] ; } byte [ ] data2 = new byte [ dataSize ] ; } public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { JavaMemoryPuzzle jmp = new JavaMemoryPuzzle ( ) ; jmp.f ( ) ; } }
When you run this you will always get an OutOfMemoryError , even though the local variable data is no longer visible outside of the code block .
So here comes the puzzle , that I 'd like you to ponder about a bit .
If you very politely ask the VM to release memory , then you do n't get an OutOfMemoryError :
public class JavaMemoryPuzzlePolite { private final int dataSize = ( int ) ( Runtime.getRuntime ( ).maxMemory ( ) * 0.6 ) ; public void f( ) { { byte [ ] data = new byte [ dataSize ] ; } for ( int i= 0 ; i< 10 ; i++) { System.out.println (
" Please be so kind and release memory " ) ; } byte [ ] data2 = new byte [ dataSize ] ; } public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { JavaMemoryPuzzlePolite jmp = new JavaMemoryPuzzlePolite ( ) ; jmp.f ( ) ; System.out.println ( " No OutOfMemoryError " ) ; } }
Why does this work ?
In my original newsletter , I asked my readers to send an answer .
400 emails later , I 'd now prefer you to look at the next newsletter for the answer .
Please contact me via my website if you have something new to add to the puzzle .

Tweet Responding to investor concerns that TheStreet .
Com has continued targeting thriving small - cap biomedical companies with inaccurate articles , BioMedReports has been repeatedly contacted by officials of publicly traded companies -- among them , Hoji Alimi who serves as CEO of Petaluma , California based Oculus Innovative Sciences ( NASDAQ : OCLS ) .
Mr. Alimi ’s breakthrough Microcyn® Technology - a water based , biocompatible solution used increasingly around the world to help prevent and treat infections in chronic and acute wounds - has been gaining attention both on Wall Street and in the national media due to its rapid kill anti-microbial and healing properties .
A San Francisco bay area television station recently reported that the technology is a promising path to a major medical advance and earlier this month , Oculus shares rose after the company received an expanded 510 ( k ) label clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to market it ’s Microcyn® Skin and Wound Cleanser with preservatives as both a prescription and over - the - counter formulation .
The new prescription product is indicated for use by health care professionals to manage the debridement of wounds such as stage I - IV pressure ulcers , diabetic foot ulcers , post - surgical wounds , first - and second - degree wounds , grafted and donor sites .
Not long after the announcement , TheStreet .
Com ’s biomedical columnist Adam Feuerstein leveled an accusation that Oculus “ appeared to be skirting U.S. drug laws by claiming that its wound - cleansing product containing common diluted bleach has drug - like therapeutic properties . ”

Coverage
Calls from angry and confused patients , doctors and investors flooded the offices of the company and shares were negatively impacted .
It certainly was n’t the first time , TheStreet .
Com ’s coverage has impacted a stock 's price and its shareholders , but company officials became concerned when they heard reports that members of the medical community and patients who use Microcyn® products were adversely affected by the report .
“ This is becoming a patient safety issue and putting public safety at risk , ” Alimi told BioMedReports in an exclusive recorded interview .
“ It ’s no longer [ about ] attacking a company and the market potential and market cap .
You ’re damaging public safety . ”
Alimi , was concerned enough to craft a letter to CNBC ’s Jim Cramer who co-founded TheStreet.com in 1996 and took the company public in 1999 .
“ [ I ] copied the gentleman [ Feuerstein ] who had written the report , “ explained the Iranian - born , Alimi .
While the Oculus CEO made it clear that he believed the publication and writer were entitled to their constitutionally protected opinion he felt that the publication had fallen short of reporting the truth and science behind the technology accurately .
“ When you have n’t done your due diligence and you do n’t understand the basic chemistry of our product [ and ] you make recommendations like that you are putting patients ’ safety at risk , ” insists Alimi .
“ There has to be a level of integrity in the research written and I think that ’s really lacking in their case . ”
Last month , Dr. William A. Carter , the CEO of Hemispherx Biopharma ( NASDAQ : HEB ) angrily reacted to slanted attacks and base - less reports by stating that “ Adam Feuerstein would n’t know good science if it bit him in the ass . ”
Investors across the internet have also lashed out against Feuerstein ’s coverage on message boards - many of them leveling threats of physical violence while others have called for investigations by federal authorities and even lawsuits .
Feuerstein has responded to some of the anger by stating that “ Carter 's bluster [ was ] designed to divert attention away from the real matter at hand ” and by clarifying to his reader that he writes his columns and stories when he uncovers information that he thinks is important for investors to have .
Recently , Thomas Clarke , who had served as CEO of the financial news website , announced that he was leaving the publicly traded company “ effective immediately . ”
It was reported that Clarke ’s abrupt departure came less than a day after Jon Stewart ’s Comedy Central cable hit , The Daily Show , aired tape of Jim Cramer explaining in a Street.com webcast how he , as a hedge fund manager , manipulated value to serve some publicly traded companies and investors at the expense of others .
Stewart ’s show took Cramer , CNBC , and financial “ journalism , ” in general , to the cleaners but Feuerstein has insisted and written : “ I do n't make this job personal .
I like to find good stories to write about -- stories that hopefully help investors make some money in biotech .
( The best way to do that , sometimes , is to avoid buying certain stocks )
If the stories are controversial , it 's all the better , because those are usually the most fun . ”
In the case of Oculus , the “ story ” has definitely not been perceived as “ fun ” and appears to fall short of fact - scientific or otherwise - according to Alimi .
Bleach is sodium hypochlorite which is anti-microbial at a high pH ( pH scale of 8 and higher ) .
“ When you take that solution to a lower pH , you no longer have sodium hypochlorite as your active [ ingredient ] , you have Hypochlorus acid ( HOCI ) ” explains Alimi .
“ It ’s a different chemistry .
And Hypochlorus acid can be converted to different chemicals in a wound depending on how it ’s manufactured , so that is a significant difference in the chemistry of our product . ”
Alimi points out that when a physician uses bleach in a wound , he will surely kill the infection in that wound , but he will also kill tissue and cause harm in the wound bed .
In addition , diluted bleach solutions have not shown any wound healing impact - something that independent medical studies and trials have attributed to Microcyn® .
Some feel that this type of reporting can be directly blamed for TheStreet ’s continued troubles and decline in the current bear market .
As recently reported , the publication ’s stock recently dropped below $ 2 per share , down from $ 9.50 per share a year ago .
In recent years it had traded as high as $ 16 per , but it has also suffered with the decline in the media and advertising markets as well as a major purge of subscriber newsletter operations .
Its success was initially tied closely to Mr. Cramer ’s popularity , but the recent heavy criticism may finally be reflecting in the company ’s ( NASDAQ : TSCM ) stock price performance .
In a strange twist , many have noted that stocks which have been the subject of slanted reports by Mr. Feuerstein , have just been added to the Russell 3000 index while TSCM itself has been booted as a financial services sector stock .
An excerpt of Mr. Almi ’s interview with BioMedReports can be heard below .
In it , he reacts to investors ’ questions about litigation , TheStreet .
Com ’s coverage and whether or not Oculus has considered issuing additional common shares .

Some doubt the ability of the UK to meet renewable energy targets Britain 's energy systems are no longer fit for purpose , according to leading members of the UK 's best - known scientific academy , the Royal Society .
A meeting of experts at the society said the government must invest hugely to create a new low - carbon economy .
And it must take on the big generating companies who dominate energy policy , participants said .
The government says the key issues on energy will be addressed in its forthcoming energy White Paper .
Electricity ' supergrid '
The experts say ministers must make up lost time by investing massively in research and deployment of renewables ; creating a more wide - ranging electricity ' supergrid ' ; and ensuring that coal - fired power stations capture 90 % of their carbon emissions by 2020 .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme
One leading member of the society said privately that the government 's performance on carbon capture so far had been pathetic - although would agree that criticism should not be confined to the UK .
The meeting agreed that failure to develop renewables in time meant that the UK must continue to rely on nuclear power - even though questions over waste and security were unresolved .
First priority on the society 's action list is a big push on energy efficiency in existing homes , taking advantage of the latest technologies .
The call is echoed by the all - party parliamentary climate change group , which is set to insist that landlords should be prevented from letting homes which waste energy .
White Paper
The group 's vice - chairman , Lord Redesdale , said the UK would never reach its climate change targets unless it radically improved policies on existing homes .
He said : " A billion tonnes will have failed to be saved from domestic carbon emissions and this is equivalent to the CO2 pollution from Britain 's aviation sector over the next 25 years .
" We can either heat our homes and have hot baths , or fly but not both .
There really does need to be much tougher policies on reducing carbon emissions from the homes . "

Safe nuclear waste disposal Renewable energy Bioenergy - from cellulosic crops or algae Energy storage Nuclear fusion
The government says many of the issues will be addressed in its energy White Paper - although to the frustration of ministers in the energy and environment departments , the Treasury has blocked whole scale investment in home refurbishment until after 2012 .
Ministers argue that their policy on carbon capture and storage is ahead of any other major nation - calling for four demonstration projects and insisting that new coal - fired power stations should capture a percentage of their emissions until the technology is fully proven .
A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said the UK had made major strides recently on energy and climate change .
He listed The Climate Change Act , carbon budgets , and leadership for the Copenhagen climate summit - including the Prime Minister 's suggestion last week that rich nations should transfer $ 100 bn - a - year to poor nations to help with climate change .

Another Victim of America ’s Ponzi Scheme Economy ( Part 1 )
As of yesterday , Lear Corp. , an auto parts supplier for the " Little 3 " joined the list of others who have been victimized by the collapse of America ’s Ponzi scheme economy .
With Visteon having filed for bankruptcy protection in May of this year , and the " Little 3 " essentially bankrupt with no real future , you can bet there ’s much more to come from America ’s financial apocalypse .
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/wire/chi-ap-us-lear-bankruptcy,0,5090445.story
If you think Detroit looks bad now , wait a few more years because you “ ai n’t seen nuthin yet . ”
Hundreds of U.S. cities , large and small , face an inevitable demise similar to Detroit , Cleveland , and Philadelphia .
How can I be so sure of this ?
America ’s real economy was transformed by decades of unfair trade policies that destroyed millions of U.S. jobs .
As an attempt to mask the reality , economists and politicians have highlighted the “ Information Age ” as the engine of the “ New Economy , ” promising higher living standards for all .
But we have seen slightly different results .
Rather than higher living standards for all , the “ New Economy ” has brought higher living standards to much of the developing world , corporate executives and wealthy shareholders of U.S. corporations .
Meanwhile , working - class Americans have been left out of the picture .
In fact , because there is a finite amount of wealth to divide , it ’s clear that America ’s wealthy elite and much of the developing world have seen their living standards increase at the expense of working - class Americans .
Rather than higher living standards for all , this proclamation of a “ New Economy ” has provided a smoke screen for more permissive free trade policies that continue to destroy working - class America , while enriching corporations and workers from developing nations .
It ’s been socialism for corporations and developing nations at the expense of working - class Americans .
Not by coincidence , the current bailouts advocated by Washington bear a striking resemblance to their own policies of economic extortion through the mechanisms of free trade .
As a replacement for jobs that produce real goods , America ’s “ New Economy ” is now characterized by a service economy that ’s based on scavenging wealth from the huge Ponzi scheme designed by Washington .
America ’s “ Old Economy ” created good jobs during a period when U.S. imports were in high demand around the world .
As a result , America was the world 's largest creditor because it served as the global leader of manufactured goods ; real products needed and demanded by the world – the best automobiles , consumer appliances , textiles , and basic materials .
During the " Old Economy " Americans had a healthy savings rate , a one - income household was the norm , healthcare and higher education was affordable , there were no credit cards , there was no need for cheap labor off the backs of illegal aliens , and America was a net exporter of crude oil .
Towards the final stages of America ’s “ Old Economy ” Asia began modernizing its own manufacturing industries .
Rather than automotive plants and consumer electronics , much of Asia ’s manufacturing efforts were focused on providing goods for its own consumers so as to decrease dependence on imports .
At first , they were n’t so good at it .
But once free trade became the status quo , it enabled Asia to enter the market place with unfair advantages while using illegal trade practices .
Furthermore , as more American firms sent manufacturing plants overseas , Asia became the recipient of the unintended but inevitable transfer of intellectual property from the United States .
This enabled Asian companies to gain access to critical manufacturing and design secrets .
Even Japan has benefited from U.S. intellectual property as the result of free trade .
In many cases , huge companies are being sold off to foreign competitors because they simply cannot compete on U.S. soil due to free trade .
http://www.avaresearch.com/article_details-274.html
In return , U.S. corporations have increased their profits while providing cheap goods to U.S. consumers .
The only problem is , Ponzi scheme never last indefinitely .
At some point you need a real job to buy goods .
Credit cards can only take you so far .
Now we are seeing this Ponzi scheme unravel .
Unfortunately , it still has a long way to go .
http://www.avaresearch.com/article_details-154.html
As a direct beneficiary of intellectual property from the U.S. , Asian imports have evolved from cheap trinkets into automobiles , consumer electronics , prescription drugs , and so on .
For many years now , Asia has dominated the consumer electronics manufacturing industry .
Now , Japan dominates the automotive industry .
China has already destroyed the U.S. textile , chemical , steel and other industries , using unfair trade and pricing practices .
Meanwhile , Washington has sat idle , as has the World Trade Organization .
You ask why ?
How can this be ?
Washington does n’t have much bargaining power since China is the principal player in America ’s Ponzi scheme , providing financing to keep interest rates low , which keeps U.S. consumers shopping “ till they drop . ”
Of more detriment , U.S. consumers are buying mainly imports from Asia , Europe and Latin America .
This indirectly leads to even more job losses in America .
As you can imagine , this fuels a perpetual loop that is virtually impossible to escape from without a major collapse ; a collapse much larger than we see today .
Due to the toxic effects of free trade , China will soon dominate the automotive and drug manufacturing industries .
Without radical changes in free trade and the implementation of universal healthcare , America will continue its competitive decline in global trade .
If you want to devise a system of free trade , all participants must play by the same rules .
Otherwise , competitive advantages will be established favoring one or more nations over those operating under less favorable rules .
http://www.avaresearch.com/article_details-74.html
As it stands today , America has no chance to mount a permanent economic recovery without radical realignment of economic and trade policies .
Until free trade has been restructured into fair trade , millions of additional jobs will be sent permanently overseas .
And the only replacement of these jobs will be service - oriented professions catering to the wealthy , similar to what you see in third world nations .
During America ’s “ Old Economy ” Detroit was at its peak , along with Cleveland , Philadelphia and St. Louis .
Today , these cities are largely ghettos .
But there ’s a silver lining for some .
Each of these “ ghetto cities ” has one or two small areas filled with mansions resting on gorgeous lots , with fancy landscaping .
This is the " old money . "
Chances are quite high that the owners of these residences accumulated their wealth as a result of , or in spite of the decaying industries that once made these cities economic giants .
Chances are , they were the beneficiaries of free trade , corporate fraud and crony capitalism ; some of the more prominent symbols of modern America .
They may have been executives who were paid ridiculous sums of money , despite doing a lousy job .
They may have transitioned from politics into the corporate world where they were paid millions of dollars for having lunches with their friends in Washington .
They may have worked as bankers , attorneys or consultants on leveraged buyouts and other deals that destroyed jobs and eliminated pensions .
No matter how you slice it , chances are the people who own these mansions did not earn an honest living .
And most Americans are paying the price for their estates .
This is the reality of America .

hat were you doing during the morning hours ( EST ) of July 13th 2009 ?
On that auspicious day , in a dramatic vote , the C++ standards committee decided to remove concepts from C++0 x .
Undoubtedly , this resolution will have a huge impact on C ++.
In this column I will outline the causes of concepts ' failure , discuss the lessons from this unprecedented event , and try to predict how it will affect the future of C ++.
Immaculate Concepts
The main impetus for adding concepts to C++ was to allow template designers to precisely specify requirements and constraints on and among types .
The problem was how to design a constraints mini-language that would be simple and intuitive on the one hand , and complete and efficient on the other hand .
To demonstrate the problem that concepts were supposed to solve , consider the function template min ( ) .
It imposes certain implicit requirements on the type T :
template < typename T> const T& min( const T& x , const T& y ) { return x < y? x : y ; }
T must be a type that has a less - than operator ( < ) to compare two values of type T , and the result of which must be convertible to a Boolean value .
In C++03 it 's difficult to express these requirements in a clear and bullet - proof manner .
Bjarne Stroustrup and Gabriel Do Reis presented the first concepts paper in 2003 ( other committee members contributed to this endeavor later ) .
At first , it seemed as if concepts ticked the right boxes .
Here 's a modified min( ) function that uses concepts to express the constraints on T :
concept LessThanComparable < typename T> { bool operator <( const T& x , const T& y ) ; } template < typename T > requires LessThanComparable < T> const T& min( const T& x , const T& y ) { return x < y? x : y ; }
Author 's Note :
The examples are quoted from Douglas Gregor 's excellent introduction to concepts .
If C++ templates had to deal only with simple cases like min( ) , the design of concepts would be a cinch .
However , the C++ Standard Library consists of far more complex templates — containers that impose certain requirements on their elements , smart pointers with peculiar ownership semantics , algorithms that must meet certain performance limits , various categories of iterators — you name it .
That is why the authors have been refining the concepts specification for more than seven years .
After several iterations , the concepts proposal forked off in two different directions ( the technical differences between the two proposals will not be discussed here ) .
A compromise was reached at the October 2005 meeting in Mont - Tremblant , Canada ; the two competing proposals would be merged into an integrated concepts proposal known as the " Mont - Tremblant compromise . "
Off the record , some committee members viewed the Mont - Tremblant compromise as the watershed — the integrated concepts proposal had simply turned into an incoherent monster .
Debates about whether the imminent C++ standard should include a conceptualized Standard Library heated up .
While some of the problems with concepts were resolved promptly , each new day led to the discovery of additional problems and disagreements .
With serious efforts , the committee managed to approve the C++0x Committee Draft ( which included concepts ) in September 2008 .
However , in recent months , the criticism and doubts concerning concepts reached a boiling point .
The last straw was probably Stroustrup 's latest concepts paper , which added more fears and doubts .
The concepts - related threads on the committee 's reflectors ( list servers ) pointed out that concepts were " untried , risky , incomplete and controversial . "
Concerns about compile - time and runtime overhead were also voiced .
As the Frankfurt meeting got closer , these voices became harsher and louder .
Two Tough Choices
The distrust and antipathy toward concepts paved the way to voting this feature out of C++0 x .
There was one huge problem with this decision though : concepts were already pervasive in the Committee Draft ( CD ) .
Almost every paragraph and code listing involving templates uses concepts directly or indirectly .
Worse yet , many new features that have been accepted into C++0 x in recent years presuppose concepts .
Removing concepts from the standard will require a massive excision operation that might kill the patient .
But what other choices did the committee have ?
Leaving concepts in situ was n't a better choice .
Even the authors agree that the current concepts specification is n't complete , and that perfecting it would take " several more years . "
However , they consider the current proposal " good enough for now . "
Furthermore , they insist that the outward complexity of concepts is misleading — the underlying model is " good enough ; " it 's only the surface complexity ( what the user has to write ) that needs fixing .
Considering that concepts have already taken seven years of precious committee time , no one was willing to spend five more years or so on refining the surface complexity , or indeed any other concepts complexity .
The cruel choice was thus between a painful excision , and asymptotic refinement of concepts .
On the afternoon of July 13th the die was cast : Concepts were voted out of C++0 x by a decisive margin .
An Unprecedented Event
Unlike other self - contained features that usually have no huge impact on C++ as a whole ( nullptr for example ) , the removal of concepts amounts to a landslide , and will probably lead to a witch hunt .
Committee members and the C++ community will want answers .
It appears that the committee 's limited resources were wasted on a feature that failed , while at the same time , other critical C++0 x features such as multithreading and garbage collection did n't get enough attention .

This article makes me so angry , I ’d love us all to start thinking what we can do to change a society where danger - hallucinating authorities persecute and prosecute those of us still sane .
Suggestions welcome .
This piece originally appeared in Brain , Child .
By Bridget Kevane
On Saturday , June 16 , 2007 , I was charged with endangering the welfare of my children , a criminal charge that , in the city where I live , Bozeman , Montana , can lead to imprisonment in the county jail .
The Montana Code 46-16-130 (3 ) states that a parent can be charged with this offense if she “ knowingly endangers the child ’s welfare by violating a duty of care , protection , or support . ”
Typically , prosecution is pursued when an adult supplies a child younger than eighteen with drugs , prostitutes the child , abandons the child ’s home , or engages in sexual conduct with the child .
A violation of duty of care is described as cruel treatment , abuse , infliction of unnecessary and cruel punishment , abandonment , neglect , lack of proper medical care , clothing , shelter , and food , and evidence of bodily injury .
I was charged with this crime because I dropped my three children and their two friends off at the Bozeman Gallatin Valley Mall .
Bozeman is a small town known for its quality of life , striking physical beauty , easy access to the outdoors , and great public schools .
It is also known as a safe community .
The mall is considered a family place where kids trick - or - treat in October to escape the cold , and groups of children meet friends , shop , eat and see movies .
It is a popular activity both during the long Montana winters as well as the summer months .
The mall is a safe place .
There are no signs posted at the mall saying that children cannot be left unattended .
No child has ever been kidnapped or molested at the mall .
And yet , I was charged as a criminal for dropping children there without my direct supervision .
My oldest daughter , Natalie , and her friend , were both twelve at the time , going into seventh grade .
The girls , who had known each other since they were three years old , had attended a babysitting class sponsored by the local hospital for girls eleven and older .
The class teaches CPR , infant care , responsible behavior and more .
They both also had enough experience babysitting other people ’s children that I trusted having them supervise the other kids at the mall —
Ellie , eight , Matthew , seven , and my younger daughter , Olivia , who was three .
An outsider , or someone used to a bigger , more crowded way of living , might be shocked to know that I left children that young in the care of two twelve - year - olds .
But these kids were a pack .
They grew up together in a neighborhood full of children .
They walk to and from their local schools together , play together , and frequently spend time at each other ’s homes .
My husband and I are particularly good friends with two families that live near our home .
We parents depend on each other for support and mutual child care as much as our children depend on each other for friendship .
As our kids have grown older , an implicit agreement has formed among us :
Our children will wander to each other ’s homes , and it is our job to informally supervise them and keep each other aware of their whereabouts .
As we all live within less than half a mile from each other , much time is spent going from one house to the other , to the park , or walking around the nearby university , where I am a professor of Latin American and Latino Studies .
So when the older girls asked if they could go to the mall that Saturday , I said yes , if they took the younger kids with them .
On that particular day , I was exhausted .
The children wanted an activity , and I wanted a couple of hours of quiet and rest .
Why was I exhausted ?
I have three kids , a dog , a cat , a hamster , and a fish named Oscar .
I have a husband who had started his own company and was working on weekends .
I teach classes , write books and articles , and am chair of my department .
I love my job , for one reason because it has given me the flexibility to be home for my kids every day after school .
I oversee violin , swimming , and art lessons ; I drive my kids around ; I think about what I can make for dinner , and I wonder how early I can get to bed .
In other words , like many mothers , I work two jobs , and sometimes that catches up with me .
I ’ve come to look differently on my exhaustion that day , now that all this has taken place .
I made a choice , and I believed it was the right choice : I let my daughter take over .
I gave her a responsibility so I could have a break .
I had no reason to doubt my daughter .
I believed then and continue to believe today that the girls were aware and responsible enough to handle their younger siblings .
The plan was for the kids to have lunch and walk around a bit .
I told the older girls the rules .
They could not leave the younger kids unsupervised .
They could not make a ruckus .
They had to behave .
Olivia , the three - year - old , had to stay in her stroller .
When I called my husband and the other mother to let them know the plan , there was no hesitation on their part .
My husband was at his office down the street from the mall , less than five minutes away .
I would be at home with my cell phone , and my daughter had her cell phone in case they wanted to be picked up early .
I dropped the group off at roughly one forty - five p.m. and said that I would pick them up at four for the barbeque we were going to that night .
It was to be an afternoon activity , as simple as that .
About an hour later , my husband , who was home by then , received a call from the police telling me that we had to come down to the mall immediately .
My first thought was that the kids had made a scene , that they had knocked something over , that they had run about recklessly .
We jumped into the car .
When I walked into the mall , the children were all in an enclosed security office behind a glass wall , smiling , eating candy , and talking to a security guard and some Macy ’s employees .
I smiled and waved to them , relieved that everything appeared fine .
That feeling was quickly about to change .
As soon as we entered the office , I was confronted by two Bozeman city police officers .
One told me that what I had done was completely unacceptable in his opinion and that he was going to arrest me for endangering the welfare of my children .
I asked him if there was a mall age limit that I was not aware of .
He told me to be quiet .
I tried to explain to him that I had faith in my daughter ’s skills and in the safety of the mall , and that I was not an endangering parent .
As I tried to keep talking , desperate to clear up what was obviously nothing more than a huge misunderstanding , he warned me that if I “ went crazy ” on him , he would handcuff me right in front of the children and take me away to jail for the night .
He said he had called child services already .
They would either arrive at the mall shortly or get his report and be visiting my home this week to check in .
My husband tried to reason with the officer , emphasizing that this was a first - time mistake and asking if we could be set free with a warning , some lesser charge .
But the officer simply kept repeating that what I had done was a crime .
I was completely stunned , unable to grasp what was unfolding right before my eyes .
I sat down , scared , exhausted , and confused , and did n’t utter another word .
We were allowed to take the children home , but I was told I had to hire a lawyer and appear in court on June 21 .
As we drove home , the younger kids chattered about their adventure , oblivious about what had just transpired .
My husband asked some pointed questions , and details began to emerge : Olivia liked the candy the store employees gave her and said the ladies were nice ; Matthew said the employees asked strange questions ;
Ellie wondered why all the kids had been taken away to the Macy ’s office .
Natalie and her friend , both visibly shaken , were mostly quiet except to say that they had not been allowed to call us .
I sensed that they understood the bigger implications of what had happened and were not only worried about repercussions but also about their first encounter with the police .
“ Are we in trouble ? ” Matthew asked .
No , we replied .
Then he asked , “ Are you in trouble , Mommy ? ”
The question lingered in the air without an answer .
Guilt , a nagging feeling that always resided somewhere within me as a working mother , began to surface .
Was I a bad mother ?
Had my judgment been so completely off ?
The two police officers , so much younger than I , had been so certain that I had committed a crime against my own children .
They had not a shred of doubt .
Maybe they were right ; maybe in my at - times - frantic daily juggling act , I had lost the ability to care for my children .
I had been discovered !
My children would be taken from me !
And how was I going to explain this to my friends , who had entrusted their children to me ?
Shame , guilt ’s partner , took root as well .
When we arrived home I went straight to my room and lay down on the same bed on which , a few hours earlier , I had hoped for a couple of moments of peace .
Details of the incident became clear later .
The kids had gone into Macy ’s after lunch ; it was to be the final stop of the afternoon .
Natalie and her friend decided to try on some shirts and left the three younger kids in the purse section by the cosmetics counter — which , it ’s true , was against the rules that I had laid out for them .
While the girls were in the dressing room , some Macy ’s employees spotted the three younger kids and called mall security .
When Natalie and her friend returned less than five minutes later , all the kids were taken away to Macy ’s administrative office where they were held until the arrival of the city police .
The kids –who were now being treated as victims of abuse–were not allowed to use their cell phones to call me , because I was now considered a negligent mother .
In making their decisions , the mall police and city police relied upon the statements of four Macy ’s employees who worked the cosmetic counters , though it became clear later in written statements that some of the workers were not even in the store at the time , and that others had badly misestimated the younger kids ’ ages to be two , three , and four ( rather than three , seven , and eight ) .
The rest of the employees ’ stories vary wildly in time , place , and their perception of what actually happened .
At any point in the course of events , the Macy ’s employees , the mall security guards , the police , or the city prosecutor could have chosen to view my decision to drop my children off at the mall as an innocent moment of faulty judgment .
They could have slapped me on the wrist , or warned me , “ Do n’t do that again , ” or settled for any number of lesser charges .
After all , there is no law in Bozeman against dropping your children off at the mall .
But instead my actions were considered criminal neglect , “ violating a duty of care . ”
Why ?
As the pretrial procedures dragged on , I began to feel I was caught in a culture war , or perhaps several wars — town vs. gown , native Montanan vs. outsider , and working mother vs. working mother .
The city attorney made no secret of the fact that her own parenting choices informed her decision in backing up the police officer .
She told my lawyer in their first meeting that she also had a daughter and would never have left her at the mall .
She also said she believed professors are incapable of seeing the real world around them because their “ heads are always in a book . ”
Her first letter to my lawyer ended on a similar theme : “ I just think that even individuals with major educations can commit this offense , and they should not be treated differently because they have more money or education . ”
Despite the fact that Montana professors are among the lowest paid in the nation , and that undoubtedly the prosecutor has a law degree herself , she nevertheless categorized me as someone trying to receive special treatment .
My lawyer and I came to understand that , more than anything , the city attorney wanted me to plead guilty , to admit that I had “ violated a duty of care . ”
She wanted me to carry that crime with me for the rest of my life , a scarlet A that would symbolically humiliate me , teach me a lesson , and remain etched in my being .
I now realize that her pressure — her near obsession with having me plead guilty — had less to do with what I had done and more to do with her perception of me as an outsider who thought she was above the law , who had money to pay her way out of a mistake , who thought she was smarter than the Bozeman attorney because of her “ major education . ”
This perception took hold even though I had never spoken one word to her directly .
Nor did I ever speak in court ; only my lawyer did .
I was visible but silent , and thus unable to shake the image that the prosecutor had created of me : a rich , reckless , highly educated outsider mother who probably left her children all the time in order to read her books .
And that ’s how I became defendant Bridget Anne Lieb ( my married name ) , charged with a crime by the State of Montana , Case no .
TK -07-03739 .
The prosecutor was right in one respect .
I am an outsider .
My parents — my father born in Iowa from poor Irish immigrants , my mother raised by Russian Jewish parents in a small town in Wisconsin — left the United States in the late Fifties , never to return .
I was born in Italy and raised in Puerto Rico , one of eight children .
As kids , we were frequently left to our own devices , with the older children often left in charge of the younger ones .
In many ways , I raised my youngest sister , walking her around the neighborhood , taking her to the local neighborhood store , and more .
My mother was certainly around quite a bit , but many times she was not able to attend to all eight of us , each about a year apart , each with our own separate needs and demands on her time .
She , like many mothers , believed in the power of allowing her children to gain independence by depending on themselves .
Although I cannot speak for my siblings , I certainly believe that I derived not only a sense of independence from this practice but a sense of confidence in my ability to manage and make my own decisions .
During the months between my arrest and the deferred prosecution agreement that my lawyer eventually worked out , I began to feel that I was being reprimanded for allowing my daughter to develop that sense of responsibility , and , equally important , to come to the realization that sometimes failure is the best teacher of all .
Certainly , she had failed when she made the decision to walk into that dressing room , and had the police not intervened , I would have been angry with her , and she would have known that what she had done was wrong .
We both would have gained experience .
Instead , we got caught up in the legal system and wound up learning a different , sadder lesson : that self - sufficiency is shrinking in today ’s culture .
I saw this illustrated in the parenting class I ended up taking as part of the deferred prosecution agreement .
Listening to the questions from the other parents ( all of whom were there voluntarily , as far as I could tell ) it became clear to me that there ’s less room than there used to be to parent by instinct and to trust oneself , as my mother did .
Our culture has attempted to find a prescription for parenting , and many people want to believe in the prescription rather than in making their own daily judgments .
At every turn , the parents in the class asked questions that I believe they could have been able to figure out on their own .
Should I leave my child in timeout for less time if he yells out “ I ’m sorry ” ?
Should I not give my child dessert if she does n’t finish her meal ?
Should I let him play with his food or take it away when he does that and not give him any more ?
Should I let my child cry for twenty minutes or thirty ?
Should I close the door when my child goes to bed or leave it open ?
Should I tell my child I am angry or give her the silent treatment ?
Please tell me how to raise my children .
I , on the other hand , had trusted my own instincts and trusted the way I had been brought up when I made my decision on that fateful day :
It was fine to drop the kids off at the mall .
Did I learn from this ?
Absolutely .
I learned it ’s not okay to drop the kids off at the mall , not in Bozeman , Montana , anyway .
But I also learned that I am more fiercely attached than I realized to my way of parenting .
My temperament , my juggling , my choices : I would not let someone tell me how to raise my children .
Had I been willing to plead guilty , the whole case would have been settled in a month , with a fine of roughly eight hundred dollars and a permanent record .
Instead , I chose to plead not guilty , causing the case to go on for more than a year and cost us thousands of dollars .
I found support for my decision from my own mother , whose simple statement was the only one that made sense to me during the whole year :
If I did not defend myself , she told me , no one would .
My lawyer gave the prosecutor many options to choose from for punishment , ranging from hundreds of hours of community service to taking a parenting class to admission of a mistake .
But he could not give her the guilty plea that she so wanted .
I love my children .
I would die for them .
I have done my best as a working mother , balancing raising them with my job , making sure that I am home when they return from school , being with them on a daily basis .
I am by no means a perfect mother .
I get angry , I yell , I can be sarcastic , short - tempered , and inaccessible .
Yet my children know I love them .
They are safe and secure with me — and , I still believe , they are safe and secure in places I allow them to go without me , their friends ’ houses , our neighborhood , and , once , the mall .
I got through the year during which the case dragged on quietly , not sharing with anyone what had happened — not only because the judge had placed a gag order on the case , but also because I felt a deep , deep shame .
Here I was , someone who had been successful for almost thirteen years raising children and having a job — indeed , someone who was admired by others in this balancing act — and I was being accused of failing .
The exhaustion of being a working mother while trying to raise a wonderful family had caught up with me .
At times , I found myself thinking that six months in jail might be just what I needed .
In anticipation of my impending trial , my lawyer set up a mock jury in a conference room at his firm .
My daughter and I were called to the witness stand and asked to describe what happened to the best of our knowledge .
My lawyer thought the four mock jurors would come quickly to a decision .
They ended up discussing and fighting over the case for what felt to me like an eternity .
The jurors were meant to be representative of a broad spectrum of parents in Bozeman , which they were — but they also turned out to illustrate a microcosm of the parenting culture wars .
At stake was what constituted good parenting and whether or not I was guilty as charged .
We could hear their loud voices from the office ’s kitchen where we were waiting .
I finally was called back in with my lawyer .
What followed was one surprise after another .
First there was the Montana rancher who practically guffawed when he heard the charges against me .
At twelve years old , he told us , he was cutting wheat on a tractor and independently working a farm .
There was the child therapist who was appalled yet forgiving .
There was the father of one who was unforgiving , and there was the older homemaker who was oddly angered by my statement that I considered Bozeman a safe community .
“ There was a murder here last year , ” she exclaimed .
In the end , the mock jurors told me that if I wanted to win a real trial , I ’d have to cry and show remorse , or at least show some emotion .
Two things happened at that moment : I realized that I was so guarded about the incident that no true emotion was showing , not to strangers or to my friends or even to my husband .
And I realized I could never go to trial .
My lawyer worked out the deferred prosecution agreement , and I began my service .
At first I felt angry about the show the mock jurors had wanted me to put on , but I now realize that the only way to truly explain my story is through an emotional lens .
I do feel guilty about what happened .
Not because I committed a crime according to the legal definition , but because no parent has confidence that they have been completely successful , ever .
For all the times that I was not the “ good ” parent , I am guilty ; for all the times that I did not respond perfectly to my children ’s needs , I am guilty .
For all the times that I ’ve not given them enough of me , I am guilty .
For feeling constantly torn between so many daily demands , trying to make it all work , but knowing that I sometimes fall short , I am guilty .
But of knowingly putting my children in harm ’s way by letting them go to the mall alone ?
Not guilty .

A banking system loaded down with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of unrecognized bad debt — Japan in the 1990s ?
No , it ’s the United States today .
And where are American banks hiding their losses ?
Among other places , in their loan portfolios .
( Click table to enlarge in new window )
Banks have written down billions in toxic securities , but many toxic loans are still carried at close to full value .
According to data published by the Federal Reserve late last year , banks are carrying $ 3 trillion of residential real estate loans and $ 1.7 trillion of commercial real estate loans on their books for a total of $ 4.7 trillion .
Dan Alpert at Westwood Capital thinks as much as a fifth of that total could be uncollectable .
“ We know lots of mortgage loans are underwater , ” he says , describing the situation where the value of collateral has fallen below the principal balance of a loan .
“ A majority of the loans banks are holding were originated at the height of the bubble , when securitization broke down . ”
When securitization markets were fully functional , banks had been able to package and sell their loans to investors .
When those markets buckled , banks were forced to eat their own cooking — much of it rancid .
Banks argue that loans should not be marked down if they ’re still “ performing . ”
As long as borrowers are meeting their contractual obligations , there ’s no reason to take a writedown .
The problem is , this gives banks an excuse to extend , amend and pretend .
They can make concessions on loan terms or delay foreclosure notices , if only to maintain the fiction that borrowers will make good .
With real estate prices likely to fall , and stay , 40 percent below the peak , borrowers have a big incentive to renege on their side of the bargain .
This is how we become Japan .
Emergency bailout facilities allow banks that otherwise would have failed under the weight of bad loans to hold those loans to maturity — pretending the bad ones will be paid off in full over time .
In reality , many loans will default and banks will bleed capital for years .
Take commercial real estate .
As the Congressional Oversight Panel has reported , few CRE loans that were originated at the peak will qualify for refinancing when they mature .
Banks can pretend they will , carrying the loans at values far above what will ever be paid back .
FASB wants to bring some clarity to the issue .
A plan under discussion would force banks to record loans at fair value on their balance sheets .
But it ’s not clear how much good that would do .
One problem is that it ’s much more difficult to determine the fair value of a loan than it is the fair value of a security , where more liquid markets with more frequent price quotes make measurement relatively easier .
With loans , banks must rely on internal models .
Banks are now required to report fair value estimates four times a year .
But the most recent data raises just as many questions as it answers .
( Click table to enlarge in new window )
For instance , what estimates are banks using in their models ?
As Jonathan Weil of Bloomberg noted , Regions Financial carries its loans at 34 percent above fair value , Citigroup carries its loans at no premium .
This could mean Regions faces bigger losses down the road , or it could mean Citi ’s fair - value calculation is too charitable .
More likely , it means both .
Determining fair value is largely subjective .
So FASB ’s proposal , to make banks adjust their balance sheets accordingly , is imperfect .
It could have a positive impact if regulators use the new information to force banks to raise more capital , cushioning balance sheets from the future writedowns we know are lurking .
But will banks raise enough ?
Probably not .
Alpert is highly skeptical that banks ’ fair value estimates are accurate : “ Given the decline in value of collateral backing these loans , it ’s very likely banks are underestimating the severity of future losses . ”
So what do we do ?
We can start by eliminating government guarantees that allow banks to avoid dealing with the problem .
As things stand , the biggest banks have no incentive to write down loans because the Federal Reserve , Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Treasury Department have , in effect , promised them unlimited financing to hold loans to maturity .
As the Japanese can tell you , this is just a recipe for stagnation .
Thanks to a debt bubble that authorities refused to deal with decisively , that country is now entering its third consecutive lost decade .

I 've been working on fixing it .

working on the tty stuff trying to gradually get it sane without breaking

I spent

However I 've had enough .
If you think that problem is easy to fix you fix
it .
Have fun .
I 've zapped the tty merge queue so anyone with patches for the tty layer

The Commonwealth Bank has raised its home loan interest rates 0.1 percent .
It ’s only a very small interest rate rise , but it shows we are not all in this together .
For the Commonwealth , it is supposedly a response to the increased cost of borrowing .
Now remember , this is one of the banks which did n’t pass on the last Reserve Bank cut to customers in full .
Other banks will probably follow .
They have a nudge / wink relationship .
One Bank leads and the others follow .
Maybe they will listen to the Prime Minister and not increase their rates .
But Rudd ’s call – please Mr Micawber , do n’t take away more money – is the sigh of the powerless , more about spin and giving the impression of doing something than actually doing anything .
Shop around was Rudd Labor ’s advice .
Yes , move from the Commonwealth at an exorbitant cost to one of the other Big Four banks , all of whom already charge slightly more than the Commonwealth .
Some choice .
The banks are doing what banks and all other big businesses do – putting profit before people .
Kevin Rudd is in Government to manage that process .
Since that is your raison d’etre , Kevin , mate , why are you surprised when a bank puts profit first ?
You are n’t surprised at all .
You just have to feign mock outrage and then let them get away with it , like you did when they did n’t pass on the full rate cut last time .
The Commonwealth Bank has the money to absorb increase costs and pay it workers much more .
In the first half of this financial year it made $ 2.5 bn profit ( an increase of 9 percent over the previous comparison period ) .
Why not use some of that $ 2.5 bn to cushion borrowing costs ?
To pay more wages ?
Ah , that would impinge on the bank ’s profit rate .
And that is inviolate , is n’t it ?
Profit before people .
The Commonwealth Bank is undermining Government policy , which is to increase aggregate demand .
The Government says it is powerless .
This of course is not technically true .
But Labor wo n’t attack the logic of profit .
It is managing the system in the interests of the likes of the Commonwealth Bank .
So Rudd and Swann can talk all they like about us all being in this together , but in fact every recession we have ever had shows it is workers who bear the burden of the crisis , not bosses .
Profit is sacrosanct .
So Governments , bosses and most unions and their members put profit making before anything else .
What ’s good for profit is good for us all seems to be the mantra .
Until the crises of capitalism show us differently .
Let ’s look at the Commonwealth bank scorecard for us all being in this together .
The Bank so far has refused to pass on all the last RBA cut and it has now increased its home loan rate .
Home owners are apparently not in this togetherness bed with the Commonwealth Bank .
And which Bank is cutting the real wages of its staff ?
The Commonwealth .
I have written on this wage cutting before on this site .
The Bank has offered a pay increase of 1.5 per cent to staff who earn below $ 100,000 .
This is well below the inflation rate and is a real wage cut .
So when Rudd and the bosses claim we are all in this together , the actions of the Commonwealth Bank in attacking its workforce and working class borrowers show that for the lie it is .
What can be done ?
In South Africa unions are threatening to strike if their Central Bank does n’t cut interest rates to stimulate the economy .
It ’s a good pointer for what the ACTU should do – strike to force the RBA to cut rates and to force the bosses to pay real wage increases .
As part of a real wage campaign , Commonwealth Bank staff could refuse to process the increase .
It ’s all about profit .
Cut off the flow of profit to the Bank and they ’ll quickly begin to negotiate with you .
Do nothing and they ’ll steamroll you with wage cuts and the rest of us with rate increases .
On January 24 , 1961 , at about 12:30 AM , a B - 52 plane exploded in the skies over Goldsboro and Faro , NC .
It was carrying two Mark 39 thermonuclear bombs which disengaged when the jet disintegrated .
Apparently the right wing of the B - 52 began to leak fuel causing the explosion .
Three crewmen were killed and five survived .
Each of the disengaged bombs had a yield of 2 to 4 megatons .
That 's 250 times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima .
The parachute on one bomb opened and it landed relatively gently and was recovered quickly .
The parachute on the other bomb never opened and it crashed into a marshy area on a local farm .
It was difficult to retrieve and only part of the bomb was recovered .
The component that contains the nuclear material is still in the ground to this day possibly as deep as a 150 feet .
No one knows for sure how close the good people of Wayne County , North Carolina came to being part of a historic nuclear catastrophe .
Government officials claim safety devices in place assured the worst would never happen .
But just the thought that these jets ( and how many others ? ) are flying our friendly skies above our heads with active bombs is unnerving .
The environmental consequences of that incident are still ongoing .
The federal government purchased the swatch of land where the one bomb was not entirely recovered in an effort to prevent people from digging in the area more than five feet .
The state of North Carolina tests radiation levels of the water in that area yearly .
So far tests have shown radiation levels as normal .
I believe atomic bombs are monsters we created that we can't control .
There 's too much at stake .
There 's too much that could go wrong .

Via email , Valve mentioned that it was developing a new demo type format — for Team Fortress 2 or perhaps all Steam Games .
This comes as players have been breaking demo files after downloading new updates .

Tell us about that Robin Walker !
The Valve developer explains , " It 's getting close to being releasable in a beta form . "
The basic idea is that after players die or finish a round you are particularly proud of , you can ask the server to send you a demo of it .
" The server then sends you a demo that it recorded , which has the complete game state instead of just what your client saw , and it's in a format that 's robust and wo n't break as easily when we update the game , " Walker adds .
" In addition , the format has a some side benefits , like supporting full backwards and forwards time scrubbing . "

Not bad !

KAGUYA ( SELENE )
Last shots captured by the HDTV
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) and the Japan Broadcasting Corporation ( NHK ) would like to release the final still images taken by the onboard High Definition Television ( HDTV ) of the lunar explorer " KAGUYA " just prior to its maneuvered falling to the Moon .
The images are attached below .
The KAGUYA was launched on September 14 , 2007 , and was controlled to be dropped to the Moon on June 11 , 2009 , as its mission was completed .
The series of continued shots was taken with an interval of about one minute by the HDTV ( Teltephoto ) while the KAGUYA was maneuvered to decrease its altitude toward the impact position ( around GILL crater . )
We can see the approaching Moon surface as the KAGUYA went closer to it .
After the final image , the KAGUYA moved into the shaded area to make its final landing , thus it was pitch dark while taking an image .
This is the very final image shooting of the Moon by the KAGUYA HDTV .
You can enjoy images taken by the KAGUYA HDTV through JAXA Digital Archives , the KAGUYA Image Gallery , and the JAXA channel on YouTube .

Join the Fox News Boycott !
Due to the extremely biased and partisan reporting by Fox News shows including The O'Reilly Factor , Hannity , Fox & Friends , etc. , there is a strong public stance against supporting sponsors of these shows .
FoxNewsBoycott.com urges you to not only boycott Fox News , its sponsors , but also any stores or restaurants that air the Fox News channel in their place of business .
Have you seen the billboards around town that say “ Protect Your Right to Own a Pet ” ?
They show a child hugging a puppy and provide a website , exposeanimalrights.com , flanked by international “ no ” symbols ( a circle with a slash though it ) containing the initials PETA ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) and HSUS ( Humane Society of the United States ) .
When I first passed one a couple of weeks ago , I was confused .
Are we supposed to imagine that a PETA activist is about to snatch the puppy from the boy ’s hands because it ’s his “ pet ” and not his “ animal companion ” ?
Or -- and I admit this reaction is the result of living in a neighborhood with , shall we say , “ conflicting ” philosophies about pet care -- was something else afoot ?
Was “ protect your right to own a pet ” code for “ protect your sleazy right to keep your dog chained up in the yard all day ” ?
Admittedly , I can be a ridiculous softy when it comes to animals .
Nothing riles me up more than the thought of animal abuse , and I personally do n’t think it ’s everyone ’s “ right ” to own a pet .
But I ’m no radical either .
I eat meat , I wear leather and I occasionally pay to let my dog herd sheep , which I have a feeling PETA would n’t appreciate ( for the sheep ’s sake ) .
So although I was pretty sure I was n’t for this sign , was I necessarily against it ?
To find out , I had to call Kathy Grayson , a professional dog handler in Riverside County who is behind the signs .
She said she was fed up with what she considers unfair legislation -- primarily mandatory spay and neutering laws -- furthered by what are in her view manipulative messages from PETA , the Humane Society and others .
Spay and neutering laws punish those who responsibly breed and show dogs , she said .
True , you can pay for exemptions , but Grayson maintains that it ’s too easy for exemptions to be revoked .
“ I ’d drive home from dog shows and pass all these empty billboards on the interstate , ” she said .
“ I started to think how great it would be to put a sign in the middle of Hollywood telling people the truth about extremist groups . ”
Advertisement
Grayson called the Lamar billboard company , which offered her not just a sign in Hollywood but 100 throughout L.A. for $ 6,000 a month .
She began gathering donations , which led her to join forces with a group called the National Animal Interest Alliance , a nonprofit consortium of breeders , trainers , veterinarians , researchers and others who feel threatened by animal - rights and even animal welfare groups .
The NAIA created the “ expose animal rights ” website and now technically sponsors the sign , though the design was a collaborative effort between Grayson and a Lamar designer .
When I told Grayson I ’d read it as a possible defense of bad owners and breeders , she was shocked .
“ That thought never occurred to me , ” she said .
“ Of course I ’m against tethering a dog .
Of course I ’m against puppy mills .
I ’m trying to reach the people , the people who support PETA and HSUS without realizing that , if they get their way and we have mandatory sterilization and breeders have to go underground , there will eventually be no dogs left . ”
Oh my .
Let ’s back up for a second .
I guess I can see why you ’d put HSUS and PETA on the same billboard if you believe there ’s no such thing as pet overpopulation and no reason to push for spay and neuter laws .
Both of these groups agree that there are far too many unwanted animals in the world .
But unless I missed the memo , they do n’t have a lot else in common .
PETA is pretty radical in its concern for animals ; it just went after the president for killing a fly .
The Humane Society is a mainstream anti-cruelty and animal - shelter organization .
Advertisement
Grayson ( echoed by Patti Strand , founder of the NAIA ) claims that both groups are against even responsible breeding .
When I called Wayne Pacelle , president of the Humane Society , he told me that was n’t the case at all .
In fact , he said that when he went on “ Oprah ” to talk about puppy mills , his advice about getting a dog from a good breeder if you could n’t adopt from a shelter incurred the wrath of PETA , which does object to all breeding .
So the more I found out , the more I thought confusion was the best response to the billboard .
Based on my conversation with Grayson , I think what she meant to say with it would be more along the lines of “ animal rights is n’t necessarily the same as animal welfare ” or “ only YOU should decide whether to spay or neuter your pet . ”
If I ’m right , it ’s too bad the billboards do n’t just say that .
But then again , it ’s not easy to satisfyingly distill the nuances of the issues .
And maybe that was Grayson ’s problem .
In other words , these ideas are complicated and sometimes subtle , not qualities generally conducive to communication via billboards .
As a result , the message becomes a matter of interpretation -- and maybe even a traffic hazard as people like me scratch their heads trying to figure it out .

On the other hand , I have new respect for all those billboards for gentlemen ’s clubs .
You know exactly what they ’re saying .

Take , for example , this morning 's rant from regular Fox & Friends host , Brian Kilmeade .
Discussing a study from Scandinavia that showed that married individuals appear more capable of fending off Alzheimer 's and dementia than divorcees , Kilmeade insisted that the real reason for the study 's results must be the " pure genes " of the Swedes .
Nevermind that the study did n't compare non-Swedes with Swedes , Kilmeade could n't stop himself from taking this opportunity to share his medical wisdom like a drunken uncle at a Mississippi family reunion .
According to " Doktor " Kilmeade :
" We are — we keep marrying other species and other ethnics and other ...
See , the problem is the Swedes have pure genes .
Because they marry other Swedes ....
Fins marry other Fins , so they have a pure society . "
Of course , on Fox , making an argument that borders on a call for eugenics does n't provoke nearly as much hostility as , say , arguing for universal health care or habeas corpus .
Rather , on a channel that has repeatedly accused Obama of promoting fascism , parroting the racist rhetoric of actual fascists gets shrugged off as silly morning banter !
Haha !
Just grab another cup of coffee , Brian .

When it comes to domestic policy , there are two Barack Obamas .
On one side there ’s Barack the Policy Wonk , whose command of the issues  and ability to explain those issues in plain English  is a joy to behold .
But on the other side there ’s Barack the Post - Partisan , who searches for common ground where none exists , and whose negotiations with himself lead to policies that are far too weak .
Both Baracks were on display in the president ’s press conference earlier this week .
First , Mr. Obama offered a crystal - clear explanation of the case for health care reform , and especially of the case for a public option competing with private insurers .
“ If private insurers say that the marketplace provides the best quality health care , if they tell us that they ’re offering a good deal , ” he asked , “ then why is it that the government , which they say ca n’t run anything , suddenly is going to drive them out of business ?
That ’s not logical . ”
But when asked whether the public option was non-negotiable he waffled , declaring that there are no “ lines in the sand . ”
That evening , Rahm Emanuel met with Democratic senators and told them  well , it ’s not clear what he said .
Initial reports had him declaring willingness to abandon the public option , but Senator Kent Conrad ’s staff later denied that .
Still , the impression everyone got was of a White House all too eager to make concessions .
Certified Commercial General Contractor Suncoast is a State Certified General Contractor and has been one of the premier Commercial Construction Contractors in the Tampa Bay area since 1990 .
As a Commercial Contractor , in the early years our emphasis was on St. Petersburg , Clearwater , Largo , Pinellas Park , Tierra Verde , Gulf Beaches , St. Pete Beach , Madeira Beach and occasionally Tampa , however , that did not last long and we have had many successful projects all over Pinellas , Hillsborough , Pasco , Manatee and Sarasota Counties and as far away as Jacksonville and Miami , including many Design / Build projects .
New Commercial Construction demands a fast and efficient schedule , often utilizing CPM Scheduling ( Critical Path Method Scheduling ) techniques .
This level of construction requires a high level of coordination between the design team , material suppliers , subcontractors , construction activities , local municipalities and the Owner .
As the General Contractor , we orchestrate the coordination between these entities .
Here are a few of our noted New Commercial Construction Projects Trademark Metals Recycling - Sutton Yard
This project was to build the support structure for a 1,240 ton capacity scrap- metal shear , a machine that cuts steel coming out of a 3 ’ x 3 ’ x 30 ’ hopper like scissors cutting through paper .
Due to the terrific impact forces , the shear rests on a 4 ’ thick foundation on 60 concrete piles driven 40 ’ into the earth .
The support building houses a hydraulic unit with six pumps and an electrical array that covers a 16 ’ x 8 ' wall .
Trademark Metals Recycling - Acre Iron Yard
As a seasoned commercial builder , the construction of this relatively small employee building was not particularly difficult but there were challenges in tying this and the another existing building into the sanitary system , eliminating the existing septic system .
The challenge was that the sanitary system was several blocks away and we needed to keep the yard in full operation throughout construction .
Suncoast provided all of the design services as well as the construction .
RJ Longboat & Sons Construction - New Offices and Equipment Yard Suncoast handled this Design / Build project from the initial stages , starting with the design phase and working with the planning staff , correcting rezoning issues through City of St Petersburg , achieving an approval over some of the staff 's unfair recommendations at the City Council hearing , through construction and final approvals .

How to season cast iron pans
We 're big fans of cast iron cookware , but it does take a little more maintenance than some other materials .
Most importantly you need to season cast iron .
Seasoning simply means a patina of carbon which not only protects the pan from rust ( which exposed iron will do rapidly ) , but also gives cast iron a natural non -stick finish .
Many pans come pre-seasoned these days , but if you need to re-season or refurbish a rusted pan here 's how to do it .
About the only way to destroy a cast iron piece is to crack it , which becomes a possibility with quick temperature changes .
This is more common in older pans , but can happen to any piece .
Do n't place a very hot pan into cold water and you should be fine .
Refurbishing a rusted cast iron pan
Rusted pans can easily be brought back to life .
Check out the photos below , we let a pan rust just so we can show you how to bring it back to life .
Antique cast iron is easy to find , so keep in mind this technique next time you see an otherwise beautiful piece that has rusted .
Wash the rusted pan with hot soapy water , this is one of the few times you want to wash cast iron with soap but since we 'll be re-seasoning you have nothing to worry about Sand the rust off , we used steel wool and Bar Keeper 's Friend .
Steel wool comes in grades , we used grade # 0 which was recommended on the package for scouring pans .
It 's pretty fine which is what we wanted -- no scratches were left in the pan after the rust was gone .
Proceed to seasoning
Seasoning cast iron
Pre-heat oven to 350 ºF ( 175 ºC )
Wash the pan in hot soapy water , you want it to be clean before proceeding Dry the pan off as best you can and place in the oven for several minutes to completely dry .
The fat needs to soak into the iron and it must be completely dry for this to work best ( oil and water do n't mix ! )
Place approximately a tablespoon of vegetable shortening into the pan , close oven door and wait until the fat melts .
Remove the pan and apply a thin layer of the fat to all sides of the pan using paper towels and kitchen tongs .
You do n't want a pool of fat remaining in the bottom of the pan when you 're done , if there 's extra simply remove it .
Place fat - coated pan in the oven and bake for an hour .
After the hour is over , turn the oven off and let the pan cool inside the oven .
At this point you have a seasoned pan that should have darkened significantly in color .
If you properly care for your pan this seasoning layer will only improve and the darkening will continue .
Notes
If you do n't have any shortening you can use a liquid fat such as vegetable oil , but we 've had problems with those becoming sticky .
Lard is also a good choice if you 'd like to stay all natural .

Transgender Golfer
Miane Bagger is the first male - to - female transgender golfer to play professionally .
She was born a male in Denmark in 1966 , and emigrated to Australia in 1979 , where she presently splits her time between Adelaide and Perth .
As the Australian Amateur Golf Association had no existing rulings againest transgenders , Bagger was allowed to compete and won the South Australian Championship in 1999 , 2001 and 2002 .
She was ranked as high as 6th on the Australian amateur golf circuit .
At the time this caused controversy , with strong arguments on both sides .
In 2003 she played in the Australian Women ’s Open and attempted to join the Australian Ladies Professional Golf [ ALPA ] tour .
In 2004 she was admitted .
As of 2008 , Bagger is still unable to compete in the US based LPGA as they maintain a ‘ female at birth ’ entry condition .
Bad news is never new , but anyone overwhelmed by today 's political scandals , wars , financial disasters , soaring ­unemployment and drunken feral ­children can take refuge in the 19th century – and its wars , financial disasters , political scandals , soaring unemployment and drunken feral children .
Over two million pages of 19th and early 20th century newspapers go online today , part of the vast British Library collection .
The 49 British national and regional titles cover events including the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815 – " Vague reports have been made of the numbers slain on both sides ...
We should not quote them if our silence could prevent the spreading of disastrous intelligence " , the Morning Chronicle reported .
There was also the banks crisis of 1878 , the first FA Cup final in 1872 , and the triumph of the music hall star Vesta Tilley in a talent contest .
On 18 June 1859 , the papers were reporting the political turmoil after the resignation of the Cabinet , as Palmerston struggled to put together a government in coalition with his former deadly rival Lord John Russell .
As the Oxford Journal put it : " For the moment an event in our domestic politics eclipses in national interest the ever varying phases of the struggle in Italy . "
The Ipswich Journal reported passionate speeches in the House of Commons : " Their policy tended to ruin the people of England , and when they were turned out of office men slept more quietly in their beds .
( Cries of " Oh ! Oh ! " ) "
Half a century earlier the news was no ­better .
On June 18 1809 the Examiner warned of the alarming advances of the Emperor Napoleon against the Austrians , while its correspondent in Bohemia reported the confident prediction of Archduke Charles : " The days of the 21st and 22nd of May will be eternally memorable in the history of the world . "
The shocking spectacle of drunken working men , women and even children was a recurring concern , but there was rare good news in 1840 , when a correspondent to the Leeds Mercury reported the success of Father Mathew 's temperance crusade in Dublin : " We still have abundance of poor , but our streets are not filled with the haggard and bloated faces they once were . "
The site – http://newspapers.bl.uk/blcs – holds journals including the True Crime of its day , the Illustrated Police News which covered the Jack the Ripper murders .

An 82 - year - old masked man wielding a machine gun , a knife and a samurai sword was overpowered as he marched towards a meeting of Jehovah 's Witnesses , German police have said .
One of the congregation noticed the heavily - armed man approaching and swiftly ushered the 81 fellow worshippers out of an emergency exit of the church building , police in the north - western city of Bielefeld said Friday ( local time ) .
The pensioner entered the now empty building , stayed for a while and then departed , where he was promptly set upon by two of the Jehovah 's Witnesses who forced him to the ground until police showed up to arrest him .
Police have begun an investigation into the incident , but no motivation for the man 's actions have yet emerged .

A showgirl who claims that she and other women were paid to attend Silvio Berlusconi 's private parties said yesterday that she had pictures showing her with the Italian prime minister in his bedroom .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Patrizia D'Addario , a former model and escort girl , said that she had given prosecutors audio tapes but also had secretly recorded video footage of her encounters in Mr Berlusconi 's Rome residence , the Palazzo Grazioli .
Ms D'Addario , 42 , who was yesterday described by a senior government figure as a high - class prostitute , said that the footage showed her standing in front of a mirror .
A bedroom with a framed photograph of Veronica Lario , Mr Berlusconi 's estranged wife , was in view .
She said she had made the recordings " so that nobody could deny I had been there " .
Ms Lario sued for divorce after Mr Berlusconi attended the 18th birthday party of Noemi Letizia , an aspiring model .
She accuses her husband of " frequenting minors " .
Police said they were checking Ms D'Addario 's footage to ensure that the rooms shown were in the Palazzo Grazioli and that the voice on her tapes was Mr Berlusconi's .
Three other women who claim that they were paid to attend Mr Berlusconi 's parties have also been interviewed by prosecutors .
Mr Berlusconi , 72 , who is not himself under investigation , has dismissed the allegations as falsehoods .
Prosecutors have drawn up a list of more women they wish to interview , as well as others who may have had a role .
These include local politicians who put up Ms D'Addario as a candidate in the European and municipal elections on 6 - 7 June on behalf of the People of Liberty , Mr Berlusconi 's party , and aides to Giampaolo Tarantini , the Bari businessman under investigation for allegedly supplying women for Mr Berlusconi 's parties .
The scandal of " paid women " came to light during a three - month police inquiry into Mr Tarantini , 35 , and his brother Claudio , 40 , over alleged corruption involving contracts for hospital equipment .
Alfredo Mantovano , the deputy interior minister , said that the latest revelations were fabricated by plotters trying to bring down Mr Berlusconi .
According to Italian reports , police records showed Ms D'Addario had advertised her services an escort .
They said that two years ago she had gone to police after a prostitute was murdered , saying that she feared for her life , and denounced her then partner as a pimp .
The man was arrested and convicted but released under an amnesty , reports said .

In further extracts from her interview yesterday in ' Corriere della Sera ' , Ms D'Addario said that she had never been asked to go to Mr Berlusconi's Sardinian villa , although she claimed that other women had been paid to do so .
" Giampaolo told me there was a possibility of a holiday abroad - I think it was Bermuda . "
Mr Berlusconi owns a villa on Bermuda .
Ms D'Addario said that she had twice been to Palazzo Grazioli ; first in October last year when she had been paid € 1,000 , half the agreed sum , because she had not stayed the night .
A second time in November she had stayed the night but had not been paid .
She said she and other women had been taken from a hotel to the house in cars with darkened windows .
They had been told to " dress elegantly , with not too much make - up " .
As Prime Minister Kevin Rudd heads off to major international meetings with climate change high on the agenda this week , a new report reveals that seasons which were once distinct are shifting , destroying harvests and causing widespread hunger .
This is just one of the multiple impacts of climate change taking their toll on the world 's poorest people , according to the Oxfam report ' Suffering the Science - Climate Change , People and Poverty ' .
The report 's release comes ahead of the G8 Summit in Italy ( which starts Wednesday ) and the Major Economies Forum ( Thursday ) , both of which Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is attending .
Combining the latest scientific observations on climate change with evidence from the communities Oxfam works with in almost 100 countries around the world , the report reveals how the burden of climate change is already hitting poor people hard .
" Climate change is the central poverty issue of our times , " said Oxfam Australia climate change policy advisor Julie - Anne Richards .
" Climate change is happening today and the world 's poorest people , who already face a daily struggle to survive , are being hit hardest .
The evidence is clear - the human cost of climate change is as real as any redundancy or repossession notice .
" In Australia , we are staring down the barrel of greater droughts , more extreme fire days , and the prospect of diseases such as dengue fever expanding into new regions .
Such impacts are already being felt by people in developing countries . "
The report warns that , without immediate action , 50 years of development gains in poor countries will be permanently lost .
It predicts that climate - related hunger could be the defining human tragedy of this century .
Suffering the Science outlines evidence of how climate change is affecting every issue linked to poverty and development today , including :
- HUNGER : Rice and maize , two of the world 's most important crops on which hundreds of millions depend , particularly in Asia , the Americas and Africa , face significant drops in yields even under mild climate change scenarios .
Maize yields are forecast to drop by 15 per cent or more by 2020 , in much of sub -Saharan Africa and in most of India .
One estimate puts the loss to Africa at US $ 2bn a year .
- AGRICULTURE : New research based on interviews with farmers in 15 countries across the world reveals how once distinct seasons are shifting and rains are disappearing .
Farmers from countries including Bangladesh , Uganda and Nicaragua , who are no longer able to rely on generations of farming experience , are facing failed harvest after failed harvest .
- HEALTH : Diseases such as malaria and dengue fever that were once geographically bound are creeping to new areas where populations lack immunity or the knowledge and healthcare infrastructure to cope with them .
It is estimated that climate change has contributed to an average of 150,000 more deaths from disease per year since the 1970s , with over half of those happening in Asia .
In Singapore , Bangkok and the cities of Indonesia , dengue fever rates have risen continually over the past 20 years .
- DISASTERS : Disasters including mega fires and storms are on the rise and could triple by 2030 .
Hurricanes and cyclones throughout the world in 2005 cost a record US $ 165 billion , and the insurance industry says that climate change will make the situation worse , particularly for poor people who have no access to insurance .
Meanwhile , research shows that for every $ 1 spent on hazard reduction or disaster preparedness , an estimated $ 4 is saved .
- WATER : Water supplies are becoming so acutely challenged that several cities including Kathmandu and La Paz , which are dependent on the Himalayan and Andes glaciers , may soon be unable to function .
- DISPLACEMENT : An estimated 26 million people have been displaced as a direct result of climate change and each year a million more are displaced by weather related events .
Island communities from Vanuatu , Tuvalu and the Bay of Bengal have already been forced to move because of sea level rise .
- LABOUR : Rising temperatures will make it impossible for people to work at the same rate on hot summer days without serious health impacts , with huge ramifications for labourers paid by the hour and the wider economy .
Tropical cities such as Delhi could see a drop in worker productivity of as much as 30 per cent .
A survey of top climate scientists , also published by Oxfam today , said poor people living in low - lying coastal areas , island atolls in the Pacific , mega deltas and farmers throughout the world , are most at risk from climate change because of flooding and prolonged drought .
The scientists , all contributors to the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , named South Asia and Africa as climate change hotspots .
Many scientists are now sceptical as to whether the world can limit global warming to 2=B0C because they do not believe politicians are willing to agree the necessary cuts in carbon emissions , the report says .
Two degrees of warming is considered to be " economically acceptable " to rich countries , however whilst all countries , including Australia , would suffer , it would mean a devastating future for 660 million people throughout the developing world .
Professor Diana Liverman , a leading contributor to three IPCC Assessment Reports and a member of the National Academy of Sciences Committee , which advises the US Government on climate change , said if countries did not make deep cuts in emissions now , the changing climate would bring heat stress , sea level rise and more extreme drought and floods .
" Organisations like Oxfam can try and help people adapt to climate change but without a serious effort to reduce warming , and in the absence of international funds for adaptation , the food , water , health and livelihoods of millions of people will be at risk , " Ms Liverman said .
Oxfam Australia is calling for the Australian Government to show leadership in delivering a fair and safe global deal to tackle climate change , as only political commitment at the highest level can prevent a human catastrophe .
Rich industrialised countries , which created the climate crisis and have the resources to tackle it , must cut their emissions by at least 40 per cent on 1990 levels by 2020 and mobilise $ 187 billion per year to fund emissions reduction and adaptation in the developing world .
" Australia must show leadership at the UN climate negotiations and contribute to a global climate deal which has the needs of the world 's poorest people at its heart , " Ms Richards said .
Survey of top climate scientists : 330 scientists who contributed to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report ; Working Group II on Impacts , Adaptation and Vulnerability , were invited to take part in an on - line survey .
12.73 per cent of scientists responded .

Today , NASA released a sneak preview of restored video from Apollo 11 !
The footage is digitally cleaned from archival tapes , and is part of an ongoing project ( due to finish in September ) to get all the video processed and restored for release .
The footage was obtained using archival tapes found at the National Archives as well as CBS archives .
The tapes were scanned and cleaned using state - of - the - art digital techniques , and clearly show visible improvement .
Many of the noisy artifacts from the archived tapes have been removed , and the new footage shows details not previously available .
I have uploaded a montage of the Apollo 11 footage to YouTube ( the higher - def version can be seen at this link ) :
Let me be clear here : this video is not from any " lost " tapes !
There were rumors that NASA had found tapes that were lost years ago , and these showed the Apollo 11 footage in unprecedented detail .
These rumors are false .
The deal is that the telemetery from Apollo was downlinked from the Moon to two radio telescopes in Australia and one in the U.S .
The data were recorded on tapes and then processed .
The tapes themselves were stored for some time , but after the data were secured it was deemed that the original tapes were no longer needed .
They were wiped and reused for LANDSAT and Shuttle telemetry -- we 're talking hundreds of thousands of tapes here , so reusing them saved NASA a lot of money .
That decision may seem silly now , but at the time was deemed necessary .
So no lost tapes were found , and no previously unseen footage has been found .
What we 're seeing here is broadcast footage that has been digitally restored .
Still , there is value to this .
For example , in the last few seconds of the montage you can see ( I think )
Aldrin moving across the lunar surface as he and Armstrong plant the flag .
As he skips by , you can see the lunar regolith ( the finely ground dust on the surface ) scudding up from his boot .
On Earth , that dust would billow up in the air , and travel perhaps a few centimeters .
In the footage you can clearly see the dust moves on a ballistic path , barely arcing at all and moving a meter or two .
Clearly this was filmed in an airless , low - gravity environment .
Incredible !
It 'll be a few more months before all the video is cleaned up and released .
I can't wait to sit and watch the whole thing !
Today marks the 40th anniversary of the launch of the Saturn V rocket that carried the first humans to the Moon , and this is a very fitting way of celebrating that pivotal moment in history .
We 've all speculated about why the anti-scientific emotion - based notion that vaccines somehow must cause autism persists in spite of mountains of evidence to the contrary , but I think the question goes much deeper than that .
The anti-vaccine movement is but one of the most visible components of a much deeper problem in our public discourse , a problem that values feelings and personal experience over evidence , compelling stories and anecdotes over science .
I 'm referring to the Oprah - fication of medicine .
Why Oprah ? you may ask .
I 'm happy to tell you .
Oprah Winfrey has been the host of the highest - rated syndicated talk show in television history .
She has developed a media empire that few single individuals can match or beat .
Clearly , she is a talented and savvy TV host and businesswoman .
Unfortunately , Oprah displays as close to no critical - thinking skills when it comes to science and medicine as I 've ever seen , and uses the vast influence her TV show and media empire give her in order to subject the world to her special brand of mystical New Age thinking and belief in various forms of what can only be characterized as dubious medical therapies at best and quackery at worst .
Naturally , Oprah does n't see it that way , and likely no one could ever convince her of the malign effect she has on the national zeitgeist with respect to science and medicine .
Consequently , whether fair or unfair , she represents the perfect face to put on the problem that we supporters of science - based medicine face when trying to get the message out to the average reader about unscientific medical practices , and that 's why I am referring to the pervasiveness of pseudoscience infiltrating medicine as the " Oprah - fication " of medicine .
Over the years , Oprah has promoted a wide variety of pseudoscience and mysticism on her show .
Indeed , just last week , Newsweek ran a long article entitled " Live Your Best Life Ever !
Wish Away Cancer !
Get A Lunchtime Face - Lift ! Eradicate Autism !
Turn Back The Clock !
Thin Your Thighs !
Cure Menopause !
Harness Positive Energy !
Erase Wrinkles !
Banish Obesity ! Live Your Best Life Ever ! "
It reveals just how forcefully Oprah and her credulous belief in New Age nonsense are reflected in her show .
It starts with the example of Suzanne Somers , who in January appeared on Oprah to talk about what she does to stay young .
As Newsweek ( whose story merits quoting ) reported , " Each morning , the 62 - year - old actress and self - help author rubs a potent estrogen cream into the skin on her arm .
She smears progesterone on her other arm two weeks a month .
And once a day , she uses a syringe to inject estrogen directly into her vagina . "
The article continues , " The idea is to use these unregulated `bio- identical ' hormones to restore her levels to what they were when she was in her 30s , thus fooling her body into thinking she 's a younger woman . "
It is noted that Somers claims the hormones , synthesized from plants , are natural and risk free ; Newsweek 's writer rightly takes issue with the last point .
Somers told Oprah that every day she takes some 60 vitamin pills – 40 supplements in the morning , 20 more before going to bed .
She begins the day with injections of vitamin B12 , the human growth hormone and , Newsweek reports , " wears `nanotechnology patches ' to help her sleep , lose weight and promote `overall detoxification . ' "
After drinking wine she boosts her liver by taking vitamin C intravenously ; Somers has chelation therapy to clean her blood if she breathes cigarette smoke .
The actress makes remarkable claims for hormones ' ability to aid the human body .
" I know I look like some kind of freak and fanatic , " she is quoted saying .
" But I want to be there until I 'm 110 , and I 'm going to do what I have to do to get there . "
By Newsweek 's account , " That was apparently good enough for Oprah .
` Many people write Suzanne off as a quackadoo , ' she said .
` But she just might be a pioneer ... ' "
Oprah 's show gave doctors several chances to respond , but they were in the audience while Somers , Newsweek reports , sat onstage with Oprah , who defended her .
Oprah is quoted saying " Suzanne swears by bioidenticals and refuses to keep quiet . "
I 've known for a while that Somers promotes so - called " bioidentical hormones . "
I 've also realized that it is the height of stupidity for a woman who has survived breast cancer to pump herself full of estrogen in the futile and pathetic quest to reclaim her lost youth .
It 's just begging for a recurrence of her breast cancer .
Somers epitomizes the cliché of " I 'd rather be lucky than good . "
Either that , or her cancer was estrogen receptor - negative , but even in that case it 's definitely pushing her luck to be bathing in " bioidentical " estrogens .
Oprah , reported Newsweek , " told her audience that she found Somers 's bestselling books on bioidentical hormones `fascinating ' and said `every woman should read ' what she has to say .
She did n't stop there .
Oprah said that although she has never had a hot flash , after reading Somers she decided to go on bioidenticals herself .
` After one day on bioidentical estrogen , I felt the veil lift , ' she wrote in O , The Oprah Magazine .
` After three days , the sky was bluer , my brain was no longer fuzzy , my memory was sharper .
I was literally singing and had a skip in my step . '
On the show , Oprah had her own word of warning for the medical establishment :
` We have the right to demand a better quality of life for ourselves , ' she said .
` And that 's what doctors have got to learn to start respecting . '"
That statement epitomizes the attitude that infuses The Oprah Winfrey Show when it comes to medical issues and science .
Anecdotes trump science , and scientists should " respect " pseudoscience because of feelings and a desire for " quality of life . "
Indeed , these are exactly the attitudes that permeate the Complementary and Alternative Care movement and the anti-vaccine movement .
But Somers says it 's mainstream medicine that does n't have the facts .
" ` The problem is that our medical schools do not teach this , ' " she is quoting saying in a February interview in Newsweek .
It reported that Somers " believes doctors , scientists and the media are all in the pocket of the pharmaceutical industry , " and that " Billions are spent on marketing drugs , and these companies also support academic research . "
Without such conflicts , " Somers can see things clearly .
` I have spent thousands of hours on this .
I 've written 18 books on health .
I know my stuff . ' "
No , Somers does not know her stuff .
Writing books is no guarantee that she " knows her stuff , " particularly given that she clearly does not understand science and cherry - picks references to support her viewpoint , ignoring those that do not .
Somers also thinks her self - taught knowledge trumps the understanding of scientists who have dedicated their lives to studying such questions deeply .
The absolute worst of Oprah 's protégées is the celebrity spokesmodel for the anti-vaccine movement , Jenny McCarthy .
Beginning in the fall of 2007 , McCarthy , characterized as having " warrior spirit " and as a " warrior mom , " has been a regular guest on Oprah , where she 's been given more or less free rein to spread her gospel of vaccines causing autism and her claims that biomedical quackery can " cure " or " recover " autistic children .
McCarthy 's promotion of anti-vaccine propaganda and pseudoscience is , quite simply , so egregious and such a threat to public health that even the Oprah - friendly ( or Oprah - intimidated ) media has become alarmed .
Reporters have tried to get a statement from Oprah .
From an article on a recent TV documentary , The Oprah Effect :
" Asked if Oprah or her show endorses McCarthy 's views , a representative for Oprah 's program said , ` We do n't take positions on the opinions of our guests .
Rather , we offer a platform for guests to share their first - person stories in an effort to inform the audience and put a human face on topics relevant to them . '
When McCarthy 's views have been discussed on the air , statements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics saying that there 's no scientific evidence of a vaccine - autism link have been read . "
And from the Newsweek cover story :

" She declined to be interviewed for this article , but in a statement she said , ` The guests we feature often share their first - person stories in an effort to inform the audience and put a human face on topics relevant to them .
I 've been saying for years that people are responsible for their actions and their own well - being .
I believe my viewers understand the medical information presented on the show is just that – information – not an endorsement or prescription .
Rather , my intention is for our viewers to take the information and engage in a dialogue with their medical practitioners about what may be right for them . '" In other words , Oprah washes her hands of responsibility for spreading misinformation under the guise of trusting her audience to be able to distinguish good advice from bad advice .
It apparently matters not that McCarthy 's claims are based on her belief in autism quackery and anti-vaccine pseudoscience .
All that matters is that , by her own narrative , McCarthy has " triumphed " over the odds for the sake of her son .
The compelling personal story of " empowerment " thus trumps science , and the only " balance " Oprah feels compelled to provide is a dry statement from the CDC and AAP .
Philosopher and ethicist ( not to mention blogger ) Janet Stemwedel asks :
" Is it acceptable to give any guest you please a soapbox without taking a position on the opinions they voice from that soapbox ?
Is reading official statements from the CDC and AAP enough `balance ' to Jenny McCarthy 's views on vaccines ...?
" And , if Oprah and her producers are aware of the Oprah effect ( which , really , they have to be , right ? ) , should that awareness of their reach lead them to try to meet a higher ethical standard as far as the foreseeable consequences for giving Jenny McCarthy a soapbox ? "
I have two answers to those questions : my answers in an ideal world and my answer in the real world .
In an ideal world , my answers would be :
No , simply reading an official statement from the CDC and AAP as " balance " to Jenny McCarthy 's idiotic and dangerous views on vaccines , which have led her to a know - nothing activism based on the arrogance of ignorance that is already eroding faith in vaccines .
She uses emotion and her son to argue falsely that vaccines cause autism and that various quackery " cured " him ( and , by inference , can cure other children with autism , too ) .
Reading a dry statement from the CDC is utterly useless in combating this message .
It is nothing more than what I like to call the " token skeptic " who trots out the skeptical viewpoint briefly in a formulaic method .
" Balance , " after all , implies that there is enough scientific validity to a view that it is somewhere on the same planet with science .
There is no " balance " between Jenny McCarthy and scientists .
Jenny McCarthy is , quite simply , completely wrong about vaccines and autism .
" Balance " is a sham used by promoters of pseudoscience and quackery to claim a legitimacy that they do n't deserve .
In the real world , unfortunately , my answer would be this :
If it gets ratings , it interests Oprah .
If it fits into her apparent " spiritual " world view , it 's all good to her .
If it fits in with the " alternative " medical beliefs of her audience , she likes it .
If it provides a message of " empowerment " ( whether real or not ) , it is good .
The bottom line is that , when it comes to medicine and science , she is a force for ill .
Her intentions may be the best in the world , but that is only why she is the living embodiment of the cliché that the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
That 's especially true when that same road is also paved with no mental filter of critical thinking to keep out nonsense .
With great power comes great responsibility , indeed .
Unfortunately , given the infiltration of quackery into academic medicine , I 'm having a hard time determining if Oprah is a symptom or one of the causes of the rise of pseudoscience and quackery over science - based medicine .

Czech Roma have demonstrated in the past against alleged discrimination
Canada is considering measures to deal with the large number of people seeking asylum from the Czech Republic .
They are almost all members of the Roma or gypsy minority , fleeing what they say is persecution at home .
Czech officials say Ottawa is considering re-imposing visas , which would be a major setback for Czech tourists and business people .
Last year 860 Czechs applied for asylum .
This year , the figure has already exceeded 1,000 .
Bomb attack
Critics say they are economic migrants , simply heading to Canada in search of a better life .
Roma groups angrily deny that , pointing to a sharp rise in far - right extremism in the Czech Republic , including a petrol bomb attack that left a baby girl in hospital .
Neo -Nazi marchers have been deliberately targeting areas with large Roma communities , something that Roma groups say is adding to a climate of fear .
Reports say Canada has granted asylum to around 40 % of the claims filed by Czech Roma , meaning that the requests met Canada 's stipulation of a " well - founded fear of persecution " .
Czech officials have confirmed that the Canadian visa threat is real , but stress that they have not been notified of any final decision .
When you go travel to Russia and feel some hunger – you might want to buy some canned tuna or herring for your sandwich .
Beware .

Yesterday 's Question Period featured an unexpected and welcome surprise – the federal Liberal Party has expressed its support for net neutrality .
Industry critic Marc Garneau rose on the floor of the House of Commons and asked ( video version here ) :
Mr. Speaker , in a free and open democracy in the 21st century , in an innovative and progressive knowledge economy , no tool is more paramount than the Internet .
The Internet is the backbone of today 's flow of free ideas and sharing .
My party , the Liberal Party , supports the principle of net neutrality and an open and competitive Internet environment .
Do the Conservatives support the principle of net neutrality ?
Minister Clement responded by pointing to his digital economy strategy conference next week , but did not take a position on the issue .
Sources say that the official Liberal position is that :
" Internet traffic management should not be permitted for anti-competitive behaviour , nor should it target specific websites , users or legitimate business applications .
The Liberal Party will also continue to ensure internet management does not infringe on Canadians privacy rights . "
This marks a critically important development for net neutrality in Canada just weeks before the CRTC hearings on network management .
With two major parties – Liberals and NDP – now standing squarely in favour of protecting an open Internet , pressure is likely to build on the Conservatives to take a position , particularly given the growing emphasis on developing a national digital strategy for Canada .
Update :
The official Liberal press release on the issue is here .
Signed Distance Functions are a pretty simple concept .
Basically for each point in the world , you return a distance to the nearest surface , negative distances are inside geometry .
One neat application of them to represent scene geometry , and ray trace into the SDF .
Why would anyone do such a thing ?
Well , it turns out that when marching along a ray looking for intersections ( which is obviously not the only way to trace rays ) , it ’s jolly useful to know a minimum bound on when you might expect to encounter a surface .
This way you can keep taking large jumps along the ray , using the SDF to figure out how large , until you finally reach some threshold distance .
Here ’s the end result of the code I ’m presenting in this blog post .
Note the cool twisted pillar , and the nice soft ambient occlusion around contact points .
Both of these features are simple to do when tracing SDFs , but much harder with other methods .
So basically we represent our scene as a SDF , but in order to have varying materials we need this function to not only return the distance to the closest surface , but the material of that surface too , so we end up with the following Haskell type for our scenes :
type Scene = Vec3 -> ( Double , Material )
In order to define a simple scene we just need to write a function which returns the distance to the surfaces , for example here ’s a unit sphere :
sphere pt = ( mag pt – 1.0 , defaultMaterial )
In other words , we take the magnitude of the position ( i.e. distance from the origin ) and subtract 1.0 since this is our radius .
Simple !
To build larger scenes from simple scenes such as this , we need a way to combine two scenes .
This is done by just taking the minimum of the distances , and picking the corresponding material .
mergeScenes :: Scene -> Scene ->
Scene
mergeScenes scene1 scene2 pt
| d1 < d2 = res1
| otherwise = res2
where res1@ ( d1 , _ ) = scene1 pt
res2@ ( d2 , _ ) = scene2 pt
Since our scenes are just functions from position to distance , it ’s very easy to manipulate the geometry by warping the inputs to the SDF – for example , in order to build the twisted column shown in the screenshot above we first build a regular column , and then twist it by rotating the input by varying amounts ( related to the y component ) :
column pt@( Vec3 x y z ) = ( mag pt – mag closestPt , defaultMaterial )
where clamp x = max ( - 0.5 ) ( min 0.5 x )
closestPt = Vec3 ( clamp x ) y ( clamp z )
twistedColumn pt@( Vec3 _ y _ ) = column ( rotateY y pt )
There are many other possibilities for these kinds of modifications , for example we could add some random noise to the distance function to get bumpy surfaces etc .
Once we have a scene to ray trace against , we simply march through the SDF until we reach a distance small enough to consider “ on ” the surface :
type Ray = ( Vec3 , Vec3 ) — origin , direction
rayTrace :: Scene -> Double -> Ray ->
Maybe Color
rayTrace s end ( pos , dir )
| end <= 0 = Nothing
| dist < 0.0001 = Just $ shade s material dir n pos defaultLight `scale` getAO s pos n
| otherwise = rayTrace s ( end - dist ) ( pos + dir `scale` dist , dir )
where ( dist , material ) = s pos
n = getNormal dist s pos
The first equation of rayTrace simply checks if we ’ve reached the far plane , in which case we return Nothing , since there was no hit .
The second guard checks if we ’ve reached a surface , and if so shades the point using our light and the normal is computed by looking at the distances in the neighbourhood of the point .
The whole thing is modulated by our ambient occlusion factor ( which may not be strictly correct , I know ) .
This ambient occlusion factor is computed by looking at a small number of samples “ above ” our surface point and comparing the distance to these samples with the distances in the SDF for those samples .
If the sampled distances are smaller than the distance to the surface , then that means there ’s some amount of “ occlusion ” for that sample ( since there ’s evidently some object other than the surface nearby ) .
We weight these occlusion estimates and sum them to get the final ambient occlusion .
This is pretty hacky with several magic numbers to tweak , but it works really well , giving smooth 3D ambient occlusion with very little cost .
Here ’s the full code listing .
I ’ve implemented a small vector library with the stuff we need in order to keep it reasonably self - contained .
You will need some way of actually displaying / saving the final image , though – the code below uses the ppm package ( ” cabal install ppm ” should do it ) .
This code is not intended to be an example of “ nice ” Haskell code – it ’s pretty much just a copy of the code I ended up with after experimenting with SDFs , so there ’s lots of hard coded values and other limitations ( e.g. just one light source ) which are , erm , ” left as an exercise to the reader ” .

Side note : the outer loop for our ray tracer uses “ parMap ” for almost perfect linear scaling ( I get 1.9 x on my dual core machine , and I suspect a lot of the overhead is just the serial business of actually writing the image to disk ) .
It ’s interesting to note that this was added pretty much as an afterthought ; while playing with the code and adding more and more stuff the runtime got slower and slower , so as a quick ’n ’ dirty speedup I changed a “ map ” to “ parMap rnf ” and it ran twice as fast .
This was n’t a carefully considered optimization pass , it was more like “ This is slow , I ’ll just hack in some parallelization real quick ” .
I dare say I ’ll never utter that sentence when writing C – even if it had a “ parMap ” equivalent , I ’d be very careful about using it since there ’s no way of knowing that there wo n’t be any hidden side effects somewhere .
It is not the Premier League and it was only a friendly but those Newcastle fans who had not seen Michael Owen score since January might have allowed themselves a wry smile .
Owen was 25 minutes into his Manchester United debut , having replaced Wayne Rooney , when the Malaysia keeper , Mohammad Marlias , blocked Frederico Macheda 's dash on goal .
The ball broke to Owen and that was enough .
The picture of Owen on the Bukit Jalil 's vast screens is the kind of thing Manchester United hoped to gain from their tour of Asia before the bombs wrecked their hotel in Indonesia .
" He will always look to score that type of goal , so nothing unusual happened today , " said the United manager , Sir Alex Ferguson .
" But he is wearing the number seven shirt that has traditionally been worn by high - profile members of our club and he has the ability and the experience to handle that .
Some players would not rise to that challenge but he will . "
Despite an offer from the Australian FA to stage a game in Melbourne or Sydney to replace the cancelled Indonesian leg of the tour and a direct plea from the Indonesian government to fulfil their commitments in Jakarta , United have opted to remain in Malaysia , where they will play the same opposition at the same venue on Monday .
The Manchester United chief executive , David Gill , said it was not logistically possible to bring the Indonesian team to Kuala Lumpur .
After the events in Jakarta , the football was supposed to be the easy bit .
And yet , a few minutes into the second half , the football was looking rather embarrassing for Manchester United .
Facing a team ranked 157 in the world – one place lower than the Maldives – Rooney , driving his way through 76 per cent humidity , scored once and created another for Nani .
It would be wrong to say that the 85,000 in the Bukit Jalil Stadium was depressed by what happened ; most had come to see the world champions and Ryan Giggs received a standing ovation for running a few yards of the track on which the Commonwealth Games had been staged in 1998 .
And then things started to wrong .
Mohammad Yahyah , billed as a defensive midfielder , first lobbed Edwin van der Sar from 30 yards and then took the ball from the Dutchman 's replacement , Ben Foster , as he collected a back pass from Darron Gibson .
He slid the ball home to screams that were only slightly less loud than when Manchester United scored .

Last year , I convened a panel of friends and coworkers to taste and rate Caribbean beers .
This time around , we took on domestic canned beers in search of the perfect brew for a holiday weekend cookout .
We were looking for one with broad appeal , one that people could enjoy all day in the afternoon sun and one that was cheap .
How cheap ?
My only rule was that each individual beer had cost less than $ 1 , or no more than $ 6 a six - pack .
This was a blind tasting , with beers served in unmarked cups .
Participants were asked to rate the beer on a scale of 1 to 5 on the overall taste -- this was relative , given the quality of beer -- and a separate score of 1 to 5 based on how refreshing the beer would feel on a hot summer day .
( Temperatures were in the 80s on both tasting days . )
The average scores for each beer were then combined to get the overall tally .
And before you ask , it was n't a panel full of beer snobs :
Testers ranged from a sommelier at a highly - rated restaurant to a self - described Coors Light drinker .
Let 's see what they said .
Overall Winner
National Bohemian
Combined score : 7.14286 ( Taste : 3.7/5 ; Refreshment : 3.4/5 )
Price : $ 8/12 - pack at DeVino's in Columbia Heights
The surprise winner was Baltimore 's own Natty Boh , which testers rated highest on flavor and third for refreshment .
Some of the praise : " The best one -- actually tastes like beer ! "
" High carbonation and the most hops . "
" Zesty ... got a little more kick . "
" Flavor ! Weird ! " wrote one Going Out Guru , who was obviously not expecting much after sampling a few other brews .
Another praised Boh as " Mellow and smooth . "
Of course , reactions were mixed .
" Most assertive and palatable flavor , " said one , damning with faint praise .
" I would happily drink this beer because it does n't have a nasty aftertaste , " added another .
Final view : " Not great , but at least distinctive "
Second Place
Miller High Life
Combined score : 7 ( Taste : 3.4/5 ; Refreshment : 3.6/5 )
Price : $ 4.99/6 - pack from Chevy Chase Wine and Spirits
The Champagne of Beers proved popular with testers on both ends of the spectrum , who rated it second for both flavor and refreshment .
" The best ... I wanted to drink it though a straw in a tall glass with ice , " raved one .
" Cold and fizzy .
Would probably like this with a dog , " said another .
Of course , there were notes of caution .
" The tastiest , but not exactly refreshing . "
Another taster opined he " would not want to drink multiples of this one --
If my thirst got the best of me , I would regret the subsequent bloat . "
Third Place
Pabst Blue Ribbon
Combined score : 6.5 ( Taste : 3.1/5 ; Refreshment : 3.4/5 )
Price : $ 5.29/6 - pack from Chevy Chase Wine and Spirits
One of the most popular bargain beers around town did n't exactly win over our testers .
They praised the " rich " taste and said it " goes down smooth . "
" I would n't have to be drunk to drink this , " said one .
But its refreshment divided the panel .
One called it a " tabula rasa " and wanted tp " knock 'em down on the beach , " while another held that PBR has " too much body for a thirst quencher . "
One participant turned up her nose completely : " Sort of icky .
Makes me want to drink something else .
Anything else . "
Fourth Place
Bud Light
Combined score : 6.07143 ( Taste : 2.4/5 ; Refreshment : 3.7/5 )
Price : $ 4.99/6 - pack from Chevy Chase Wine and Spirits
On a hot day , this is the beer our panel wants most .
" Very refreshing , due to the complete lack of flavor , " said one wag .
It got high marks all around for being " bright , cold and bubbly , " but did n't get much praise beyond that .
" I bet this is the cheapest -- minimally flavored fizzy water , " offered one .
Said one expert : " Very carbonated ; tastes like soda water .
Good as the fifth or sixth beer of the night . "
Fifth Place
Schaefer
Combined score : 5.92857 ( Taste : 3/5 ; Refreshment : 2.9/5 )
Price : $ 3.99 /6 - pack from Chevy Chase Wine and Spirits
One tester said Schaeffer was " lighter and fruitier [ than some of the others ] -- tastes like there should be an orange slice thrown in . "
On the other hand , another said it was " way too sugary to be refreshing . "
For the most part , though , Schaefer was just considered bland .
" No aluminum taste , no hoppiness -- a suitable accompaniment to salty food . "
Or this random dismissal : " Cold and carbonated -- good enough for when you 're already drunk and it's hot . "
And one just summed it up : " Yuck . "
Last Place
Schlitz
Combined score : 5.5 ( Taste : 2.4/5 ; Refreshment : 3.1/5 )
Price : $ 3.99 /6 - pack from Chevy Chase Wine and Spirits
" The beer that made Milwaukee famous " was not a favorite of our testers .
Let 's just run down the comments :
" Tastes a little bit of hops , a little bit of cardboard "
" Would only drink this if was served in a koozie . "
" Kind of like drinking sparkling water with beer ice cubes .
But it 's easy to drink . "
" Frothy -- definitely cheap tasting , like a [ Milwaukee 's Best ] nose "
" Tasteless and slightly reminiscent of saliva . "

There has been a lot of ludicrous recommendations recently to combat deflation by making deposit rates negative .
I did not think any central bank would be dumb enough to try it .
I thought wrong .
Today , Riksbank , Sweeden 's central bank cut the deposit rate to - 0.25 % effectively charging savers interest on deposited money .
DATE 2/07/2009
The weak development of the economy requires a somewhat more expansionary monetary policy .
The Executive Board of the Riksbank has therefore decided to cut the repo rate by 0.25 of a percentage point to 0.25 per cent .
Deep economic downturn
Economic activity abroad is very weak and this hits Sweden hard .
Exports have fallen substantially and the situation on the labour market is continuing to deteriorate rapidly .
The information received in recent months points to the economic downturn in 2009 being somewhat deeper than the Riksbank forecast in April .
Deposit Rate
The decision on the repo rate will apply with effect from Wednesday , 8 July .
The deposit rate is at the same time cut to - 0.25 per cent and the lending rate to 0.75 per cent .
Sweden Attempts To Boost Lending
Sweden 's Riksbank cut interest rates to a fresh record low on Thursday and offered banks 100 billion crowns ( $ 13.2 billion ) to boost lending as it strives to reverse the country 's worst recession since the 1940s .
The central bank lowered its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 0.25 percent in a surprise move , putting official rates at their lowest since records began in 1907 , and said it expected rates to remain at that level until late 2010 .
" It 's a double whammy , or even a triple whammy , " said Roger Josefsson at Danske Markets .
" The deposit rates are actually negative now .
In some sense they are creating a money machine for banks .
You can lend all you want , but do n't put that back into the central bank . "
Sweden was plunged into recession late last year as the global financial crisis pulled the plug on market demand , leaving firms such as world number two truck firm Volvo scrambling to cut costs and shed jobs .
The central bank forecast the economy will contract 5.4 percent this year and return to tepid growth of 1.4 percent next year .
Broadening its arsenal of policy measures , the Riksbank said it would offer banks loans at a fixed rate as was done recently by the European Central Bank , although it offered unlimited amounts .
The Riksbank will offer 100 billion crowns of fixed interest loans with a maturity of 12 months .
It said supplementary measures would ensure monetary policy had the intended effect .
" This should contribute to lower funding costs for the banks and lower interest rates for companies and households , " it said .
Deputy Central Bank Governor Barbro Wickman - Parak told a news conference that offering loans at fixed rates to the banks was judged more suitable than purchasing government or mortgage - backed bonds , at least for now .
" Sweden has a very bank - based system , " she said .
" Company borrowing , in contrast to the United States , is carried out through the banks and in light of that it is reasonable for us to look first to moving through the banking system when we want to ease credits . "
The ECB ended up pouring 442 billion euros ( $ 622 billion ) of funds into money markets in its first such operation with a term as long as one year , pushing some bank - to - bank borrowing costs to new record lows .
Punishing Savers
The army led by Muqtada al - Sadr , seen in 2003 , is suspected of spearheading the killings of hundreds of men in Iraq .
( ( Pier Paolo Cito / Associated Press ) )
Iraqi militias are torturing and killing " hundreds " of men in a growing , systematic campaign against suspected homosexual activity that may be aided by Iraqi security forces , an international human rights group said Monday .
The bodies of several gay men were found in Baghdad 's main Shia district of Sadr City earlier this year with the Arabic words for " pervert " and " puppy " — considered derogatory terms for homosexuals in Iraq — written on their chests , according to a report released Monday by Human Rights Watch .
The killings have spread to other cities and areas in the country , but remain centred on the capital , according to the report .
" The killers invade homes and pick people up in the street , witnesses and survivors said , interrogating them before murdering them to extract the names of other potential victims , " the rights group said in a statement .
Reliable numbers were n't available , Human Rights Watch said , blaming a combination of the failure of authorities to investigate such crimes and the stigma preventing families from reporting the deaths .
But it cited a well - informed UN official as saying in April that the death toll was probably " in the hundreds . "
The Mahdi Army , a Shia militia run by radical cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , is suspected of spearheading the killings , Tom Porteous , the London director of Human Rights Watch , told CBC News on Monday .
In an interview from London , Porteous said the Mahdi army has for the most part suspended its military resistance to the U.S. presence in Iraq , but has been eager to show it still has influence over the daily lives of Iraqis .
" One theory is in order to maintain relevance and to gain publicity , they are now taking it upon themselves to run a campaign to — in the words of some preachers and some media commentators — cleanse the country of depravity , which again is being interpreted as being brought in by the foreign invasion and occupation , " he said .
The report also cited several cases of so - called honour killings , in which families kill their gay relatives to avoid public shame .
' They are massacring us '
Human Rights
Watch included the individual accounts of dozens of Iraqi men forced to flee their homes or the country because of a " radically new intensity " to anti-gay attacks in Iraq this year .
Among them is Atif , 27 , from the Zayouna area of Baghdad , who said he fled for northern Iraq at the beginning of April .
" I call people in Baghdad and they tell me , ' Do n't come back , they are massacring us .
They are massacring gays here , ' " the report quoted him as saying .
Another man described how four masked men , dressed in black , kidnapped his partner of 10 years in April .
" He was found in the neighbourhood the day after , " the man was quoted as saying .
" They had thrown his corpse in the garbage .
His genitals were cut off and a piece of his throat was ripped out . "
Homosexuals have been targeted throughout the Iraq war , but the killings appear to have intensified as improvements in overall security led gay men to begin going out to cafes in groups and socializing in public , according to the report .
Human Rights
Watch accused authorities of doing nothing to stop the killings and warned that reflected an overall inability to protect the people .
There is no law against homosexuality in Iraq , but a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said it receives few complaints of abuse because of the secrecy and stigma attached to homosexuality in Iraqi culture .
It ’s just about that time of year again , when most states in America offer up a few days to shop without paying sales tax .
While some states are not having the days this year ( Massachusetts & California being two states without “ no sales tax ” days ) , many states will have sales tax holiday shopping days for their residents .
To help you out , I have assembled the following list of the dates , number of shopping days , the items included , and the website you can go to for more information .

Despite the 201 confirmed cases of the virus in New York City , most have been mild and there has been only one confirmed death from the virus , that of a 55 - year - old educator .
The funeral for Mitchell Wiener , an assistant principal at I.S. 238 in Hollis , Queens , who died of complications from swine flu on Sunday , was held this afternoon in Flushing .
I.S. 238 is the only school in the city where students  four of them  have confirmed cases of the new strain of virus .
The criteria for closing a school because of concerns about swine flu has become a point of contention with educators and parents , and one that the city has yet to spell out .
“ I know people would like there to be a perfect formula where you can push a button and decide , ” Dt. Thomas R. Frieden , the departing city health commissioner , said at an afternoon news conference .
“ It has to do with how many kids are sick , for how long they ’ve been sick , what proportion of the school that represents , how that ’s changed from day to day .
We ’ve seen different patterns . ”
The United Federation of Teachers has been monitoring absentism in the schools because of the flulike symptoms and said it planned to hold a news conference on Thursday to discuss its findings .
The effect of the increased school closings has become evident in the crowded hospital waiting rooms over the past few days , said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg .
“ While there are abnormal number of people going to the hospital , who are worried , virtually none , a very tiny percentage of them have any symptoms whatsoever , ” Mr. Bloomberg said .
Alexandra Torrensvilas was the target of cops who pinned a DUI on her for an accident they caused .
Now she has been cleared of charges after the Broward State Attorney 's Office officially dropped the four DUI citations on Wednesday .
But the saga is far from over as now prosecutors turn their attention to the four Hollywood police officers who made up an intricate story to cover for a February traffic accident involving a cop car .
The scheme was caught on one of the officers dashboard cameras .
The disturbing video shows Alexandra Torrensvilas , 23 , handcuffed in the back of the squad car as the officers get their stories straight on what they are going to say happened .
Officer Joel Francisco , 36 , an 11 - year veteran , crashed into the back of Torrensvilas ' vehicle at a light on February 17 at midnight .
The cop radioed to other officers who converged on the scene and hatched a way to bail Francisco out .
Officer Dewey Pressley , 42 , arrives and questions Torrensvilas , who tells him that she has been drinking .
The 21 - year veteran officer seizes the opportunity and arrests her for DUI .
But the plot thickens from there .
The cops begin to brainstorm believable excuses for the accident .
" As far as I 'm concerned .
I 'm going to put words in his mouth .
She went to accelerate and a cat jumped out of the window at which point he thought it could have been a pedestrian , which distracted him , " Pressley tells Sgt. Andrew Diaz , another veteran of the force .
" I mean what 's the chances of hitting a f--- in drunk when a cat jumps out of the window ? "
Still , the cops run with the half - baked idea and rush to get Torrensvilas to do a Breathalyzer test so they can officially say she was drunk .
" I nailed her on the video .
I already hung her on video .
She said she has been doing a beer party , " Pressley says .
" She 's gonna blow . "
Then , another cop debates with Pressley on who is going to write up the fabricated report to clear their police comrade .
" I know how I 'm going to word this with the cat so we can get him off the hook .
I 'll write the narrative , " Pressley says .
" We 're going to bend this a little bit . "
Civilian Community Service Officer Karim
Thomas joins the three senior officers and the four cops go so far as to change the angle of pictures of the accident to make it look like Torrensvilas swerved in front of the cop car and caused the accident , not Francisco .
Throughout the tape , the cops acknowledged what they are doing is illegal , but when you are the law , there is nothing wrong with bending it for a fellow cop , one says .
" I do n't lie and make things up ever because it 's wrong , but if I need to bend it a little bit to protect a cop , I 'll do it , " Pressley tells Francisco after reassuring him no one will ever find out .
" She 's freaking hammered anyway . "
The cops even do a final rehearsal before Villa is taken to the city lock up .
" We 'll take care of it , " one officer says .
The others reply : " We 're good . "
The police officers are currently on administrative duty pending a state attorney 's office investigation .

There was a song that came out some years ago by Sir Mix - a - Lot called " I like big butts and I cannot lie " .
At my church , I led the protests and burning of records when that song came out .
You would think that as President he could resist those urges , at least in public .
Bill Clinton , the hell - bound sinner he is , at least had the decency to get his " vacuuming " from that fat Jewess in the privacy of the Oval Office .
Here , Obama is just plain cocky and arrogant to think he could be a pervert in public .
I guess he figures the media loves him so much they will look the other way .
You know if Bush was caught like that , he would 've been impeached for sexual harrassment .
EDIT : AND ... right in front of his wife and daughter !
Does Obama have no sense of shame ?

My Personal Story
President Ronald Reagan said , " government is not the answer ... it is the problem . "
It 's apparent that the GOP agreed and spend the last 12 years leaving no doubt that " government is the problem . "
The GOP has always said that government should be small .
The GOP governments have never actually been smaller , but at least their hearts have been in the right place ,
If it 's true that smaller is better , I think that the GOP could do the nation a great favor and resign from government .
That way the government would be smaller and a lot less of a " problem . "
Many years ago , a secret lagoon hidden off the Australian coast reputedly had magical medical powers .
The local natives would bathe in its waters to cure burns and wounds .
This lagoon , as it turned out , had several native trees growing near its banks , and their falling leaves transformed the pool into an antiseptic bath .
The colour of the water was turned brown by the oil from the leaves , hence the " tea " name in English
Now we know that the melaleuca tree , also known as the tea tree , produces an oil with many healing properties .
Read on to discover the many uses of this amazing essential oil , for skin , hair , and for use in and around the home .
By the by , I consistently use that title because I mean for it to operate as a trigger warning .
I write a lot about rape , but sometimes I write about other things , and I do n’t want anybody taken off - guard transitioning from “ help computer ” into wtf rape - talk .
Case you were wondering .
I was re-reading my five billion goddamn posts about rape and force , and I realized ( surprise ! ) there is a more succinct way for me to express what I was thinking .
I tend to go on and on , circling a subject , trying to get out everything in my head that possibly relates to it , and then sometimes find I did n’t really address the subject at all .
So , here is what I wanted to say in those five billion posts about rape :
If women are raised being told by parents , teachers , media , peers , and all surrounding social strata that :
it is not okay to set solid and distinct boundaries and reinforce them immediately and dramatically when crossed ( “ mean bitch ” )
it is not okay to appear distraught or emotional ( “ crazy bitch ” )
it is not okay to make personal decisions that the adults or other peers in your life do not agree with , and it is not okay to refuse to explain those decisions to others ( “ stuck - up bitch ” )
it is not okay to refuse to agree with somebody , over and over and over again ( “ angry bitch ” )
it is not okay to have ( or express ) conflicted , fluid , or experimental feelings about yourself , your body , your sexuality , your desires , and your needs ( “ bitch got daddy issues ” )
it is not okay to use your physical strength ( if you have it ) to set physical boundaries ( “ dyke bitch ” )
it is not okay to raise your voice ( “ shrill bitch ” )
it is not okay to completely and utterly shut down somebody who obviously likes you ( “ mean dyke / frigid bitch ” )
If we teach women that there are only certain ways they may acceptably behave , we should not be surprised when they behave in those ways .
And we should not be surprised when they behave these ways during attempted or completed rapes .
Women who are taught not to speak up too loudly or too forcefully or too adamantly or too demandingly are not going to shout “ NO ” at the top of their goddamn lungs just because some guy is getting uncomfortably close .
Women who are taught not to keep arguing are not going to keep saying “ NO . ”
Women who are taught that their needs and desires are not to be trusted , are fickle and wrong and are not to be interpreted by the woman herself , are not going to know how to argue with “ but you liked kissing , I just thought … ”
Women who are taught that physical confrontations make them look crazy will not start hitting , kicking , and screaming until it ’s too late , if they do at all .
Women who are taught that a display of their emotional state will have them labeled hysterical and crazy ( which is how their perception of events will be discounted ) will not be willing to run from a room disheveled and screaming and crying .
Women who are taught that certain established boundaries are frowned upon as too rigid and unnecessary are going to find themselves in situations that move further faster before they realize that their first impression was right , and they are in a dangerous room with a dangerous person .
Women who are taught that refusing to flirt back results in an immediately hostile environment will continue to unwillingly and unhappily flirt with somebody who is invading their space and giving them creep alerts .
People wonder why women do n’t “ fight back , ” but they do n’t wonder about it when women back down in arguments , are interrupted , purposefully lower and modulate their voices to express less emotion , make obvious signals that they are uninterested in conversation or being in closer physical proximity and are ignored .
They do n’t wonder about all those daily social interactions in which women are quieter , ignored , or invisible , because those social interactions seem normal .
They seem normal to women , and they seem normal to men , because we were all raised in the same cultural pond , drinking the same Kool - Aid .
And then , all of a sudden , when women are raped , all these natural and invisible social interactions become evidence that the woman was n’t truly raped .
Because she did n’t fight back , or yell loudly , or run , or kick , or punch .
She let him into her room when it was obvious what he wanted .
She flirted with him , she kissed him .
She stopped saying no , after a while .
These rules for social interactions that women are taught to obey are more than grease for the patriarchy wheel .
Women are taught both that these rules will protect them , and that disobeying these rules results in punishment .
Here ’s a situation every woman is familiar with : some guy she knows , perhaps a casual acquaintance , perhaps just some dude at the bus stop , is obviously infatuated with her .
He ’s making conversation , he ’s giving her the eye .
She does n’t like him .
She does n’t want to talk to him .
She does n’t want him near her .
He is freaking her out .
She could disobey the rules , and tell him to GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM HER , and continue screaming GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME every time he tries to step closer , or speak to her again .
And then he will be all , “ I was just talking to you !
WTF ! ” and everybody else will be all , “ Yeah , seriously , why ’d you freak out at a guy just talking to you ? ” and refuse to offer the support she needs to be safe from dude .
Or , the guy might become hostile , violent even .
Ladies , you ’ve seen that look , the “ bitch ca n’t ignore me ” look .
It ’s a source of constant confusion , as soon as you start budding breasts , that the man who just a moment ago told you how pretty you are is now calling you a stupid ugly whore , all because you did n’t get in his car .
OR
You could follow the rules .
You could flirt back a little , look meek , not talk , not move away .
You might have to put up with a lot more talking , you might have to put up with him trying to ask you out to lunch every day , you might even have to go out to lunch with him .
You might have to deal with him copping a feel .
But he wo n’t turn violent on you , and neither will the spectators who have watched him browbeat you into a frightened and flirtatious corner .
So we learn the rules will protect us .
We learn that , when we step out of line , somebody around us might very well turn crazy .
Might hurt us .
And we wo n’t be defended by onlookers , who think we ’ve provoked the crazy somehow .
So , having your ass grabbed at the bus stop , having to go out to dinner with a guy you fucking ca n’t stand , maybe even having to fuck him once or twice , it ’s a small sacrifice to avoid being ostracized , insulted , verbally abused , and possibly physically assaulted .
It ’s a rude fucking awakening when a woman gets raped , and follows the rules she has been taught her whole life — does n’t refuse to talk , does n’t refuse to flirt , does n’t walk away ignoring him , does n’t hit , does n’t scream , does n’t fight , does n’t raise her voice , does n’t deny she liked kissing — and finds out after that she is now to blame for the rape .
She followed the rules .
The rules that were supposed to keep the rape from happening .
The rules that would keep her from being fair game for verbal and physical abuse .
Breaking the rules is supposed to result in punishment , not following them .
For every time she lowered her voice , let go of a boundary , did n’t move away , let her needs be conveniently misinterpreted , and was given positive reinforcement and a place in society , she is now being told that all that was wrong , this one time , and she should have known that , duh .
For anybody who has ever watched the gendered social interactions of women — watched a woman get browbeaten into accepting attention she does n’t want , watched a woman get interrupted while speaking , watched a woman deny she is upset at being insulted in public , watched a woman get grabbed because of what she was wearing , watched a woman stop arguing — and said and done nothing , you never have the right to ever ask , “ Why did n’t she fight back ? ”
She did n’t fight back because you told her not to .
Ever. Ever .
You told her that was okay , and necessary , and right .
You did n’t give her a caveat .
You did n’t say , “ Unless … ” You said , “ Good for you , shutting up and backing down 99 % of the time .
Too bad that 1 % of the time makes you a fucking whore who deserved it . ”
Nobody obtains the superpower to behave dramatically differently during a frightening confrontation .
Women will behave the same way they have been taught to behave in all social , professional , and sexual interactions .
And they will be pretty goddamned surprised to come out the other end and find out that means they can legally be raped at any time , by just about anybody .
I am focusing on women here .
I tend to do that , being one and all , but let ’s mention something about men .
If men have been raised to behave aggressively , to discount what women and weaker men want and feel and say , to obtain power and social standing through force , to deny emotions exist , to feel that women are fundamentally a different species , to set a boundary and keep it NO MATTER WHAT , to make a decision and stick to it NO MATTER WHAT , to feel entitled to sex , to feel they will be ostracized and possibly physically attacked if they do n’t acquire sex with women , to feel under threat of harassment and attack if they do n’t constantly maintain a hyper - masculine exterior , to prove their manhood through dangerous and degrading physical activities …
if you have seen men behave in this way , and encouraged it , and thought it was normal , so normal you did n’t even see it …
then you never have the right to say “ He could n’t possibly have done that ” when you hear that your brother raped somebody .
That was n’t concise at all .
What I mean to say is :
The way men and women interact on a daily basis is the way they interact when rape occurs .
The social dynamics we see at play between men and women are the same social dynamics that cause men to feel rape is okay , and women to feel they have no right to object .
And if you accept those social interactions as normal and appropriate in your day to day life , there is absolutely no reason you should be shocked that rape occurs without screaming , without fighting , without bruising , without provocation , and without prosecution .
Behavior exists on a continuum .
Rape does n’t inhabit its own little corner of the world , where everything is suddenly all different now .
The behavior you accept today is the behavior that becomes rape tomorrow .
And you very well might accept it then , too .

Lupine seeds once thought to be 10,000 years old , but now known to date from the 1950s
The oldest viable seeds in the world , dating from the Pleistocene era , are not what we thought .
New dating techniques have revealed that the seeds , which have been grown into live Arctic lupine plants , are not 10,000 years old as believed .
Instead they are modern seeds which contaminated ancient rodent burrows .
However , it remains possible that plants may yet be grown from seeds trapped in ice age permafrost , says the scientist who debunked the record .
More than four decades ago , Canadian scientists published details in one of the world 's foremost scientific journals of how they discovered two dozen seeds of an Arctic lupine plant within ancient lemming burrows .
In Science , they described how these burrows , found at Miller Creek within the Yukon territory of western Canada , had been buried deep within frozen silt since the Pleistocene .
The record now for the oldest viable seeds is held by a 2,000 - year - old date palm recovered near the Dead Sea
Yukon palaeontologist Grant Zazula
That made them over 10,000 years old .
As well as rodent nests , faecal pellets and seeds , they also contained an ancient lemming skull , further confirming their old age .
Crucially , the seeds remained viable , as the scientists managed to germinate and cultivate normal healthy Arctic lupine ( Lupinus arcticus ) plants from them .
" These were considered to be the oldest viable seeds to have ever grown , " says Grant Zazula , a scientist working for the Yukon Palaeontology Program run by the Government of Yukon , based in Whitehorse , Canada .
Controversial claim
But the idea that seeds could remain viable for so long immediately attracted controversy .
" The scientific community was really split by that presumed ancient viable Arctic lupine seeds .
Some believed it , others did not , " says Zazula .
The controversy rested on the methods used at the time to date the seeds .
When the researchers published the original claim in 1967 , there was no way of radiocarbon dating small samples the size of seeds .
Pleistocene lemming skulls found alongside the seeds Instead , the seeds were presumed to be of the same age as the ancient frozen lemming burrows in which they were found .
But through his own research into ice age fossils , Zazula became suspicious of the seeds ' provenance .
Studying ancient rodent nests buried in the Yukon permafrost , some up to 25,000 years old , from which he had recovered seeds from around 65 different plant species , Zazula had never found any ' ancient ' Arctic lupine seeds .
" Also , Arctic lupine is a boreal forest understory flower , and I do not think it lived during the ice age with incredibly cold , harsh arctic conditions .
The ecology does not fit , " he says .
Radiocarbon tests
So Zazula contacted Richard Harington of the Canadian Museum of Nature , one of the authors of the original 1967 Science paper about the seeds .
Harington told Zazula that some of the seeds still existed , though they were coated in paraffin wax to preserve them .
Zazula recruited Fiona Brock , an expert in radiocarbon dating from the University of Oxford , UK and together the researchers found a way to avoid the contamination from the paraffin , and accurately radiocarbon date the seeds for the first time .
The Pleisotocene seeds , it turns out , appear to be from between 1955 and 1957 , Zazula 's team report in the journal New Phytologist .
A modern Arctic lupine in bloom
The radiocarbon dating did confirm that the lemming skull found alongside the seeds was from the Pleistocene .
That validated the original researchers ' claim that they had collected Pleistocene samples from deep within the permafrost .
But without their knowledge , the seeds must have fallen into the burrows just years before they were collected .
The burrows had likely been exposed by mining activity in the region .
" I was excited that we were able to put a controversy to rest , " says Zazula .
" The ' ancient ' viable Arctic lupine seed is cited throughout seed germination text books , studies on permafrost and throughout the botanical literature .
So , it was nice to be able to conclusively demonstrate the actual age of the seeds . "
" The take home message is that any claims for ancient seed viability must be accompanied by rigorous dating methods .
If you are going to say something is really old , the research has to effectively demonstrate their age . "
Ice age plants However , Zazula suspects that ancient seeds will yet be discovered that remain viable , and that live plants could still be grown from them .
" The record now for the oldest viable seeds is held by a 2,000 - year - old date palm recovered near the Dead Sea , " he says .
In 2002 , Russian scientists published a claim that they had germinated a 33,000 - year - old seed of a small tundra flower ( Silene stenophylla ) .
But they published their work in a relatively unknown journal , and the claim has received almost no acceptance in the scientific community , Zazula says .
Yet " although we have shown that these Arctic lupines were not old as previously thought , I still think that in the near future we will be able to grow ancient , ice age seeds that are preserved in permafrost , " Zazula says .
Indeed , studies are already underway to attempt to germinate real ancient seeds from the Yukon permafrost , he says .

Volunteers were called on today to join an annual summer bat count in New Jersey that could further determine how many have fallen to the enigmatic " white - nose syndrome " responsible for devastating their Northeastern populations .
As the Congressional Natural Resource Committee in Washington , D.C. , began today to review federal responses to the dilemma , the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey launched an effort to monitor roosting spots where bats spend their summers in the state .
From old buildings and barns to dead trees , checking roosts may help state biologists confirm their worst fears -- that as many as 95 percent of the state 's bats died over the winter .
" We ask our volunteers each year to go to a known bat roost at least twice between now and early August and count them as the bats fly out in the evening , " said Maria Grace of Conserve Wildlife .
" This year , we 're telling people that not seeing bats in those roosts is just as important to note .
We 'll know then how significant the die - off is due to white - nose syndrome . "
After mass die - offs of bats in 2006 and 2007 in New York , the phenomenon was named after a strange white fungus found on their snouts and wings .
Since then , it has spread to nine states from Vermont to Virginia .
Bats began dying in New Jersey in January and a pre-spring inspection of the state 's largest hibernating spot , or hibernaculum , the Hibernia mine in Rockaway Township , revealed a 95 percent population drop .
The syndrome prompts bats to wake from hibernation in the dead of winter , even fly from their hibernaculum , and use up crucial fat reserves .
" The exact cause of mortality of affected bats is not yet fully understood , but the newly identified fungus is considered a likely contributor , " Marvin Moriarty , northeast regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , told the natural resource committee yesterday .
The fungus invades the skin , underlying tissue and particularly the wings , which help to balance complex physiological processes such as body temperature .
All six bat species that hibernate in the Northeast have been impacted and scientists fear the syndrome will spread to large bat populations in the South and Southwest -- and that some species may never recover even if a solution is found .
" Bats differ from most other small mammals in that they have long lives and reproduce slowly , " Moriarty said .
Bats are insect-eaters and help human agriculture .
The 1 million killed would have consumed 8,000 pounds of insects in a single summer night , scientists said .
" The level of nightly consumption by one little brown bat would be equivalent to a 150 - pound teenage boy eating approximately 300 quarter - pounders .
Translated to the number of insects that would not be eaten by one little brown bat in your backyard on a given night , it amounts to the equivalent of 60 medium - sized moths or over 1,000 mosquito - sized insects , " said Thomas Kunz , director of the Center for Ecology and Conservation at Boston University .
Conserve Wildlife will assign a bat roost to volunteers who contact the foundation at ( 609 ) 984-0621 or e-mail Maria Grace at Conserve Wildlife .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Under normal circumstances , Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N might be afforded a moment of gloating as it struts toward what could be a banner earnings announcement just nine months after being roiled by Wall Street 's worse crisis since the Great Depression .
Flags fly outside of the Goldman Sachs headquarters building in the financial district of New York May 8 , 2009 .

But these are n’t ordinary times for the biggest U.S. investment bank , which lately has faced a torrent of unwanted publicity stemming from employee theft allegations and an unflattering spread in Rolling Stone magazine .
Now Goldman , expected to announced second - quarter earnings on Tuesday , finds itself in a no-win situation .
If earnings are too good critics may lambaste it for ramping up risk too much and embracing a hedge fund - like model that could make it vulnerable to big market swings .
If they fall short , investors may accuse the firm of failing to live up to its reputation for being more aggressive and intelligent than its rivals .
" They are between a rock and a hard place , " said Walter Todd , a portfolio manager with Greenwood Capital Associates , which owns shares of rival Morgan Stanley MS.N .
And , regardless of the results , critics may fall back on the old “ Government Sachs ” refrain , a nod to the number of former Goldman defectors now working in government , and claiming special treatment .
From a public relations standpoint , Todd said that leaves Goldman asking questions familiar to the oil industry as it contended with windfall profit taxes amid spiking gas prices .
“ How well do they really want to do ? ” Todd asked .
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting Goldman to report net income for common shareholders of $ 3.54 a share .
That is down from a pro-forma $ 4.58 a year earlier , but would best a surprisingly strong first quarter in which Goldman reported net income of $ 3.39 per share .
Strong trading income and improving equity underwriting markets are expected to bolster the results , offsetting a one - time charge of $ 425 million related to payback of loans Goldman took from the U.S. Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
In a noisy second quarter , Goldman repaid $ 10 billion in TARP loans , while raising $ 8.9 billion in equity , debt and asset sales to win its way out of the government program .
Getting the approval to exit TARP was considered a key step from getting out from under the thumb of the U.S. government , which has taken the industry to task for lavish compensation .
If Goldman reports strong earnings , it will confront another public relations challenge in how it translates profits to compensation for employees .
Last month , the Observer newspaper reported that Goldman employees in London were briefed on the company ’s performance and told to expect record bonuses if the year finished strongly .
Goldman has denied such a briefing ever took place .
“ PAY THEIR PEOPLE ”
Banc of America Securities - Merrill Lynch analysts said in a research note this week that Goldman could set aside as much as $ 17.9 billion for compensation this year , more than the $ 10.9 billion last year , but still below the $ 20.19 billion set aside in 2007 .
Using Goldman ’s first - quarter headcount , that comes out to $ 642,000 per employee , based on the research estimates .
“ Does the strong earnings and the employee pay - out mean it is back to the future and that they are wheeling and dealing and engaging in higher risk activities , as was true just a few years ago ? ” said Lawrence White , a professor at New York University ’s Stern School of Business .
“ We do n’t really know . ”
To be sure , there is more than a touch of jealousy to the chorus of ill - will toward Goldman , which rivals have in recent years waited -- so far in vein -- to break its long earnings hot streak .
The bank ’s defenders say Goldman is simply being upbraided for its success and argue that the firm has Wall Street ’s most sophisticated risk management procedures in place -- systems that put it in a stronger position than most rivals to ride out last fall ’s turmoil .
And the fact is that better - than - expected earnings would boost Goldman ’s share price , already up 73 percent so far this year , which would be good news for its investors and partners .
“ In the financial realm , they are smartest guys around , ” said Bill Hackney , chief investment officer of Atlanta Capital Management Co , which owns Goldman shares .
“ I doubt there ’s any behind the scenes conspiracy among Goldman executives to cause them to have an unfair advantage in the market .
This harping is just sort of sour grapes . ”
Sour grapes or not , Goldman , despite the fact that the Treasury Department is no longer run by one of its former CEOs and that a retired Goldman chairman has been forced out of key post at the New York Federal Reserve , continues to raise hackles among many .
A scathing article in Rolling Stone that accused the bank of having a key role in various market bubbles stretching back to the 1920s and stoked outrage on the Daily Kos and other blogs .
The arrest of one of its former employees earlier this week for allegedly stealing computer codes that were the key to hefty trading profits at the firm also stirred up chatter on various financial blogs where little love is lost for the firm .
The case is not expected to impact earnings but the firm , famously publicity - averse , may have little chance of retreating from the spotlight anytime soon .
We need people like Senator Jeff Merkley fighting for us .
Blue America still has our act - blue page alive and well for health care reform .
Please pitch in if you can .
It 's so frustrating watching the Max Baucus coalition try and dictate health care reform for America .
Not to just keep flogging a dead horse endlessly , but it does strike me as worth noting that when you read a puff piece in The New York Times about the Gang of Six bipartisan dealmakers in the Senate that vast power is being wielded by people who , in a democratic system of government , would have almost no power .
We ’re talking , after all , about Max Baucus of Montana , Kent Conrad of North Dakota , Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico , Susan Collins of Maine , Mike Enzi of Wyoming , and Chuck Grassley of Iowa .
Collectively those six states contain about 2.74 percent of the population , less than New Jersey , or about one fifth the population of California .
The six largest states , by contrast , contain about 40 percent of Americans ... read on
And Max Baucus was leaking out costs today to the media from the Holy CBO that he says gets their bill to cost under the magic 1 trillion mark .
Of course the Holy Grail does n't have all the figures yet , Max says , but he 's trying to sell it to the media that way .
If the plan does n't cost anything then it wo n't do anything .
Being obsessed by the Holy CBO has been a huge big mistake .
Just to remind you , Max Baucus was instrumental in getting Bush 's tax cuts passed back in 2001 .
Baucus started his career as a relatively low - profile congressman from conservative Montana but , in recent years , has shown a willingness to stray from the Democratic lines , at times sparking intense fights with the congressional Democratic leadership .
He supported President Bush ’s trillion - dollar tax cut that mainly benefitted the wealthy in 2001 , fought to add a prescription - drug benefit to Medicare ( in language pushed by the Bush administration ) and sought billions in aid for drought - plagued farmers in his home state .
And now he plans to kill health care .
Bill Clinton speaks up about the CBO :
Former President Bill Clinton , himself a victim of an errant Congressional Budget Office score or two , implied today that the agency was n't connected enough to the real world to know whether programs would save money or not .
Speaking a few days after the CBO estimated that the White House 's latest " gamechanger , " an independent Medicare Advisory Commission to set prices , would save little money over 10 years , Clinton urged policy - makers -- and here he means Democrats -- to not accept the CBO 's scores without adding a dollop of common sense . " I recognize that if you 're in that budget office , you 've got to project the future , " Clinton said .
But certain programs would realize savings " regardless of whether the mathematical rules they are now up with will prove it or not . "
He said that those with a stake in changing the system " almost always get the short end of the stick " when it comes to budget projections .
And Digby explains :
n order to understand what this really means you you have to recall that there was no discussion , zero , when the last administration asserted without any debate that we were engaged in a war without end , for which costs could not be measured nor should they be .
It was accepted by members of both parties as a simple imperative and no discussion of cost - benefit analyses were even on the table .
But when it comes to directly benefiting Americans with a life and death threat of another sort , that 's all we talk about .
This is not an accident
.
This whole health care debate has been played very badly .
Not getting into the game publicly for so long allowed the right wingers and Evan Bayh Democrats to corrupt the health care messaging .
Now we hear that the Blue Dogs have corrupted the EC&C committee also .
We 'll see what actually happens a little later .
People are usually very reluctant to change anything in life , even if it 's going to help so it's not a shock that America is split over health care reform in the polls .
It 's a big deal and in the end people will be more hesitant to actually back change .
That 's why we need a strong leader to communicate it .
That just means the Democratic Party must keep pushing forward .
The Republicans went forward with the lunacy of the Terri Schiavo matter even when 79 % of Americans were against government intervention in a family matter .
That ''s their core values .
They are birthers .
We want real health care reform that will help us all .
We believe in America .

Rutherford County jail , Tennessee
The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is supposedly conducting an investigation into the death and possible murder of an 18 - year - old boy who was taken to the Rutherford County jail in Tennessee .
It seems things went a little bit too far .
Young Andron Reed died or was killed soon after he was handed over to County Sheriff ’s deputies late Friday night .
He had been arrested after leading state troopers on a high - speed chase down Interstate 24 , which ended in a slight accident .
Luckily for all no one was injured according to the highway patrol officers who took Andron and his brother Octavius into custody at the scene .
Of course Andron was arrested on a variety of charges ranging from evading arrest to driving under the influence and even assault , but how many times have we heard about people being falsely charged with assault by the police to justify or cover their actions .
After Andron was booked at the Rutherford County jail , they immediately took him to a cell , apparently within ear shot of his brother Octavius , who was able to hear Andron 's screams as he was being beaten by Sheriff ’s deputies .
The TBI said Andron Reed was found unconscious and not moving by the jail house nurse who had him taken by ambulance to the Middle Tennessee Medical Center , where he later died .
TBI agents only have the information provided by the same jailers who may have murdered Andron .
They claim that he was combative during the arrest and booking process .
Since Andron Reed is dead he can't dispute the claim .
If The TBI really is investigating the tragic death of this eighteen year old boy it will all hinge on the the autopsy .
If it is a real autopsy and not another cover up , the results should tell us how Andron Reed died , or was murdered .
If it is determined that he was murdered , one of the ' untouchable ' police could actually be charged with the murder , something which almost never happens in the US unless the police are actually careless enough to be video recorded by witnesses while shooting an unarmed person in the back .
Bush is no longer the president and yet the corrupt police state he turned America into continues .
Obama promised change , but has changed nothing about the egregious cruelty and abuse of authority by the police .
Hundreds die in police custody each year , when will the American people rise up and say no more , no more tazer torture deaths , no more stripping naked and molesting of our wives , sons , and daughters , no more permanently disfiguring and disabling beatings .
When will America start screening police applicants to weed out the sublimated sadists and killers ?
When will the legal system start punishing the police instead of consistently finding them innocent ?

The US Department of State had prior knowledge of the coup .
The Department of State and the US Congress funded and advised the actors and organisations in Honduras that participated in the coup .
The Pentagon trained , schooled , commanded , funded and armed the Honduran armed forces that perpetrated the coup and that continue to repress the people of Honduras by force .
The US military presence in Honduras , that occupies the Soto Cano ( Palmerola ) military base , authorised the coup d’etat through its tacit complicity and refusal to withdraw its support of the Honduran military involved in the coup .
The US ambassador in Tegucigalpa , Hugo Llorens , coordinated the removal from power of President Manuel Zelaya , together with Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Shannon y John Negroponte , who presently works as an advisor to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
From the first day the coup occurred , Washington has referred to “ both parties ” involved and the necessity for “ dialogue ” to restore constitutional order , legitimising the coup leaders by regarding them as equal players instead of criminal violators of human rights and democratic principles .
The Department of State has refused to legally classify the events in Honduras as a “ coup d’etat ” , nor has it suspended or frozen its economic aid or commerce to Honduras , and has taken no measures to effectively pressure the de facto regime .
possibility of President Zelaya ’s immediate return to power , as part of a strategy still in place that simply seeks to legitimate the de facto regime and wear down the Honduran people that still resist the coup .
Washington manipulated the Organization of American States ( OAS ) in order to buy time , therefore allowing the coup regime to consolidate and weaken thepossibility of President Zelaya ’s immediate return to power , as part of a strategy still in place that simply seeks to legitimate the de facto regime and wear down the Honduran people that still resist the coup .
Secretary of State Clinton and her spokesmen stopped speaking of President Zelaya ’s return to power after they designated Costa Rica 's president Oscar Arias as the “ mediator ” between the coup regime and the constitutional government ; and now the State Department refers to the dictator that illegally took power during the coup , Roberto Micheletti , as the “ interim caretaker president ” .
The strategy of “ negotiating ” with the coup regime was imposed by the Obama administration as a way of discrediting President Zelaya – blaming him for provoking the coup – and legitimising the coup leaders .
Members of the US Congress – Democrats and Republicans – organised a visit of representatives from the coup regime in Honduras to Washington , receiving them with honors in different arenas in the US capital .
Despite the fact that originally it was Republican Senator John McCain who coordinated the visit of the coup regime representatives to Washington through a lobby firm connected to his office , The Cormac Group , now , the illegal regime is being representated by top notch lobbyist and Clinton attorney Lanny Davis , who is using his pull and influence in Washington to achieve overall acceptance – cross party lines – of the coup regime in Honduras .
Otto Reich and a Venezuelan named Robert Carmona - Borjas , known for his role as attorney for the dictator Pedro Carmona during the April 2002 coup d’etat in Venezuela , aided in preparing the groundwork for the coup against President Zelaya in Honduras .
The team designated from Washigton to design and help prepare the coup in Honduras also included a group of US ambassadors recently named in Central America , experts in destabilising efforts against the Cuban revolution , and Adolfo Franco , ex administrator for USAID ’s Cuba “ transition to democracy ” program .
No one doubts that the fingerprints of Washington are all over the coup d’etat against President Manuel Zelaya that began on June 28 .
Many analysts , writers , activists and even presidents , have denounced this role .
Nevertheless , the majority coincide in excusing the Obama Administration from any responsibility in the Honduran coup , blaming instead the lingering remains of the Bush - Cheney era and the war hawks that still pace the halls of the White House .
The evidence demonstrates that while it is certain that the usual suspects who perpetrate coups and destabilisation activities in Latin America are involved , ample proof exists confirming the direct role of the new administration in Washington in the Honduran coup .
The Department of State
The new form of diplomacy of the United States , known as “ smart power ” , has played a principal role before , during and after the coup in Honduras .
During a press briefing on July 1 , spokespeople for the Department of State admitted to having prior knowledge of the coup in Honduras , clarifying that US diplomats had been meeting with the groups and actors planning the coup to encourage a different “ solution ” to their discontent with President Zelaya .
[ i]
The State Department also confirmed that two high level representatives from the Department , which included Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Thomas Shannon and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Craig Kelley , were in Honduras the week prior to the coup and maintained meetings with the civilian and military groups that later participated in the illegal overthrow of a democratically elected president .
They state their mission was to “ urge against ” the coup , but evidently such verbal pressure was insufficient to discourage the actors involved in the coup , particularly considering the actions manifested by Washington contradicted those harsh words .
On the day of the coup , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton published a statement regarding the situation in Honduras .
Despite the fact that governments around the world were quickly condemning the actions as a coup d’etat , Clinton ’s statement did not recognise the events in Honduras as a “ coup d’etat ” and also did not call for the return of President Zelaya to power .
Curiously , Clinton ’s statements from day one have referred to “ all parties ” of situation , legitimising the coup leaders and somehow placing blame – publicly – on President Mel Zelaya for provoking his own overthrow : “ The action taken against Honduran President Mel Zelaya violates the precepts of the Inter - American Democratic Charter , and thus should be condemned by all .
We call on all parties in Honduras to respect the constitutional order and the rule of law , to reaffirm their democratic vocation , and to commit themselves to resolve political disputes peacefully and through dialogue .
Honduras must embrace the very principles of democracy we reaffirmed at the OAS meeting it hosted less than one month ago . ” [ ii ]
And ever since , despite different references to a “ coup ” having occurred in Honduras , the Department of State has refused to legally classify what took place as a coup d’etat .
By doing so , the US government would be obligated to suspend economic , diplomatic and military aid to Honduras , which apparently they are unwilling to do , since such a measure would substantially affect US interests in the Central American nation and the region .
On July 1 , the spokesmen for the State Department explained their wavering on the coup question : “ In regard to the coup itself , I think it would just – it would be best to say that this was a coordinated effort between the military and some civilian political actors .
Obviously , the military was the entity that conducted the forcible removal of the president and has acted as the securer of public order during this process .
But for the coup to become more than an insurrection or a rebellion , you have to have an effort to transfer power .
And in that regard , the congress – the congress ’s decision to swear in its president , Micheletti , as the president of Honduras indicates that the congress and key members of that congress played an important role in this coup . ” [ iii ]
This position of ambiguity , that condemns the events in Honduras as a violation of constitutional order but does n’t go as far as classifying the situation as a coup d’etat and also does n’t call for the reinstatement of President Zelaya to the presidency , was ratified again after the meeting held between Secretary of State Clinton and President Zelaya on July 7 .
Clinton made the following statement , “ I just finished a productive meeting with President Zelaya .
We discussed the events of the past nine days and the road ahead .
I reiterated to him that the United States supports the restoration of the democratic constitutional order in Honduras .
We continue to support regional efforts through the OAS to bring about a peaceful resolution that is consistent with the terms of the Inter - American Democratic Charter …
We call upon all parties to refrain from acts of violence and to seek a peaceful , constitutional , and lasting solution to the serious divisions in Honduras through dialogue .
To that end , we have been working with a number of our partners in the hemisphere to create a negotiation , a dialogue that could lead to a peaceful resolution of this situation . ” [ iv ]
Now it was clear , after this meeting , that Washington would no longer consider Zelaya ’s return to the presidency as a necessary solution but rather would lobby for a “ negotiation ” with the coup regime , that in the end , favours US interests .
Sources that were present at the Organisation of American States ( OAS ) meetings that took place after the coup affirm that the presence of a high - level US delegation intensified the pressure against other States to urge for a “ negotiated ” solution that did n’t necessarily imply the return to power of President Zelaya .
This method of circumventing the main issue , manipulating the outcome and attempting to appear as though one position has been assumed when in reality , actions demonstrate the contrary , forms part of the new Obama doctrine of “ smart power ” , which purports to achieve imperialist objectives without demonising the government .
“ Smart Power ” is “ the capacity to combine ‘ hard power ’ with ‘ soft power ’ to achieve a victorious strategy .
‘ Smart Power ’ strategically uses diplomacy , persuasion , capacity building , military power and economic and political influence , in an effective way with a political and social legitimacy . ”
Essentially , it ’s a mix of military force with all forms of diplomacy , with an emphasis in the use of “ democracy promotion ” as a principal tactic to strongy influence the destiny of societies , instead of a military invasion .
[ Note : Beware that “ smart power ” places an emphasis on the use of agencies like USAID and National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) to do the ‘ dirty work ’ of silently penetrating and infiltrating civil society organisations in order to promote a US agenda .
This explains Obama ’s call for an additional $ 320 million in “ democracy promotion ” funds for the 2010 budget just for use in Latin America .
This is substantially a higher sum than the quantity requested and used in Latin America for “ democracy promotion ” by the Bush administration in its 8 years of government combined . ]
The ambassador
Journalist Jean - Guy Allard has revealed the origens of the current US ambassador in Honduras , Hugo Llorens[v ] .
Per Allard , Hugo Llorens , a Cuban national from birth who arrived in the United States as part of Operation Peter Pan , is “ a specialist in terrorism …
In 2002 , George W. Bush ’s White House strategically placed the astute Llorens as Director of Andean Affairs at the National Security Council in Washington , D.C. , which converted him into the principle advisor to the President on Venezuela .
The coup d’etat in 2002 against Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez occured during Llorens ’ tenure , who was working together with Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs , Otto Reich , and the very controversial Elliot Abrams .
In July 2008 , Llorens was named Ambassador to Honduras . ”
On June 4 , 2009 , just weeks before the coup d’etat against President Zelaya , Ambassador Llorens declared to the Honduran press that “ ... One ca n’t violate the Constitution in order to create another Constitution , because if one does n’t respect the Constitution , then we all live under the law of the jungle . ” [ vi ]
Those declarations were made in reference to the national opinion survey on the possibility of convening a constitutional convention during 2010 , that would have taken place on June 28th if the coup d’etat against President Zelaya had n’t occured .
The commentaries made by Llorens evidence not only his position against the survey , but also his interference in the internal affairs of Honduras .
But Llorens was n’t alone in the region .
After his nomination as US Ambassador in Honduras – position that he was assigned to due to the urgent necessity to neutralise the growing presence of leftist governments in the region and impede the regional potency of ALBA - several other US ambassadors were also named in neighboring nations , all experts in destabilising the Cuban revolution and executing psychological warfare .
The diplomat Robert Blau arrived first to the US embassy in El Salvador , on July 2 , 2008 , named as second in command .
In January 2009 , Blau became the Charge d’Affairs at the Embassy .
Before arriving to El Salvador , Blau was subdirector of Cuban affairs at the Department of State in Washington , after working for two years at the US Interests Section in Havana , Cuba , as a Political Counselor .
His work with Cuban dissidents was so successful that Blau was honored with the Department of State James Clement Dunn Award for Excellence .
Llorens and Blau were old friends , after working together as part of Otto Reich ’s team in the State Department .
Soon after , Stephen McFarland was named as US Ambassador in Guatemala , on August 5 , 2008 .
McFarland , a graduate of the National War College in the US , similar to Hugo Llorens and Robert Blau , and also a former member of Combat Team Number 2 of the US Marines in Iraq , was the second in command at the US embassy in Venezuela during William Brownfield ’s tenure .
Brownfield is known for achieving a substantial increase in State Department funding and strategic support for the Venezuelan opposition .
After Venezuela , McFarland was sent to the US Embassy in Paraguay to oversee the construction of the large US military base in that country that borders Bolivia .
McFarland was also Director of Cuban Affairs at the State Department and his resumé claims he is an expert in “ democratic transitions , human rights and security matters . ”
Ambassador Robert Callahan arrived to Managua , Nicaragua , also at the beginning of August .
Callahan has worked at the US embassies in La Paz , Bolivia , and San José , Costa Rica , and was a distinguished professor at the National War College .
In 2004 , he was sent to Iraq as press attaché at the US Embassy in Baghdad .
Upon his return , he established the press and propaganda office at the newly created Directorate of National Intelligence ( DNI ) in Washington , which today is the most powerful entity in the US intelligence community .
Together , these ambassadors – experts in coup d’etats , destabilisation and propaganda – prepared the terrain for the coup against President Zelaya in Honduras .
Funding the coup leaders
Just one month before the coup against President Zelaya occured , a coalition of different organisations , business associations , political parties , high level members of the Catholic Church and private media outlets , was formed in opposition to Zelaya ’s policies .
The coalition was called the “ Democratic Civil Union of Honduras ” .
It ’s only objective was to oust President Zelaya from power in order to impede the future possibility of a constitutional convention to reform the constitution , which would allow the people a voice and a role in their political process .
The “ Democratic Civil Union of Honduras ” is composed of organisations including the National Anticorruption Council , the Archbishop of Tegucigalpa , Honduran Council of Private Enterprise ( COHEP ) , Council of University Deans , Workers ' Federation of Honduras ( CTH ) , National Convergence Forum , National Federation of Commerce and Industry of Honduras ( FEDECAMARA ) , Association of Communication Media ( AMC ) , the Group Peace & Democracy and the student group Generation for Change .
The majority of these organisations have been the beneficiaries of the more than $ 50 million annually disbursed by USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) for “ democracy promotion ” in Honduras .
In fact , a USAID report regarding its funding and work with COHEP , described how the “ low profile maintained by USAID in this project helped ensure the credibility of COHEP as a Honduran organisation and not an arm of USAID . ”
Which basically means that COHEP is , actually , an arm of USAID .
The spokespeople for the Democratic Civil Union of Honduras representing , according to them , “ civil society ” , declared to the Honduran press on June 23rd – five days before the coup took place against President Zelaya – that they “ trust the armed forces will comply with their responsibility to defend the Constitution , the Law , peace and democracy . ”
When the coup took place on June 28th , they were the first to immediately claim that a coup had not occured , but rather “ democracy had been saved ” from the hands of President Zelaya , whose crime was to attempt to give voice and visibility to the people .
Representing the biased middle and upperclasses , the Democratic Civil Union has qualified Zelaya ’s supporters as “ hoards ” .
The International Republican Institute ( IRI ) , entity that receives funding from the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , received more than $ 1.2 million in 2009 to work with political groups in Honduras .
IRI ’s work has been dedicated to supporting “ think tanks ” and “ pressure groups ” to influence political parties and “ support initiatives to implement political positions during the campaigns in 2009 . ”
This is a clear example of intervention in the internal politics of Honduras and evidence of NED and IRI funding to those groups involved in the coup .
The Washington lobby
Republican Senator John McCain , ex US presidential candidate , helped coordinate the visit of a coup regime delegation to Washington last week .
McCain is well known for his opposition to governments in Venezuela , Bolivia and other countries in the region considered “ anti-imperialist ” .
McCain also maintains very close ties to the Cuban exile community in Miami .
McCain is also Chairman of the Board of the International Republican Institute ( IRI ) that has funded the coup participants in Honduras .
McCain offered the services of a lobby firm in Washington , closely tied to him , the Cormac Group , that organised a press conference for the coup regime delegation at the National Press Club on June 7th .
McCain also helped set up several meetings in Congress with the traditional Cuban - American representatives and those general “ Chávez - haters ” , such as Connie Mack , Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mel Martinez .
But beyond the Republican connection to the Honduran coup regime , there is a even more damning link to the current Democrat administration in Washington .
Lawyer Lanny Davis was hired by the Business Council of Latin America ( CEAL ) to lobby in favour of the coup regime and convince the powers in Washington to accept and recognise the de facto government in Honduras .
Lanny Davis was special counsel to ex President Bill Clinton from 1996 - 1998 and he is a close friend and advisor to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Davis is organising a diplomatic offensive and public relations blitz in favour of the coup regime , including the strategic placement of advertisements in important US media that seek to legitimise the de facto Honduran government , and he is organising meetings and hearings with members of Congress , the State Department and the White House .
CEAL represents the conservative business community in Latin America , including those that have promoted and participated in previous attempts to oust democratic governments via coup d’etats and / or other forms of sabotage .
For example , the Venezuelan representative of CEAL is Marcel Granier , president of RCTV , the television station that heavily participated in the 2002 coup against President Chávez and that consistently has violated Venezuelan law in order to promote its political agenda .
As part of this offensive , Lanny Davis arranged a special hearing before the House Foreign Relations Committee , attended by high level members of Congress and overseen by Democrat Elliot Engel ( congressman from New York ) .
Testimonies were given at the hearing by representatives of the coup regime from Honduras and others who have supported the coup – directly and indirectly – such as Michael Shifter from the InterAmerican Dialogue , Guillermo Pérez - Cadalso , ex Honduran foreign minister and supreme court judge , and the infamous Otto Reich , a Cuban - American well known for his role in the majority of destabilisation activities against leftist and progressive governments in Latin America throughout the eighties .
Reich , who was named Special Advisor on Latin America to President George W. Bush , also played a key role in the 2002 coup against President Chávez .
As a result of this hearing , the US Congress is currently trying to pass a resolution that recognises the coup regime in Honduras as a legitimate government .
Another consequence of Lanny Davis ’ lobbying efforts was the meeting arranged in the Council of the Americas Washington office on June 9th .
This event included the participation of Jim Swigert , Director of Programs in Latin America and the Caribbean for the National Democratic Institute ( NDI ) , entity that receives its funding from NED and USAID , Cris Arcos , former US ambassador to Honduras , and Adolfo Franco , ex USAID Administrator for Latin America and the Caribbean , and the director of the “ transition to democracy ” program for Cuba .
These three characters are working as advisors to the Obama administration on the Honduran crisis .
Franco , who was previously advisor on foreign policy to John McCain during his presidential campaign in 2008 , has been accused of corruption for his mismanagement of USAID funds destined for the Cuba “ democracy ” program .
Franco diverted a large quantity of these funds , totaling over $ 40 million , to groups such as the Committee for a Free Cuba and the Institute for Cuban Studies in Miami , without adhering to a transparent process of funds disbursement .
Negroponte and Reich , again
Many analysts and specialists on Latin American have speculated on the role of former ambassador to Honduras John Negroponte , who directed the paramilitary forces and death squads known as the “ Contra ” against leftist movements in Central America during the 1980s .
Negroponte held various high level positions during the Bush administration , including US Ambassador to Iraq , US Ambassador to the United Nations , National Director of Intelligence and lastly , subsecretary of state , second only to Condoleezza Rice .
After leaving the Department of State in January 2009 , Negroponte entered the private sector , as is custom amongst former top government officials .
He was offered a job as vice - president at the most influential and powerful consulting firm in Washington , McLarty Associates .
Negroponte accepted the job .
McLarty Associates was founded by Thomas “ Mack ” McLarty , former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton and also Clinton ’s Special Envoy to Latin America .
Since the end of the Clinton administration , McLarty has managed the most powerful strategic consulting firm in Washington , which until just last year , was called Kissinger - McLarty Associates due to the merging of Thomas McLarty and Henry Kissinger .
This partnership clearly evidenced the bi-partisan unions that truly craft the most important policies in Washington .
In his new role , John Negroponte presently works as advisor to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Remember , the current US ambassador to Honduras , Hugo Llorens , has worked closely under Negroponte ’s domain during the majority of his career .
So it would not be a far jump to consider that John Negroponte , expert in crushing leftist movements in Central America , has played a role in the current coup against President Zelaya in Honduras .
Otto Reich has also been investing his energy during the last couple of years in a campaign against President Zelaya .
The Honduran president actually threatened to sue Reich for defamation in April 2009 , after Reich accused President Zelaya of stealing $ 100 million from the state - owned telecommunications company , Hondutel .
These accustations were never backed by evidence , and the truth was revealed soon after that explained Reich ’s interest in Hondutel .
Through his consulting and lobbying firm , Otto Reich Associates , the Cuban - American was representing a multinational corporation that was pushing for the privatisation of Hondutel , a move that Zelaya opposed .
With President Zelaya out of the picture now , Reich is able to pursue the multi-million dollar deal .
Reich also co-founded an organisation in Washington named Arcadia Foundation [ vii ] together with a Venezuelan , Robert Carmona - Borjas , a lawyer specialised in military law who is linked to the April 2002 coup d’etat in Venezuela , per his own resumé .
Robert Carmona - Borjas was in the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas , Venezuela , together with the dictator Pedro Carmona , on the days of the coup , from April 11 - 12 , 2002 , and escaped , together with Carmona , when the palace was retaken by the presidential guard and constitutional order was restored .
He later fled to the United States after he was brought up on charges for his role in the coup d’etat in Venezuela , and became a university professor at George Washington University in Washington , DC ( nice to see the warm welcome coup leaders and violators of democracy receive in the United States ) .
Since last year , Reich and Carmona - Borjas have been conducting a campaign against President Zelaya , accusing him of corruption and limiting private property rights .
Through the Arcadia Foundation , they created a series of video clips that have been shown in different media , attempted to portray Zelaya as a corrupt president who violates the basic rights of the Honduran people .[ viii ]
Carmona - Borjas has travelled frequently to Honduras during the last few months , and even held public meetings where the coup against Zelaya was discussed openly .
At one encounter where Carmona - Borjas was present , Honduran Public Defender Ramón Custodia , who was involved in the coup d’etat , declared to the press that “ coups are a possibility and can occur in any political environment ” .
After the coup took place , Robert Carmona - Borjas appeared at a rally in support of the de facto regime , on July 3 , and received the honors and applause from the coup leaders who declared him “ an important actor ” that “ helped make possible ” the removal from power of President Zelaya and the installation of the dictator Roberto Micheletti as de facto president . [ ix ]
Military power
The United States maintains a large military presence in Honduras in the Soto Cano ( Palmerola ) base , located about 50 miles from the capital , Tegucigalpa , that has been actively operating since 1981 , when it was heavily occupied by the US Ronald Reagan Administration and used for its operations in Central America .
During the eighties , Soto Cano was used by Colonel Oliver North as a base of operations of the “ Contra ” , the paramilitary forces trained , armed and funded by the CIA , and charged with executing warfare against all leftist movements in Central America , with particular focus on the neighbouring Sandinista government in Nicaragua .
From Soto Cano , the “ Contra ” launched terrorist attacks , psychological warfare ( overseen by Otto Reich ’s Office for Public Diplomacy ) , death squads and special covert missions that resulted in the assassination of tens of thousands of farmers and civilians , thousands of disappeared , tortured , wounded and terrorised all throughout the region .
John Negroponte , US ambassador at the time in Honduras , together with Oliver North and Otto Reich , directed and oversaw these dirty operations .
They later became involved in the Iran - Contra scandal once the US Congress cut the funding for the paramilitary groups and death squads used by the Reagan Administration to neutralise the leftist movements in the region , and the Negroponte - North - Reich team sold arms to Iran to continue funding their covert operations .
The Soto Cano base houses the US Joint Task Force - Bravo military group , composed of members from the army , air force , joint security forces and the First Batallion Regiment 228 of the US Air Force .
The current total presence of US forces on the base numbers approximately 600 , and includes 18 combat planes , UH - 60 Black Hawk helicopters and CH - 47 Chinook helicopters , used for special warfare operations .
The Honduran Aviation Academy is also located on the Soto Cano base .
More than 650 Honduran and US citizens also live inside the base installations .
The Honduran constitution does not legally permit the presence of foreign military in the country .
A “ handshake ” agreement was made between Washington and Honduras authorising the “ semi- permanent ” important and strategic presence of hundreds – at times thousands – of US military personnel on the base .
The agreement was made in 1954 , in exchange for the multimillion dollar aid the US provides to the Honduran armed forces , which ranges from training programs , arms and military equipment and joint exercises and operations that take place on the ground in Honduras .
The base was first employed by the US military and CIA to launch the coup d’etat against Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954 .
Each year , Washington authorises hundreds of millions of dollars in military and economic aid to Honduras , which is the third - poorest country in the western hemisphere , after Haiti and Nicaragua .
This “ exchange ” securing the US military presence in the Central American nation can be terminated at any time by the Honduran government , without much notice .
On May 31 , 2008 , President Manuel Zelaya announced that Soto Cano ( Palmerola ) would be converted into an international civilian airport .
The construction of the airport terminal would be financed with a fund from the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas ( ALBA – of which Bolivia , Cuba , Ecuador , Dominique , Honduras , Nicaragua , St. Vicents , Antigua and Barbados and Venezuela are members ) .
This obviously was a huge threat to the future US military presence in Honduras .
The two generals that have participated in key roles in the coup against President Zelaya are both graduates of the US School of the Americas , famous for training dictators , torturers and repressors in Latin America , and they maintain very close ties with the US military forces based in Honduras .
The Commander of the Honduran Air Force General Luis Javier Prince Suazo studied in the famous School of the Americas in 1996 .
The Head of the Honduran High Military Command , General Romeo Vásquez , who was fired by President Zelaya on June 24 , 2009 , for disobeying the president ’s orders , and later appeared as the principal actor in the military coup just days later , is also a graduate of the School of the Americas .
These two high level military officers also maintain close contact with the Pentagon and the Southern Command .
The US Ambassador in Honduras through September 2008 , when Hugo Llorens was appointed to the position , Charles Ford , was transferred from Honduras to the Southern Command in Florida and charged with providing “ strategic advising ” to the Pentagon about Latin America , a position he holds today .
The Honduran military are funded , trained , schooled and commanded by the US military .
They have been indoctrinated with the anti-leftist , anti-socialist , pro-empire mentality since the beginning of the Cold War .
The Generals and high level officers involved in the coup in Honduras have publicly stated that they were “ obligated ” to remove President Zelaya from power because of the “ threat ” he posed with his “ leftist ” ideology and alignment to socialist nations in the region such as Venezuela and Cuba .
Per one Honduran colonel , “ ' We fought the subversive movements here and we were the only country that did not have a fratricidal war like the others
…
It would be difficult for us , with our training , to have a relationship with a leftist government .
That 's impossible .
I personally would have retired , because my thinking , my principles , would not have allowed me to participate in that .''. [ x ]
All of the above evidence – and certainly more to come in the future – proves the undeniable role of Washington in the coup d’etat aginst President Zelaya in Honduras .
Things are getting worse each day in Honduras
By Eva Golinger
July 13 , 2009 -- Postcards from the Revolution --
Things are getting worse each day inside Honduras .
Over the weekend , two well - known social leaders were assassinated by the coup forces .
Roger Bados , leader of the Bloque Popular and the National Resistance Front against the Coup d'etat , was killed in the northern city of San Pedro Sula .
Approximately at 8 pm on Saturday evening , Bados was assassinated by three gun shots .
Bados was also a member of the leftist party , Democratic Unity ( Unificación Democrática ) , and was president of a trade union representing workers in a cement factory .
His death was part of the repressive actions taken by the coup government to silence all dissent .
Ramon Garcia , another social leader in Honduras , was also killed on Saturday evening by military forces who boarded a bus he was riding in Santa Barbara and forced him off , subsequently shooting him and wounding his sister .
Juan Barahona , national coordinator of the Bloque Popular and the National Resistance Front against the Coup d'etat , stated that these actions are being committed by the coup government " as the only way to maintain themselves in power , by terrorising and killing the people " .
Despite statements made by representatives of the coup government , the national curfew remains in place .
Social organisers from Honduras have stated that the curfew is still in effect and that the coup government is lying about lifting it , so as to seem less repressive to the international community .
However over the weekend foreign journalists from Telesur , Venezolana de Televisión ( VTV -- Venezuelan State TV ) and EFE were detained by military forces and expelled from Honduras .
The Venezuelan journalists returned last night to Venezuela , while Telesur is still trying to find a way to maintain its correspondents on the ground .
For now , they are all in Nicaragua after being forcibly expelled .
This means few , if any , international media are left in Honduras to cover the reality on the ground , of a coup d'etat now 15 days in the making .
Honduran media , which supports the coup , reported on the journalists ' detention stating that the police arrested and deported them for " car theft " .
The massive censorship inside Honduras by the media and coup government is already taking an extraordinary toll on the people of Honduras who each day are finding it more difficult to resist .
Support in Washington
Meanwhile , the coup government has hired top - notch Democrat lobbyists in Washington to make its case before Congress and the White House and convince the US people to recognise them as a legitimate government .
The New York Times has confirmed that Clinton lobbyist Lanny Davis , former special counsel for President Bill Clinton from 1996 - 1998 , and close advisor to Hillary 's campaign for president last year , has been hired by the Latin American Business Council -- an ultraconservative group of Latin American businesses -- to represent the coup leaders in the US .
Davis arranged a series of meetings with Congress last week , including a hearing before the House Foreign Relations Committee , where he testified in favour of the coup government alongside Iran - Contra propaganda man Otto Reich , as well as several private meetings in the State Department and interviews with US media .
Another lobbyist , Bennett Ratcliff of San Diego , another close friend and advisor of the Clintons , was also hired by the coup regime to advise them on the negotiations taking place in Costa Rica .
Ratcliff actually accompanied the coup representatives and dictator Roberto Micheletti himself , to Costa Rica , presenting the " conditions " of a negotiated return for President Zelaya to Honduras .
So what 's up with the Clinton advisors and lobbyists hanging out with the coupsters ?
Obviously , it 's a clear indication of Washington 's support for the coup regime in Honduras , despite the rhetoric we heard last week " condemning the coup " .
The real actions show just the opposite : clear , undivided support for Micheletti and a definite rejection of President Zelaya 's return to the presidency in Honduras .
Ratcliff 's conditions for the negotiation -- approved by secretary of state Clinton -- included the following five main terms :
1. Zelaya can return to the presidency , but not to power .
The presidency and the exercise of power are two different things .
2. Zelaya must not pursue any plans to reform the constitution or promote polls or referendums that give voice to the people .
3. Zelaya must distance himself substantially from President Chávez .
" This is essential " , they said .
4. Zelaya must share governance with the Congress and those in the coup regime until the elections in November .
5. Zelaya must give amnesty to all those involved in the coup .
Well , there you have it !
Obama 's first coup and Hillary 's first use of " smart power " to achieve the ouster of a left - leaning president that was further opening the doors of Central America to Latin American integration and sovereignty .
There is no doubt that this coup has been executed to cease the expansion of socialism and Latin American independence in the region .

CrunchGear reports that developer Till Schadde has discovered a security flaw that allows AIM instant messages sent to certain unlocked and jailbroken iPhones to be misrouted to unintended recipients .
Till tested the service by sending an AIM from the OS X desktop using iChat to his iPhone .
He then received a reply back from a random recipient .
It is clear that this is a Push problem in the message addressing - each iPhone is assigned its own identifier and receives messages from a central server operated by Apple - although this may change .
Schadde reports that AOL is investigating the issue , although he suggests that AOL says that the issue is not the result of anything happening in their systems .
Initial indications are that the bug appears to be related to a hack being developed to skirt Apple 's blocking of Push Notifications to unlocked iPhones , with the hack possibly somehow causing device identifiers to be mis-assigned through Apple 's servers .
It is not yet clear how widespread the problem is and to how many devices misrouted messages are being sent .
Olda K. has pointed out the following article in Nude Socialist to me ,
I do not accept that this continuing rejection of the science is a reflection of media distortion or scientific illiteracy .
Rather , I see it as proof of our society 's failure to construct a shared belief in climate change .
The psychology of denial
Sleepwalking into disaster ; are we in a state of denial about climate change . :-)
The author , a boss of a climate pressure group " COIN " in Oxford , is conducting an " informal research project " .
It means that he 's asking various people the annoying question how they could dare to fly to long - haul destinations .
Of course , needless to say , all the people whom he has interviewed and who flew to unnecessarily distant airports - for skiing trips , holidays in Sri Lanka , or scuba diving in the Pacific - were Greenpeace or British Antarctic Survey officials , leading climate policy experts , and similar green material .
So this not - so - gentle man asks why people do n't " act " on climate change .
And indeed , the obvious answer - that such an " action " would mean an economic suicide with no detectable positive effects - must remain a taboo .
If he 's not allowed to consider the possibility that his belief system is wrong , what other culprits can he find ?
You should n't be surprised by the result .
Media distortions and scientific illiteracy turn out to be innocent .
The true villain is nothing else thanitself .
Marshall admits that even Ms Pope who is the holy mother of the Hadley Center for Climate Change thinks that climate science should build on scientific evidence .
But Mr Marshall " could not disagree more " .
What matters is " shared belief " .
Mr Marshall continues by discussing the possible methods how to construct such a " shared belief " that does n't exist so far : only 10 % of the people count " climate change " as a major problem .
His conclusion is that the bulk of the society agrees with the skeptics not because they 're right but because the " maverick " skeptics are better in trustworthiness , honesty , confidence , charm , humour and outspokenness .
Well , again , Mr Marshall has missed the obvious explanation , namely that the " ordinary " people are actually able to compare the impacts of a few tenths of a degree of possible warming on one side and the unavailability of energy on the other side .
By the way , I disagree with the " maverick " label for most of the climate realists .
We 're defending the status quo , the pillars of the scientific and industrial civilization that have been in place for centuries .
It 's the climate activists like him who are unhinged mavericks and hippies .
Today , there are many of them but that can't change the fact that they 're still hippies .
Instead of investigating whether his beliefs are actually correct or wrong , he wants to bring artists and writers to science because science has failed , he thinks .
" Collective imagination " should replace it because :
Well , religious bigots have always needed a fundamentally different approach than science to achieve their goals , and Mr Marshall is surely not the first example in the human history .
In fact , science is literally threatening to the core values that people like Mr Marshall worship , such as blind beliefs , unlimited fear , irrationality , and brainwashing of whole nations .
Science has always been their enemy , whether they were potent in inspiring a new large religious awakening or as impotent as Mr Marshall .
I am also amused by Marshall 's comment that " they " have done the work .
Google Scholar shows that Mr Marshall has only written two papers .
Each of them has earned 3 citations and they 're called :
Well , it does n't look like Mr Marshall has done any work in his life .
Instead , as Prof Richard Lindzen has explained ( go e.g. to 21:00 and especially 33:45 ) , Mr Marshall is a typical example of the mentally ungifted people who find the " shared belief " in catastrophic global warming to be a good tool to imagine themselves as something that they are surely not - namely thinkers - and to place themselves above others even though they are actually below them , from any objective viewpoint .
I just wonder how it 's possible that a journal with the word " scientist " in its official title , and Nude Socialist is surely one of them , can be printing this garbage written by similar people who have nothing sensible to say .
And that 's the memo .

I am sometimes certain that I wait all year for tomato season , you know , the way a more normal person might be excited for the Giants to get back to the field or eagerly anticipate whatever sleek and minimal trinket Apple has coming out this fall .
But for me , it ’s just tomatoes .
I eat them on eggs , in sandwiches , cooked and raw in every possible format from paste to pasta to chili and seriously , do n’t even try to bring me a cream cheese - schmeared bagel without a thin slice of tomato on it .
Alex did once and let ’s just say , it did n’t go over well .
Poor Alex .
I love tomatoes so much that I even occasionally take part in the blasphemy that is “ sun - dried tomatoes , ” most of which are about as dried out in the sun as I am this week –unfortunately not the case for either of us .
But lets talk about what sun-dried tomatoes aspired to be before their dreams were co-opted by food packagers and evil - minded chemists : tomatoes roasted slowly at a low temperature .
If you ’ve never made slow - roasted tomatoes before , prepare to have your mind blown because they ’ve got very little to do with the aforementioned packaged variety in all of the best ways : they ’re so flavorful that you might think you think someone snuck into your oven and doused them in both vinegar and salt , even if you did neither .
They also have just the right level of moisture , dry on the outside with some juiciness left within–no rehydrating needed here .
They can transform even those freakily perfect supermarket grape tomatoes into heaven on a plate , but if you manage to get your hands on the real deal from a greenmarket , well , I hope you ’re sitting down when you pop the first one in your mouth .
And what to do with them ?
Namely , anything .
Dorie Greenspan uses hers as a pasta picker - upper , or stores them in the fridge covered in olive oil , laying them over chicken , salmon , tuna or mixed vegetables .
Heidi at 101 Cookbooks puts them in salsa .
And I put them … in my mouth .
Or mix them with white beans or slivers of basil .
Or in my mouth .
Or in salad .
But mostly in my mouth .
Previously
One year ago :
Oh look , I was gushing over the exact same thing .
I ’m so predictable .
Ottawa should grant citizenship to people born outside the country to a Canadian parent , provided the mother or father lived in Canada for a given time before the child was born , says a parliamentary report .
The recommendation from the standing committee on citizenship and immigration comes after Bill C - 37 , which took effect in April , discontinued the practice of giving citizenship to children born outside Canada to parents who are naturalized Canadians .
" It is in Canada 's interest for the government to ensure that citizenship is not passed on to `citizens of convenience , ' " the all - party committee said in its report released last week .
But it added : " We are of the opinion that the parents ' attachment to Canada can be measured by the amount of time they resided in Canada before their child was born . "
Bill C - 37 was introduced in response to the problem of " lost Canadians , " people who for technical reasons were n't considered Canadian citizens – something they often learned about only when they applied for citizenship documents .
The simplified rules helped resolve most of those cases .
But it also meant that second - generation children born abroad , and children born to people whose Canadian parents adopted them overseas , lost their assumed right to citizenship .
Witnesses told the committee the new law could result in some children born abroad to Canadians being citizens of no country at all .
" The risk of statelessness should not be overlooked , given the complexity of citizenship laws , " the four - page report warned .
It recommended that Ottawa grant children adopted abroad by Canadian parents who ordinarily live in Canada the same legal status as those born in the country , to avoid creating " two classes of citizens . "
That trouble is about not paying bills .
It ’s also about the vertigo of falling out of the middle class .
“ We talk about it as middle - class poverty , ” said Sara Horowitz , founder and executive director of the Freelancers Union , which has 70,000 members in New York City .
“ Your frame of reference , when you think of yourself as middle class , does n’t include being scared about making ends meet , realizing that welfare and food stamps are your only option .
Psychologically , that shift is devastating . ”

For more than four years , Lisa Feuer was able to make ends meet as a freelance yoga instructor .
The recession , however , has severely curtailed business .
Credit ... Michal Chelbin for The New York Times
Sudhir Venkatesh , a sociologist who teaches at Columbia University , began to see early signs of that shift last winter in the coffee shops where he does fieldwork .
Venkatesh is collecting work histories in the course of studying the off - the - books economy : in a chapter of Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt ’s book “ Freakonomics , ” he was the clever Ph.D. student who noticed that many drug dealers lived with their mothers because they could n’t afford their own housing .
Venkatesh observed that when the recession began , the spectrum of vulnerability among freelance workers broadened , from the sex workers he is currently studying to those in other professions .
Every few months , Venkatesh goes to the same set of coffee shops in Manhattan and Brooklyn and talks to people who come in and sit down .
“ I ’m looking for clues in weird places that wo n’t register for an economist , ” he says .
Venkatesh asks the coffee - shop patrons whether they are out of work , looking for work or have stopped looking in the past few weeks .
Venkatesh also asks people if they work for themselves .
Over the years , he has observed the rise in the number of people who say yes .
This year , he estimated , at least half of his coffee - shop sample was made up of the self - employed .
Increasingly , they talk about their fading prospects .
In 2005 , 16 percent of the coffee - shop patrons Venkatesh talked to in Brooklyn and 34 percent in Manhattan said they were out of work , were looking or had recently given up looking .
In April of this year , the figure rose to 37 percent in Brooklyn and spiked to 53 percent in Manhattan .
Many of the coffee - shop patrons told Venkatesh that they had maxed out their credit cards and had no savings .
He concluded that it was n’t just many workers in the sex industry who were living at the edge of poverty — it could be anyone who had hung out their own shingle .
Venkatesh sees a difference in how freelancers talk about the recession compared with workers who have been laid off .
“ They ’re more alone , and they ca n’t help but feel like they did something wrong because they ’re losing relationships with individual clients , ” he says .
“ They think of themselves as ministering to their clients , so they also feel guilty about no longer helping them . ”
The instability of freelancing is n’t new .
Lawrence Katz , a Harvard economist , points out that the share of workers who have standard full - time jobs with benefits has been shrinking since the 1980s .
But in the past , temporary and on - call workers — everyone from data - entry employees to construction workers — were hit hardest by downturns .
Now the higher - earning independent contractors are suffering , too .
Meanwhile , unemployment insurance is still largely structured as it was when the system was instituted during the Depression .
“ Unemployment insurance was designed in 1935 to give temporary support to the classic male laid - off worker , ” Katz says .
“ It ’s not set up for the circumstances we see today , with a lot of people freelancing . ”
President Obama ’s recovery package includes incentives for states to modernize their unemployment - insurance laws by , among other things , covering more part - timers .
“ But it ’s still tough for freelancers , ” Katz says .
At the Freelancers Union , Sara Horowitz is pushing for a new kind of unemployment protection fund that would cover the self - employed by helping them put away money that they could draw on in times of need .
Will “ Transformers ” make “ Dinosaurs ” of us all ?
With the ongoing box office behemoth that is “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen ” seemingly devouring everything in its path , the studios are nevertheless allowing two potentially vulnerable major productions to venture out of the nest a couple of days ahead of the big July 4th holiday weekend .
For the family trade , we have a 3 - D CGI animated sequel , “ Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs , ” which will be showing on a record number of 3 - D screens .
( Which I guess means that if you have n’t seen “ Up ” in 3 - D by now , which I finally managed just last night , you may be SOL until at least such time as we start seeing 3 - D retrospectives . )
In a saner world , this would be the # 1 movie this week because of family appeal , I think it ’s safe to say .
Carl DiOrio of The Hollywood Reporter is calling it at between $ 45 and $ 50 million for Friday through Sunday ( not counting weekdays ) , which he thinks will be somewhat below the “ Transformers ” take based on a very modest 50 % drop - off .
Is the word of mouth on this film , despised even by many who liked the first film ( which I could n’t even sit through ) really that good ?
I ’m not a twittering teen , so who knows .
Though , to be honest , the “ Ice Age ” sequels reviews are hardly much better , at 34 % “ fresh ” according to the mighty Tomatometer .
Critics sound seriously bored this time around , though kids ’ attention spans are often better than adults when animated animals are involved .
Variety , which apparently has n’t read Carl DiOrio , says the following :
No one is willing to call the Fourth of July race , with the “ Transformers ” sequel looking like a powerhouse .
There ’s also the issue of timing .
July 4 falls on Saturday , which could dampen returns on what is generally the busiest moviegoing day of the week .
Damn those national holidays with their picnics and fireworks and other non-moviegoing pleasures .
But , yes , there is another very major release this week which , in any normal world , would be the film to beat .
I obviously speak of the Michael Mann - directed Johnny Depp / Christian Bale vehicle , “ Public Enemies . ”
As I wrote a couple of days back , however , concern is widespread that this one does n’t really have the mass appeal — or non mass appeal , even — to really make the grade .
A film of this type , from a highly regarded director and with two widely - admired master thespian - style superstars in the lead and which appeals to grown - ups with other things to do than head lemming - like to the ‘ plex , really should break 70 % on the Tomatometer .
56 % is disappointing and this is the kind of film which may not be entirely critic proof — or rather it might be the kind of film where the word of mouth might more closely follow the reviews because of the nature of the audience , if you follow me .
DiOrio ’s call , which I really have no reason to question , is for $ 25 million for the actual weekend and as much as $ 40 million for the five day extended period .
That should about cover the salaries of Mr. Bale ’s eye - line protection team .
Researchers in the US have devised a new way to create graphene - sheets of carbon one atom thick that have extraordinary electronic properties - based upon a detailed understanding of the chemical structure of an important precursor of the material , graphite oxide .
There are a variety of ways to produce graphene , such as peeling flakes from graphite , but the challenge is to find a technique that can produce industrial - scale quantities of high - grade material efficiently .
One method uses graphite oxide .
In solution the oxide disperses into one - atom - thick layers , which can be ’ spin- coated ’ onto a surface and then chemically reduced to form graphene .
However , so far it has proved difficult to remove all the oxygen from the sample without introducing defects into the crystal lattice - and thereby lose some of the properties .
Now , Wei Gao and colleagues at Rice University in Texas have carried out a thorough analysis of NMR spectroscopic data on graphite oxide to identify the various oxygen structures present within the material , and then worked out an efficient way to eliminate them by reduction .
It was already known that oxygen occurs in a number of forms in graphite oxide , including hydroxyl , epoxy and ketone groups .
The new work has provided good evidence that previously suspected but unconfirmed structures are also present in the form of five - and six - membered lactol rings .
The team used this information to devise a novel reduction strategy by first deoxygenating the graphite oxide sheets with sodium borohydride , followed by dehydration with concentrated sulphuric acid , and a final step of heating , or annealing .
’ Our approach is designed to reduce all the functionalities , including the lactols , ’ says Gao .
The team have n’t carried out details mechanistic studies , but believe that the lactols are reduced to secondary alcohols and carboxylic acids in the first step , alcohols are then dehydrated into double bonds in the second step , and finally the carboxylic acids are lost as CO 2 during the annealing process .
The approach produces far smaller amounts of impurities than other methods based upon reduction of graphite oxide , the researchers say , with concomitant improvement in the resulting material ’s properties .
Rod Ruoff , a graphene expert from the University of Texas at Austin in the US , welcomes the new work .
’ They have furthered the understanding of the chemical structure of graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide materials through their detailed spectroscopic analyses , ’ Ruoff says .
’ It is hoped that other chemists and materials scientists will be inspired by their work and will rise to the challenge of preparing a broad portfolio of chemically modified graphenes , both for developing fundamental understanding of chemistry of graphene , and for a host of possible applications , ’ he adds .

Sometimes it 's just fun to play around with the programming languages we know and see what we can create .
I thought it might be nice to create a little online keyboard with CSS , and then make it work with jQuery .
The keyboard includes " action " keys ( caps lock , shift , and delete ) which dynamically changes the keyboard when clicked .
I 'll show you how to build it today .
Step 1 : Basic HTML and Files
This keyboard requires a lot of HTML setup and playing around with CSS .
Each of the keys will be represented by a list item in an unordered list .
Each of the list items will have a class attached to them , used in both the CSS and jQuery .
Most of the classes are just " letter " , " lastitem " , or something similar .
This will make finding out which list item is which easy .
Make sure you have setup a folder wherever you are going to be using this keyboard .
Inside this new folder , create an index.html file along with a css and a js folder .
Finally , create a keyboard .js file in the js folder and a style.css file in the css folder .
Inside the HTML file we 'll be including two JavaScript files and one CSS file .
Inside the body tag there will be a HUGE unordered list containing all the letters , numbers , and some " action " keys .
The HTML will also have a textarea in it with an id of " keyboard " .
This will be the place where all the characters are added .
The below code should be placed inside the index.html file .
You wo n't have to worry too much about the classes on the list items for now .
I 'll explain them more when we 're using jQuery .
However , some of the classes ( like right - shift and lastitem ) are just there because of the CSS we 'll be using .
Step 2 : Making the List Pretty
The JavaScript for the keyboard would work perfectly fine without any CSS , but it would n't look like a keyboard .
I 'm not going to explain every style because a lot of them are pretty self - explainitory , but there are a couple that I will go over .
Save the following CSS in the style.css file located in the css folder .
Take notice of the following styles because they are very important .
.on -
In some of the list items , there are two spans .
These are the keys that have more than one character per key ; like the numbers .
The span with the on class will be hidden .
This changed when a user clicks on the shift key , but more on that later with the JavaScript .
.lastitem -
The last jey in any row will have its right margin zeroed out so the layout wo n't break .
Step 3 : Bringing the Keys to Life
If you were to click on a list item nothing would happen .
We 're about to fix that with a little jQuery .
The main idea we 'll be using is to attach a click handler to each of the list items , grab the text when clicked , and do some magic to it depending on the list item 's class .
From here on out , all the JavaScript code will go into the keyboard .js file .
The Setup
We need to open up jQuery and define three variables that will be used through the code .
These variables are the textarea , a shift status , and a caps lock status .
What comes next is attaching the click handler to all the list items ( keys ) .
Two variables are setup when the key is clicked .
$ this is defined just to required less typing from us , and character is defined as the HTML of the list item .
If the list item is a letter , nothing will happen to this variable , and it will be returned .
The Shift Key and Caps Lock
If the shift key ( list items with the class of " left - shift " or " right - shift " ) is clicked , we want to toggle the " uppercase " class of each letter .
Then for the list items with a class of " symbol , " we want to toggle the display between the nested span tags .
What we want to do next is set shift to the opposite boolean value ( if it 's true set it to false , and vice versa ) , and the caps lock variable to false , and finally return false to not do anything else with the character variable .
Now , if the caps lock key is clicked , we will toggle the " uppercase " class on letter list items ; set the caps lock variable to true ; and return false .
The Delete Key
For the delete key , we need to assign another variable : html - the contents of what 's currently in the textarea .
Once we have that , we set the new HTML of the textarea to everything but the last character .
This is done with JavaScript 's substr method .
Once again we return false as to not run anything else .
Special Characters
For all the list items which are n't a letter and are n't one of the " actions " keys , we change the character variable to something special .
For a list item with the " symbol " class , character is set to the contents of whatever span is visible .
A space is ( obviously ) used for the space bar .
The tab character is represented by \t , and finally a new line ( the return key ) is
.
Uppercase Letters
If you can remember to when we handled the shift and caps lock keys , an " uppercase " class was either added or removed using the toggleClass function .
If the uppercase class is found , the character is converted to its uppercase form with the help of the toUpperCase method .
The Aftermath
On a normal keyboard , you usually only need the shift key for one letter .
If the shift variable is found to be set to true , we want to toggle the display of the symbol 's spans .
What also happens is that if the caps lock key is " on " , the letters are once again toggled between uppercase and lowercase .
To finish off , the character is added to the textarea and the user can continue " typing " .
Final JavaScript Code
Conclusion
Sometimes it 's nice to play around , even if the final product is n't truly " real world . "
By applying a few classes to our list items , we were able to create a CSS and jQuery powered keyboard .
The keyboard is n't totally useless .
I 've seen websites were there 's an option for an on - screen keyboard .
But mostly , this allows us to gain a better understanding of the capabilities of CSS and jQuery .

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) -- Republican Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff sent out half a dozen Twitter messages on Tuesday revealing details of his yet - to - be announced U.S. Senate campaign that were solely intended for his spokesman .
Shurtleff has repeatedly said he 's interested in challenging fellow Republican Bob Bennett , and he is expected to announce his candidacy next week .
In messages accidentally sent to more than 1,600 followers , Shurtleff wrote about fundraising , being endorsed by a legislative conservative caucus as well as other senators and representatives .
Shurtleff wrote that it is " time to rock and roll . "
Within minutes of posting the messages -- the tweets -- were removed from Shurtleff 's Twitter page .
In one tweet , Shurtleff wrote , " I just realized that I was responding to a text from u. I 'm going to pull it off immediately . "
A few seconds letter , Shurtleff wrote " Take down my last reply to Ben Cannati too .
His tweets to me say " direct from Ben , so I thought my reply would go directly back just to him . "
For the uninitiated , Twitter is a microblogging Web site that allows users to post 140 character messages .
The messages can be posted and received via text messages from cell phones .
After realizing the messages had been picked up by reporters , Shurtleff wrote " Thinking of ' texting while drowsy ' law after private 1 AM tweet went public .
Formal announcement on 5/20 about senate race and tweeting plans . "
Shurtleff has used the social networking service along with his Facebook account and a blog to give legal opinions on civil unions and to rail on the Bowl Championship Series , which kept an undefeated University of Utah football team from playing in the national title game .
The series of tweets began appearing Tuesday afternoon when Shurtleff mentioned " significant fundraisers in UT , CA , NY , AZ and TX and should have no trouble raising up to $ 2 mil .
I wo n't need that much if I can knoc ... , " the message said before truncating .
It was n't immediately clear whether Shurtleff meant he , or Bennett , should have no trouble raising $ 2 million .
Saying he wo n't need that much money , Shurtleff was likely referring to the state 's political convention system .
Candidates here typically do n't need to raise as much money as they do in other states if they can appeal to a small pool of conservative delegates and win the Republican nomination at the party convention , avoiding a primary and the costly advertisements that come with them .
In Utah , whoever wins the Republican nomination is for all intents guaranteed victory in U.S. Senate elections .
Shurtleff 's spokesman , Paul Murphy , said the tweets came in response to a text message he had sent about Tim Bridgewater , who had been considering a run for state GOP Party chairman .
On Tuesday , Bridgewater sent out a message via Twitter saying he was dropping out of that race and would " explore a run for federal office next year . "
" In meeting with the delegates across the state it is clear there is a desire for change .
Nxt yr voters will hv good choices , " Bridgewater wrote .
Bennett 's seat is the only federal office in Utah up for election next year .
Shurtleff wrote , " Yea , pretty weird .
I was supporting another candidate for state party chair and poos show tim losing so maybe he 's getting back . "
" It will also be against Bennett and I 'll pick up his delegates when he drops off the first ballot .
I 'm announcing I 'm running at 12 , " another message said before cutting off .
Shurtleff is in Israel on a trade mission and an e-mail sent to him seeking comment was not immediately returned Tuesday .
Murphy said Shurtleff was able to find some humor in the situation .
" Some tweets are supposed to be fleeting , but some apparently do stay , " Murphy said .
" I think it 's funny .
The attorney general has made a point of being transparent , and he 's taken it to new levels . "

Now , Pääbo and colleagues have created a quicker , less expensive , and less wasteful method to reconstruct the genomes of ancient specimens . '
The samples we used in this new project were even more poorly preserved than that original sample [ analysed last year ] , meaning that the shotgun method would have cost hundreds of millions of pounds , ' says graduate student Adrian Briggs who helped pioneer the new technique .
' Hence the need for our new targeted retrieval method - primer extension capture ( PEC ) . '
' We have managed to immortalise a precious DNA source , for example a Neanderthal DNA extract , by making many thousands of copies of every original DNA molecule in that source , ' says Briggs .
In doing so , ancient DNA sequences can be stored in a ' library ' they can be used again and again .
The technique uses 5 '- biotinylated oligonucleotide primers and a DNA polymerase that isolate Neanderthal mtDNA sequences from the plethora of contaminant DNA .
Sequences of interest are then directly extracted from this amplified library of degraded DNA before the sequencing step .
' This saves on experimental time and costs by several thousand fold , ' Briggs adds .
Eske Willerslev , an expert on ancient DNA at the University of Copenhagen , Denmark , thinks this is an important technological breakthrough .
' The capture approach makes it possible to retrieve very short pieces of DNA ( 50 - 70 bp ) that is difficult if not impossible using regular [ approaches , ' he comments .
' This means that the chances of retrieving endogenous rather than contaminant DNA increases significantly . '
In fact , new genetic evidence from the remains of six Neanderthals ( Homo neanderthalensis ) suggests the population hovered at an average of 1,500 females of reproductive age in Europe between 38,000 and 70,000 years ago , with the maximum estimate of 3,500 such female Neanderthals .
" It seems they never really took off in Eurasia in the way modern humans did later , " said study researcher Adrian Briggs of the Max - Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany .
The research , which will be published in the July 17 issue of the journal Science , suggests the small population size of our ancestral cousins may have been a factor in their demise .
" Because there never really were millions of them , they probably were more susceptible to some event that made them go extinct , which to me , suspiciously coincides with the emergence of modern humans , " Briggs told LiveScience .
Ian Tattersall , curator of anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York , who was not involved in the current research , said the study " does support notions that toward the end of last ice age , the Neanderthal population was declining as a result of harsh circumstances . "
He added , " I do n't believe Neanderthals would 've gone extinct if it was n't for this new element , the Homo sapiens competing for the same resources . "

Targeted Retrieval and Analysis of Five Neandertal mtDNA Genomes
This is a very exciting paper , both for the apparent advance in ancient DNA technology , and for the finding of a smaller effective population size for Neandertals .
The reduced mtDNA diversity in Neandertals might be the result of selection .
Even among current cold - adapted populations , mtDNA diversity is reduced , and this is due to bioenergetic adaptation for a cold climate .
Chemistry World has some details on the new technical advance :
The much publicized Neandertal DNA data from Vindija cave were taken from an almost ideal sample in terms of preservation .
LiveScience has some details on the implications for the demography of Neandertals : I really find it hard to believe that Neandertals died out beause of competition with Homo sapiens .
After all , a population of a few thousand could quite easily have been accommodated in Paleolithic Europe ; population density was so low , that there were plenty of resources for modern humans and Neandertals alike .
There are plenty of scenaria for the disappearance of the Neandertals , ranging from absorption by modern humans ( although recent estimates of introgression are usually from modest to very low ) to cannibalism , to contracting diseases brought byand for which they had no immunity .
We do n't even know how long the co-existence between the species was before the disappearance of Neandertals .
The argument for a causative role of modern humans in Neandertal demise is weakened if the latter persisted for many thousands of years after the arrival of the former .
If , however , Neandertals were so limited in numbers , perhaps there was no major reason for their disappearance .
It could very well have been a statistical accident as random fluctuations in population size may have driven them to a non-viable demographic size from which they may not have been able to recover .
As usual for apaper , there are plentiful open access supplementary data doi:10.1126/science.1174462Adrian W. Briggs et al .
Analysis of Neandertal DNA holds great potential for investigating the population history of this group of hominins , but progress has been limited due to the rarity of samples and damaged state of the DNA .
We present a method of targeted ancient DNA sequence retrieval that greatly reduces sample destruction and sequencing demands and use this method to reconstruct the complete mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) genomes of five Neandertals from across their geographic range .
We find that mtDNA genetic diversity in Neandertals that lived 38,000 to 70,000 years ago was approximately one - third of that in contemporary modern humans .
Together with analyses of mtDNA protein evolution , these data suggest that the long - term effective population size of Neandertals was smaller than that of modern humans and extant great apes .

Bad Astronomer Phil Plait likes the photography of Annie Leibovitz , such as this ad photo for Louis Vuitton bags featuring astronauts Sally Ride , Buzz Aldrin , and Jim Lovell .
Despite her fame and the excellent work she 's done in the past , I find most of Leibovitz 's current work aesthetically repulsive .
A bit of a rant here .
Annie used to take good photos , and she still occasionally does , but her advertising work ( including this picture ) and many of her portraits long ago strayed much too far into over - Photoshopped territory .
One critic even called a picture she created last year the worst photograph ever made , and I 'm inclined to agree .
I think this would have been a much better photo with the same people , all of whom I admire , plus the same truck and the same bag , outside on a sunny day , maybe on the landing strip at Edwards Air Force Base .
Maybe in black and white .
The example here is overlit , over - processed , oversaturated , and ingenuine .
Their facial expressions are n't that great .
And yeah , if they 're supposed to be looking at and lit by the Moon , it 's in entirely the wrong place in the image .
Even a non-nerd can probably detect that intuitively .
Compare her classic portrait of Whoopi Goldberg in the bath ( 11th down on this page ) to her recent Photoshop monstrosity of Whoopi ( second down on this page ) .
I admire surreal photography and well - executed photo manipulation , whether using Photoshop or high - dynamic - range ( HDR ) imaging .
But Leibovitz is n't doing that .
She and her team of assistants have manipulated the life out of her images .
Much of her new stuff reminds me of velvet paintings of dogs playing poker .
The astronaut ad is no exception .

Netizens of South Korea could find themselves at the mercy of a copyright infringement firestorm today , as a tough new copyright law takes effect .
A prominent social networking site is sending warnings to its customers about their behavior , noting that far reaching penalties include 6 month Internet disconnections .
Reports of countries mulling the possibility of 3 strikes for online pirates is nothing new and if those reports are to be believed , it might or might not be implemented in dozens of countries in the future .
There is no such doubt in South Korea .
Today , tough new anti-piracy legislation takes effect which targets illicit file - sharers in a particularly aggressive way .
The scheme , hatched by the country ’s Ministry of Culture , Sports and Tourism , gives authorities the power to disconnect pirates for up to 6 months .
However , 3 Strikes for file - sharers is just a small part of the issue .
Although the government insists the rules are targeted at large scale infringers , thanks to a lack of clear boundaries in the legislation – which simply refers to “ copyrighted content ” – South Korea has extended the 3 Strikes concept to pretty much everyone adding content to the Internet .
According to SKC , the operator of social networking site Cyworld and web portal Nate , any South Korean running a blog or a social networking page will have to be very careful indeed .
In recent days the company has been alerting its users to the new law , notifying them that not only is the sharing of copyright songs , movies and TV shows illegal , but also the use of any copyrighted images or videos .
Any of these could earn the infringer a strike .
Any ‘ YouTube ’ - style homemade videos that contain copyrighted music in the background are also banned and will also get you a strike .
And song lyrics .
And excerpts from books .
We shall know shortly if the copyright industries behave responsibly with their new found power or if they choose to use it as a weapon of mass disconnection .
Either way , South Korea ’s enviable broadband position is hardly likely to benefit from the legislation .
Issue # 85 • January / February , 2004
“ I want you to do an article on how to shoot a handgun accurately , ” Dave Duffy told me .
“ Make it 2,500 or 3,000 words . ”
Long ago , I would have answered , “ Sure , and while I ’m at it , how about a history of the world in , oh , 10,000 words or so ? ”
Nancy Crenshaw uses strong stance and technique to make up for lack of size as she turns in an excellent one - handed high speed performance with SIG 9 mm .
Today , with more than 45 years of handgunning behind me ( yeah , I ’m old , but I started early , too ) I realize that you actually can cover this topic in a fairly short article .
The reason is found in the classic statement of Ray Chapman , the first world champion of the combat pistol .
“ Shooting well is simple , ” Ray said , “ it just is n’t easy . ”
I ’ll buy that .
It ’s true that the handgun is the most difficult of firearms to shoot well .
There ’s less to hang on to .
There ’s a shorter radius between the front and rear sight than with a rifle , meaning a greater unnoticed human error factor in aiming .
You do n’t have that third locking point on the shoulder that you have with a long gun ’s butt stock .
And few handguns have the inherent mechanical accuracy of a good rifle .
That said , though , you can get the most of your handgun ’s intrinsic accuracy by simply performing marksmanship basics correctly .
If the gun is aimed at the target , and the trigger is pressed and the shot released without moving the gun , then the bullet will strike the mark .
That simple .
We need a few building blocks to construct this perfect shot , however .
Let ’s build the structure brick by brick .
This student demonstrates a strong Weaver stance at an LFI class .
Feet are in proper pyramidal base , upper body is forward , and he is firmly grasping his .40 caliber Walther P99 .
I teach my students a five - point “ pre-flight check list ” to go through before they fire the shot .
As with any structure , you start from the bottom up .
Those points are : 1 ) Strong stance .
2 ) High hand grasp .
3 ) Hard grip .
4 ) Front sight .
5 ) Smooth rearward roll of the trigger .
The “ power stance ”
I ’ve found that stance is the one thing I ’m likely to have to correct first , even when teaching the experienced shooter .
The edgeways stance of the duelist is necessary for skateboarding or surfing , but counter - productive to good shooting .
If one heel is behind the other , the body does not have good lateral balance and will tend to sway sideways .
( The miss will most commonly go toward the strong hand side . )
If the feet are squared off parallel , in the old “ police academy position ” so often seen on TV , the body does not have good front to back balance , and the shots will tend to miss either high or low , most commonly the latter .
You want to be in a fighter ’s stance , a boxer ’s stance , what a karate practitioner would call a “ front stance . ”
The lower body needs a pyramidal base , a triangle with depth .
If you are right handed and firing with your strong hand only , the pelvis wants to be at about a 45 degree angle vis -à - vis the target , with your left leg to the rear .
If you are shooting two - handed and are right hand dominant , the hips still want that 45 - degree angle but the left leg should now be forward and the right leg back .
Now you ’re balanced forward and balanced back , balanced left and balanced right .
It ’ll be easier to hold the gun on target .
In rapid fire , the shoulders want to be forward .
This will get body weight in behind the gun and help control recoil .
For very precise slow fire , some shooters like to cantilever the shoulders to the rear .
This may make the gun seem to hang steadier with less effort , but it will cause the gun to jump up sharply upon recoil .
This not only slows down your rate of sustained fire , but subconsciously , the more the muzzle jumped at the last shot , the more likely you are to jerk the trigger on the next one .
Personally , I use the power stance with the shoulders at least slightly forward even in slow fire .
Master shooters have a phrase that helps them remember this principle more easily : “ Nose over toes . ”
High hand grip , thumb curled down for strength , index finger at distal joint on trigger for maximum leverage .
This is the grasp author used to win IDPA NH State Championship in 2003 with this stock service revolver , S&W ’s .45 caliber Model 625 .
High hand grasp
With a double action revolver , you want the web of your hand all the way up to the rear edge of the backstrap , as shown in the accompanying photos .
With a single action frontier - style revolver with the plow - handle shape grip , you still want a high hand grasp .
On a semiautomatic pistol , you want the web of the hand so high that a ripple of flesh is seen to bunch up behind the backstrap of the grip at the top edge , where the grip safety would be on a 1911 style pistol .
The higher the hand , the lower the bore axis .
This means much better control of muzzle jump and less movement of the pistol upon recoil .
Since most handguns , particularly semiautomatics , are designed to be shot this way , it means that you will find it easier to press the trigger straight back as you make each shot .
If your hand is too low on the “ handle , ” a straight rearward pressure on the trigger will tend to pull the muzzle down , placing the shot low .
With a proper high hand grip on an auto pistol such as this Wilson Custom CQB .45 , you ’ll see this “ ripple of flesh ” behind the grip tang .
A semi-auto is designed to operate as the slide moves against the abutment of a firmly held frame .
A low grasp allows the muzzle to whipsaw upward from recoil as the mechanism is automatically cycling , diverting momentum from the slide through the frame .
Now the slide can run out of momentum before it has completed its work .
This is why holding a pistol too low can cause it to jam .
All these problems are cured with the high hand grasp .
Hard grip
In the debate about shooting techniques in the saloon after all the guns have been locked away , this issue will take up about three rounds of drinks .
In the old days , the “ quail grip ” was taught .
“ Imagine yourself holding a live quail .
Hold it just firmly enough that it ca n’t fly away , but not firmly enough to hurt it . ”
We are n’t talking about birdies .
We ’re talking about guns .
Specifically , we are talking about powerful defensive handguns and hard - kicking Magnums and large calibers used for outdoor sports such as hunting .
The harder we hold them , the less they kick and jump .
The less they kick and jump , the more efficiently we can shoot them .
Traditional grasp of the .45 autoloader .
Thumb rests on manual safety , pad of index finger is in contact with trigger .
Author prefers this grasp : thumb curled down for more gripping strength , trigger finger inserted
to distal joint for more leverage .
This writer strongly recommends the “ crush grip . ”
How hard do you hold the handgun ?
As hard as you can .
It was once advised to intensify your grip until tremors set in , and then back off until they stopped .
In the real world , under stress , there ’s going to be some tremor anyway .
Get used to it now .
Hold the gun as tightly as you can and let it tremor .
The key is this : keep the sights straight in line .
If the sights are in line , and the hand is quivering , the sights will quiver in the center of the target .
When the shot breaks , the bullet will strike the center of the target .
Once it has been center - punched , the target will neither know nor care that the launcher was quivering before the projectile took flight .
Any marksmanship expert will tell you that consistency of grasp is a key to consistent accuracy .
As stress levels change during shooting , which is really a multi- tasking exercise that gives you a lot to think about , the consistency of grasp can change too .
If you think about it , there are only two ways to grasp the pistol with uniformity .
One is to hold it with virtually no pressure at all .
This will give you poor control of recoil .
The other is to hold it as hard as you can , for each shot and every shot .
The hard hold has some other benefits .
If you have accustomed yourself to always hold a pistol with maximum grip strength , you are much less likely to ever have it knocked or snatched from your hand .
Moreover , you now have the ultimate cure for a handgunner ’s malady known as “ milking . ”
“ Milking , ” taken from the hand ’s movement when milking a cow ’s udder , occurs when the index finger closes on the trigger and the other fingers sympathetically close with it , changing the grasp and pulling the sights off target .
Most commonly , this will pull the shot low and to the side of what you were aiming at .
It is a function called “ interlimb response . ”
When one finger closes , the other fingers want to close with it .
One reason author recommends a very firm grasp .
Imagine yourself holding a pistol , and grasp it thus with fingers relaxed …
… and notice that when you “ press the trigger , ” the other fingers close reflexively .
This is called “ milking , ” and is conducive to bad shots .
The cure …
… is to grasp firmly with everything but the trigger finger .
Now , when trigger finger is flexed …
… the other fingers ca n’t sympathetically close , because they ’re already closed as tight as they can get .
Do this simple exercise .
Relax your hand , and pretend to be holding a handgun .
Now , move the index finger as if rapidly firing a handgun with a heavy trigger pull .
You will see the other fingers reflexively contracting along with it .
You have just seen and experienced milking in action .
Now do the same , but this time with all but the index finger closed as tightly as you can hold them .
As you run the index finger , you ’ll feel the tendons trying to tighten the grasp of the other fingers , but you ’ll see that they actually can’t .
That ’s because the tight grip has already hyperflexed the fingers , and they ca n’t tighten any more .
The milking action has now been eliminated .
Thumb position is negotiable .
Generations of shooters with the GI 1911 .45 learned to shoot with the thumb high , resting on the manual safety .
Many competitive target shooters prefer to point the thumb straight at the target .
This straight thumb position seems to align the skeleto - muscular structure of the hand in a way that allows the index finger its straightest rearward movement .
With powerful guns , curling the thumb down to add grasping strength and enhance control is a valid technique .
A lot of it depends on how the gun fits your hand .
The controls may also be a factor .
With a conventional double action auto that has a safety catch mounted on the slide ( Beretta , S&W , and Ruger to name just a few ) , I like my thumb to be where it can not only push the lever into the “ fire ” position , but verify that the lever is in fact in the position it should be in .
Trigger finger contact ?
The old time marksmen liked the very tip of the finger , on the theory that it offered more sensitivity .
With a handgun that has a very light trigger pull , there may be some validity to that .
Still others use the pad of the finger , which is basically the point at which you find the whorl of the fingerprint .
Personally , I ’ve learned that contacting the trigger at the crease of the distal joint , the spot old time revolver masters called “ the power crease , ” gives me much more leverage and therefore more control .
This is particularly true on guns whose trigger pulls may be long and / or heavy : the double action handgun , the Glock , etc .
A lot of this will depend on hand size and shape in relation to gun size and shape .
There are many variables in the interface between human and machine .
Front sight
The conventional sight picture with conventional handgun sights is the one you see in the marksmanship manuals .
The front sight is centered in the notch of the rear sight .
The top of the front sight is level with the top of the rear sight , and there is an equal amount of light on either side .
Human vision being what it is , you ca n’t focus on the sights and the target at the same time .
Actually , you ca n’t focus on both the front and the rear sight at the same time , either .
Once the target has been identified as something you need to shoot , you no longer need your primary visual focus on it .
Primary focus now goes to the aiming indicator , the front sight .
Think of it as a fighter pilot would : “ enemy craft sighted , lock missiles on target . ”
The way we lock the handgun ’s missiles onto the target is by focusing on its front sight .
With a slide mounted safety as on S&W Model 457 compact .45 , shown , author prefers this grasp , with thumb at upward angle to guarantee release of safety catch .
Failing to properly focus on the front sight is a widespread problem among shooters .
Every good shooter with iron sights ( as opposed to red - dot optics or telescopic sights ) whom you know can probably remember when he or she experienced “ the epiphany of the front sight . ”
The realization , “ So that ’s what the coach meant when she said to watch the front sight ! ”
Watch the front sight hard .
Apply your primary visual focus there .
Look at it until you can see every little scratch in the machining on its surface .
If it has a dot on it , focus on it until the dot looks like a soccer ball .
Then you , too , will experience the epiphany of the front sight , and will see your shot groups tighten as if by magic .
Smoothly roll the trigger
Remember the prime directive : once the gun is aimed at the target , the trigger must be pulled in a way that does not pull the muzzle off target before the shot is fired .
This means that the trigger must come straight back .
You want a smooth , even , uninterrupted pull .
You can say to yourself , “ press the trigger . ”
You can say to yourself , “ sque - e - eze the trigger . ”
I say to myself , “ roll the trigger , ” because that connotes the smooth , consistent , uniform pressure I ’m trying to apply .
You do n’t want the shot to truly surprise you , of course , because that would be an unintentional discharge .
Rather , you want the exact instant of the shot to surprise you , so you do n’t anticipate it and convulsively jerk the shot off target .
Experts agree that the best way to get the trigger pull down , once you know what it ’s supposed to be , is to practice it .
Dry - fire , or “ clicking ” the empty gun , is the best practice .
The position of the sights when the gun goes “ click ” will tell you whether the shot would have been on target or not .
The more thousands of these repetitions you perform , the more the proper trigger pull will be hard - wired into your mind and body to the point where you can do it perfectly in an emergency without consciously thinking about the details .
Accuracy tends to degrade with speed .
Author fired the chest shots in hyperspeed mode , the eight shots in one hole in the neck at a more deliberate pace .
Pistol is SIG P220 .45 .
The best way to learn it is with what I dubbed the “ exemplar drill . ”
Find an accomplished pistol shooter to assist you .
Take a strong stance and firm grasp , and hold the gun on target .
Let your index finger barely touch the trigger , and let that finger go limp .
Ask the seasoned shooter to place his gun hand over yours , and his trigger finger over yours , and let his finger press yours straight back against the trigger .
After several repetitions , you ’ll be feeling what he feels when he makes the perfect shot .
This is the easiest way to learn what a good trigger pull feels like .
Now progress to the two of you pulling the trigger together at the same pace .
After some of that , you ’re ready for the third stage .
Now it ’s your finger pulling the trigger , his lightly touching yours to monitor its progress .
Once you ’ve got that down , let the coach sit back and watch as you “ fly solo , ” making corrections as necessary .
Some suggestions
Observe all rules of safe shooting and safe gun handling , of course .
Start with paper or cardboard targets in close , at three to seven yards .
If your shot is off the mark by three inches at 25 yards , it might have been just the natural limits of the gun ’s accuracy .
It might have been the ammo .
It might even have been the wind .
But if you ’re off by three inches at four yards , you ’ll know exactly what it is .
The closer you are , the easier it is to correct whatever caused the bad hit on the target .
Once you ’re hitting in tight groups at close range , move back incrementally .
As the distance increases , so does the challenge .
The world champion was right when he said it was simple , it just was n’t easy .
The “ not easy ” part is taken care of in repetition .
Fortunately , repetition means shooting , and shooting is fun .
Good luck .
Stay safe .
And enjoy .
Top 10 : Sports Movie Pep Talks
Everyone needs a boost from time to time .
It ’s precisely these boosts that give us the inspiration we need to get through a bad day at work or a tough time in our personal lives .
Hollywood has tapped into this human condition and made many films that give us those last - chance - at - greatness speeches we ’ve come to call sports movie pep talks .
Through cinema , we meet many great motivators — some real , others fictional — and when they implore athletes to dig a little deeper , they spur us to do the same .
Here are 10 great sports movie pep talks to bookmark and keep at your fingertips for whenever you ’re feeling a little low and need a pick - me - up .
In his commentary in today 's Financial Times about the economic policy of government stimulus of the economy , Robert Skidelsky , the noted British author and authority on John Maynard Keynes , declares : " What is fascinating is that it is an almost exact rerun of the debate between Keynes and the British Treasury in 1929 - 1930 . "
[ Thanks to Thefoucaultproject.co.uk for the image .
]
I have already posted about this earlier .
He is right , we are right back where we started .
In the 1930s Keynes argued against then - current classical economic theory , holding that government spending would put people back to work .
At the time , few economists dared to refute his pronouncements .
( One notable exception : Edward C. Harwood . ) But the classical school of economics was n't dead yet .
Spearheaded by Milton Friedman , it girded up its loins and made a comeback , using new geeky esoteric mathematical formulas that were effective in shooing the Keynesians .
Today , we see the latter group charging forth again to reclaim their territory .
This swinging back and forth says nothing good about economics as a science , and more particularly macroeconomics .
There have been no decisive victories in this field since its inception .
This is a scary thought when you think that economists are running the show right now .
This unscientific outcome is typical of a number of the social sciences .
As Skidelsky points out : " It is characteristic of the social sciences that their battles are interminable , temporary defeats being followed by the regrouping of the defeated forces for a renewed assault .
" I agree , with a nuance .
He seems to be saying that the social sciences are ... well , just different kinds of science .
He implies that the natural sciences are like a man : logical , Darwinian , forward - looking ; and that the social sciences are more like a woman : emotional , spiteful , revengeful .
I think an endeavor is either a science , or it is not .
Skidelsky errs in his designation as science the quixotic behavior of certain persons he calls " economists . "
They may be generally recognized as economists , but they are not scientists .
The debate then becomes :
Is the term " economic science " an oxymoron ?
This is a very good question , and perhaps THE fundamental question .
There are two possible answers .
1 . Either it is an oxymoron and economists should re-designate the field of inquiry as an art form ; or2 .
Economics can be a science , in which case the methodology has gone awry , given the " interminable , temporary defeats being followed by the regrouping of the defeated forces for a renewed assault " , i.e. no progress is being made , the pendulum is merely swinging back and forth .
In this case , optimists would hold that the methodology can be fixed .
In the early 1950s , a group of scientists formed a group called the Behavioral Research Council to study this very phenomenon in the social sciences .
To make a long story short , they premised their foundation upon the hypothesis that the social sciences did have the potential to be just that , i.e. real sciences in the true meaning of the word ; but that much gobbledygook must be lifted off the real science that did exist , in order for the various fields of endeavor to make any real progress .
They published two books : , by E.C. Harwood and Rollo Handy , based upon specific dialogue on methodology between two fellows named Dewey and Bentley ; and , edited by the above two gentlemen and authored by various social scientists whose work the group respected .
The first is still pertinent to our discussion , pointing out the very flaws in the methods of research in fields like economics , to which Skidelsky makes oblique reference .
Apparently , nothing has improved - - a scary thought when you think that our economic future depends upon the work of good - intentioned people like Bernanke and his ilk , who believe in policy research that is unscientific in the judgment of a good portion of their own fellow economists .
The second is out of date but still of interest , because it gives the status of each social science as of the last printing .
An update of this text would be useful someday .
I 'll conclude this post by stating that my observations of human nature , and specifically of those who would call themselves economic scientists and those who would call themselves political scientists , point toward the conclusion that we have a long , long way to go before they start thinking of us and of their science , and not of themselves .
Meantime , look what we have allowed them to do to us all .
PS : Keynes had the potential to be a true economic scientist , but I believe he was too enamored of his own glib persona to limit his mutterings to the truly useful , in the scientific sense of the word .
Lawrence H. White , on the other hand , is one of the modern economists who counters this new policy swing back to Keynesianism .
Read his latest piece over at Cato to learn a scientific economist 's analysis of the Great Depression of 2007 and why the Keynesian stimulus idea can't and wo n't work in the long run .

The animals are known to be strong and intelligent
Thirty chimpanzees have escaped from their enclosure at a zoo in Cheshire , forcing it to be closed .
The animals found their way into a nearby keepers ' area , where their food is usually prepared , at about 1240 BST , Chester Zoo said .
A spokeswoman for the zoo said the animals had been contained and the zoo was closed as a security measure .
How the animals came to leave their quarters is not known but they were not in an area accessed by the public .
Sarah Jones , from Chester , was among the visitors at the zoo when the animals left their enclosure .
" My two young boys had only just gone into the chimpanzee house when we heard terrifying loud noises , " she said .
I saw keepers running into the house and visitors were asked to head to other areas of the zoo
Sarah Jones
Chester Zoo visitor
" The chimpanzees were large animals and they seemed very upset about something , they were making a frightening noise , I thought something was wrong , so we made our way out of the building .
" I saw keepers running into the house and visitors were asked to head to other areas of the zoo .
" We ended up being stuck in the cafe area for quite a while . "
Chimpanzees are considered to be the most intelligent non-human primate .
They are mainly terrestrial , but do spend time in the trees .
A zoo spokeswoman described them as very strong animals but said there had been no injuries to any member of the public or to staff .
" The decision to evacuate the zoo was purely taken as a precautionary measure , " the zoo said in a statement .
" We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused to our visitors and would thank them for their full co-operation and patience . "

We have written this letter because , as Central and Eastern European ( CEE ) intellectuals and former policymakers , we care deeply about the future of the transatlantic relationship as well as the future quality of relations between the United States and the countries of our region .
We write in our personal capacity as individuals who are friends and allies of the United States as well as committed Europeans .
Our nations are deeply indebted to the United States .
Many of us know firsthand how important your support for our freedom and independence was during the dark Cold War years .
U.S. engagement and support was essential for the success of our democratic transitions after the Iron Curtain fell twenty years ago .
Without Washington 's vision and leadership , it is doubtful that we would be in NATO and even the EU today .
We have worked to reciprocate and make this relationship a two - way street .
We are Atlanticist voices within NATO and the EU .
Our nations have been engaged alongside the United States in the Balkans , Iraq , and today in Afghanistan .
While our contribution may at times seem modest compared to your own , it is significant when measured as a percentage of our population and GDP .
Having benefited from your support for liberal democracy and liberal values in the past , we have been among your strongest supporters when it comes to promoting democracy and human rights around the world .
Twenty years after the end of the Cold War , however , we see that Central and Eastern European countries are no longer at the heart of American foreign policy .
As the new Obama Administration sets its foreign - policy priorities , our region is one part of the world that Americans have largely stopped worrying about .
Indeed , at times we have the impression that U.S. policy was so successful that many American officials have now concluded that our region is fixed once and for all and that they could " check the box " and move on to other more pressing strategic issues .
Relations have been so close that many on both sides assume that the region 's transatlantic orientation , as well as its stability and prosperity , would last forever .
That view is premature .
All is not well either in our region or in the transatlantic relationship .
Central and Eastern Europe is at a political crossroads and today there is a growing sense of nervousness in the region .
The global economic crisis is impacting on our region and , as elsewhere , runs the risk that our societies will look inward and be less engaged with the outside world .
At the same time , storm clouds are starting to gather on the foreign policy horizon .
Like you , we await the results of the EU Commission 's investigation on the origins of the Russo - Georgian war .
But the political impact of that war on the region has already been felt .
Many countries were deeply disturbed to see the Atlantic alliance stand by as Russia violated the core principles of the Helsinki Final Act , the Charter of Paris , and the territorial integrity of a country that was a member of NATO 's Partnership for Peace and the Euroatlantic Partnership Council - all in the name of defending a sphere of influence on its borders .
Despite the efforts and significant contribution of the new members , NATO today seems weaker than when we joined .
In many of our countries it is perceived as less and less relevant - and we feel it .
Although we are full members , people question whether NATO would be willing and able to come to our defense in some future crises .
Europe 's dependence on Russian energy also creates concern about the cohesion of the Alliance .
President Obama 's remark at the recent NATO summit on the need to provide credible defense plans for all Alliance members was welcome , but not sufficient to allay fears about the Alliance´s defense readiness .
Our ability to continue to sustain public support at home for our contributions to Alliance missions abroad also depends on us being able to show that our own security concerns are being addressed in NATO and close cooperation with the United StatesWe must also recognize that America 's popularity and influence have fallen in many of our countries as well .
Public opinions polls , including the German Marshall Fund 's own Transatlantic
Trends survey , show that our region has not been immune to the wave of criticism and anti-Americanism that has swept Europe in recent years and which led to a collapse in sympathy and support for the United States during the Bush years .
Some leaders in the region have paid a political price for their support of the unpopular war in Iraq .
In the future they may be more careful in taking political risks to support the United States .
We believe that the onset of a new Administration has created a new opening to reverse this trend but it will take time and work on both sides to make up for what we have lost .
In many ways the EU has become the major factor and institution in our lives .
To many people it seems more relevant and important today than the link to the United States .
To some degree it is a logical outcome of the integration of Central and Eastern Europe into the EU .
Our leaders and officials spend much more time in EU meetings than in consultations with Washington , where they often struggle to attract attention or make our voices heard .
The region 's deeper integration in the EU is of course welcome and should not necessarily lead to a weakening of the transatlantic relationship .
The hope was that integration of Central and Eastern Europe into the EU would actually strengthen the strategic cooperation between Europe and America .
However , there is a danger that instead of being a pro-Atlantic voice in the EU , support for a more global partnership with Washington in the region might wane over time .
The region does not have the tradition of assuming a more global role .
Some items on the transatlantic agenda , such as climate change , do not resonate in the Central and Eastern European publics to the same extent as they do in Western Europe .
Leadership change is also coming in Central and Eastern Europe .
Next to those , there are fewer and fewer leaders who emerged from the revolutions of 1989 who experienced Washington 's key role in securing our democratic transition and anchoring our countries in NATO and EU .
A new generation of leaders is emerging who do not have these memories and follow a more " realistic " policy .
At the same time , the former Communist elites , whose insistence on political and economic power significantly contributed to the crises in many CEE countries , gradually disappear from the political scene .
The current political and economic turmoil and the fallout from the global economic crisis provide additional opportunities for the forces of nationalism , extremism , populism , and anti-Semitism across the continent but also in some our countries .
This means that the United States is likely to lose many of its traditional interlocutors in the region .
The new elites replacing them may not share the idealism - or have the same relationship to the United States - as the generation who led the democratic transition .
They may be more calculating in their support of the United States as well as more parochial in their world view .
And in Washington a similar transition is taking place as many of the leaders and personalities we have worked with and relied on are also leaving politics .
And then there is the issue of how to deal with Russia .
Our hopes that relations with Russia would improve and that Moscow would finally fully accept our complete sovereignty and independence after joining NATO and the EU have not been fulfilled .
Instead , Russia is back as a revisionist power pursuing a 19th - century agenda with 21st - century tactics and methods .
At a global level , Russia has become , on most issues , a status - quo power .
But at a regional level and vis -a - vis our nations , it increasingly acts as a revisionist one .
It challenges our claims to our own historical experiences .
It asserts a privileged position in determining our security choices .
It uses overt and covert means of economic warfare , ranging from energy blockades and politically motivated investments to bribery and media manipulation in order to advance its interests and to challenge the transatlantic orientation of Central and Eastern Europe .
We welcome the " reset " of the American - Russian relations .
As the countries living closest to Russia , obviously nobody has a greater interest in the development of the democracy in Russia and better relations between Moscow and the West than we do .
But there is also nervousness in our capitals .
We want to ensure that too narrow an understanding of Western interests does not lead to the wrong concessions to Russia .
Today the concern is , for example , that the United States and the major European powers might embrace the Medvedev plan for a " Concert of Powers " to replace the continent 's existing , value - based security structure .
The danger is that Russia 's creeping intimidation and influence - peddling in the region could over time lead to a de facto neutralization of the region .
There are differing views within the region when it comes to Moscow 's new policies .
But there is a shared view that the full engagement of the United States is needed .
Many in the region are looking with hope to the Obama Administration to restore the Atlantic relationship as a moral compass for their domestic as well as foreign policies .
A strong commitment to common liberal democratic values is essential to our countries .
We know from our own historical experience the difference between when the United States stood up for its liberal democratic values and when it did not .
Our region suffered when the United States succumbed to " realism " at Yalta .
And it benefited when the United States used its power to fight for principle .
That was critical during the Cold War and in opening the doors of NATO .
Had a " realist " view prevailed in the early 1990s , we would not be in NATO today and the idea of a Europe whole , free , and at peace would be a distant dream .
We understand the heavy demands on your Administration and on U.S. foreign policy .
It is not our intent to add to the list of problems you face .
Rather , we want to help by being strong Atlanticist allies in a U.S. - European partnership that is a powerful force for good around the world .
But we are not certain where our region will be in five or ten years time given the domestic and foreign policy uncertainties we face .
We need to take the right steps now to ensure the strong relationship between the United States and Central and Eastern Europe over the past twenty years will endure .
We believe this is a time both the United States and Europe need to reinvest in the transatlantic relationship .
We also believe this is a time when the United States and Central and Eastern Europe must reconnect around a new and forward - looking agenda .
While recognizing what has been achieved in the twenty years since the fall of the Iron Curtain , it is time to set a new agenda for close cooperation for the next twenty years across the Atlantic .
Therefore , we propose the following steps : First , we are convinced that America needs Europe and that Europe needs the United States as much today as in the past .
The United States should reaffirm its vocation as a European power and make clear that it plans to stay fully engaged on the continent even while it faces the pressing challenges in Afghanistan and Pakistan , the wider Middle East , and Asia .
For our part we must work at home in our own countries and in Europe more generally to convince our leaders and societies to adopt a more global perspective and be prepared to shoulder more responsibility in partnership with the United States .
Second , we need a renaissance of NATO as the most important security link between the United States and Europe .
It is the only credible hard power security guarantee we have .
NATO must reconfirm its core function of collective defense even while we adapt to the new threats of the 21st century .
A key factor in our ability to participate in NATO 's expeditionary missions overseas is the belief that we are secure at home .
We must therefore correct some self - inflicted wounds from the past .
It was a mistake not to commence with proper Article 5 defense planning for new members after NATO was enlarged .
NATO needs to make the Alliance 's commitments credible and provide strategic reassurance to all members .
This should include contingency planning , prepositioning of forces , equipment , and supplies for reinforcement in our region in case of crisis as originally envisioned in the NATO - Russia Founding Act .
We should also re-think the working of the NATO - Russia Council and return to the practice where NATO member countries enter into dialogue with Moscow with a coordinated position .
When it comes to Russia , our experience has been that a more determined and principled policy toward Moscow will not only strengthen the West 's security but will ultimately lead Moscow to follow a more cooperative policy as well .
Furthermore , the more secure we feel inside NATO , the easier it will also be for our countries to reach out to engage Moscow on issues of common interest .
That is the dual track approach we need and which should be reflected in the new NATO strategic concept .
Third , the thorniest issue may well be America 's planned missile - defense installations .
Here too , there are different views in the region , including among our publics which are divided .
Regardless of the military merits of this scheme and what Washington eventually decides to do , the issue has nevertheless also become -- at least in some countries -- a symbol of America 's credibility and commitment to the region .
How it is handled could have a significant impact on their future transatlantic orientation .
The small number of missiles involved cannot be a threat to Russia 's strategic capabilities , and the Kremlin knows this .
We should decide the future of the program as allies and based on the strategic plusses and minuses of the different technical and political configurations .
The Alliance should not allow the issue to be determined by unfounded Russian opposition .
Abandoning the program entirely or involving Russia too deeply in it without consulting Poland or the Czech Republic can undermine the credibility of the United States across the whole region .
Fourth , we know that NATO alone is not enough .
We also want and need more Europe and a better and more strategic U.S. - EU relationship as well .
Increasingly our foreign policies are carried out through the European Union - and we support that .
We also want a common European foreign and defense policy that is open to close cooperation with the United States .
We are the advocates of such a line in the EU .
But we need the United States to rethink its attitude toward the EU and engage it much more seriously as a strategic partner .
We need to bring NATO and the EU closer together and make them work in tandem .
We need common NATO and EU strategies not only toward Russia but on a range of other new strategic challenges .
Fifth is energy security .
The threat to energy supplies can exert an immediate influence on our nations ' political sovereignty also as allies contributing to common decisions in NATO .
That is why it must also become a transatlantic priority .
Although most of the responsibility for energy security lies within the realm of the EU , the United States also has a role to play .
Absent American support , the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline would never have been built .
Energy security must become an integral part of U.S. - European strategic cooperation .
Central and Eastern European countries should lobby harder ( and with more unity ) inside Europe for diversification of the energy mix , suppliers , and transit routes , as well as for tough legal scrutiny of Russia 's abuse of its monopoly and cartel - like power inside the EU .
But American political support on this will play a crucial role .
Similarly , the United States can play an important role in solidifying further its support for the Nabucco pipeline , particularly in using its security relationship with the main transit country , Turkey , as well as the North - South interconnector of Central Europe and LNG terminals in our region .
Sixth , we must not neglect the human factor .
Our next generations need to get to know each other , too .
We have to cherish and protect the multitude of educational , professional , and other networks and friendships that underpin our friendship and alliance .
The U.S. visa regime remains an obstacle in this regard .
It is absurd that Poland and Romania -- arguably the two biggest and most pro-American states in the CEE region , which are making substantial contributions in Iraq and Afghanistan -- have not yet been brought into the visa waiver program .
It is incomprehensible that a critic like the French anti-globalization activist Jose Bove does not require a visa for the United States but former Solidarity activist and Nobel Peace prizewinner Lech Walesa does .
This issue will be resolved only if it is made a political priority by the President of the United States .
The steps we made together since 1989 are not minor in history .
The common successes are the proper foundation for the transatlantic renaissance we need today .
This is why we believe that we should also consider the creation of a Legacy Fellowship for young leaders .
Twenty years have passed since the revolutions of 1989 .
That is a whole generation .
We need a new generation to renew the transatlantic partnership .
A new program should be launched to identify those young leaders on both sides of the Atlantic who can carry forward the transatlantic project we have spent the last two decades building in Central and Eastern Europe .
In conclusion , the onset of a new Administration in the United States has raised great hopes in our countries for a transatlantic renewal .
It is an opportunity we dare not miss .
We , the authors of this letter , know firsthand how important the relationship with the United States has been .
In the 1990s , a large part of getting Europe right was about getting Central and Eastern Europe right .
The engagement of the United States was critical to locking in peace and stability from the Baltics to the Black Sea .
Today the goal must be to keep Central and Eastern Europe right as a stable , activist , and Atlanticist part of our broader community .
That is the key to our success in bringing about the renaissance in the Alliance the Obama Administration has committed itself to work for and which we support .
That will require both sides recommitting to and investing in this relationship .
But if we do it right , the pay off down the road can be very real .
By taking the right steps now , we can put it on new and solid footing for the future .
Stars are the meat and potatoes of astronomy and cosmology .
Everything we know about the universe depends on a remarkably intimate and hard - won knowledge of how they shine , age and die .
They have defined the night for generations , and provided our ancestors with the first hints of a regularity in nature that has haunted scientists and thinkers for thousands of years .
Yet stars rarely occupy the main ring in popular expositions of the cosmos these days .
Black holes , the infinitely dense corpses of some stars , drowning all light and matter , are more dramatic .
Planets , especially those around distant stars , are more alluring to the imagination .
Cosmologists seem to spend more time worrying about the origins of galaxies , the galumphing clouds in which stars live .
Now , however , to rebalance the cosmos , so to speak , comes “ Journey to the Stars , ” a new show in the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History .
Narrated by Whoopi Goldberg , it is dedicated to elucidating the nature of those pinpricks in the heavenly vault and what they mean to us .
“ Journey ” is easily the most beautiful planetarium show I have ever seen and the most vertiginous .
The filmmakers have an entire 3 - D universe in their supercomputer , and they are n’t afraid to use it to swoop us outward through the stars falling past us faster and faster like snowflakes past the windshield in a storm , flipping us over and diving back and forth through the Milky Way past gnarled ribbons of nebulae .
Half an hour after the show ended , my head was still spinning , and it was n’t from the Secrets of the Cosmos cosmopolitans with dry-ice cubes the museum was serving to its supporters on the terrace that night .
US military aircraft have started delivering aid to Taiwan
International aid , including US military helicopters , has started to arrive in Taiwan , more than a week after Typhoon Morakot hit the island .
Rescuers are still trying to reach hundreds of survivors trapped in remote areas cut off by landslides .
More than 500 people are believed to have been killed in the deadliest typhoon to hit Taiwan in 50 years .
The government has been criticised for being slow in responding to the typhoon and in asking for assistance .
Officials have confirmed that 126 people were killed in the storm , but President Ma Ying - jeou has said the figure could exceed 500 .
Hundreds of the victims are believed to be buried in one village , Hsiaolin , which was almost completely covered in a mudslide triggered by several days of extremely heavy rainfall .
About 40,000 Taiwanese troops are now searching for survivors in remote areas in the south of Taiwan .
On Sunday , Transport Minister Mao Chih - kuo said more than 1,600 people needed to be airlifted from 44 badly - damaged villages .
Heavy US helicopters and transport planes have arrived to help deliver aid and to lift digging equipment into cut - off villages to start clearing roads .
A team from the European Union has also arrived to assess how the EU can help .
On Tuesday , two US Black Hawk helicopters will arrive to search for survivors in the forested mountains who may not yet have been found .
China has also offered military aircraft , but Taiwan has declined the offer .
The two neighbours separated at the end of a civil war in 1949 and no peace treaty has been signed .
Allowing Chinese military planes to enter Taiwan would be a highly sensitive matter , says the BBC's Cindy Sui in the island 's capital , Taipei .
The next task is to ensure that people who do not need to be evacuated and people who need to move back in can survive in areas with damaged houses , washed - out roads , no running water or electricity and sanitation problems due to dead bodies and animal carcasses , our correspondent says .

In 2007 , Iran produced a pseudo - documentary called “ In the Name of Democracy , ” which served as a vehicle to highlight what it called confessions of three academic researchers charged with trying to overthrow the state .
“ They do n’t like new ideas to get to Iran , ” said a researcher once investigated about his work , who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal .
“ They do n’t like social and cultural figures in Iranian society to become very popular . ”
In 2001 , Ali Afshari was arrested for his work as a student leader .
He said he was held in solitary confinement for 335 days and resisted confessing for the first two months .
But after two mock executions and a five - day stretch where his interrogators would not let him sleep , he said he eventually caved in .
“ They tortured me , some beatings , sleep deprivation , insults , psychological torture , standing me for several hours in front of a wall , keeping me in solitary confinement for one year , ” Mr. Afshari said in an interview from his home in Washington .
“ They eventually broke my resistance . ”
The problem , he said , was that he was not sure what he was supposed to confess to .
So over the next several months , he said , he and his interrogators “ negotiated ” what he would say  and , more ominously , whom he would implicate .
Once his confession was complete , he said , he practiced it for 7 to 10 days , and then it ran on state - run television .
Three years later , Mr. Memarian , the journalist and blogger , was arrested in another security sweep .
He said that his interrogator at first sought to humiliate him by forcing him to discuss details of his sex life , and that when he hesitated , the interrogator would grab his hair and smash his head against the wall .
He said the interrogator asked him about prominent politicians he had interviewed , asked if they ever had affairs , and asked if he had ever slept with their wives .
“ I was crying , I begged him , please do not ask me this , ” said Mr. Memarian , who is in exile now in the United States .
“ They said if you do n’t talk now you will talk in a month , in two months , in a year .
If you do n’t talk now , you will talk .
You will just stay here . ”
The pressure was agonizing , he said , as he was forced to live in a small cell for 35 days with a light burning all the time and only three trips to the bathroom allowed every 24 hours .
He was forced to shower in front of a camera , he said .
At one point the interrogators threatened to break his fingers .

Sex is one of life ’s pleasures and it is practiced by most people at least once in their lifetime .
This list takes a look at some more unusual sex facts and sex related topics .
Feel free to add your own interesting facts to the comments .
10 Weightloss
Fascinating Fact : Sexual acts lead to weight loss
The average human loses 26 calories when kissing for a minute .
Furthermore , vigorous sex for half an hour burns 150 calories ( you can lose three pounds in a year – if you have sex 7 to 8 times a month ) .
Kissing is also very good for your teeth : the extra saliva released during the act helps to keep the mouth clean – reducing the risk of decay .
9 Pubic Wigs
Fascinating Fact :
In Victorian times , whores wore pubic wigs
The pubic wig ( merkin ) has been around since the 1400s when it was originally worn by women who had shaved their pubic hair off to prevent lice .
In the Victorian times it was frequently worn by prostitutes who wanted to conceal the fact that they had diseases like syphilis ( Honest – we are n’t merkin ’ this up ) .
They are also used in the film industry to conceal actors genitals in nude scenes .
8 Condoms
Fascinating Fact : Condoms were originally made of animal intestines or linen
In Asia before the fifteenth century , some use of glans condoms ( devices covering only the head of the penis ) is recorded .
In China , glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper , or of lamb intestines .
In Japan , they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn ( ouch ) .
In the 16th century , condoms were often made with linen sheaths soaked in a chemical solution and allowed to dry before use .
The cloths were sized to cover the glans of the penis , and were held on with a ribbon .
Pictured above is an animal intestine condom from the early 1900s .
7 Not Tonight Josephine
Fascinating Fact :
Sex cures headaches
Next time your significant other refuses your advances by claiming to have a headache , remember this fact : the sex act can help to cure a headache .
Sex causes the body to release endorphins which naturally reduce the pain of a headache .
6 Skin Care
Fascinating Fact : Sperm is good for the skin
The proteins in sperm have a tightening effect on the skin .
When sperm is left to dry , the evaporation of the water in it leaves behind protein which can help to reduce wrinkles .
While this may be an excellent anti-aging treatment , the obvious downside is that you have to walk around with sperm on your face .
5 Pubic Hair
Fascinating Fact : Pubic hair is programmed to grow a certain amount
All hair on the body is controlled by a “ growth program ” which determines the growth duration ( and consequently the length ) of hair .
Pubic hair has a shorter growth duration ( on average just a few months ) compared to hair on the head .
This is what stops pubic hair growing to unmanageable lengths .
4 Blowsy Gal
Fascinating Fact :
The term “ blow job ” comes from the Victorian times
In Victorian times , a slang term for a prostitute was “ blowsy ” .
At the same time , “ blow ” was slang for ejaculation .
Consequently , by the 1930s , the act of fellatio came to be known as a blow job .
It was also used to describe jet planes in World War Two .
In Ancient Greece , the common slang for a blow job was “ playing the flute ” .
3 Male Porn
Fascinating Fact :
Men looking at male porn produce more sperm
Studies have shown that men who looked at porn of two men and one woman produced more sperm than those who looked at just women .
Scientists speculate that seeing competition makes men step up their baby - making capacities .
2 Sex For Fun
Fascinating Fact : Humans are n’t the only creatures to have sex for fun .
Humans are n’t the only members of the animal kingdom that have sex just for fun .
Dolphins and Bonobo chimps have also been observed engaging in sexual activity , when they are not in their natural reproductive cycles .
With the exception of a pair of Cohan gorillas observed doing so , bonobos are the only non-human animal to have been observed engaging in all of the following sexual activities : face - to - face genital sex , tongue kissing , and oral sex .
When Bonobos come upon a new food source or feeding ground , the increased excitement will usually lead to communal sexual activity , presumably decreasing tension and allowing for peaceful feeding .
Interestingly , Bonobo chimps also play and experience joy like humans .
1 Animal Prostitution
Fascinating Fact :
Some female penguins engage in prostitution
Believe it or not , in the wild , certain female penguins ( even when in a committed relationship ) will exchange sexual favors with strange males for the pebbles they need to build their nests .
According to Dr Fiona Hunter ( a zoologist ) : “ It tends to be females targeting single males , otherwise the partner female would beat the intruder up . ”
On some occasions the prostitute penguins trick the males .
They carry out the elaborate courtship ritual , which usually leads to mating .
Having bagged their stone , they would then run off .

As the recession lingers , some Phoenix - area residents are shifting attention from their financial troubles , including falling home values and shrinking retirement savings , to stockpiling food and ammo .
They worry the economic turmoil could lead to skyrocketing inflation , food scarcity , even violence .
To prepare , they are forming social - networking groups to discuss how to store grains , purify water , plant gardens and , if needed , shoot guns .
" Most of us feel that if things do get better , it will be a long way out , " said Jeff Rodriguez , a 26 - year - old software engineer from Glendale .
" I want to have some preparations in place . "
The economy has him thinking a lot more about things like where his food comes from , how much cheap oil is left in the world and how people in the blazing - hot Valley would survive a major economic failure .
He has carefully prepared a 12 - row , 384 - square - foot garden , stores a ton and a half of grain in his home , and is considering buying pygmy goats or chickens .
He also has researched solar electricity and a rainwater - collection system .
He is far from alone .
Rodriguez belongs to a local network of like - minded people who include retirees , young mothers and successful professionals .
These people are joining thousands nationwide who are studying survival tactics far from the backwoods bunkers associated with " survivalists . "
At least two survival - related groups have formed in Phoenix since December , and groups with varying outlooks and politics have sprouted nationally from Kentucky to New York .
Of course , it 's not unheard of for mainstream groups to prepare for emergencies .
The Mormon Church , which reports 13.5 million members worldwide , has long counseled self - sufficiency and encourages families to keep a prudent supply of food on hand .
Disasters such as hurricanes and 9/11 , and even perceived troubles like the Y2 K bug , always increase interest in survivalism .
The men behind the counters at U.S. Surplus Corp. in Phoenix see a crush of new customers every time tragedy strikes .
The newbies stand out from the military personnel and outdoor enthusiasts who stop in for rugged clothing , rations or canteens .
" They are the ones trying to fix up a cave to live in , " store manager Gary Pickering said .
" They are asking a lot of questions and buying things they normally would n't , like water - purification tablets . "
Sales at the store have n't slid with the rest of the economy , officials said .
Preparing for a disaster makes sense only if people actually know how to use the equipment they are buying , said Cody Lundin , who runs a survival - skills school in Prescott and authored two books on the subject .
He says people should learn to care for themselves in case of emergency whether a disaster is pending or the economy is tanking .
Last year was among the best ever for his school , although it 's not always clear what motivates people to sign up .
" I 'm seeing an influx of people simply calling to inquire what I think about stuff , " Lundin said .
" They are probing the waters because they are getting freaked out . "
Professional counselor Rita Archambault said her East Valley clinic is treating more people with anxiety over the economy .
" I have not seen so much concern about the economy in my entire life , " she said .
If planting a garden , raising poultry or stockpiling ammunition makes people feel better about their situation , good for them , she said .
" If you are not hurting anybody and you are reducing your anxiety , what harm is there ? "
Archambault said .
The only danger is if people get so obsessed that they neglect their job or family , she said .
It 's not surprising that many of the people preparing for tough times are educated professionals , said Heidi Wayment , a social - psychology professor at Northern Arizona University who has researched disasters and anxiety .
" To understand the huge potential crisis that could come from economic collapse , you have to be educated , " Wayment said .
" I would n't say these people are crazy - far from it . "
The people who are newly interested in survival skills recognize their eccentricity .
" I 'm cognizant that what I 'm doing is not normal , " said Rodriguez , adding that his roommate thinks the food stockpile and garden are cool .
On a recent Friday evening , he and a few of the nearly 100 survivalism group members gathered at a Scottsdale bar .
Amid the pumping dance music , they discussed the jobless rate , harvesting rainwater and protecting their property from looters .
" It would be fair to say most have at least some interest in firearms , " Rodriguez said .
That 's not to say the members glorify violence .
" I would n't even know what to do with a gun ! " exclaimed MaryLou Benigno , 68 .
Benigno , a retired teacher , has been gardening for years , but the economy has brought more urgency to her hobby .
She lectures the group on how to keep a worm - bed of compost under the kitchen sink from stinking up the house and the best places to buy seeds .
Benigno has been shopping for a cheap foreclosure home with land for a garden , which she hopes to share with friends .
" I do n't want to be corny and say something like , ' Getting back to nature , ' but if you develop a site properly , you could grow on every inch of the place , " she said .
Lynn Smith , a Scottsdale commodities trader , spoke of his plans to head to Iowa for the summer , where his family owns a sprawling piece of land .
" It would be kind of hard to get by in the desert , " he said .
Smith , 53 , sold his home shortly after the real - estate peak in 2006 when he feared a market collapse and , despite a substantial income , now lives in an RV .
He can work remotely , so he 'll spend the summer in the Midwest exploring how to grow food and may come back to Scottsdale next year , " depending what happens . "
Smith pulled out aerial photographs of the Iowa property .
" It 's all flat , and I could see someone coming from any direction except this one patch of trees , " he said .
The group nodded in agreement .
Church Reported to State for Gay Exorcism Video Connecticut mentoring group says teen tormented over being gay .
June 25 , 2009  --
The exorcism caught on video showed the Connecticut teen writhing on the floor as adults hovered above him ordering the demons to be cast out .
The boy 's supposed sin ?
Being gay .
Except the teen is n't convinced that being gay is wrong , according to a Connecticut nonprofit group for gay and lesbian youth that has mentored him for about a year .
Robin McHaelen , executive director of the Manchester - Conn. , True Colors , said she was horrified when she saw the video , reputedly shot in March and posted on YouTube by the leaders of the Manifested Glory Ministries .
The video , which has since been pulled from YouTube but can be seen on multiple Internet sites and newscasts , shows the teen flopping violently on the floor , even vomiting at one point .
McHaelen said she was mandated by law to report the exorcism to the state Department of Children and Families , which she said is now investigating .
" What I saw looked abusive .
This child vomited , passed out and looked like he was being abused , " she said .
" I do n't get to choose whether to report or not . "
A spokesman for the department , citing privacy laws , told ABCNews.com he could not comment on whether or not they were investigating .
" I was really freaked out because it seemed so violent , " she said of her first reaction .
In the video , which is about 20 minutes long in it 's entirety , a male adult can be seen imploring the demons to be cast out .
" You homosexual spirit , we call you out right now , " the man said .
" You have no power . "
At another point he commands , " Come on you homosexual demon .
We want a clean spirit .
Get out of the way ! "
McHaelen said the video shows a man and a woman alternately performing the ritual .
She believes they are Kelvin and Patricia McKinney , the husband and wife team who run the church out of a nondescript building in Bridgeport .
On the ministry 's Web site , Kelvin McKinney is listed as the church 's overseer .
His wife is alternately listed as an apostle , prophet or prophetess .
While Kelvin McKinney declined to comment on the video or his church when contacted by ABCNews.com , Patricia McKinney told ABC affiliate WABC , " I have gay friends that I grew up with . "
" As for me being a pastor , I live by the word of God , " she said .
" I do n't hate them .
We love them .
We just do n't agree with their lifestyle . "
' They Think They 're Doing the Right Thing '
McHaelen said she saw the video before she recognized the boy as someone she knew .
Once his True Colors mentor confirmed with the teen that it was him in the video , the boy told his mentor that he had requested the exorcism , something Patricia McKinney confirmed to WABC .
" This kid has been struggling with this issue for a very long time , " McHaelen said .
" He knows that he 's gay and he knows that his religion does n't approve . "
McHaelen said the teen , who will be 17 in November and lives in the Bridgeport area , agonizingly switches back and forth between being proud to be gay and wanting to rid himself of what his religion sees as a sin .
The month after the video was shot , she said , he attended an event known as the Queer Prom , co-sponsored by True Colors .
McHaelen said she does n't want to vilify Manifested Glory Ministries for the exorcism because the boy went to them .
" They were doing what they thought was in this kid 's best interest , " she said .
The church 's
Web site does n't not list a denomination .
Watching the ritual , she said , made her sad .
" They think they 're doing the right thing , but what they 're really doing is murdering this kid's soul , " she said .
Finding a Healthy Sexual Reality
McHaelen said she 's known the boy for about a year .
He has very little family support and attends two different churches , Manifested Glory Ministries and another church that is tolerant of his sexual orientation .
McHaelen said it 's not uncommon for gay and lesbian teens to flip - flop between accepting and denouncing their sexual orientation .
" They worry that it 's a choice , " she said .
But that kind of torment , she said , often leads to destructive behavior like kids acting out and having unsafe sex thinking they are going to get AIDS and die anyway , and then seeking out extreme religious intervention when they feel guilty later .
" Neither one of those things are about a healthy sexuality reality , " she said , adding that their counselors tell the teens that if they are n't comfortable yet with themselves that they do n't need to be sexually active with anyone .
" I do n't care who you love , I just want you to love them well , " McHaelen said of what she tells her teens .
While exorcisms are commonly thought to be the stuff of horror movies and Third World rituals , McHaelen said she knows of five other Connecticut teens who underwent gay exorcisms at a variety of churches in the last three years .
The Rev. Thomas Scirghi , an associate professor of liturgical theory at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley , Calif. , said that while exorcisms are an authentic institution for the Catholic Church , such a ritual would " certainly not " be performed on a teenager simply because of his sexual orientation .
While true exorcisms are rare , they are still done when a person is believed to be possessed by an evil spirit .
" You would only use this as a last resort , " Scirghi said .
Miss Mitch and Lucky Lindsey wonder ( or maybe just
make us wonder ) :
Are there straight male Republicans ?
" [ Filmmaker Kirby ]
Dick argues that the political closet has grown more oppressive in recent years , largely thanks to the Republican Party 's fervent embrace of anti-gay policies , which has sent lesbian and gay conservatives scurrying for cover . "

Dick argues , in fact , that the political closet has grown more oppressive in recent years , largely thanks to the Republican Party 's fervent embrace of anti-gay policies , which has sent lesbian and gay conservatives scurrying for cover .
He agrees that politicians , whether gay or straight , out or closeted , are entitled to some degree of personal privacy .
A politician who is cheating on his wife with a man is not inherently more newsworthy than one cheating with a woman .
But a politician who is voting for a rabidly anti-gay agenda while seeking out anonymous gay sex partners in bathrooms , in his view , is a dangerous hypocrite and very likely a disordered personality .
In voting against his own natural interests , that politician is directly damaging gays and lesbians , and depriving the entire country of an honest debate about policies and attitudes on homosexuality .
Note on the need for quotation marks around " journalist " as applied to practitioners on the Far Right :
Blinded by the Right
#
I 'm always impressed as well as grateful when someone can make sense for me of apparently irreconcilable phenomena .
Often once the connection has been made it seems obvious , even blindingly so , but that does n't make me any less grateful for the help in making the connection .
It happened again when I read Howie 's Thursday night post , " Conservative Gay Lawmakers Rejecting a Degrading Life in the Closet " ( referring , alas , not to American conservatives but to British Conservatives ) , and followed the two Salon.com links he provided in the last paragraph .
Not that Howie does n't always provide us with valuable links , but these two struck me as especially valuable .
There was , first , the interview with writer James Hannaham , conducted during the book tour for his first novel , God Says No , about salaciously sinful life in the deep closet of the hard - core Christian Deep South .
And then there was the one Howie described as " an even more direct must - read , " indie - film columnist Andrew O'Hehir 's " Behind Washington 's closed door , " about ( and including an interview with ) Outrage filmmaker Kirby Dick .
Is there anyone within shouting distance who has n't been serially confounded , even dumbfoundewd , by the ever - growing number of homophobic closet cases crawling , or more often being smoked , out of the woodwork of the leadership of America 's Far Right and Republican Party ( functionally the same things these days ) ?
As Howie has been noting , in places like South Carolina , it 's enough to make a person wonder if there arestraight male Republicans .
Well , Dick and O'Hehir have an answer , and again , obvious as it seems once it's been laid out , it 's a connection I did n't make .
I'm also grateful to Howie for trying to pin down the meaning , or rather , of being " in the closet , " which are a whole lot more various than most of us tend to assume .
And here I need to backtrack a bit .
It should go without saying that Howie has always been more ' in the know " than I have -- and for us " always " dates back to about 1961 .
But going back just a number of years ( do n't ask me how many years ; at a certain age your sense of time goes all out of whacks , and things that happened maybe 30 years ago feel like " a few years ago , " while more recent events could have taken place anywhere between two and 20 years ago ) , it used to drive me crazy when Howie would write or tell me that " everybody knew " so - and - so ( fill in the name of a closeted public figure ) was gay when I sure did n't .
I did n't know much about much of anybody who was gay .
Liberace , OK , but J. Edgar Hoover ?
( Bad example , perhaps -- in so many ways . )
The real eye - opener for me , and I can still hardly recommend the book highly enough , was Mike Signorile 's Sex , the Media , and the Closets of Power , which has what were for me fog - lifting treatments of three related but quite different power closets in American life : in the New York - centric media , the D.C. - centric federal government , and the Hollywood - centric entertainment industry .
It was from Signorile that I came to understand the phenomenon of " everybody knows " - type closets .
Within their worlds , he explains , everybodyknow , and the filthy preverts are free to practice their vile preversions --. " Keep the faith , " as it were , meaning the faith of rigid social orthodoxy , and they will never be outed .
And for many gays , especially of the older generations , the deal worked fine , because they were so thoroughly filled withhomophobia -- another subject about which I learned worlds from Mike Signorile -- that by and large they believed as strongly as their oppressors that their homosexuality is a disgusting , degrading preversion , for which theyfeel the deepest shame .
This is theof all those screamingly hateful voices we grow up with .
And it 's thehomopobia , Signorile helped me to understand , that has kept so many gay folk imprisoned in their closets .
To which , by the way , James Hannaham adds a fabulous insight in the Salon.com interview : that for many of the afflicted , .
And so it has been that in those " closets of power " the homophobic enforcers and their internalized - homophobic closet - case victims coexisted in mutually assured harmony .
Which does n't mean that there were n't still more deeply closeted gays in the ranks of the Right , and in particular Far Right .
Adding Hannaham 's insight we can see that far from being stymied by the shamefulness of it , the shamefulness added to the thrill of the hunt .
It may be that not even the homo - hating homos really understood how far from alone they were , and are .
My favorite example came from David Brock 's invaluable memoir Blinded by the Right , in which he recalled his dual " coming out " : his awakening from his former existence as a hard - core -- the hardest of the hard -- Far Right - wing attack " journalist " ( see note below * on the use of quotation marks around " journalist " ) and the outing of what he thought was the darkest and terriblest of all possible dark and terrible secrets : that he 's gay .
In this case , clearly , by " being gay " we mean not the " everybody knows " kind , but the " I 'll die if anybody finds out " kind .
Which does n't mean , by the way , that Brock 's secret was necessarily totally , impenetrably secret .
Remember , since he was reasonably discreet about his preversion and publicly preached the full gospel of the Wacko Homo - Hating Right , he would in any case have been protected by the Don't Tell , Do n't Complain compact .
Inevitably , though , there came a time -- by amazing coincidence thethat Brock was finding himself slipping out of the Wacko Right belief set he had so long sworn by ( and made such a handsome living by ) -- when he was made aware that his secret not only was n't secret but was about to be made very public .
He 's vivid in his description of his terror .
Outing meant certain ostracism by all the good Far Right folk who had been his community , his mainstay and nurturers .
The revelation that he was this secret monster would mean the end of everything .
That 's not quite what happened , though , when he walked the plank and outed himself .
He found all those hideous creeps he had expected to scorn him ( Well , I mean , have you seen pictures of the guy back then ?
The phrase " to die for " leaps to mind . )
Now if someone as deeply entrenched in the bosom of the virulently , violently homophobic Far Right had no clue , it 's hardly likely that the rest of us should be clued in .
And while we still need a proper psychological understanding of the kinship between self - hating homosexuality and far - right - wing politics ( the affinity can't be accidental , can it ? ) , the above - noted insight provided by Andrew O'Hehir in collaboration withfilmmaker Kirby Dick does , I think , explain why , at a time when so many LGBT people , now able to accept the naturalness of our various sexual attractions ( bye - bye , internatlized homophobia ! ) , have left the closet behind , on the oppressive Far Right the closet - builders can barely keep up with the demand for new , even more heavily fortified models .
As I said , it sounds ridiculously simple once you 've heard it , but then , so did the whole concept of gravity once the famous apple - plunking opened Sir Isaac Newton 's eyes :
As I 've written numerous times , the single most important revelation inis David Brock 's discovery that what right - wing " journalists " practice has nothing to do with actual journalism , that he and his colleagues approached every story with all elements predetermined by their rigid ideological gridwork .
" Reporting " then consisted of finding stuff with which to embellish this invented " truth " : facts if possible , but factoids would be just as good , and ditto hearsay , lies , and on - the - spot totally made - up stuff .

David Redmond is no doubt still rueing the day he decided to flee the pressures of work for a few hours to enjoy a boozy lunch .
The former Morgan Stanley trader was banned from the City by the Financial Services Authority yesterday for his post - prandial actions : a two - hour trading frenzy that saw him run up an unauthorised £ 10 m bet on the oil markets .
Mr Redmond , who has already been fired from his job , " showed a lack of honesty and integrity " by trying to conceal his drunken trades and failing to admit to his bosses what he had done , the FSA said .
On the day in question , in February last year , Mr Redmond returned to work at about 4.45 pm after a three - and - a - half hour lunchbreak .
He then spent more than two hours building a position in oil futures – placing a trade , on average , every 7.5 seconds – which exposed Morgan Stanley to a potential loss of $ 10 m , significantly above his trading limits .
Aware that his bets were unauthorised , Mr Redmond , now 28 , transferred some of the trades to an unknowing colleague 's account before going home .
He returned to work the following day to close out the positions – ironically making a small profit in the process .

It was only when managers at Morgan Stanley challenged his behaviour that Mr Redmond admitted what he had done , though even then he did not confess to the attempts he had made to conceal his trading .
He was suspended and subsequently dismissed by the bank for gross misconduct .
The FSA ruled that Mr Redmond should not work in the City for at least two years , though it accepted he had acted out of character and he was trading with Morgan Stanley 's money , rather than on clients ' accounts .
" He drank alcohol over lunch and it appears this affected his behaviour on his return to the office , although he was not visibly drunk , " the regulator said in its report .
" Mr Redmond 's instinctive reaction to hide his position , to seek to trade out of it himself and not to report it or seek assistance shows a serious lack of judgement . "

The news this morning that Pret a Manger have removed tuna sandwiches from their shelves in light of the unsustainably intense fishing pressure wild tuna stocks are now under , is the one story I found heartening today .
And it comes hot on the heels of the campaign to get stricken bluefin tuna off the menu at celebrity canteen Nobu .
As a former marine and fisheries biologist , one of the principal reasons that I moved into more mainstream environmental communications and campaigning was the frustration of being utterly ignored .
It has been painfully obvious for decades that we 're destroying our oceanic wealth , yet politicians do n't seem to listen to the simple , brutal truth that if we do n't stop catching all the fish … there wo n't be any fish left .
Charles Clover 's new film , The End of the Line , based on his excellent but downright alarming book of the same name , is also seeking to engage a broader public audience on what is happening beneath the surface of our seas with their tacit support .
We are taking a wonderful , bountiful and phenomenally productive natural resource and systematically hunting it to extinction , leaving the oceans poorer and depriving humanity of a vital source of protein , potentially forever .
Aliens spinning past our blue planet would note that seven - tenths of it is ocean , and 90 % of that is more than a kilometre deep .
Yet even in these dark , abyssal depths we are relentlessly pursuing slow - growing , deep water species to meet the burgeoning global appetite for fish .
Imagine if we practiced the same sort of hunting on land , using satellite tracking , sonic scanning devices to find and hunt down the very last cows roaming our countryside and then used a massive machine gun to kill them , along with everything else in the vicinity as a sort of terrestrial " bycatch " .
Before moving on to hunt down the last sheep , and then pigs once the cows had run out or they were too hard to find .
Crazy as it sounds this is more or less what happens in our seas .
Part of the problem is the heroic romance coupled with the invisibility of the fishing industry .
We still hold notions of brave men in small boats , battling the elements to return with a natural harvest .
While this is true for small , inshore fishermen , it 's the huge industrial - scale , ocean factory trawlers that are really raping the seas with trawl nets big enough for 13 jumbo jets to fly into .
But all this goes on out of sight and out of mind offshore , with most consumers experience of fish being limited to a skinned fillet in a plastic supermarket tray .
The value of the UK fishing industry also seems relatively and almost pitifully small , with a total annual catch value of only £ 600 m .
Are we really prepared to destroy our wild fish stocks for such meagre returns ?
The growth in Marine Stewardship Council accredited fisheries in the UK and globally is a source for some optimism , and public support for marine protected areas ( 83 % think this is a good idea ) that allow fish and shellfish populations to recover will also help .
These may not necessarily be enough for the tuna however , and the bluefin in particular is a spectacular and wonderful species .
A hot - blooded fish that can reach half - a - ton and 4 m in length ( though few get to this size these days ) , these incredible beasts were once abundant .
But the allowable catch quotas have usually been around double what the science recommends .
As a result the populations are so low collapse is almost inevitable .
A moratorium is needed to bring these amazing fish back from the brink - and not just so they can end up as sushi .
An American man was charged with giving Al - Qaeda information about the New York transit system and attacking a U.S. military base in Afghanistan .
Â
Since his arrest , he has helped the U.S. in a secret fight against terror on both a domestic and international level .
The federal court unsealed papers that identified Bryant Neal Vinas as the defendant .
Â
He is a native of Long Island and in January , plead guilty in a sealed Brooklyn courtroom .
Federal prosecutors refused to give out information about the case but said that Vinas had provided critical information that led to a security alert about the subway system last year .
The FBI had received a report that Al - Qaeda terrorists may have considered attacking the system during the holidays .
Â
The origin of that report was Vinas .
Â Vinas was also held responsible for a rocket attack on U.S. forces in Afghanistan in September 2008 .
Â
Vinas was arrested in Peshawar , Pakistan , in November .
Â
He had reportedly been in Pakistan for five months where he had received “ military - style - training ” from Al - Qaeda .
Thankfully in instances such as this , America has hard working individuals that keep America safe .
Â
Individuals interested in protecting America from threats , attacks , and reducing America ’s vulnerability should start working on a degree today .
Â
There are degrees out there that provide students with the knowledge and skills required to work in this exciting and dangerous field of Homeland Security .
I 'm getting lots of emails telling me to move on .
I will .
But I want to explain why I think the Palin drama is actually important .
It 's not because of her : she 's a delusional , narcissistic and disturbed person who would be voted off a reality show in the first rounds .
It 's because of John McCain , the Republican establishment and the mainstream media .
What happened last fall was a warning sign to all of us about how corrupt and cynical the GOP , McCain and the MSM are .
They colluded in such a way that this unstable , erratic , know - nothing beauty queen could actually have been president of the United States .
What matters is that all those in on this scam be exposed and their way of conducting themselves be reformed until they stop risking the fate of the country and the world on their own vanities and cowardice .
McCain knew full well that Palin was unqualified to be commander - in - chief at this period of time ; and he knew there was no way she could ever learn enough to do the job .
So his decision to pick her was pure cynicism and irresponsibility .
The MSM knew full well that there were very serious questions about this unknown person 's background , lies , mental stability , and secrecy - but they were so terrified of being called biased they refused to do the proper vetting .
We 've been wondering when we'd see the next Laptop Hunters ad from Microsoft , but it looks like the company 's throwing a change - up : its latest 30 - second spot features Wes Moss , Certified Financial Planner , explaining that iTunes " costs a lot " while Zune Pass " costs a little . "
The argument , of course , is that at a buck a song ( or more ) , filling up your iPod costs way more than the $ 15 / month cost of the Zune subscription service , but we 've got a feeling that Wes just wo n't convince as many people as Lauren and Giampaulo -- while we certainly think Zune Pass is a great deal , especially with the 10 free tracks a month now included , most people have plenty of music from all kinds of sources already , and an additional monthly bill in the current economy does n't seem all too appealing .
Plus , well , this argument has never really worked for services like Yahoo and Rhapsody in the past , so we 're not sure it 's going to work now .
But that 's just us -- we 're sure you 've got your own opinions , so check out the vid after the break and sound off .
P.S. If Wes looks familiar it's because he was a contestant on Donald Trump 's The Apprentice .
He was fired .

Feminist crusader group Equality
Now ’s latest moralist histrionics take the form of a strongly worded letter to the UN accusing Japan of being rape heaven , and demanding a ban on hentai and other forms of pornography “ harmful to women . ”
The letter tells the UN ’s feminist arm CEDAW , the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women , to tell Japan in no uncertain terms that it is a bad country which is oppressing women , and there are a number of laws it must enact in order to appease American feminists .
Here is the summary of their rather lengthy screed , which can be read in full here ( PDF version ) :
Japan is a nation which accepts hentai .
This encourages rape so hentai must be banned .
Japan is nation where courts let rapists go free with a slap on the wrist .
Sentences must be increased .
Japanese judges violate the rights of women by taking into account whether they resisted their “ rape . ”
Women should not have to resist sex to be able to call it rape .
Evil misogynists have waged a “ hate mail ” campaign against us .
We were sent some AV which we thought was child porn involving “ girl - children ” , but Japanese police experts on pubic hair told us it was n’t , so they must all be misogynists .
Rapelay was withdrawn from sale , the EOCS banned all fetishes , and some companies have banned foreigners from their websites .
This is not enough .
The Japanese government must ban everything we object to and make it all illegal .
The UN must tell the Japanese to do as we direct .
It is no wonder this group has attracted “ unprecedented ” criticism for its unremitting attacks on freedom of speech .
You can convey your thoughts on their wanton attacks on visual culture on their website .
Perhaps being bombarded with criticism in the same way they bombard politicians in other countries with unsolicited mail is a new experience for them , hence their displeasure .
Dr. Weindruch said the study data offered “ very encouraging ” signs that resveratrol could duplicate in people some of the effects of caloric restriction .
Critics , however , are not yet ready to accept that the rhesus study proves caloric restriction works in primates .
If caloric restriction can delay aging , then there should have been significantly fewer deaths in the dieting group of monkeys than in the normally fed comparison group .
But this is not the case .
Though a smaller number of dieting monkeys have died , the difference is not statistically significant , the Wisconsin team reports .
The Wisconsin researchers say that some of the monkey deaths were not related to age and can properly be excluded .
Some monkeys died under the anesthesia given while taking blood samples .
Some died from gastric bloat , a disease that can strike at any age , others from endometriosis .
When the deaths judged not due to aging are excluded , the dieting monkeys lived significantly longer .
Some biologists think it is reasonable to exclude these deaths , but others do not .
Steven Austad , an expert on aging at the University of Texas Health Science Center , said some deaths could have been due to caloric restriction , even if they did not seem to be related to aging .
“ Ultimately the results seem pretty inconclusive at this point , ” Dr. Austad said .
“ I do n’t know why they did n’t wait longer to publish . ”
Leonard Guarente , a biologist who studies aging at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , also had reservations about the findings .
“ The survival data needs to be fleshed out a little bit more before we can say that caloric restriction extends life in primates , ” Dr. Guarente said .
In mouse studies , people just count the number of dead animals without asking which deaths might be unrelated to aging , he said .
The second rhesus monkey study , being conducted by the National Institute on Aging , is not as advanced as the Wisconsin study .
The researchers have not yet reported on the number of deaths in the dieting and normal monkey groups .
But there are signs that the immune system is holding up better in the dieting group , said Julie Mattison , the leader of the institute ’s study .
Few attempts at rewriting the rules of business have been met with as much hostility as the latest theory touted by Chris Anderson , editor of the technology magazine Wired .
His latest book , Free : the Future of a Radical Price , expounds a philosophy of “ freeconomics ” – businesses in a vast range of industries , he argues , should emulate the giant giveaway of the internet .
Bold , perhaps , but also spectacularly badly timed .
And the response has reflected that .
The Economist , for one , has roundly criticised Free .
“ The lesson of the two internet bubbles , ” it intoned , “ is that somebody , somewhere , is going to have to pick up the tab for lunch . ”
What is really puzzling is that the backlash against Anderson ’s ideas has taken this long to happen .
The response to his first book , The Long Tail , an analysis of online businesses which sell a wide variety of items in very small quantities , compared Anderson to Copernicus , no less , and its title became a buzz - phrase for the new media and marketing classes .
But eventually his theory wilted in the face of empirical evidence .
Both books contain a grain of truth ; however , in each case it is buried beneath a pile of dramatic , improbable extrapolations .
Anderson correctly notes that digital technology has lowered the cost of production ( and reproduction ) of digital goods , the cost of transactions , and the cost of ­acquiring customers .
However , the giveaways his freeconomy depends on require someone else to pick up the tab , and in the current economic climate , with profits evaporating and jobs being shed , there is little enthusiasm for altruism or wild punts .
In addition , media owners and executives have turned viscerally on the notion of giving away their key products .
Rupert Murdoch , who could be heard lauding Web 2.0 a couple of years ago , now echoes the fairly common view that aggregators such as Google are parasitic .
Understanding how such flimsy ideas became so popular in the first place involves looking back to the infancy of the magazine that incubated them .
In 1992 , Louis Rossetto , an expatriate American living in Amsterdam , was getting exhausted .
For a fruitless two years , he had been pulling a blueprint from his backpack .
It was for a new magazine that would foretell dramatic changes in business and society as computers became networked – but nobody wanted to know .
However , his fortunes took a turn for the better when he met Nicholas Negroponte , the well - connected Boston socialite and academic .
Negroponte was seeking a publicity vehicle for his “ concept factory ” , a novel business proposition spun out from the venerable Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Negroponte ’s Media Lab did n’t trouble itself with boring engineering and scientific research – the empirical bedrock of technological innovation , which takes years to bear fruit .
The Lab was designed to coax corporate sponsorship with attention - grabbing ideas .
This was Hollywood with P T Barnum thrown in .
Few of the whimsical concepts from the Lab – furry alarm clocks that run away , “ ambient furniture ” – would ever be viable products , but they generated acres of newsprint .
And the press coverage drew in the sponsorship .
Negroponte sold the proposition that his whizz - kids knew the future , and if you , too , suspended disbelief , so could you .
A new business had been created .
Negroponte became Rossetto ’s first investor , and his flagship guru .
Wired magazine was born .
Wired married an admirable American can - do spirit to the techno - utopianism of earlier media prophets such as Alvin Toffler , a former associate editor of Forbes magazine who has been writing since the 1960s about technology ’s future and its impact .
But Wired also inherited Toffler ’s bossy , declamatory tone .
The future would n’t just be different , it would be unrecognisable ; history would be erased , and existing businesses must leap out of the way .
The necessity to preach “ rewriting the rules of business ” in every issue set Wired on the path to hubris .
The answer to the puzzle of Anderson ’s popularity lies in the roots of Wired itself – a mix of manifest destiny and opportunistic hucksterism .
Anderson is primarily an evangelist for a vision that dictates a specific shape and structure for the internet .
This may be premature .
And , coincidentally , it is a vision that directly benefits one company , Google , at the expense of the telecommunications and media industries .
Both of Anderson ’s theses were inspired by critiques of the internet that fatally undermine this vision .
Arguably , both amount to exercises in public relations rather than economics .
The Long Tail was a response to an essay by Clay Shirky , a prominent technology writer who also teaches at New York University .
Shirky ’s argument dampened much of the nascent utopianism about blogs , pointing out that the readership of early blogs followed what economists call a Pareto curve , or “ power curve ” : a small number of sites ( the “ head ” ) attracted a huge number of readers , but most ( the “ tail ” ) had few or none .
This jarred with the utopian notion of the internet as a new kind of democracy .
Why bother to participate if our fates were decided for us by a few block votes ?
So Anderson turned the notion upside down .
The blockbuster was over , he proclaimed , and , like a man possessed , he began to see long tails everywhere .
It was the Guardian that lauded this logic by comparing Anderson to Copernicus .
The implicit message was that the little people would win .
Many people were so keen to believe that Web 2.0 would make the world fairer that they rejected any evidence to the contrary .
It was only last year , with an exhaustive study of online music sales by the economist Will Page and an experienced digital retailer , Andrew Bud , that a more useful picture of digital markets begin to emerge .
Page and Bud found that most of the songs available for purchase had never been downloaded , and that the concentration of hits was more pronounced than ever before .
On the file - sharing networks , the same pattern emerged .
So , carrying a huge retail inventory , though cheaper than before , was of little or no value .
Now , with Free , Anderson has turned to the criticism that the internet destroyed the value of movies , newspapers and music .
Firms could , and now should , cross - subsidise this unprofitable activity , he argues .
But cross-subsidies are n’t new : they have been the subject of decades of observation by economists .
Nor are they a panacea .
Alan Patrick , co-founder of the Broadsight media and technology consultancy , points out that despite falling marginal costs , the idea of anything being “ free to produce ” is a myth ; the costs are hidden elsewhere in the system .
While at McKinsey , Patrick ran simulations of the “ free to produce ” business model and found that “ it results in wholesale value destruction with no accruing market benefit , unless you can build an extremely commanding lead and get the whole positive dynamic of increasing returns working for you .
But that ’s hard and rare . ”
Explaining the popularity of Wired - style theses should keep sociologists busy for years to come .
They will doubtless note the business culture ’s appetite for upbeat nostrums , and the media ’s desire for myth - making .
Business pays lip - service to genuine innovation these days , but , like the modern politician , it is keen to hear about the virtues of constant structural reorganisation , or how to adopt the ephemera of radical change .
A speaker who can supply this market with new buzzwords can command 20 times the income of an American magazine editor .
So one can hardly blame Anderson for trying his luck .
And the buzz - phrases would n’t have spread without frequent repetition by an uncritical media .
This could be evidence of a lack of confidence or expertise in explaining technical subjects – but it ’s the same cynical resort to novelty that Negroponte banked on when he backed Wired magazine .
Anderson ’s vision today looks curiously conservative and static , and is both deeply reductive and pessimistic about human nature .
We are happy to pay when we perceive value , even for the most unlikely products , such as bottled water .
The ideas at the heart of Free do little to explain that .
For the “ little people to win ” , we need to draw on our human capacity for organisation and inventiveness , and engage in real , not virtual , politics .
Fittingly , and not surprisingly , Free has had a critical mauling .
So , perhaps the Wired era is over , departing like a snake - oil salesman at a medicine show who – having poisoned the town – ca n’t leave quickly enough .

If you were wondering what happened to that Jersey City kitten that was rescued Saturday afternoon from drowning in a sewer catch basin , it is resting comfortably at the West Side Avenue Animal Hospital .
Believe it or not , there is patient / hospital confidentiality at work here , but the estimated month - old feline is sore but basically in good health , according to Roselle Camaligan , manager of the animal hospital .
The kitten is also a male .
" Our sore kitten is in the custody of the city Board of Health , and he is getting medical attention and resting comfortably , " Camaligan said .
" Right now , he is enjoying the air conditioning . "
Andy Krochalk , of the Liberty Humane Society , said it will be a while before the " John Doe " kitten is put up for adoption .
A cat needs to be at least 2 months old and weigh 2 pounds before it can be spayed or neutered .
" We sometimes wait until they are 2 1 / 2 to 3 pounds to be on the safe side before any surgery , " said Krochalk .
" Until then , the cat is in foster care . "
When it is ready for adoption , there is a seven - day waiting period to allow an owner to come forward before it can go to a new home , according to Animal Control Officer Emanuel Machado .
The kitten almost did not make it to the animal hospital , according to its rescuer , Animal Control Officer Richard Lorenzi , who heard the cat 's protest while standing on the corner at West Side and Communipaw avenues .
As members of the police Emergency Services Unit lifted the sewer basin grating , Lorenzi dropped down into the dark , wet confines and plucked the kitten out of the water as the little furry head went under the surface .
" There were so many people around the intersection asking if they could have the cat , " he said .
It is not unusual to find kittens on the street this time of the year .
" There is a kitten season , from spring to the fall , " explained Amy Geduldig of the ASPCA national organization in New York City .
" It is the warm months when female cats go into heat .
It is also when shelters around the country are busiest with cats . "
Gail Buchwald , senior vice president of the ASPCA adoption center points out that the number of cats on the street is a result of human irresponsibility .
" Those feral cats are a result of pets being released or because ' intact ' cats , those pets which are not spayed or neutered , are left to roam outside the home , " said Buchwald .
" Breeding season is triggered by cycles of longer daylight .
Cats will roam for longer periods .
A male cat will disappear for a longer time , sometimes days .
They can smell a female cat a mile away . "
She said the biggest threat to cats during this period are not catch basins but cars .
Those who are interested in adopting the " John Doe " cat in Jersey City may want to consider that it may be harder for a new kitten to acclimate itself with an owner if it has had no previous human contact for 14 days , according to Buchwald .
Each week that passes it becomes progressively more difficult to bond .
There are still those who say they have beat the odds and still have managed to have a furry companion .
Car dealers from Ohio and around the country descended on Capitol Hill this morning to lobby against widespread dealership closures resulting from the Chrysler and General Motors ' bankruptcies .
Local auto dealer Alan Spitzer , who is losing several Chrysler and GM franchises , said dealership closures throughout Ohio will cost more than 8,500 jobs .
" It does n't take a Harvard MBA to figure out that if McDonald 's wants to sell more hamburgers , they do n't close their restaurants , " Michelle Primm of Cascade Auto Group in Cuyahoga Falls told a Capitol Hill press conference .
Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton said 47 Chrysler dealerships and 79 GM dealerships in Ohio would be shuttered .
" This is about jobs and it's about fairness , " Sutton said at the press conference .
The dealers want legislation to restore franchise agreements that were canceled by auto makers or killed during their bankruptcy proceedings .
Passage would let them bargain with manufacturers to stay open , or negotiate closure terms under franchise laws in their states .
The ailing auto makers say the dealer closures will reduce their corporate support costs and make their remaining vendors more profitable .
" The reorganization under the guidance of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court necessitated that tough , painful business decisions be made , including reducing the number of manufacturing facilities , employees and dealers , " said a statement from Chrysler .
" These decisions were not taken lightly , nor were they made irrationally .
The opinion of the Court that approved Chrysler 's motion to reject certain dealer agreements affirmed the necessity of reducing the size of the company 's dealer network and the rationale used to determine what dealer contracts were rejected . "
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote later this week on a spending bill that includes an amendment by Bainbridge GOP Rep .
Steve LaTourette to restore the dealer franchises .
A majority of House of Representatives members have cosponsored legislation to accomplish that goal , and LaTourette says he 's seeking Senate backers for the measure .
Even if his bill does n't become law , LaTourette says he'd be happy if his effort prods auto makers to settle with aggrieved dealers .
" These people should come to the table and they should fix the wrong that was done , " LaTourette said .
Small scale industrial manufacturing - this is a hot topic .
The guys who are already doing fabbing ( printing of objects ) are into lots of good research , both at an " at home " level , as well as at academia , like the MIT researching this area .
This are thoughts floating in my mind right at the moment .
And than THIS came up :
The M - 1iA from FANUC robotics is a small - scale assembly robot , with a weight of only 17 kg .
It is therefore perfect for doing automated assembly at home , or on mobile situations like exhibitions , travel or even more futuristic scenes .
Self - assembly of robots for example is just one interesting field to explore or robotic mobility concepts .
Okay people - time to move on and explore new plateaus , instead of doing one robot after another that does anything .

The Democrats : Fake Party of Compassion
Last week , we examined the Republican Party ’s claims to be the party of small government , personal responsibility , free markets , and strict constitutionalism–and found it wanting .
But the same is true of the Democratic Party ’s claims to be the “ party of compassion ” or to have a special regard for the welfare of “ America ’s working families . ”
The Democratic Party , historically , has represented one faction of the corporate ruling elite .
As described by sociologist G. William Domhoff and historian Thomas Ferguson , its primary constituency is large - scale , capital - intensive , high - tech , and export - oriented business .
Far from being a “ constraint ” or “ countervailing power ” against Big Business , the twentieth century regulatory - welfare state was created primarily to serve corporate capital .
As Murray Rothbard put it , “ our corporate state uses the coercive taxing power either to accumulate corporate capital or to lower corporate costs . ”
Or in the equally apropos words of Roy Childs , “ liberal intellectuals ” have been “ the ‘ running dogs ’ of big businessmen . ”
That FDR was hardly the “ traitor to his class ” of official mythology is suggested by the role of General Electric CEO Gerard Swope in the New Deal economic agenda , and by the army of corporate lawyers and investment bankers in the Roosevelt “ brain trust . ”
Take , for example , the National Labor Relations ( or Wagner ) Act .
The sectors of the corporate economy that supported FDR were capital - intensive , with long planning horizons that required stability and predictability , and hence extremely vulnerable to disruption .
But labor costs were a modest part of the total cost structure of such capital - intensive industry .
So the leaders of heavy industry were willing to offer workers significantly improved wages and benefits , in return for coopting the leadership of the labor movement and creating a class of union bureaucrats that would stamp out wildcat strikes and enforce contracts against the rank and file .
If the Republicans were originally the party of protectionism , the Democrats were historically the party of what William Appleman Williams called “ Open Door Empire . ”
That policy led to the creation of a de facto corporate world government under the Bretton Woods institutions , after WWII , with the U.S. military as enforcer .
Open Door Empire was the basis for the system of global corporate - state collusion popularly ( and wrongly ) known today as “ free trade , ” and more accurately as neoliberalism .
The only thing it has in common with genuine free trade is the removal of tariff barriers .
But in its reliance on “ intellectual property ” and other statist measures , it is if anything more genuinely protectionist than anything the GOP was doing a century ago .
The National Security State and permanent war economy were created by good liberal Democrats : FDR and Truman .
The archipelago of military bases and garrisons around the world , and the grand tradition of CIA - engineered coups ( who was President when Diem and Sukarno were overthrown , I wonder ? ) , are very much a bipartisan creation .
Much of the legal framework for neoliberalism was constructed in Bill Clinton ’s watch ( y0u know , that “ peace and prosperity ” Carville is so partial to ) .
NAFTA , the Uruguay Round of GATT , the Digital Millennium Copyright Act–you ’d almost get the idea global corporate rule did n’t start with Bush .
And if that ’s not enough to get your head around , the Bush police state did n’t start with Bush , either .
Some of Bush ’s most objectional dictatorial powers resulted , not from the USA PATRIOT Act , but from “ counter - terror ” legislation passed under Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing .
A good example is the power to declare organizations “ terrorist ” by executive fiat and seize their assets without due process –thank Clinton for that .
And some of the worst stuff in USA PATRIOT was originally proposed –unsuccessfully –in the Clinton legislation .
That Chuck Schumer played a major role in crafting both pieces of legislation bears more than passing significance as well , I think .
Today , despite all the soccer mom rhetoric about “ working families , ” the leopard has n’t changed its spots .
The role of Robert Rubin ( he of Goldman - Sachs and Citigroup ) in Democratic policy circles should tell you as much .
Nancy Pelosi , whose family net worth is $ 18 million thanks to her marriage to an investment banker , is only the 17th richest member of Congress ; that should tell you something .
The Obama - Geithner TARP policy , despite some symbolic tinkering with executive compensation , is in its essentials a direct continuation of the Bush - Paulson version .
It ’s the ultimate in neo -Hamiltonianism , saddling taxpayers with interest - bearing debt in order to buy up the banks ’ bad assets and reinflate them to something approximating their pre-collapse face value , so that just maybe the banks will use some of the resulting liquidity to start lending money back to the public at interest .
The Democrats , if anything , are more in collusion with the Copyright Nazis of the RIAA , MPAA and Microsoft than are the Republicans–and that ’s saying a lot .

And he :
Infiltrated Olympia Port Militarization Resistance Sept 2007 through June 2009
( at meetings , and as an administrator of this listserv )
He also infiltrated NWAIDAC , also in person .
So we :
Removed him from an admin role over the Oly PMR listserv .
Set his email to " no delivery " for the Oly PMR list .
Investigated him for about a month to make sure the person we saw in meetings really lived at the address we had for him .
Got photo proof of his residency there .
Outed him at an Olympia City Council meeting on July 21 , 2009 .
He lives in Spanaway , WA with his spouse and kids .
We have the address .
He 's the registered owner of the address .
We 've photographed his vehicles at that address .
We 've photographed him on his motorcycle here in Olympia .

Although worlds apart , the way fish learn could be closer to humans ' way of thinking than previously believed , suggests a new research study .
A common species of fish which is found across Europe including the UK , called the nine - spined stickleback , could be the first animal shown to exhibit an important human social learning strategy .
The sticklebacks can compare the behaviour of other sticklebacks with their own experience and make choices that lead to better food supplies , according to the study by St Andrews and Durham universities .
The researchers suggest these fish might have an unusually sophisticated social learning capability not yet found in other animals , called a ' hill - climbing ' strategy .
This ability of picking the best quality food patch by comparing how successful others are at getting food from it against their personal experience has not been shown before in animals , say the scientists .
The team of researchers , which was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , suggests that in the case of the nine - spined stickleback it is likely to be a case of ' needs must ' as the anatomy of this particular species of fish does not offer significant protection from predators to forage alone safely .
They may have been ' forced ' to learn from others about where to feed while hiding from predators as they themselves cannot risk looking for food sites in the open .
The scientists say the findings , published in the academic journal Behavioral Ecology , show that the cognitive mechanisms underlying cumulative cultural evolution may be more prevalent in nonhuman animals than currently believed .
The findings show that big brains , like those in humans , are not necessarily needed as a pre-requisite for cumulative culture .
The researchers say the findings contribute to the understanding of brain evolution and the types of brain required for certain cognitive functions , both in humans and animals .
Lead author Dr Jeremy Kendal from Durham University 's Anthropology Department , and a Research Council UK Fellow , said : " Small fish may have small brains but they still have some surprising cognitive abilities .
" ' Hill - climbing ' strategies are widely seen in human society whereby advances in technology are down to people choosing the best technique through social learning and improving on it , resulting in cumulative culture .
" But our results suggest brain size is n't everything when it comes to the capacity for social learning . "
Around 270 fish were caught using dip nets from Melton Brook in Leicester , and housed in aquariums in a laboratory .
The fish were split into three experimental groups and one control group .
The fish in the experimental groups were given two different learning experiences and two preference tests in a tank with a feeder at each end .
First , they were free to explore the feeder at each end during a number of training trials , where one feeder supplied more worms than the other , called the rich feeder .
They were then tested to see which feeder they preferred .
In the second training trial , those fish that had learned a preference for the rich feeder observed other fish feeding but this time the rich and poor feeders were swapped round with the rich feeder either giving even more worms than the one the fish previously got their food from or giving roughly the same or less .
In the second test , the fish were again free to swim around and choose their feeder .
Around 75 per cent of fish were ' clever ' enough to know from watching the other fish that the rich feeder , previously experienced first hand themselves as the poor feeder , gave them the better pay off .
In comparison , significantly fewer fish preferred the feeder that appeared to be rich from watching others if they themselves had experience that the alternative feeder would give roughly the same or more food .
The team 's further studies have found that the likelihood of copying the behaviour of others increased with the rate at which the others fed .
Dr Kendal said : " Lots of animals observe more experienced peers and that way gain foraging skills , develop food preferences , and learn how to evade predators .
But it is not always a recipe for success to simply copy someone .
Animals are often better off being selective about when and who they copy .
" These fish are obviously not at all closely related to humans , yet they have this human ability to only copy when the pay off is better than their own .
You might expect this ability in animals who are closely related to humans .
In the case of the nine - spined stickleback , they have most likely adapted to their local ecology . "
Co-author Professor Kevin Laland from the School of Biology at St Andrews University added : " Nine - spined sticklebacks may be the geniuses of the fish world .
It 's remarkable that a form of learning found to be optimal in humans is exactly what these fish do . "

ARCHIVES | SEARCH New Set of Bait Files Posted by Mikko @ 12:32 GMT
Three weeks ago we posted a series of screenshots of bait document files used in targeted attacks .
These are files that have been used to infect specific individuals in different organizations in order to gain access to their computer .
All the documents shown below contained exploits that installed backdoors .
Targets of these attacks are not known .
Again , this was just a quick sampling ; we get a lot of these .
We 'll be blogging more tomorrow about a change in the hostnames used in these attacks .
P.S. Feel free to leave suggestions for translations of the non-English documents in the comments section .
A price war is about to hit the games industry – and for once it 's not good news for consumers .
Last month , Activision announced it would release its eagerly awaited shooter Modern Warfare 2 with an RRP of £ 55 – £ 15 more than most new console releases .
And there was more : the former boss of Sony Europe , Chris Deering , said publishers would soon consider pricing games at £ 70 to make a profit .
This seemed to embolden Activision 's chief executive , Bobby Kotick , who told reporters last week he would be willing to go higher than £ 55 , especially with " premium " editions of games .
One thing is clear : it now costs around $ 30 m ( £ 18 m ) to build a title for PS3 and Xbox 360 , 10 times more than the average PS2 development budget , but publishers are n't making 10 times more money .
Something 's got to give – and it looks like it 's going to be us , the gamers .
In some ways , we can't really complain ; cartridge titles on machines such as the N64 and Snes regularly retailed for £ 50 -£ 55 .
It 's only with the advent of cheap optical media that prices dropped .
And these days publishers have to provide significant post - sales support .
Retailers are worried , pointing out there 's a bit of a recession on , so perhaps raising prices is n't the best idea .
The tactic could lead to a horribly misshapen industry , in which a handful of " tent pole " titles are released every year – doubtless big sequels and entertainment franchise tie-ins .
Original projects will migrate to download services such as Xbox Live , creating a chasm between budget releases and the massive Triple A showcase releases .
There 's got to be a better solution .
The answer may be dynamic in - game ads , which have been employed in a number of Xbox 360 titles .
According to the market research outfit Emarketer , US companies are set to spend $ 170 m on in - game advertising by 2013 , which should help to offset those dev costs – although gamers are n't always pleased about the intrusion , and ads were recently removed from the PS3 title WipeOut HD as they doubled loading times .
Ultimately , publishers may just have to sit down , read Chris Anderson 's latest book , Free , and rethink how they deal with pricing .
Perhaps they should look at the mobile phone or pay - TV businesses , offering different tariffs for differing groups of customers ; a fixed low price for those who just want to bomb through the single - player missions and do n't mind a few ads popping up in the process ; and a higher price , or subscription charge for those who spend weeks playing online and downloading new weapons .
It 'll be complicated but at least it could mean not filling shelves with £ 70 copies of Michael Bay movie tie-ins .

And here is the July 2007 commentary by Goldman Sachs and Citadel when the two firms purchased a 19.9 % stake each in Direct Edge .
" Direct Edge has quickly become a major market center for U.S. equities by virtue of its innovative market model and competitive pricing schedule " said Greg Tusar , Managing Director , Goldman Sachs .
" Goldman Sachs is a fantastic addition to the Direct Edge partnership , " said Mathew Andresen , Co-Head of Citadel Derivatives Group .
" Volumes have grown significantly in recent weeks and we expect that trend to continue as Direct Edge becomes a more important liquidity destination for the marketplace . "

China is planning a vast increase in its use of wind and solar power over the next ­decade and believes it can match Europe by 2020 , producing a fifth of its energy needs from renewable sources , a senior Chinese official said yesterday .
Zhang Xiaoqiang , vice - chairman of China 's national development and reform commission , told the Guardian that Beijing would easily surpass current 2020 targets for the use of wind and solar power and was now contemplating targets that were more than three times higher .
In the current development plan , the goal for wind energy is 30 gigawatts .
Zhang said the new goal could be 100GW by 2020 .
" Similarly , by 2020 the total installed capacity for solar power will be at least three times that of the original target [ 3GW ] , " Zhang said in an interview in London .
China generates only 120 megawatts of its electricity from solar power , so the goal represents a 75 - fold expansion in just over a decade .
" We are now formulating a plan for development of renewable energy .
We can be sure we will exceed the 15 % target .
We will at least reach 18 % .
Personally I think we could reach the target of having renewables provide 20 % of total energy consumption . "
That matches the European goal , and would represent a direct challenge to Europe 's claims to world leadership in the field , despite China 's relative poverty .
Some experts have cast doubt on whether Britain will be able to reach 20 % .
On another front , China has the ambitious plan of installing 100 m energy - efficient lightbulbs this year alone .
Beijing seeks to achieve these goals by directing a significant share of China 's $ 590bn economic stimulus package to low - carbon investment .
Of that total , more than $ 30bn will be spent directly on environmental projects and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
But the indirect green share in the stimulus , in the form of investment in carbon - efficient transport and electricity transmission systems , would be far larger .
HSBC Global Research estimated the total green share could be over a third of the total package .
China also believes the price reforms that will take place in its economic recovery programme will lead to more efficient use of resources and an increased demand for renewable energy .
" Due to the impact of global financial crisis , people are all talking about green and sustainable development , " Zhang added .
" Enterprises and government at all levels are showing more enthusiasm for the development of solar for power generation , and the Chinese government is now considering rolling out more stimulus policies for the development of solar power . "
He said the government would also plough money into the expansion of solar heating systems .
He said the country was already a world leader , with 130 m square metres of solar heating arrays already installed , and was planning to invest more .
The US goal for solar heating by 2020 is 200 m square metres .
Zhang was speaking in London on a day China came under increased pressure from Washington to do more cut its emissions .
David Sandalow , the US assistant secretary of energy , said the continuation of business as usual in China would result in a 2.7C ( 4.9 F ) rise in temperatures even if every other country slashed greenhouse gas emissions by 80 % .
" China can and will need to do much more if the world is going to have any hope of containing climate change , " said Sandalow , who is in Beijing as part of a senior negotiating team aiming to find common ground ahead of the crucial Copenhagen summit at the end of this year .
" No effective deal will be possible without the US and China , which together account for almost half of the planet 's carbon emissions . "
Zhang said China was pursuing " a constructive and a positive role " in negotiations aimed at agreeing a deal in Copenhagen .
As part of that agreement , he said developing countries would have to pursue " a sustainable development path " , and said Beijing was open to the idea of limits on the carbon intensity of its economy ( the emissions per unit of output ) .
" We have taken note of some expert suggestions on carbon intensity with a view to have some quantified targets in this regard .
We are carrying out a serious study of those suggestions , " Zhang said .
Zhang told the all - party parliamentary China group in Westminster yesterday that Beijing 's stimulus package was already showing signs of re-energising the Chinese economy .
He said it grew by 6.1 % in the first quarter of this year , and growth in the second quarter would be stronger than the first .
He predicted that China would meet its target of 8 % growth this year .
• This article was amended on Thursday 11 June 2009 .
We confused the absolute with the incremental in reporting that a rise in temperature of 2.7C corresponds to an increase of 36.9 F .
It is 4.9 F .
This has been corrected .
Paul Larsen of Toronto makes some interesting cargo bikes in his spare time .
While Larsen 's Toronto - based business , Invodane , focuses on creative engineering solutions for large - scale industrial projects , he 's also been dabbling with making the cargo bikes that he grew up with in Denmark .
Since moving to Canada he has not seen such a large amount of interest as there is this year .
On a lazy Sunday I decided to go see Larsen 's collection of bikes .
[ img_assist|nid=3358|title=|desc=|link=node|align=center|width=500|height=375 ]
Larsen proudly showed off his collection that included his own creations and imported cargo bikes and trikes from Europe .
As I arrived he was just handing off the retrofitted cargo bike that a customer was just picking up for his two kids , which included two kid seats that are secured firmly to the cargo bay of the bike .
We then proceeded to try out his custom large flat bed cargo trike and followed up with a couple cargo trikes imported from Denmark and a Bullitt cargo bike , a very light , narrow and long two - wheeled cargo bike .
The easiest to maneouvre were the two - wheelers since the loads were quite low and I could easily lean into turns .
People seem to think that trikes are inherently stable since they have three wheels but they do n't seem to realize that most roads are sloped which means you are always fighting against the lean of the trike whether going straight or turning corners .
There has been some improvement with the fancier trikes made by companies such as Nihola , which have front wheels which swivel independently , much like those of a car .
[ img_assist|nid=3391|title=|desc=|link=node|align=center|width=500|height=375 ]
Unfortunately , Larsen is only producing cargo bikes as a hobby .
He 's doing this , I imagine , simply for the love of the bikes and making people happy because he is n't able to pay for his own labour .
That means he 's willing but do n't expect him to meet any deadlines .
It would take some work to make this a commercially - viable bike , unlike what other cargo bike makers are pumping out .
Larsen is still a good place to go if you want a custom configuration or if you want something creative .

CAPTURED JAPANESE RATIONS MAY BE EATEN
Captured Japanese rations — particularly certain types of canned foods which were familiar items in American grocery stores prior to the war — may furnish welcome variety to U.S. troops as auxiliary rations or for emergency use .
( This statement of course presupposes that the use of such captured foods has been approved by competent and proper authorities . )
Some enemy foods , such as canned crabmeat , salmon , tuna , mandarin orange sections , canned pineapple and other fruits , rice , tea , and sugar , are familiar to American tastes .
These items can easily be used provided that they are in good condition .
Certain other Japanese foods , including dried fish , edible seaweed , pickled radishes , and pre-cooked rice flour , are strange to most American tastes .
But , if rations are short , these items may be eaten and will supply nourishment .
The Japanese soldier in adequately supplied garrisons , eating perhaps twice as well as his family at home , does not live on rice alone , although this staple , supplemented with fish and a few vegetables , is his most important food .
The average Japanese family eats very little meat .
The daily diet revolves around the basic rice - fish - vegetable combination , and other foods are used principally for flavoring and seasoning , or as savories and relishes .
To this basic diet , the Japanese armed forces have added some meat , fruits , extra vegetables1 , and sweets .
But , as at home in Japan , these extras are used chiefly to flavor and vary the rice - and - fish staple , and do not provide a complete change of ration from day to day .
It is worth noting , too , that Japanese soldiers , even in rear echelons , do not have anything comparable to the American company or squadron mess ; each Japanese soldier prepares and cooks his own food , usually cooking enough at one time for a 24 - hour supply .
The following foods are included in Japanese field rations :
Canned meat — roast beef , corned beef , beef - and - vegetable mixture , pork - and - vegetable mixture .
Canned fish — salmon , tuna , sardines , bonito , mackerel .
( Also clams . )
Canned vegetables ( in the meat mixtures ) — beans , bean sprouts , peas , bamboo sprouts , spinach , water chestnuts .
( Also rice , in compressed cakes or cooked with red beans . )
Canned fruit — cherries , plums , peaches , pineapple , pears , mandarin orange sections .
Canned eggs — hardboiled ( in one Naval Air Force emergency ration . )
Dehydrated vegetables — beans , peas , potatoes , cabbage , carrots , onions , radishes , mushrooms , burdock , edible seaweed , taro root ( a starchy tuber , from which Hawaiians make their poi ) .
Dehydrated fish — bonito ( salt - water fish of the mackerel family ) .
Condiments , preserves — soy sauce ( powdered or liquid ) , bean paste , dried plum cakes , pickled giant radishes , butter , jellies .
Staples — rice ( polished or unpolished ) , granulated sugar , salt .
Some rations contain biscuits or crackers .
Beverages — tea , milk ( condensed or powdered ) , cider , whisky .
Sweets — caramels , hard candies , chocolate .
Most of these foods are familiar to Americans .
A number of the canned foods , such as crabmeat , tuna and salmon , and the mandarin oranges , formerly were widely stocked by American grocers .
The liquid soy - bean sauce is similar to that found in all U.S. Chinese restaurants , although it is saltier and " hotter . "
The bamboo and bean sprouts also are well known .
The dehydrated vegetables can be reconstituted by American procedures , although the soaking time may be different and a certain amount of experimenting may be necessary .
Rice , polished ( white ) or unpolished ( brown ) , may be used in regular U.S. Army recipes .
Cooked , this rice may be added to American B-ration meat items .
The canned meat , fish , vegetables , and fruits may be used in the customary ways .
METHODS OF PACKAGING
All canned foods , whether in large or small cans , are encased in wooden boxes bound with grass rope .
Rice usually is packed in large burlap or straw bags .
Flour , sugar , and salt are packed the same way .
Rice , and occasionally barley and wheat , also are packed in cans in the form of compressed cakes ( sometimes cooked and mixed with red beans ) .
The liquid soy sauce is packed in wooden barrels ; the powdered form , in gallon cans .
Dehydrated vegetables are shipped in large , rectangular cans .
COMBAT RATIONS
The Japanese soldier going into combat usually carries rice and bags of small , hard biscuits .
Whenever possible , canned meat is carried .
There are also two types of especially packaged rations .
One , wrapped in brown crepe paper , is a small package , 3 3/ 4 by 3 1/2 by 1 3/4 inches , and weighs about 9 ounces .
Each package equals a Japanese meal , and consists of several rectangular cakes of compressed wheat or barley , four cakes of sugar , three brown cakes of dried fish , and one or more pink cakes of very salty dried plums .
The sugar and the grain cakes are of good quality .
The cakes may be eaten as they are , or , with the addition of water , made into a hot breakfast cereal .
The second type of combat ration is packed in a transparent wrapper tied at both ends with a string .
This wrapper contains two paper sacks , each with identical contents : two cakes of compressed fish - and - vegetable mixture and a sack of finely milled pre-cooked rice flour .
Japanese soldiers mix the flour with water to make a dough , and eat it cold .
This is not palatable to Americans , but may be used in an emergency .
SPECIAL RATIONS
Several types of Japanese emergency aviation rations have been found .
Examples are two for the Naval Air Force .
One comprises dried fish ( bonito ) , biscuits , pickled plum , peas , hard candy , caramels , and — last but not least — a cardboard tube containing chocolate and whisky .
Another naval air ration includes rice cakes , hard - boiled eggs , canned meat - and - vegetables , canned pineapple , cider , chocolate , and whisky .
Japanese hospital and canteen foods may be captured , and these are more likely to satisfy American palates .
Among the foods are canned fruits , canned meat and fish , condensed and powdered milk , butter , jellies , and candy .
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
It is most important that a U.S. medical officer inspect and approve all captured enemy food supplies before they are eaten by American personnel .
Under emergency conditions , if food supplies are short or if competent medical personnel is not available to inspect the food , the exact identification of a food item may not be important .
However , it is important to know whether food is safe to eat .
In such circumstances , the canned goods are safest , provided that ( 1 ) the can does not bulge , ( 2 ) the can is not seriously rusted , and ( 3 ) the contents do not yield any kind of questionable odor .
The Quartermaster General advises the fullest use of captured enemy food , after it has been inspected and approved by competent personnel .
Packaged foods should not be opened — or opened , partially used , and then discarded — except when necessary .
The principal thought in using captured foods should be to ease our own supply problem to some extent .
To waste supplies — even enemy supplies — is foolhardy .
1 At established garrisons in occupied territories the Japanese have been cultivating gardens to supply fresh vegetables .
Two former detainees of the US ’s Guantánamo Bay detention centre in Cuba are to be resettled in the Republic , Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern has confirmed .
The Government has previously said it was looking at taking in two Uzbek prisoners identified for resettlement to help facilitate President Barack Obama 's order that the prison be closed by the end of January .
A definite timetable has yet to be established for the transfer of the two male detainees but both are expected within the next couple of months , Mr Ahern said today at a meeting in Dundalk with the new US Ambassador Dan Rooney .
While the two men were not being admitted as refugees within the terms of the Geneva Convention , Mr Ahern said he intended to adhere to the norms of official procedure in respecting the rights of the two men to their privacy .
“ There would not therefore be public disclosure of any personal information , family situations , nor would details of the arrangements for travel to Ireland be made public , ” he said .
The Minister said he made the decision to accept the men after receiving a report from a group of Irish officials last weeek on their visit to Washington and Guantanamo .
Mr Ahern said he was conscious of the intention of the Obama administration to close the centre at Guantanamo Bay , “ in part by transferring detainees , no longer regarded as posing a threat to security but who cannot return to their own countries , to other countries willing to accept them . ”
He said during his tenure as Minister for Foreign Affairs he had consistently called for the closure of the detention facility .
European Union member states had agreed arrangements last month concerning monitoring of former detainees accepted by member states for resettlement , and Mr Ahern said that Ireland would be complying with those arrangements .
Mr Ahern called on the public to acknowledge the difficult conditions in which the two men had been detained for a number of years and to allow them time and space to adjust to their new circumstances when they arrive .
Welcoming Mr Ahern ’s decision , Amnesty International Ireland said the Government has always been consistent in its opposition to the use of Guantánamo Bay Detention Centre and was one of the first governments to call for its closure .
Director Colm O’Gorman said : “ Today we see these calls matched by action .
We are delighted that Ireland will play a valuable role in shutting down Guantánamo and in assisting these men in rebuilding their lives .
Mr O’Gorman said : “ We especially welcome Minister Ahern ’s determination to protect the privacy of these men .
After years of imprisonment and possible torture they will need time and support to adjust to life outside of prison .
“ While Guantánamo is the responsibility of the US , other countries made it possible .
They allowed people to be transferred through their territory , actively participated in illegal detentions and kidnapping or , as in Ireland ’s case , they allowed their territory to be used as a staging area for rendition operations , ” he said .
“ Those countries that played a part in the system should follow Ireland ’s example and help shut it down . ”
Legal charity Reprieve applauded what is described as the “ compassion and foresight ” shown by the Government and urged other European governments to follow suit .
The charity ’s legal director Zachary Katznelson said : “ Ireland today has joined the vanguard of human rights , committing to accept men who have been abused and mistreated for years by the United States , but who do not pose any threat . ”
Green Party justice spokesman Ciarán Cuffe said the decision " shows a strong commitment to our international human rights responsibilities and a gives a positive signal to the Obama administration in their efforts to close the Guantánamo facility ” .
President Obama made history again Monday , nominating Dr. Regina Benjamin to be his surgeon general , said the Los Angeles Times in an editorial .
But unlike Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor , a fellow “ woman from an under - represented minority , ” Benjamin will probably have an easy confirmation hearing .
What senator would oppose a MacArthur “ genius ” award winner “ considered an angel - like figure ” for her work among the rural poor in Alabama ?
Benjamin ’s selection did spark some debate : “ Is she fantastic or , as some dissenters claim , merely marvelous ? ” said Christopher Beam in Slate .
As a family practitioner , she has the “ America ’s doctor ” part of the job down .
“ Where Benjamin will really distinguish herself , though — or fall face first — is in the role of advocate , ” for Obama ’s health - care reform but also less controversial wellness programs .
As far as advocacy goes , Regina Benjamin is no Sanjay Gupta , said Elise Foley in The New Republic .
But “ with all due respect to Gupta , ” the CNN celebrity doctor and Obama ’s first choice for surgeon general , “ this may be a good thing . ”
Gupta would have excelled at the traditional ceremonial role of relaying health information to the public , but Benjamin ’s work with the poor and uninsured , and emphasis on preventative medicine , could give her a real impact .

While I ’ve been getting lots of attention for “ take down ” of a single file that infringed on my copyright , another , much more broad and serious event is unfolding in the UK at the Hadley Climate Centre .
It appears that the “ mole ” has caused a Centre - wide panic and they are purging publicly available climate data .
If their climate science is so solid , so unassailable , why would they need to do this ?
Why hide the climate data gathered from public domain sources worldwide such as NOAA and NCDC ?
Steve McIntyre tells the story and wonders also .
I ’m sure all of those who complained in my case will do the same about Hadley , since it will affect the climate community worldwide .
I suppose we now have a new term : “ Climate Data Deniers ” – Anthony
“ Unprecedented ” Data Purge At CRU
by Steve McIntyre on July 31st , 2009
On July 31 , 2009 , the purge of public data at CRU reached levels “ unprecedented ” in its recorded history .
Climate Audit reader Super - Grover said that the data purge was “ worse ” than we expected .
On Monday , July 27 , 2009 , as reported in a prior thread , CRU deleted three files pertaining to station data from their public directory ftp.cru.uea.ac.uk /.
The next day , on July 28 , Phil Jones deleted data from his public file – see screenshot with timestemp in post here , leaving online a variety of files from the 1990s as shown in the following screenshot taken on July 28 , 2009 .
The following day , the following listing of station data available since 1996 ( discussed in my post CRU Then and Now ) was deleted from public access : ftp.cru.uea.ac.uk/projects/advance10k/cruwlda2.zip , though other data in the file remained .
This morning , everything in Dr Phil ’s directory had been removed .
This is part of a broader lockdown at CRU .
Ian Harris , Dave Lister , Kate Willett , Tim Osborn , Dimitrios , Clive Wilkinson and Colin Harpham all altered their FTP directories this morning .
Only one directory ( Tim Osborn - see below ) has added material .
Revisiting the Advance 10 K webpage this morning , all Advance 10 K data was deleted from their FTP site .
None of the Advance 10 K data links at www.cru.uea.ac.uk/advance10k/climdata.htm work any more .
If you go to the directory page ftp.cru.uea.ac.uk / projects which formerly hosted ftp.cru.uea.ac.uk/projects/advance10
k directory , it now contains only two directories between Sept 1999 and the present , both dated 8/1/2008 , but containing data from 2001 .
On July 31 , 2009 at 10:41 am , Tim Osborn published a webpage entitled “ controversy.htm ” .
It is located in a folder entitled www.cru.uea.ac.uk/people/timosborn/censored/ and the webpage www.cru.uea.ac.uk/people/timosborn/censored/controversy.htm itself is of course censored .
I presume that the data has not been totally destroyed , only that , after many years of public availability , it has been put under lock and key .
It ’s as though CRU is having a collective temper tantrum .

Dear Cecil :
Why does head hair ( as well as beard hair , I think ) grow indefinitely , whereas hair on the rest of the human body grows to a certain length and then stops ?
Kim M. , Washington , D.C .
Cecil replies :
What makes you think scalp hair grows indefinitely ?
Did n’t you ever listen to the title song from Hair ( “ Do n’t never have to cut it ‘ cuz it stops by itself ” ) ?
Each scalp and beard hair grows two to six years before stopping , attaining a typical maximum length of two to three feet .
Then it becomes dormant for about three months , whereupon a new hair starts growing and pushes the old one out of the follicle from behind .
That ’s why even someone who ’s not balding loses 70 to 100 head hairs a day .
By comparison , the growth cycle for other body hair is only a few weeks .
Maximum scalp - hair length varies greatly among individuals .
The all - time champ had 10 - 1/ 2 feet , although Diane Witte of Worcester , Massachusetts , is said to be closing in fast .
Diane , whose hair grows at the rate of a half - inch per month , had 10 - 1 / 4 feet as of 1988 and by now has surely broken the record .
Cecil ’s staff contacted Ms. Witte in hopes of being there for the historic finale , but we were unable to agree on terms .
No matter .
I ’m sure it ’ll turn up eventually on “ Wide World of Sports . ”

Pope Benedict XVI has called for a new financial order , a new way of understanding business enterprise , that respects the dignity of workers and looks out for the common good by prioritizing ethics and social responsibility over dividend returns , according to a report by the Associated Press .
The text of the enyclical titled “ CARITAS IN VERITATE ” or “ Charity in Truth ” can be found here on the Vatican web site .
The Pope in this third encyclical of his pontificate has addressed squarely a myth that has surrounded modern capitalism and economic growth .
Most often this mythology has attempted to perpetuate the dominance of the rich classes .
This mythology has as its key theme that for capitalism to thrive , trade unions must be weakened or non-existent , that profits have to be maximized even if it goes hand in hand with worker layoffs and lower wages , sometimes achieved through offshore outsourcing .
The profit motive is worthy , but it need not be exhorbitant profits at the expense of the worker .
Both the capitalist and the workers can have a share in the wealth of a company .
On the other hand , the government does not exist for the investor but for the people , understood as workers , investors , and other classes of people on the margin of society .
It is the responsibility of the government to spend on development , on education , on healthcare .
The private sector cannot be expected to deliver in these sectors in a manner that delivers services that are affordable to the poor .
There will be those who will argue that competition reduces prices .
Competition will not however reduce prices beyond a point where they do not meet the high profitability requirements of the private sector .
Do n’t expect the private sector to insure the poor sick …. those will be on the streets if the government cannot foot the bills .
Competition in private sector education may lower costs , but not as low as a government - run and subsidized schools .
The private sector wants a share of the subsidies by offering to deliver services better than the government .
The pet line goes : if poor kids ca n’t afford private schools let the government pay the fees for them .
But the government can have far more kids educated at the fees private schools charge .
One of the greatest challenges facing the economy is to achieve the most efficient use , and not abuse of natural resources , based on a realization that the notion of ‘ efficiency ’ is not value - free , the Pope wrote .
The Pope said that the drive to outsource work to the cheapest bidder had endangered the rights of workers , and demanded that they be allowed to organize in unions to protect their rights and guarantee steady , decent employment for all , according to the AP report .
Pope Benedict is concerned about the inhuman conditions for factory workers in outsourcing hubs in China and south - east Asia .
The move to outsource at the lowest cost has led to workers working in sweat shops , under inhuman conditions , as has been documented by Naomi Klein ( No Logo ) and other writers .
Some writers like nobel laureate Paul Krugman have argued that sweat shops are an improvement over the current lving conditions of people in some Asian countries .
But the Pope cannot take the clinical ( if cynical ) view of an economist .
His concern is the pain , the dehumanization of people worldwide .

The amendment propels the growing single payer health care movement at the state level .
There are at least ten states which have active single payer efforts in their legislatures .
They are California , Colorado , Illinois , Minnesota , Montana , New Mexico , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Washington .
The amendment mandates a single payer state will receive the right to waive the application of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) , which has in the past been used to nullify efforts to expand state or local government health care .
Under the Kucinich Amendment a state 's application for a waiver from ERISA is granted automatically if the state has signed into law a single payer plan .
With the amendment , for the first time , the state single payer health care option is shielded from an ERISA - based legal attack .
Now that the underlying bill has been passed , as amended , by the full committee , we must make sure that Congress knows that we want the provision kept in the bill at final passage !
The state single payer option was one of five major amendments which I obtained support to get included in HR3200 .
One amendment brings into standard coverage for the first time complementary and alternative medicine , ( integrative medicine ) .
Another amendment drives down the cost of prescription drugs by ending pharmaceutical industry 's sharp practices manipulating physician prescribing habits .
An amendment stops the insurance industry from increasing premiums at the time when people are not permitted to change health plans ; and finally an amendment imposing a requirement on insurance companies that they disclose the cost of advertising , marketing and executive compensation expenses ( which generally divert money from patient care ) .
Please make sure you post this message on your social networking site , ask all your friends to get involved and encourage everyone you know to sign up at www.Kucinich.us so we can build full momentum behind this movement for real health care .
Let 's do this !

THE health bills coming out of Congress would put the de cisions about your care in the hands of presidential appointees .
They ’d decide what plans cover , how much leeway your doctor will have and what seniors get under Medicare .
Yet at least two of President Obama ’s top health advisers should never be trusted with that power .
Start with Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel , the brother of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .
He has already been appointed to two key positions : health - policy adviser at the Office of Management and Budget and a member of Federal Council on Comparative Effectiveness Research .
Emanuel bluntly admits that the cuts will not be pain - free .
“ Vague promises of savings from cutting waste , enhancing prevention and wellness , installing electronic medical records and improving quality are merely ‘ lipstick ’ cost control , more for show and public relations than for true change , ” he wrote last year ( Health Affairs Feb. 27 , 2008 ) .
Savings , he writes , will require changing how doctors think about their patients : Doctors take the Hippocratic Oath too seriously , “ as an imperative to do everything for the patient regardless of the cost or effects on others ” ( Journal of the American Medical Association , June 18 , 2008 ) .
Yes , that ’s what patients want their doctors to do .
But Emanuel wants doctors to look beyond the needs of their patients and consider social justice , such as whether the money could be better spent on somebody else .
Many doctors are horrified by this notion ; they ’ll tell you that a doctor ’s job is to achieve social justice one patient at a time .
Emanuel , however , believes that “ communitarianism ” should guide decisions on who gets care .
He says medical care should be reserved for the non-disabled , not given to those “ who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens . . .
An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia ” ( Hastings Center Report , Nov. -Dec. ’ 96 ) .
Translation :
Do n’t give much care to a grandmother with Parkinson ’s or a child with cerebral palsy .
He explicitly defends discrimination against older patients : “ Unlike allocation by sex or race , allocation by age is not invidious discrimination ; every person lives through different life stages rather than being a single age .
Even if 25 - year - olds receive priority over 65 - year - olds , everyone who is 65 years now was previously 25 years ” ( Lancet , Jan. 31 ) .
The bills being rushed through Congress will be paid for largely by a $ 500 billion - plus cut in Medicare over 10 years .
Knowing how unpopular the cuts will be , the president ’s budget director , Peter Orszag , urged Congress this week to delegate its own authority over Medicare to a new , presidentially - appointed bureaucracy that would n’t be accountable to the public .
Since Medicare was founded in 1965 , seniors ’ lives have been transformed by new medical treatments such as angioplasty , bypass surgery and hip and knee replacements .
These innovations allow the elderly to lead active lives .
But Emanuel criticizes Americans for being too “ enamored with technology ” and is determined to reduce access to it .
Dr. David Blumenthal , another key Obama adviser , agrees .
He recommends slowing medical innovation to control health spending .
Blumenthal has long advocated government health - spending controls , though he concedes they ’re “ associated with longer waits ” and “ reduced availability of new and expensive treatments and devices ” ( New England Journal of Medicine , March 8 , 2001 ) .
But he calls it “ debatable ” whether the timely care Americans get is worth the cost .
( Ask a cancer patient , and you ’ll get a different answer .
Delay lowers your chances of survival . )
Obama appointed Blumenthal as national coordinator of health - information technology , a job that involves making sure doctors obey electronically deivered guidelines about what care the government deems appropriate and cost effective .
In the April 9 New England Journal of Medicine , Blumenthal predicted that many doctors would resist “ embedded clinical decision support ” — a euphemism for computers telling doctors what to do .
Americans need to know what the president ’s health advisers have in mind for them .
Emanuel sees even basic amenities as luxuries and says Americans expect too much : “ Hospital rooms in the United States offer more privacy . . . physicians ’ offices are typically more conveniently located and have parking nearby and more attractive waiting rooms ” ( JAMA , June 18 , 2008 ) .
No one has leveled with the public about these dangerous views .
Nor have most people heard about the arm - twisting , Chicago - style tactics being used to force support .
In a Nov. 16 , 2008 , Health Care Watch column , Emanuel explained how business should be done : “ Every favor to a constituency should be linked to support for the health - care reform agenda .
If the automakers want a bailout , then they and their suppliers have to agree to support and lobby for the administration ’s health - reform effort . ”
Do we want a “ reform ” that empowers people like this to decide for us ?

This is a post I ’ve been looking forward to for a long time :
Launchpad is now open source !
We released it today under the GNU Affero General Public license , version 3 .
Note that although we had previously announced that we’d be holding back two components ( codehosting and soyuz ) , we changed our minds : they are included — all the code is open .
Big congratulations ( and thanks ) to the Canonical Launchpad team , who worked overtime to make this happen sooner rather than later , and to Mark Shuttleworth , whose decision it was to open source Launchpad in the first place .
Rather than repeat the various release announcements , I ’ll just point to them :
The Canonical Launchpad developers will be on IRC in channel # launchpad - dev on irc.freenode.net .
That ’s the place to go for real time development discussion and questions .
For usage issues , # launchpad is still the place , as before .
The mailing list is launchpad - dev { AT} lists.launchpad.net , which you can subscribe to by joining the ~ launchpad - dev team .
Again , that ’s the development mailing list ; user questions should still go to launchpad-users { AT} lists.launchpad.net .
Please bear with us as we learn how to be an open source team .
Many of the Launchpad developers have open source experience already , of course , but as a team we ’ve been working on Launchpad in - house for some years .
This is a big change .
We ’ve been looking forward to it , though , and are ready and eager .
That ’s all .
Happy hacking :-) .

Labour is considering a plan to raise National Insurance contributions to fund a guaranteed minimum level of care for the elderly , The Independent has learnt .
The aim would be to end the current " postcode lottery " over the services provided to the elderly in their own homes , and to avoid the need for old people to sell their property to fund expensive care home fees .
Ministers describe these issues as " unfinished business " from when the modern welfare state was set up by Labour after the Second World War .
The Government will set out its initial thinking in a Green Paper on long - term care next week .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
An expansion of social care is emerging as one of the " big ideas " for a fourth term to be included in Labour 's general election manifesto .
Under the plans , social care would not be nationalised , but tailored to individual needs through different providers .
It would be brought into line with the NHS , so that people would know what support to expect , ending the anxiety and uncertainty caused by the existing patchwork system .
No decisions have been made , and ministers want a big national debate first .
The options include funding a basic national standard of care through a one - off payment by individuals of about £ 12,000 – either when someone retires or taken out of the estate when they die .
However the option most favoured by ministers at present is an " earmarked " rise in National Insurance contributions , similar to the one Gordon Brown introduced as Chancellor in 2002 to boost the health budget , which won public support .
Although all workers could be expected to pay into a national social care " pool " , higher earners would pay proportionately more than those on low incomes .
Ministers are wary about imposing what would be seen as another tax hike , and insist that any rises would not take effect for some years .
National Insurance payments for all workers are already due to rise by 0.5 per cent in 2011 , to help fill the black hole in the public finances .
Andy Burnham , the Health Secretary , told The Independent that his goal was to extend the principles of the NHS to social care so that people could enjoy a " basic entitlement " .
He said : " It is a major personal priority to me to put ideas on the table about how to make social care much fairer .
There is a real unfairness in how we provide it , which is a major concern for people .

" We need to ensure there is not so much local variation .
There is a real need for bold ideas to transform the quality and fairness of the system . "
He added : " My aim would be : is it possible to run social care along the same lines as the NHS , as a contract between the person and the state ? "
Mr Burnham said he also wanted to " invest more " in the staff working in social care .
Ministers will contrast their idea of a national standard with the Tories ' instinct to leave people to " fend for themselves " .
But the Tories will accuse Labour of dithering on the issue during 12 years in power , saying that there is no chance of reform before the election .
The Green Paper will acknowledge the need for a " fairer , simpler and more affordable " system that is fit for an ageing population , and will urge younger people to join the debate on how to fund it .
About 400,000 people receive care in their own homes – such as home helps – from local authorities or private agencies .
Fees paid for these services have risen by an estimated 45 per cent in the past two years , with huge variations in different areas .
Home care is free in Scotland .
Most councils do not pay for care if someone has assets of more than £ 23,500 .
Under this means - tested system , 30 per cent of people who go into a care home have to pay their own fees .
The average stay in a home is two years , with an average bill of £ 25,000 a year .
A public consultation by the Department of Health found widespread ignorance about the system and a lack of a single point of information .
Almost half the people consulted expected social care to be " free " like the NHS .
Many wanted " peace of mind " , to know the cost of care , and were worried about not being able to pass on their property to their families when they die .
An extra 1.7 m people will require access to social care over the next 20 years , the Government estimates .
Average life expectancy has risen from 66 years in 1946 , when the welfare state was created , to 78 today .
It is predicted that a girl born this year could live to be 126 .
The number of people over 65 now outnumbers the under - 18s for the first time .
The ratio of people in rather than out of work , now 4:1 , will fall to about 2:1 by 2050 .

The federal income tax code is now so mangled that we can probably increase federal revenues with a 0 % income tax rate for a majority of Americans .
Long before President Barack Obama took office , the bottom 40 % of income earners paid no federal income taxes .

Former deputy PM John Prescott is calling for inquiries to be reopened into allegations of widespread mobile phone hacking by the News of the World .
The Guardian alleges reporters paid private investigators to hack into 2,000 to 3,000 phones , including his and those of other public figures .
Details of the operation emerged in a court case but were suppressed by the police and the High Court , it claims .
A Home Office minister is to answer questions about the allegations later .
The Guardian alleges News Group Newspapers , owner of the News of the World , paid £ 1 m in out - of - court settlements in three cases after the paper 's journalists were accused of involvement in phone hacking earlier this decade .
Andy Coulson has been backed by Tory leader David Cameron Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has called on Andy Coulson , who was editor of the News of the World during the period the allegations cover , to give a " full and open explanation " of his role in the affair .
Mr Coulson , who is now working as director of communications for the Conservative Party , resigned from the paper in 2007 after its royal editor was jailed for hacking into the voicemail messages of royal staff .
At the time , Mr Coulson denied any knowledge of a wider hacking operation .
Tory leader David Cameron insisted Mr Coulson 's job was safe , but stressed it was " wrong for newspapers to breach people 's privacy with no justification " .
The Guardian claims the Professional Footballers ' Association 's head , Gordon Taylor , had his phone hacked into by News of the World - paid investigators and received £ 700,000 in damages and court costs last year , but on condition that details of the case were not made public .
He sued on the basis that News Group must have known about the phone hacking .
The paper alleges Mr Prescott and " two or three thousand " other public figures were targeted , including London Mayor Boris Johnson and former Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell , but evidence about the bugging operation was suppressed by the police and the High Court .
A spokesman for News Group 's parent company , News International , said : " This particular case means nothing to anyone here , and I 've talked to all the people who would be involved . "
Mr Prescott told the BBC the allegations " raised many many questions " .
' Rogue reporter '
He said : " First of all , those of us that had our phones tapped and the police were aware of it - why were we not told ?
Why were they [ the News of the World ] not prosecuted ?
" Why was a separate deal done in the court and then put away , and not made available to us ?
To the legal authorities [ I would ask ] why did you do this ?
ANALYSIS Nick Robinson ,
BBC political editor
It is now clear that phone hacking at the News of the World was much more widespread than previously thought ; that it targeted senior ministers not just celebrities and that , if the Guardian is correct , at least one of the paper 's executives knew about it .
This is leading to calls - not just from Labour politicians - for Andy Coulson to answer questions about what he knew and to questions about whether he should be at David Cameron 's side .
That is why I am sure that David Cameron is anything but " relaxed " , as was claimed last night .
Coulson has already broken rule one for any spin doctor - " Never become the story " .
He 's good enough at his job to know that this story will soon become one about David Cameron 's judgement .
Read Nick 's blog in full
He said News Group newspaper executives had convinced MPs on the House of Commons culture committee that the case of the News of the World 's royal editor Clive Goodman was a " one-off " example of a " rogue " reporter .
" That was clearly untrue if these allegations are to be believed , " Mr Prescott said .
He said the committee and the Press Complaints Commission , which both investigated the Goodman case and found no evidence of a wider hacking operation , should reopen their inquiries .
The culture committee is due to discuss the new allegations when it meets on Thursday .
Its chairman , Conservative MP John Whittingdale , said : " I have to say I 'm extremely surprised if it is the case that a payment of a million pounds has been made by News International to people who allegedly have had their phones intercepted by an investigator .
" We were given an absolute assurance when we carried out an inquiry that only one journalist on News of the World had any knowledge of interceptions - Clive Goodman . "
Writing in his blog , Mr Prescott also questioned the role of Mr Coulson .
" This really does call Cameron 's judgement into question in hiring Coulson , " wrote Mr Prescott .
" The question Cameron must answer is : ' Do you back him or sack him ? ' . "
' Ramped - up '
Mr Cameron issued a statement to say it was " wrong " for newspapers to breach privacy without justification .
He said : " That is why Andy Coulson resigned as editor of the News of the World two - and - a - half years ago .
" Of course I knew about that resignation before offering him the job .
But I believe in giving people a second chance .
" As director of communications for the Conservatives he does an excellent job in a proper , upright way at all times . "
Mr Coulson said on Thursday : " This story relates to an alleged payment made after I left the News of the World two - and - a - half - years ago .
I have no knowledge whatsoever of any settlement with Gordon Taylor . "
During the prosecution of Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire - also jailed in January 2007 - the court heard how they had hacked into the phones of celebrities , including supermodel Elle Macpherson , publicist Max Clifford and Mr Taylor .

The gang took first - class luxury holidays with their " earnings "
A father and his sons who made £ 7 m from a pirate DVD scam have been jailed by a judge at Southwark Crown Court .
Sami Sheikh , 28 , and brother Rafi , 26 , of North Chingford , east London , were each jailed for six years .
They were earlier found guilty of conspiring to break copyright laws , trademark laws and acquire criminal property between 2003 and 2006 .
Khalid Sheikh , 53 , who lived with his sons , was convicted of the copyright plot and jailed for four years .
A fourth man , Xin Li , 34 , of Victoria Road , Walthamstow , east London , was sentenced to two years and three months imprisonment , after being found guilty of concealing criminal property .
What I find really distasteful is you corrupted and exploited your children for your own financial interests
Judge Martin Beddoe , to Khalid Sheikh
As he passed sentence , Judge Martin Beddoe said : " The evidence suggested tens of thousands of burnt counterfeit material was being produced each week in so - called factories where vulnerable immigrants from China were patently being exploited for substantial financial reward . "
Addressing Khalid Sheikh , the judge said : " You were not only the head of the family as father of your sons but in reality the head of a significant organisation ... which had become part legitimate and part criminal .
" What I find really distasteful is you corrupted and exploited your children for your own financial interests . "
Police caught the gang following a raid on residential and business premises in North Chingford , Harlow in Essex and Walthamstow on 13 June 2006 .
During the trial the court heard the gang ran a " sophisticated " operation and imported equipment from the Far East to copy new films like Ice Age 2 , the Da Vinci Code and Iron Man to the " best industry standards possible " .
They ran fake DVD " factories " from various properties
The gang , which employed " largely illegal Chinese immigrants " , produced hundreds of thousands of DVDs in " factories " housed in several semi-detached houses across London .
The DVDs were then sold on the street for as little as £ 3 before they were released .
The father and sons , who claimed benefits , also produced pornographic and bestiality films to such an extent some sex film shops were driven out of business , the court heard .
Jurors heard that while the " employees " were made to work " round - the - clock in conditions of virtual slavery " , the gang took first - class flights on luxury holidays and spent money in lap - dancing clubs .
Two years after opening a small shop in Walthamstow , the scam was so successful the gang bought a £ 658,000 warehouse in Essex and made it the headquarters of their operation .
Police believe most of the " vast " ill - gotten gains of the scam have been smuggled out of the country .
Following the sentencing Det Ch Supt Nigel Mawer , from Film Piracy Unit of the Met , said : " This sentencing is the result of three years ' hard work and investigation into the activity of an extensive criminal network . "
A confiscation hearing will take place at a later date .

Obama has allocated an additional $ 150 million to Jordan .
Regimes in Egypt , the PA , the UAE and Saudi Arabia have benefited from US policy shifts .
In the latest in a recent series of increased American assistance efforts for Arab and Muslim states , U.S. President Barack Obama has allocated an additional $ 150 million to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan .
The regimes leading Egypt , the Palestinian Authority , the United Arab Emirates and even Saudi Arabia have all benefited from recent American policy shifts .
Jordan 's Minister of Planning and International Cooperation , Suhair Al - Ali , was quoted by The Jordan Times as explaining that the kingdom receives $ 363 million annually from the United States in economic assistance .
The allocations signed into law by Obama this week mean that Jordan will receive a total of $ 513 million from the U.S. in 2009 .
The minister told the Jordanian newspaper that the additional American aid was the result of ongoing efforts by Jordan 's King Abdullah II , as well as Obama 's " recognition of the important role Jordan plays in the region . "
Egypt received $ 310 million in supplemental appropriations from the U.S. House of Representatives , currently controlled by Obama 's Democratic party .
At the same time , 2009 State Department funding for the promotion of democratic initiatives in Egypt was cut from $ 50 million to $ 20 million .
In addition , the U.S. has agreed not to give any of the pro-democracy funds to organizations that are not approved by the Mubarak regime .
In the year 2007 , Egypt received a total of $ 2.4 billion .
On another front , in March of this year , it was reported that the Obama administration planned to dramatically increase funding to the Palestinian Authority for security training , which is conducted by Jordanian police under the supervision of U.S. General Keith Dayton .
The U.S. allocated $ 75 million for the PA police training in 2008 , but reports indicated that the Obama administration was planning to pump up to $ 130 million into the program in 2009 .
In any event , the U.S. has already pledged $ 600 million in funds to the Palestinian Authority , with another $ 300 million for humanitarian aid to the Hamas regime in Gaza .
Elsewhere in the region , the U.S. is set to help the United Arab Emirates become the first Arab nation with a developed nuclear power infrastructure .
President Obama gave his official support and authorization for the $ 41 billion project , allowing private U.S. companies to compete for construction contracts .
In Pakistan , the U.S. president proposed $ 2.8 billion in aid for that nation 's military , alongside civilian aid of $ 1.5 billion a year for the next five years .
The military aid is ostensibly to allow the Pakistanis to more effectively fight jihadist and al - Qaeda terrorism emanating from the Swat Valley and along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
The Obama administration 's assistance to Arab and Muslim states extends beyond the monetary , however .
According to an article in Joseph Farah 's G2 Bulletin earlier this month , the American government has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to preserve sovereign immunity for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and four Saudi princes in connection with a civil case seeking compensation for victims of the massive September 11 , 2001 , al - Qaeda terrorist attacks on the American homeland .
The claimants in the case say that there is sufficient evidence of Saudi involvement in 9/11 for the court to lift the normally applicable immunity .
Mark Sanford says he has no plans to resign as governor of South Carolina , even though 60 % of his state 's residents ( according to a Survey USA poll ) wish he would , and even though he continues to behave like a lovesick youth .
This week the governor told the Associated Press that his Argentine mistress was his soulmate .
Headlines in South Carolina newspapers question his sanity .
In America , righteous religious moralisers who get caught sinning are as common as weeds .
The transgressors inevitably are called hypocrites , and perhaps they are .
But I argue that many , like Sanford , were betrayed as much by their moral training as by their own weaknesses .
Too often contemporary moral guidance is reduced to vacuous advice about good and bad choices .
To me , good and bad choosing is whether to buy two 12 - ounce boxes of corn flakes for $ 4 or one 24 - ounce box for $ 3.75 .
Most life choices , however , are too complex to be reduced to a simple yes or no .
American conservative Christians tell us all our moral questions can be answered by a list of rules from the Bronze Age .
I 've got nothing against the Ten Commandments , mind you , but they offer little help with the ambiguities of today 's world .
Life today is full of heartbreaking circumstances that leave us with no purely " good " choices – when to take a loved one off life support , terminate a difficult pregnancy , leave a stable but stultifying job , end a loveless marriage .
The old " thou shalt not " rules desert us when we are most lost .
It is no coincidence , I think , that the " Bible belt " states famous for their culture of conservative religiosity long have had higher rates of divorce , babies born out of wedlock , and other by - products of human frailty than " liberal " states , where people expect to muddle along with uncertainties and doubts .
People who believe they are not supposed to doubt are unprepared to struggle with doubt when it comes .
Further , no list of external rules can guide us through the murky depths within ourselves , so that we see how we are jerked around by our unexamined fears and desires and the deceitfulness of ego .
It does n't help that most " successful " people who become political and religious leaders are aggressive extroverts rather than reflective introverts .
Show me a pious public moraliser who is a stranger to himself , and I will show you the subject of a future tabloid scandal story .
The righteously religious insist that theirs is the only path to morality , even though their overall behavioral track record appears no better than that of the non-religious .
However , this is not necessarily a failure of religion .
Buried within the vast , centuries - old heritages of the world 's great religions one can find genuinely insightful moral teaching , if one looks hard enough .
However , any advice that acknowledges the complexity of human life is quickly rejected by the " moral clarity " crowd .
It appears " moral clarity " is most often achieved by sweeping messy details under a rug instead of dealing with them honestly .
For some , the cognitive dissonance does n't snap until their sins are exposed on YouTube .
Which brings us back to Mark Sanford .
Whether he finishes the remaining 18 months of his term in office remains to be seen .
In a public statement issued after the " soulmate " remark , Jenny Sanford said she is leaving a door open to saving their marriage .
One hopes there 's a door open to personal insight as well .
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford 's love - struck romp in Buenos Aires with his Argentine " soul mate " was n't just a threat to his marriage , job , and presidential aspirations .
It also jeopardizes his Department of Homeland Security clearance and raises new questions about his candor on the steamy affair .
Did n't know the Republican had one ?
Well , as a chief of state and head of the South Carolina National Guard , Sanford has a top - secret security status that lets him in on classified information such as possible terrorist threats and emergency tips .
But with that need to know come intelligence community rules of conduct , a key one being that relationships with foreigners must be revealed .
The reason :
Those in the know can leave themselves open to blackmail from rival intelligence services about a compromising dalliance .
Dallas McKennon , an exuberant character actor and voice actor who helped enliven Gumby , Archie Andrews , Buzz Buzzard and many other animated characters , has died .
He was 89 .
McKennon , who played the tavern keeper Cincinnatus on the 1960s TV series “ Daniel Boone ” and dozens of other codgers on film and television , died Tuesday of age - related causes at the Willapa Harbor Care Center in Raymond , Wash . , according to his daughter Barbara Porter .
A tall , gangly actor with an unruly beard , McKennon was easily identifiable on - screen , but he could bend his voice in endless variations to bring personality to a host of sound roles .
Stop-motion pioneer Art Clokey used McKennon for the high - pitched tones of the green animated clay figure Gumby , and Woody Woodpecker cartoon creator Walter Lantz chose McKennon for Woody ’s nemesis , Buzz Buzzard .
McKennon also provided the teenager voice for Archie Andrews , and he recorded characters for the Walt Disney films “ Lady and the Tramp , ” “ Mary Poppins ” and “ 101 Dalmatians , ” among others .
At Disney theme parks , McKennon ’s distinctive voice warns riders on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad to hang on to their hats and glasses because “ this here ’s the wildest ride in the wilderness ! ”
And at Disney ’s Epcot , when the animatronic Ben Franklin speaks in the “ American Adventure ” exhibit , it ’s actually McKennon doing the talking .
“ He was an entertainer , ” Will Ryan , a friend and fellow voice actor , told The Times on Friday .
“ There was something of the 6 - year - old in him , no matter what his age was .
. . .
“ He had a gift for mimicry , but there ’s that spirit behind it .
. . .
It was n’t so much that he could do different voices , but that he could enthusiastically do different personalities . ”
Sometimes called Dal , McKennon had been imitating sounds since he was a youngster in rural northeast Oregon .
He was born July 19 , 1919 , in La Grande , Ore .
When he was a child , his mother died unexpectedly and McKennon was sent to live with an aunt and an uncle on a farm .
He became fascinated by the animals there .
“ Besides doing the chores , ” McKennon told the Lake Oswego ( Ore . )
Review a number of years ago , “ I ’d go out in the barnyard and see if I could imitate the animals .
I learned to do dogs and most of the animal sounds . ”
He enrolled in a drama class in high school and took his talent for creating different voices and sounds to the local radio station , earning money by recording commercials .
He briefly attended the University of Washington before serving in the Army Signal Corps during World War II , stationed in Alaska .
McKennon returned to Oregon after the war and found a job hosting a live children ’s show on Portland radio station KGW , playing Mr. Buttons .
After landing a bit part in “ Bend of the River , ” a 1952 James Stewart western filmed in Oregon , McKennon headed to Los Angeles .
Besides lining up voice work , he played Captain Jet and introduced cartoons on “ Space Funnies , ” a children ’s program that aired on KNXT - TV in the mid-1950s .
He had small parts in Alfred Hitchcock ’s 1963 suspense film “ The Birds ” and the 1967 Elvis Presley vehicle “ Clambake . ”
He also had bad - guy roles in a string of TV and movie westerns including “ Gunsmoke , ” “ The Virginian , ” “ Wagon Train ” and “ Bonanza . ”
“ I specialized in barn burnings , ” he once told an interviewer .
In 1968 , McKennon and his wife , Betty , whom he had married in Portland in 1942 , decided to move their family of eight children back to Oregon .
They settled in Cannon Beach , and he commuted to Los Angeles for acting and voice jobs .
McKennon ’s wife of 66 years survives him , as do his children : daughters Dalene Lackaff of Woolwich , Maine , Barbara Porter and Linda Strozyk , both of Raymond , Wash. , Gayle McKennon of Hyannis , Mass. , Tamara Rock of South Bend , Wash. , and Wendy McKennon of North Bend , Ore ; and sons Jerald McKennon of Tualatin , Ore. , and Steven McKennon of Newberg , Ore .
He is also survived by 21 grandchildren and 20 great - grandchildren .

Lou Dobbs had David from Freeport , N.Y. , on the line , the caller musing darkly about President Obama “ rushing all these programs through by whatever means , ” knowing he will soon be exposed as a fake , a fraud , a . . .
Kenyan .
At that point , a scrupulous radio host had three options : ( A ) hit the kill button ( B ) laugh and hit the kill button or ( C ) offer some push - back against the fantastical notion that Barack Obama was born on foreign soil and thus serves -- illegally -- as the Oval Office ’s first resident alien .
Instead , Dobbs chose the maximum complicity - minimum integrity route , or ( D ) : “ Certainly your view ca n’t be discounted , ” the host said .
So it went over the last week , with the bloviating interviewer offering the ( nominal ) credibility of his syndicated radio show , which airs on dozens of stations , and the CNN television brand as a platform for assorted wing nuts , whose conspiracy fulminations about Obama had previously been most virulent in the more disreputable reaches of the Internet .
Advertisement
The subject fits neatly with Dobbs ’ nativist , immigrant obsession .
And the cable demagogue , already well behind Fox News , has got to find some way to keep from sagging behind even traditional cable television laggard MSNBC .
Cooler heads at CNN put some distance between themselves and their once star host , with fill - in Kitty Pilgrim using a segment of “ Lou Dobbs Tonight ” on Friday to provide a substantially more skeptical look at the Obama - made - in - Africa claims .
Pilgrim introduced the topic of Obama ’s alleged foreign birth as she sat in for Dobbs that night , calling it “ the discredited rumor that wo n’t go away . ”
“ CNN has fully investigated the issue , ” the substitute said , and “ found no basis for the questions about the president ’s birthplace . ”
Advertisement
When the issue first surfaced in the presidential campaign last summer , numerous credible news organizations and even the Hawaii Department of Health presented clear evidence that Obama was born Aug.
4 , 1961 , in Honolulu .
But those reports have done little to snuff out elaborate and ever - mutating conspiracy theories .
I often hear from disgruntled readers that they do n’t pay attention to the dread “ Mainstream Media ” because they can find “ the truth ” on the Internet .
Translation : Some blogger will please them by propping up just about any cockeyed theory that they hold .
The Internet agitators , in turn , get support and sustenance from mainstream provocateurs like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh , who last month chortled , “ God does not have a birth certificate , and neither does Obama -- not that we ’ve seen . ”
Advertisement
Dobbs and the others found a nominal “ news ” peg for the story last week when the U.S. Army allowed a reserve major , Stefan F. Cook , to reverse his voluntary deployment to Afghanistan .
Cook proclaimed his orders invalid because , he insisted , his commander in chief was n’t born in the U.S .
Never mind that the good major appears in this instance to be more agent provocateur than man of arms or that he is represented by Orly Taitz , an Orange County attorney ( and dentist ) who has made it her life ’s work to prove Obama is n’t one of us .
Dobbs welcomed Taitz and another of her clients , Alan Keyes ( who was crushed by Obama in their Illinois U.S. Senate race ) , to his radio program like seers instead of extreme partisans .
Dobbs suggested he had reached no conclusions , before barreling ahead with questions about why Obama has n’t produced “ his birth certificate , the long form , the real deal . ”
But Obama has presented his birth certificate , as first noted by the nonpartisan FactCheck.org in June of last year .
Advertisement
Rather than settling the matter , though , the Internet display of the “ Certification of Live Birth ” provoked the first in what has become an endless cycle of challenges and innuendo .
Just last month , the Hawaii Department of Health confirmed to the Honolulu Star - Bulletin that the document is the only official record of the president ’s birth and proves he was born in that state .
But conspiracy theorists argue that the lack of an underlying paper document ( the so - called long - form birth certificate ) proves a cover-up .
That ignores multiple truths including this one : Hawaii ’s records , like those in many states , have gone electronic , and the certification document is accepted by both the state and national government as full proof of citizenship .
To insist otherwise is to embrace the notion that thousands upon thousands of Hawaiians have obtained their U.S. passports , using similar documents , fraudulently .
Advertisement
One Internet “ proof ” of Obama ’s alien roots truncates a taped interview with his grandmother to make it sound as if she is confirming his birth in Kenya , when the full tape shows she does nothing of the sort .
Another canard asserts that Obama must have been traveling on an Indonesian passport when he went to Pakistan at age 20 , because the U.S. had banned travel there .
Problem :
There was no such travel ban .
To believe the wild theories , one must also accept that Obama ’s mother -- rather than apply for citizenship for her son as one would expect if he had been born overseas -- launched an elaborate hoax .
It would have begun in 1961 with her placing false birth notices in Honolulu ’s two daily newspapers .
Diabolical .
Brooks Jackson , director of Annenberg Political Fact Check ( FactCheck .
Org ) and a reporter with 34 years in the business , has seen one howler after another knocked down , only for another to sprout in its place .
Advertisement
“ CNN should be ashamed of itself for putting some of that stuff on the air , ” said Jackson , who worked at the cable outlet for more than 20 years .
Besides Pilgrim ’s skin - back report last week , one CNN employee reminded me several times that Dobbs ’ most pointed assertions were made on his radio program , which is unconnected to CNN .
Jackson has studied the kind of “ disordered thinking ” exhibited by the foreign - birth gadflies , known collectively as “ birthers . ”
His book “ unSpun : Finding Facts in a World of Disinformation ” -- co-authored with another journalism authority , Kathleen Hall Jamieson -- explored instances in which the public let itself be overtaken by emotion .
Jackson said he saw a bit of this emotional attachment to a conspiracy theory from Democrats who insisted that Sen.
John F. Kerry lost the 2004 election only because of voter fraud in Ohio .
They kept finding new examples .
Advertisement
Certainly , a good chunk of the American public has n’t armed itself with enough plain information to sniff out the flimflam .
Well after this year ’s presidential inauguration , the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 11 % of Americans believed Obama was a Muslim .
And 35 % were n’t sure of his religion .
Republican Rep. Mike Castle of Delaware saw a town hall meeting this month interrupted as a woman , rooted on by a boisterous crowd , angrily demanded to know why nothing was being done to oust the “ citizen of Kenya ” pretending to be president .
On the even more extreme fringes , such sentiments border on dangerous .
James von Brunn , the elderly neo -Nazi who shot and killed a guard last month at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , D.C. , had posted anti-Obama “ birther ” theories on the Internet .
Dobbs did not return my call Tuesday .
But he did go on the radio and rant about the L.A. Times and the other liberal media that are “ subservient and servile to this presidency . ”
Advertisement
He insisted he believed Obama is a citizen , while continuing to tell listeners “ there is no actual birth certificate . ”
He did it because he is a Man of the People .
And , as he explained , “ the American people want an answer . ”

( A version of this article first appeared in the May 28 , 2009 Rolling Stone . )
Cornel
West is a slender man , but he hugs like a sumo wrestler : crouch , grab , wrap and squeeze .
“ I want to love everybody , ” West tells me not long after he greets me at his Princeton University office with a bear hug that is warm and wonderfully conspiratorial .
” Ah , yes , Brother Jeff ! ” he exclaims , like I ’ve arrived just in time for a clandestine mission .
I ’d feel special if it were n’t for the fact that there ’s hardly a soul on Earth whom West wo n’t call “ Brother ” or “ Sister . ”
As we walk around town , West embraces and is fully embraced by a maintenance man , a schoolteacher , a group of street missionaries and a class of fifth - graders visiting from Queens , who recognize him from the cover of his 1993 bestseller , Race Matters , still so popular that it ’s sold on the street in some inner-city neighborhoods .
West never holds back from anyone who wants a piece of him — whether it ’s a blessing or banter , an argument with the great man or simply a hug that lasts too long — but he never gets pinned down , either .
He locks eyes and holds hands , asks and answers real questions , and then pirouettes away .
West has been called “ perhaps the preeminent black intellectual of our generation ” by Harvard ’s Henry Louis Gates Jr. , himself a candidate for that mantle .
It might be more accurate to say that West is the preeminent intellectual of our generation , no qualifiers .
No other scholar is as widely read , no other philosopher courted by presidential candidates , no other Ivy League professor referenced not just by other academics but by popular filmmakers ( The Matrix trilogy , in which West played a bit role , was inspired in part by his work ) and musicians ( West has collaborated with Prince , Talib Kweli , and jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard , among others ) .
What makes
West ’s fame even more remarkable is the fact that he ’s among the most radical figures in American public life .
He stumped for Obama last year but only with the caveat that he would be Obama ’s number - one critic the day after the inauguration .
He started even sooner .
In his book Hope on a Tightrope , published weeks before Obama ’s election , West declares , “ I ’m not an optimist at all .
Brother Barack Obama says he has the audacity to hope .
I say , ‘ Well , what price are you willing to pay ? ’ “
There is a sense in which this may be West ’s moment as much as it is Obama’s .
It ’s one thing to speak truth to power when the powers - that - be are as crassly reactionary as George Bush ; it ’s another when all the power is in the hands of the very man you campaigned for .
Now is West ’s chance to move beyond Democrats and Republicans to the real work of rebuilding the American left .
Race , as always , matters — some liberals expected West to give his allegiance to Obama because they ’re both black .
In fact , West despised Obama ’s widely - praised Philadelphia speech on race —
“ It was weak , man , weak ” — in which the candidate described slavery as America ’s original sin .
“ That ’s not true , ” West says ; American democracy was born out of the dispossession and murder of the continent ’s first peoples .
To West , that fact does n’t invalidate democracy , it makes it messy .
He thinks it should be messy .
At times , he sounds like a conservative : Freedom is n’t free , he says , and anyone who leads you to believe as much is lying .
“ Innocence itself is a crime in America , ” he tells me .
He laments what Henry James called our “ hotel civilization ” — “ no darkness , no despair , no dread , no suffering , no grief . ”
No truth .
“ Where there is no death , there is no life , ” he writes .
That ’s the Westian turn .
He roots himself in what he calls “ the night side of American democracy ” so he ’ll be ready for the dawn .
He begins with anger so we can end with love .
“ My dear Brother Barack , ” he tells me one evening at the basement restaurant across from his office , “ he ’s gotta inscribe himself in the sentimental narrative . ”
The American dream , that is , which West sees as a menace to actual American democracy , since it carries within it the idea that we are special , maybe even better than the rest of the world .
West hears that narcissistic tone in Obama ’s insistence that “ in no other country on earth ” is his personal story possible , and that his story is proof that America is getting better all the time .
“ Every generation the union is being perfected , ” West paraphrases Obama .
“ But that ’s a lie .
There ’s retreat , there ’s regress , there ’s setbacks , there ’s moving backwards .
The history of race in America is not a history of progress . ”
West thinks Obama ’s presidency may become one of those setbacks .
“ Because you end up with a selective appropriation of Obama and people like him .
And his cousins on the street , Jamal and Latisha and Shaquille and all of them , they ’re not a part of that .
Their suffering is rendered invisible as people are preoccupied with Obama and company , who make whites more comfortable .
Lessens their fears and anxieties .
Allows them to embrace him while still demonizing , marginalizing , Latisha there ! ”
West has been jailed for half a dozen causes since he was first arrested as a Harvard freshman at a student protest .
His second arrest , though , was an almost textbook case of demonization :
The police rounded up the three black men on his dormitory floor after a white classmate said she ’d been raped by a stranger .
“ Lined us up three times , ” he remembers .
“ Kept us in for a number of days .
Had her come in , shaking , crying , and the police are saying , ‘ Now , these three did it . ’
She said ‘ No . ’ ”
West ’s voice sounds like Southie as he plays the part of the cop : “ ‘ Now please , do n’t be worrying about hurting their feelings .
You know they did it . ’”
The woman said no again .
“ Three times over two days .
That white sister saved our lives !
She held on to the truth , man . ”
Years later , when West was commuting to Williams College in rural Massachusetts to teach a course , a highway patrolman pulled him over and accused him of trafficking cocaine .
West said he was a professor on his way to a class .
“ And I ’m the Flying Nun , ” the officer answered .
“ Let ’s go , nigger . ”
When West began teaching at Princeton , cops stopped him three times in his first 10 days .
He still has a hard time catching a cab in Manhattan .
West speaks of these experiences not as revelations but as simple facts .
“ Just the way the world is , ” he says .
Critics who accuse him of racial opportunism ignore his commitment to a class - based economics of redistribution for everyone .
He ’s a scholar of Marx , hardly a career booster in America , and a professor of religion , a job that does n’t usually lead you to semi-regular appearances on Real Time With Bill Maher .
He comes under frequent fire from his own comrades on the left for his insistence that moral values must be at the heart of any movement worth dying for , which to his mind is the only kind worth fighting for .
“ It ’s all about witness , brother , ” he tells me one evening in his office , rocking in his chair .
“ Every person who bears witness has to have the depth of conviction of a martyr .
You have to be willing to die .
That ’s the statement allowing you to live . ”
He calls himself “ a Martin man , ” after King , but not predictably so .
His religion is rooted in the angry prophets of the Old Testament and a Christ story as awful as it is redeeming , “ the painful laughter of blues notes and the terrifying way of the cross , ” he says — a radical Christianity diametrically opposed to the suburban sermons of Rick Warren and Joel Osteen .
It ’s not a belief in a Christ gladly crucified on Good Friday or risen from his tomb in time for church Easter Sunday , but a faith drawn from a recognition of the despair of the Saturday in between .
” That Saturday , ” West tells me , the normal humor of his voice giving way to a growl , “ it ’s the full - fledged experience of the death of God .
Which is spiritual abandonment .
By any of the positive powers in the universe . ”
West rears up and spreads his arms and his fingers wide , his voice suddenly loud and staccato .
“ That ’s Christ on the cross : ‘ My God , my God why hast thou forsaken me ? ’ ”
He laughs and shifts into a Richard Pryor voice : “ ‘ Hey man , ' ” this Jesus says to the Lord , “ ‘ I thought you were coming through ! ' ”
West leans across his desk , peering through big black - framed glasses .
“ That ’s part of the humanity of Jesus .
But it ’s also part of the Jewishness of Jesus .
Because in the Hebrew scriptures , you ca n’t have the prophetic tradition ” — the Martin tradition — “ without Ecclesiastes .
Y’see , the prophetic goes hand in hand with the comic . ”
West reads the most existential book of the Bible — ” that which is crooked cannot be made straight : and that which is wanting cannot be numbered ” — with the bleak humor of the blues .
A few weeks later , West travels to New York to give a speech at the Museum of Jewish Heritage .
West lives as much on the road as in Princeton , delivering more than 100 public talks a year .
But tonight ’s lecture wo n’t be his stump speech .
It ’s a tribute to one of his late heroes , Abraham Joshua Heschel , the Polish - born rabbi who marched with King in Selma , best known for his first book , The Prophets .
West wants to be a prophet , himself , an ambition that would be grandiose if it were n’t for the fact that he wants the rest of us to be prophets , too , speaking truth to power .
“ To prophesy , ” he writes , “ is not to predict an outcome but rather to identify concrete evils . ”
He ’s concerned not with divine revelations but with what he sees as jazzlike improvisation , the radical hope he tempers with the tragic sensibility he takes from the blues .
“ I ’m a bluesman in the life of the mind , ” he says , “ a jazzman in the world of the ideas . ”
He dresses the part : a hand - tailored three - piece black suit with cufflinks of 25 karat Ethiopian gold , each featuring a tiny image of Africa .
It ’s an ensemble deliberately reminiscent of jazzmen and preachers , Duke Ellington and “ Daddy ” King , Martin ’s father .
Men with callings as well as style .
“ A sense of vocation , ” says West , a pious devotion to the usable past .
“ What is piety ? ” he asks at the Jewish Museum , working the stage like a tent revival preacher .
He stops , holds one hand up like he ’s just caught the word by a wing .
“ It is the acknowledgment of the debt to those who came before , the wind at our backs , the source of the good in our lives .
Could be your mama , could be your daddy .
Could be your jazz teacher , your dance teacher .
If you ’re religious like myself it could be God and all of those . ”
The future , he says — the democracy he dreams of , the democracy we have yet to achieve — demands prophesy , piety “ and the poetic .
And by poetic I do n’t mean a person who writes verses . ”
He draws the word out like an English don .
“ I mean what Shelley had in mind when he said poets are the unacknowledged ” — he goes into a Westian growl — “ legislators of the world !
All those who exercise imag - i-nation , and get us outside of our egocentric pre-dic - ament !
Give us a sense of awe and wonder !
So we become concerned about something outside of our own little bubbles , our own little suburbs , our own little slices of reality , our own little professional managerial spots ” — he makes that sound a like a filthy word , then pulls up in a hard pause , hunches down close to the edge of the stage , and whispers slowly — “ our own little iron cages . ”
He stands .
“ There ’s a lot of material toys in the cages .
But you ’re still in prison .
And poets allow us to shatter those bars . ”
When the talk is over , West gets down on his hands and knees so he can greet at eye level the fans filing by the stage , alarming and delighting one after another as he swings his arms out from under him — is he going to fall face - first ?
— only to wrap them around the person in front of him , hugging every potential poet and comrade in turn .

West came to his sense of self by way of a peculiarly American convergence of influences .
His is not an “ only in America ” story but an “ especially in America ” one , part Emersonian self - reliance , part Motown funk .
He ’s an intellectual mutt in the best sense , a “ freestyle , California spirit , ” as he puts it , “ rooted in gutbucket blues and jazz dispositions . ”
Even his trademark black suit is layered with influences — beneath jazz and the blues , there ’s 19th century Russian literature .
“ It ’s in emulation of Masha , ” he says , one of the heroines of his favorite play , Anton Chekhov ’s Three Sisters , a drama of provincial manners set amidst the Russian gentry .
West identifies with the lonely woman at the heart of the story .
“ She ’s wearing black , says she ’s in mourning . ”
Her father has just died , she ’s trapped in a pointless marriage with a boring man .
“ But it ’s even deeper than that .
How do you make deep disappointment a constant companion and still persevere ?
There is this sense with Masha , when you see her in that black dress , of having a sad soul with a sweet disposition . ”
West was born on June 2 , 1953 , in Tulsa , Oklahoma , back then known as the “ Oil Capital of the World ” and also as the site of America ’s worst race riot , when tens or maybe hundreds of black citizens were murdered one night in May 1921 , killings anticipated by a headline in a local paper that read , “ To Lynch Negro Tonight . ”
When West was two , his father — “ a PK , ” says West , “ a preacher ’s kid ” — moved the family to Topeka , Kansas so he could study biology at Washburn College in the hope of becoming a dentist .
Cornel ’s older brother , Clifton , was one of two African Americans in the first kindergarten class to follow the 1954 Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka desegregation decision , which began in his school .
In 1958 , the family moved to Sacramento , a civil service town of sleepy jobs and no great riches where West ’s father had been hired as a civilian administrator in the Air Force .
There they lived in a new house in the all - black suburb of Glen Elder .
It was a slice of small town Americana : Friday nights were for all ages dance parties —
“ Corn has the gift of gyrating hips , ” says his brother , now 59 , “ he was a James Brown , funkified kind of cat ” — Sunday mornings were for church , and the Saturdays in between were for baseball .
His mother , Irene , read him poetry and played him records , Nat King Cole , crooners .
“ How loved we were !
I do n’t want it to sound idyllic , ” West says , “ but it was .
Love - saturated . ”
At first , white meant little more than the color of Donald Duck ’s feathers or the cowboys on Bonanza .
“ I did n’t interact with white brothers and sisters at all .
I think , in the end , that was a very positive thing , because it gave me a chance to really revel in black humanity . ”
But white America made itself known .
Glen Elder was one of three black neighborhoods in Sacramento , each subtly cut off from the rest of the city .
To get to school , the Glen Elder kids had to cross a creek .
There were two options : they could walk over a rickety wooden footbridge or they could wait for a lull in the traffic and dash across main bridge , which had no sidewalks or guard rails and was high enough over the water to make a fall a life - threatening possibility .
“ If a truck came the same time you were on the bridge , ” says Cornel , “ you ’d go under . ”
His neighborhood had no streetlights , no public transportation .
But it was the bridge that educated him .
“ You could just see the racial politics .
You could see Jim Crow . ”
Cliff knew his little brother was smart .
The bridge showed him that Cornel was brave .
“ There ’s a signature moment we all go through in life when we have to step out of this box of fear where we ’re at , ” Cliff says .
“ That bridge was Corn ’s moment .
He was five years old and alone , and he had to go across the bridge .
And he did it .
Lot of us older kids did n’t want to do it , but he did it .
That was his moment of stepping out into nothing , and landing on something . ”
“ That was the first death shudder , ” Cornel tells me , 51 years removed from that day and still shaken by it , rocking in his chair , his voice a murmur .
He ’s felt them ever since .
“ The sense of , of sheer feebleness and — and relative helplessness of we human organisms experience in the face of cosmos and the face of death and the face of despair .
All those things that rattle you , make you shudder and shiver and quiver .
After that , it ’s just a matter of imagining what non-existence is like , what life is like after bodily extinction . ”
Cornel kept those ideas to himself .
“ It was strange sensibility for a kid .
I just think that most people had other things on their mind .
You did n’t want to distract them or irritate them by sharing these kind of thoughts that I was having . ”
The following year , the city built a new school — on the black side , for black children .
Cornel understood what was happening .
Summer trips to see his grandparents in Texas and Oklahoma made it plainer .
“ We sat on the back of the bus , ” remembers Cliff , “ could n’t look people in the eye . ”
“ I had a rage , man , ” says Cornel .
He began fighting almost every day .
He ’d line kids up and go down the row , relieving them of their milk money .
“ Everyone in the neighborhood knew I ’d be going to jail . ”
When he was eight , he says , he beat another boy so badly he nearly killed him .
“ I was a gangster , ” he says , not yet five feet tall .
The first time he clashed with a teacher was in second grade , for no good reason .
A year later , he did it again .
This time it changed his life .
“ That one was morally inclined , ” says Cliff .
The family had just returned from Texas .
While they ’d been riding in the back of the bus , the Freedom Riders were being beaten and firebombed for riding in the front .
In West ’s family , old stories were surfacing : Cornel had learned about a great uncle who ’d been lynched years before , his broken body wrapped by his killers in a flag .
One day , when his teacher told the class to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance , Cornel sat down .
“ Why we saluting this thing that do n’t love us ? ” he asked .
“ I ’m not gonna do it . ”
The teacher stared .
“ Cornel West !
You stand up right now ! ”
She waited .
The other kids got nervous .
One by one , several more sat down .
The teacher , late in a pregnancy , waddled over to Cornel .
“ She hit me first , ” West says .
The principal did n’t care .
“ She hit a little black kid , ” West remembers .
“ She got a prize , man .
Gotta keep us in order . ”
Cornel was expelled .
At first , no school would take him .
Then his mother arranged for an IQ test .
He scored north of 160 .
That won him a seat at Earl Warren Elementary , an “ enrichment ” school on the far side of town .
He was one of two black children in his class , but there the students were all geniuses , none so bright as Cornel .
He loved it .
“ Sheer act of grace , ” he says of the twist by which expulsion led him to the school .
He read a biography of Einstein , and decided he wanted to be like him .
( He took up the violin in emulation of “ Albert . ” )
He read a biography of Theodore Roosevelt , and decided he ’d go Harvard because T.R. had .
( “ I loved his strenuous mood . ” )
He worked his way through every volume in the bookmobile that was the black side of town ’s only library .
When he was 14 , he picked up the book that would make him a philosopher .
It was an anthology of the 19th century Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard , most famous for his Fear and Trembling , a meditation on Genesis 22 , in which God commands Abraham to sacrifice his own son , Isaac .
It ’s a fantastically difficult work for a reader of any age , but for young Cornel the book was a revelation : nothing , not even the love between a parent and a child , God and humanity , is as it seems .
“ In the end , ” he says now , “ we ’re beings headed toward death .
I was convinced for the most part we do n’t have any control .
So you really have to make a leap , you have to acknowledge the magnitude of the mystery . ”
Not so much the mystery of life as the mystery of death .
“ It is a kind of vertigo , ” he told the philosopher George Yancey , “ a dizziness , a sense of being staggered by the darkness that one sees in the human condition , the human predicament . ”
By then , West had become a model teenager , a track star who rose before dawn every day to train , a straight - A student at the head of his class and its elected president , a young man so passionate about scripture that he was already spoken of as a possible successor to the pastor of his church , Shiloh Baptist .
One life , a good life , was laid out before him .
But he began to have doubts .
To Cornel , the average Christian now seemed like a well - behaved child .
Be a good boy or girl , and you ’ll get your dessert in heaven .
( “ American Christianity , ” he writes in Hope on a Tightrope , “ is all about identifying with a winner . ” )
But the “ leap of faith , ” as Kierkegaard conceived it , was absurdly dangerous , like trying to jump across an abyss with no reasonable hope of success .
Why try ?
Because once he ’d felt the death shudder , once he ’d become aware in his bones of the reality of death , ordinary life — waiting to die , living as if you never will — seemed even more awful .
There was no choice but to step out into nothing , hoping he ’d land on something .
*
Today , Kierkegaard is just one face in a crowd lining the walls of West ’s office in Stanhope Hall , a simple but handsome three - story sandstone building at the heart of the Princeton campus .
Nearly every inch of his bookshelves features not the spines of his library but its covers , and every cover has been chosen for its portrait of one of West ’s heroes .
Talking with West means talking with them all .
“ Brother Fyodor might disagree with that , ” he ’ll say gesturing toward glowering Dostoyevsky , or , speaking of how he learned to love movies , “ It was this sister right here , ” nodding toward an arch - eyed vamp .
“ Bette Davis .
Good God ! ” Bessie Smith smiles between Herman Melville and Flannery O’Connor .
The radical black crime novelist Chester Himes looms beneath a tiny portrait of Le Corbusier , the Swiss - French pioneer of modern architecture .
A bare - chested Fela Kuti , the Afrobeat revolutionary , dances around the corner from the Greek opera star Maria Callas .
A couple of “ bad men ” — William Faulkner and Robert Johnson — are bookended by a couple of witty ones , Oscar Wilde and Billy Wilder .
Tupac
Shakur offers his baleful gaze next to that of another poet murdered by greed , Federico Garcia Lorca .
“ These are soulmates , man , ” he says .
“ You carry them around with you , they inhabit your heart and mind and soul . ”
West has published 18 books , ranging from philosophy to politics to pop culture ( his 19th will be a memoir called Brother West : Living and Loving Out Loud ) , but he understands himself first and foremost as a reader .
He reads a minimum of three hours every day regardless of his schedule and rarely sleeps more than three hours a night .
“ I ’ve been blessed with a powerful metabolism , ” he says .
Eddie Glaude , Jr. , a West protégé and rising star in African American studies whose office is across the hall from his mentor ’s , recalls traveling with West and talk show host Tavis Smiley , another longtime collaborator of West’s .
Smiley had just gotten advance proofs of a memoir he was about to publish , and he gave Glaude and West copies at the end of a long night , around two in the morning .
At seven a.m. , they were on the road to their next event , Smiley and Glaude blinking with fatigue .
West was bright - eyed — he ’d read the book cover to cover and wanted to discuss it right away .
“ The only other reader in my intellectual inventory who ’s comparable to Cornel is Ralph Waldo Emerson , ” says Glaude , speaking of the 19th century essayist whose work shapes both his and West ’s writing .
“ And Emerson loses his sight ! ”
West has a reputation as a ladies ’ man , but it ’s hard to believe — how romantic can it be to crawl into bed with you lover and a copy Georg Lukacs ’ 1923 History and Class Consciousness , one of the many texts
West rereads every year ?
Married three times , with a 31 - year - old son , Clifton , by his first wife , and separated from the mother of his eight - year - old daughter , Zeytun , West is cagey about his current romantic condition .
“ I ’m just dangling and adrift , in a certain sense .
I ’m hoping somebody ’s praying for me . ”
In his voiceover commentary for the DVD box set of The Matrix trilogy — a brilliantly free - form conversation with spirituality writer Ken Wilber about the movies ’ philosophical roots , from Plato to Schopenhauer to William James to West ’s own writing —
West strikes an oddly mournful note when Neo and the love interest , Trinity , get intimate .
“ Love itself is a certain kind of death , ” he muses .
“ That deep sense of lack and loss are part of the structure of desire . ”
“ There ’s a way in which you could think about Cornel as a kind of sick soul , ” says Glaude .
“ In the sense that he begins with the dead , with darkness .
He begins with suffering .
The blue note .
And all too often people want to move too quickly beyond that . ”
“ That ’s the American way , ” says West when I raise the question of the blue note and its dismissal , the common conviction that looking forward means forgetting the past .
“ ‘ No problem we cannot solve , ’ ” he says , paraphrasing conventional wisdom .
Well , that ’s a lie .
I do n’t know why Americans tell that lie all the time . ”
He laughs , shaking in his chair , mimicking a voice that sounds like a suburban golfer in pants a size too small .
“ ‘ No problem we ca n’t get beyond . ’
That ’s a lie !
But — it generates a strenuous mood . ”
This , to West , is a good thing , the naiveté that makes ambition possible .
“ Engagement !
I like that .
Now , Brother Leopardi on the other hand ” — Giacomo Leopardi , a 19th century Italian poet - philosopher revered in Italy but little read in the U.S — “ he starts with what he calls , ‘ The mind ’s sweet shipwreck . ’
Ain’t that a beautiful phrase ? ”
Leopardi should be the poet of our times ,
West tells me — late empire , mid-recession .
“ You hear about people rereading Steinbeck now , ” he says , referring to a recent surge in sales of Grapes of Wrath , Steinbeck ’s Great Depression chronicle .
“ They got to go deeper than that ! ” Steinbeck lets us off too easy .
West prescribes Brother Leopardi for “ deep - sea diving of the soul , ” a process ’s not just personal but essential to understanding “ the paradox of human freedom ” : that we must summon the strength to resist and endure oppression even as we acknowledge that we are ultimately weak in the face of death and despair .
“ We are organisms of desire , ” West defines the human condition , “ whose first day of birth makes us old enough to die . ”
West gets down on his hands and knees , crawling along the bottom shelf until he locates a green volume .
“ This is the Leopardi , brother . ”
He flips through the pages .
“ Oh , man !
See this one ?
‘ I refuse even hope . ’”
He repeats the line , his body suddenly slack , staring at me as if to ask , “ Do you follow ? ” I do , or , at least , I ’ll try .
West begins to read , rocking forwards and backwards at his hips like a metronome .
“ ‘ Everything is hidden , ’ ” he reads , “ ‘ Except our pain . ’”
He looks up .
“ Deep blues , man . ”
He returns to the green book in his hand .
“ We come , a forsaken race , / Crying into the world , and the gods / Keep their own counsel … ’ ”
I bend close , following the rhythm of his handwritten annotations down the margins : “ blues , ” “ jazz , ” “ blues , ” “ blues , ” “ jazz . ”
The blues , West says , is the suffering that ’s at the heart of the American story , both tragic and comic , darkly grandiose and absurdly mundane .
Jazz is democracy , or “ deep dem - oc - racy , ” as West likes to say , emphasis on the first word and the second syllable , the sound of a system we have yet to achieve .
“ Y’see , you take a military band , it ’s like ” — West bangs out a martial beat .
But jazz ?
He drums a complicated rhythm .
“ Under . Below .
On the side of the note .
Not just the note itself , y’see .
It ’s a powerful critique . ”
Jazz — improvisation — is his answer to things as they are , the negation of the status quo and thus the affirmation of another possibility .
“ Now , this , this is the greatest one , ” West says , petting a page of Leopardi ’s poems and looking at me with giant poem eyes as if to communicate the gravity of the words in his hand , the necessity of their immediate recitation .
He resumes rocking and reading :
That man has a truly noble nature
Who , without flinching , still can face
Our common plight , tell the truth
With an honest tongue ,
Admit the evil lot we ’ve been given
And the abject , impotent condition we ’re in ;
Who shows himself great and full of grace
Under pressure .…
West closes his book and stands still .
His head shakes back and forth with admiration .
That ’s too polite a word for the emotion flooding over him : it ’s relief , gratitude .
“ To know the wretchedness of who we are , ” he says .
“ Yet the fact that we know it , is itself a noble thing , because that kind of knowledge means we can know a whole lot of other things . ”
I think of a passage in West ’s 2004 Democracy Matters .
In a chapter that ranges from the Stoic philosopher Zeno to Emmett Till ’s mother standing over her murdered son ’s coffin , West quotes Ralph Ellison writing on the blues .
I ’d copied it into my notebook on the train to Princeton .
“ ‘ The blues is an impulse to keep the painful details and episodes of a brutal experience alive in one ’s aching consciousness , ’ ” I read aloud , “ ’to finger its jagged grain , and to transcend it , not by consolation of philosophy but by squeezing from it a near - tragic , near - comic lyricism . ’ ”
West nods , a teacher triumphant .
“ That ’s right ! ” he says .
“ It ’s knowledge the way Adam knew Eve. Adam knows Eve .
It ’s embracing .
Some think it ’s just sexual , but it ’s not just sexual .
To know is to be engaged .
The blues knows because the song is an action . ”
It ’s recognition of the death shudder , a naming of the pain .
“ That ’s the way in which a song of despair is not despair . ”
He points to the craggy features of the Irish playwright , Samuel Beckett , staring out from a book cover eye level with West ’s desk chair .
Beckett , in West ’s reckoning , is like Chekov what he calls a literary bluesman .
“ Brother Beckett .
He does n’t allow despair to have the last word .
The last word is what ? ”
He paraphrases Waiting for Godot : “ ‘ I ca n ’t go on .
I will go on .
I ca n’t go on .
I will go on . ’ Y’see ? ”
West hunches his shoulders , striking a pose like a creature about to spring .
He fixes a gap - toothed grin , his spectacles framing his eyes as if to emphasize the double duty they perform as exclamation points at the end of a train of ideas .
West likes to say that for him thought is a weapon , but “ train ” might actually be the right metaphor — all aboard or miss out on the ride .
“ He has an extraordinary ability to connect , ” says the Rev. Herbert Daughtry , at whose Brooklyn church , the House of the Lord Pentecostal West preached as much as wrote his first book , Prophesy Deliverance ! :
An Afro-American Revolutionary Christianity , nearly thirty years ago .
( It later became one of the sources for The Matrix movies , and it ’s still cited by radical activists and academic philosophers to this day . )
“ I ’ve never seen him be pedantic .
I want to say he ’s simple , but I do n’t want to be misunderstood .
He ’s like a serpent in a sense , coming out of his coil ” — slow moving , Daughtry explains , “ a y’all kind of person ” — “ then boom !
He hits with you the brilliance of his mind . ”
*
West is fond of citing a scene from one of his favorite plays , Tennessee Williams ’ Streetcar Named Desire .
Blanche DuBois , “ the American Hamlet , ” in West ’s words , is a Southern belle fallen on hard times and forced to move in with her sister and brutish brother - in - law .
There she finds solace for a while in the arms of a workingman named Mitch .
Only , she poisons the relationship with lies — she calls them “ magic ” — of a mythical past at odds with the truths of her morbid mind and her years of suffering .
Clued in by Stanley , Mitch confronts her , ripping a shade off a lamp to see her in the light of the bare bulb .
“ That wonderful moment , ” West says , one afternoon , widening his eyes and rearing back in a look of horror to play the part of an outraged Mitch : “ Let me see who you really are ! ”
West tells the story with as much sympathy for the deceiver as for the deceived ;
Blanche no more knows who she really is than Mitch does .
“ To thine own self be true , ” advice given by Polonius to his son in the original Hamlet , is in West ’s thinking one of the most fundamental challenges each of us faces .
Torn between books and the world , it has n’t been easy for him .
Around the same time Kierkegaard transformed West ’s understanding of religion , the particulars of American history converged to reveal the reality of race in its rawest form : the murder of Martin Luther King on April 4 , 1968 .
That year , the Black Panthers came into West ’s life when they opened an office close to West ’s church , Shiloh Baptist .
West walked over one Saturday after choir practice .
“ Young black brother ?
They said , ‘ Come on in ! ’ ”
West knew the image : the black leather jackets , the berets , most of all the guns .
The year before , Bobby Seale had led a contingent of armed Panthers in a march on Sacramento to protest a bill that would outlaw loaded weapons in public .
“ Looked like a little army , ” remembers West .
There were guns in the office next to the church , too , guns West was glad for — as much guarantee as could be had that the people gathered there would n’t be killed like Martin .
“ The problem of violence is that it ’s often connected to revenge and hatred , ” West says now .
“ But certain forms of violence are tied to love on a deep level .
Self - defense is self - love . ”
The guns , for West , were on the same plane as James Brown ’s “ Say It Loud , I ’m Black and I ’m Proud , ” released that year .
But West never took up arms himself .
“ I could never join because of my Christian faith , ” he says .
“ You had to be an atheist .
My whole life as a person on the left , I ’ve been saying , I ’m with you , but I ’m a Christian .
I ’m with you in part because I ’m a Christian .
But I ’m never fully with you because I ’m a Christian . ”
The book West that grew from West ’s early ’ 80s talks at Brooklyn ’s House of the Lord Church , Prophesy Deliverance ! :
An Afro-American Revolutionary Christianity , was an attempt to reconcile his twin passions , both of which he saw as fatally flawed in practice , through the lens of blackness .
He believes in Marx ’s radical critique of capital and empire , but he also believes in God .
To West , Marxism without what he calls “ the love ethic ” is inhumane , just as Christianity without a systemic economic and political analysis is incomplete .
And what would blackness contribute ?
Death ; or , to put it another way , the blues , a sensibility both tragic and comic that was lacking in the utopianism of the left and the messianism of religion .
American blackness , he hoped , would bring both down to earth by drawing the church into the frontlines for social justice and pushing genuine radicalism — disciplined , patient , and pious , in the Westian sense of “ subversive memory , ” an ongoing engagement with one ’s intellectual ancestors , black and otherwise — into the main currents of American life , or , at least , African - American life .
He published his next major work , The American Evasion of Philosophy : A Genealogy of Pragmatism in 1989 .
It ’s driven by almost lyrical lists of opposites paired , as in his description of pragmatism as a philosophy of “ profound insights and myopic blindness ” that ’s equally the product of America ’s revolutionary roots and its history of slavery , our “ obsession with mobility ” and a longing for fixed rules .
The same instinct that leads us to discount theory , philosophy , even the idea of ideas — the anti-intellectualism of American life — is that which drives us toward innovation and the invention of new things .
Or , to turn this seemingly fair trade upside down : our talent for technology comes at the cost of the perceptive powers with which we might understand our own creations .
Therein lies the rational miracle of West ’s vision of a “ prophetic pragmatism . ”
He takes that last paradox — technological innovation without ideas , invention without the context with which to comprehend — and performs pragmatic ju-jitsu .
Whereas academic philosophy seeks either ultimate truths or proof that no such truths are possible , pragmatism “ evades ” the question , instead trying “ to deploy thought as a weapon to enable more effective action . ”
The super - agents of pragmatism are action - oriented philosophers , from Ralph Waldo Emerson and John Dewey to West ’s own mentor , the late Richard Rorty , thinkers who commit themselves to “ continuous cultural commentary , ” drawing their ideas from the world as they find it and wrapping those ideas around the circumstances of any given moment .
A cultural critic — the label West has come to prefer to “ philosopher ” or “ theologian ” — attempts to “ explain America to itself . ”
That explanation is itself an action , an intervention , a heroic attempt at what West calls “ American theodicy . ”
Theodicy is a term more common to theology than philosophy .
It is , essentially , a word for the central question of West ’s life , his self - declared obsession : “ the problem of evil . ”
Theodicy asks , “ If God ” — or simply the universe — “ is good , why does he permit evil ? ”
It ’s the thorny knot at the heart of the self - help conundrum , “ Why do bad things happen to good people ? ”
It ’s a risky question , one not easily reconciled with the pragmatic tradition .
One possible answer is nihilism ; another is sanctimony and self - regard .
James H. Cone , the founder of black liberation theology and one of West ’s mentors early in his teaching career , cites West ’s transformation of the question of theodicy as crucial to the importance of West ’s project , prophetic pragmatism .
West , he says , locates the problem of theodicy not in the abstract of heaven but in the concrete of the world : “ How do you really struggle against suffering in a loving way , to leave a legacy in which people would be able to accent their own loving possibility in the midst of so much evil ? ”
West calls himself a libertarian , but he ’s not the kind who mistakes selfishness for wisdom , the fool who knowingly declares “ I got mine and tough luck for you if you do n’t . ”
Libertarianism , in West ’s view , is a collective affair .
The chains that bind the slave also entrap the slave owner ; the prison of poverty requires the affluent to act as wardens .
We ’re all locked in a box together — and that means that we can only win our freedom to be individuals together .
Both slave and slave - owner must free one another and themselves from the framework of slavery , the rigid structures of thought — the matrix , a term present in West ’s work long before the movies — that prevent us from imagining a better way of being .
West sees glimmers of that imagination in Barack Obama , but he thinks the new president , like the Panthers years ago , is torn between his best and worst inclinations .
“ They both got gangsters around ’em , ” he says .
For the Panthers , it was Eldridge Cleaver and the men who loved bullets more than books ; for Obama it ’s establishment goons like Larry Summers and his protégé Timothy Geithner .
West has a personal beef with Summers , with whom he tangled when he was teaching at Harvard and Summers was the university ’s president ( Summers was later forced out ) .
But now he sees Summers as simply one more representative of a certain political style .
“ These folks have no history whatsoever to being fundamentally committed to justice for working people .
Nobody else on the team ever thought about defending poor people .
Rubinites ?
No history of it .
Arne ?
In Chicago ? ”
As in Arne Duncan , Obama ’s Secretary of Education , who has pledged to run schools like businesses .
“ Please .
Rahm ?
Please !
What are we talking about here ?
He does not have one figure from the social movements who helped promote his campaign .
It ’s the typical move of a newcomer who wants to reassure the establishment .
‘ Hey , I ’m not going to upset you .
Please realize your boys are giving me all the advice I need . ’”
West campaigned for Obama in Iowa , Ohio , Texas , South Carolina , and all over the airwaves , but it was strange advocacy .
He derided change as an empty slogan , reminded anti-war crowds that Obama is n’t anti-war , and warned African Americans against voting for Obama just because he ’s black .
“ I got trashed like I do n’t know what .
I ’d get emails from inside Obama people , ‘ You ’re hurting the campaign , you ’re going to impede the first black man from becoming president with your critique on television , blah , blah , blah . ’ ”
Obama staffers sing
West ’s praises in public , but in private resentment simmers even now .
“ Dr. West , ” a White House source told me on condition of anonymity , “ he would go on , I do n’t want to say on a rant , but on a hoop , as we say in the black church .
He might say something that if you were writing his comments , you would prefer him not to have said . ”
But Obama ,
West believes , understood .
“ Because up until the end he ’s still allowing me to go to Ohio and do 15 events a day , Cleveland 14 events , Columbus 14 events .
He knew I had some ability to bring folk in .
With Barack , you got a brilliant and clever strategist , and I ’m always suspicious of strategists .
It ’s the distinction between the quest for truth vs. the quest for power .
My calling is Socratic ” — asking tough questions .
“ His calling is one of running the country ” — delivering answers broad enough to satisfy the majority of people most of the time , truth be damned at least some of the time .
“ I think he has progressive potential .
But it will be events that push him .
The irony is we ’re now living in age of Obama and Barack Obama may be reluctant to step into his own age .
We got to help him do it . ”
I ask him if , given the chance , he ’d take a White House job to help Obama in that direction .
It ’s late in the evening and we ’re picking at desserts after dinner and five hours of conversation .
West startles for the first time , his brow furrowing , his eyes narrowing .
He looks like I ’ve just called him an Uncle Tom .
“ That ’s not my calling ! ” he says , rebuke in his voice .
Then he softens , laughing to himself .
“ Yeah , brother , you find me in a crackhouse before you find me in the White House .
I ’ll go into the crackhouse before I ever go that far inside . ”
*
The last time a Democrat took the White House , West almost gave up on America .
“ I was ready to go , ” he says .
Ready to leave behind two decades of radical activism and writing during a political “ ice age , ” ready to leave behind two failed marriages .
It was January 1993 , Bill Clinton ’s inauguration :
West watched it from the other side of the world , in his adopted homeland , Ethiopia .
He ’d moved there with his third wife , Elleni , Ethiopian royalty , after a fashion , a direct descendent of the modern nation ’s founder .
“ Brother Lerner , ” he told Rabbi Michael Lerner , with whom he was working on a book of black - Jewish dialogues , “ I may not be coming back . ”
“ I understood the attraction , ” says Lerner , a longtime activist like West who ’d considered making aliyah to Israel .
“ Being in a society where you ’re not a minority , where there ’s a possibility of being more regular , less bizarre .
We discussed it many times , the possibility of him staying there , a life with his wife , a princess , made him feel like he was not going to be an outsider .
Cornel is a very lonely person .
For a long time , I thought I was his best friend , ” says Lerner .
“ But he had probably about 1,000 best friends .
He was best friends with everybody .
That made him more isolated .
It was more like he had a whole lot of one - night stands .
Not sexual , of course , but in terms of intimacy .
People would fall in love with him , and I believe he genuinely fell in love with them .
It was such a series of people and so many , that you could n’t possibly –there was no depth to those friendships .
So much intensity , but no depth . ”
Lerner is n’t calling
West shallow .
He believes West is one of the most profound thinkers he ’s ever encountered .
“ West has a prophetic consciousness , ” he says , language no honest rabbi dispenses lightly .
But that ’s the trouble .
When West speaks of love , he means it in the biblical sense of the prophets .
“ Hesed , ” he tells me one evening in Princeton , the Hebrew word for “ lovingkindness . ”
“ Steadfast commitment to the wellbeing of others , especially the least of these , ” West says .
That demands a lot of love , but West does n’t stop there .
“ Justice is what love looks like in public . ”
For him , justice is not vengeance but fairness ; the respect he believes should be accorded every soul .
“ And democracy , ” he continues , “ is what justice looks like in practice . ”
That is , a society where there is justice — a vast , public lovingkindness — for all .
West is steadfastly anti-utopian .
He thinks perfectionist illusions drive both religion and radicalism to murderous ends .
He knows that love for all is a hopeless cause , that thus justice is a hopeless cause , too .
Democracy ?
Not a chance .
It ’s a blues dream of a jazz impossibility .
But still , he can’t help dreaming .
I ask West why he came back to America .
His marriage was fading — “ it ’s hard to pursue a vocation and have a high quality relationship , ” he says — but his star was rising , as Race Matters turned into a bestseller and he became a different kind of royalty at home in America .
“ Cornel West became ‘ Cornel West ’ , ” as his former student Eddie Glaude puts it .
West ’s answer , though , is both more personal and more abstract .
“ Two reasons , ” he says .
“ My mother ” — West ’s father died in 1994 — “ and the music . ”
The Whispers , The Stylistics , and The Dramatics ; Curtis , Marvin , and Aretha ; Sinatra , Sassy , and Coltrane .
“ In the end , as a bluesman , as a jazzman , it ’s about the life that you live that is artistically and musically shaped .
And you can do that in the academy , you can do it on the street , you can do it in the library , you can do that on the basketball court , you can do it in the nightclub . ”
You can even do it in America .
In fact , for West , you must .
Simple opposition — to racism , to oppression , to American empire — is no more an option in his mind than submission .
“ I ’m for the revitalization of democratic possibility within the empire , ” he says .
“ I ’m still part of the American grain . ”
West is sometimes criticized from the left as a reformer rather than a revolutionary .
There is a sense in which that is a radical understatement .
West is a conservative , in the truest , oldest sense .
He ’s inspired by Giambattista Vico , an 18th century Italian philosopher who in his New Science — his attempt to construct a theory of almost everything — pointed to the common roots of “ human ” and the Latin humando , which means “ burying . ”
To be a scholar of the humanities — to be human — is to begin with the dead , to see that our futures are linked to our pasts , to acknowledge , deep in our bones , the truth of our own dying selves , “ from womb to tomb , ” West says .
For him , this is a present fact .
Several years ago , he was diagnosed with Stage IV prostate cancer , given just months to live .
Instead , he has thrived .
But the cancer is n’t gone , merely “ contained . ”
Then again , that ’s the way it ’s always been for him .
One day , in the midst of a riff on some of his heroes , Richard Pryor and Toni Morrison , Malcolm and Martin , he comes to an abrupt halt .
It ’s the death shudder .
Imperceptible if he did n’t tell me , just a pause , a consideration of what unites them all .
“ It ’s always there , ” he says , and he ’s grateful for it ; the death shudder makes him glad to be alive .
“ Wrestling with death , ” he writes , “ not simply as some event that ’s going to happen to you at the end of your life , but calling into question certain assumptions and presuppositions that you had before you arrived — that ’s learning how to die . ”
That , for West , is the beginning of freedom .
“ To learn how to die in this way is to learn how to live . ”
There ’s something almost funny about that paradox .
Not funny “ ha ha ” but funny like the blues , the absurdity of a situation — from slavery to segregation to a simple broken heart — so painful that the bitter laugh of the blue note becomes resistance to suffering .
“ Subversive joy , ” West says .
It ’s an American tradition , John Coltrane ’s jazz and Bessie Smith ’s growl , the deepest rhymes of hip - hop and even the wisdom of dead white men .
“ The impassioned odes to democratic possibility in Walt Whitman , ” West writes in Democracy Matters , “ the dark warnings of imminent self - destruction in Herman Melville . ”
Consider Moby - Dick , he says one evening at a bar across the street from his office .
It ’s the quintessential American novel , and look how it ends : the whaling ship dashed to smithereens , crazy Ahab gone beneath the sea , and only the narrator , Ishmael , left alive , clinging to a coffin in the whirlpool that has swallowed them all .
“ Most critical , ” says West , hunching forward and giving me a great , gaptoothed grin , waiting for me to catch up .
“ The raft , ” he says , running his fingers along the edge of the table , nudging me toward his favorite kind of ending , tragic and comic at the same time .
“ The coffin constitutes a raft .
He ’s spared to tell the tale . ”

A version of this article appeared in the May 28 , 2009 issue of Rolling Stone .
Basic thesis of this article : indirect object syntax method calls are evil , and we should all use no indirect to avoid accidentally using them .
If you 're already convinced of that , go read something else , we 're done here :)
If you 're not , then first I guess I should explain what indirect object syntax is .
new Foo @args ;
That 's indirect object syntax .
Basically doing
method_name ClassName @args ; method_name $ obj @args ;
instead of
ClassName->method_name(@args ) ; $ obj->method_name( @args ) ;
Using arrow ( -> ) syntax is good .
You should do it .
For everything .
Of course , if you 're still reading , presumably you do n't believe me .
So first , I suppose I should provide some background on how perl5 parses things .
Basically , when perl sees
bareword < something >
It follows the following procedure to decide what it is :
(1) Is < something > a valid class name ?
If so , this is a method call .
use Foo :: Bar ; new Foo : : Bar @args ; # calls Foo:: Bar->new
(2) Is bareword a known subroutine name ?
If so , this is a sub call .
sub wotsit { ... } wotsit { foo => ' bar ' , baz => ' quux ' } ; # calls wotsit ( { ... })
(3) Stuff it , I 'm guessing it 's a method call .
wotsit { foo => ' bar ' , baz => ' quux ' } ; # tries to call a method on a hashref
BOOM !
Better still , you can run into case ( 3 ) very , very easily .
Consider the following :
# One.pm package
One ; use strict ; use Two ; sub one {
Two : : two { ( foo => ' bar ' , baz => ' quux ' ) } } 1 ; # Two.pm package
Two ; use strict ; use One ; sub two ( & ) { join ( ' , ' , $ _ [ 0 ] - > ( ) ) . "
" ; } 1 ;
The circular dependency is what 's going to kill us .
So long as we load One.pm first , we 're fine .
But if we load Two.pm first , it starts loading One , the 'use Two ' does n't start loading
Two because it 's already in process , and so when ' sub one ' is parsed there is n't a Two : : two yet , and we get a completely unexpected case ( 3 ) -
$ perl - MOne -e ' print One : : one ' baz , quux , foo , bar $ perl - MTwo -e ' print One :: one '
Ca n't use string ( " foo " ) as a subroutine ref while " strict refs " in use at Two. pm line 7 .
String " foo " ?
What the hell ?
... well , what 's happening here is that the block is , amazingly , still being parsed as a block .
So it gets called and then the commas become the comma operator rather than a list constructor , and so the return value is actually ' foo ' , and then $ _ [ 0 ] ->( ) tries to call it , and then strict screams because that is n't a subroutine reference .
If the above confused you , that 's fine .
It confused me horribly the first time I encountered it ( especially when it was two plugins in a Module : : Pluggable style system so I got different load orders depending on the machine the code was being run on ... )
However , with the aid only of indirect .pm we can make this far less confusing -
# One.pm package
One ; use strict ; use Two ; no indirect ; sub one {
Two : : two { ( foo => ' bar ' , baz => ' quux ' ) } } 1 ; # Two.pm package
Two ; use strict ; use One ; no indirect ; sub two ( & ) { join ( ' , ' , $ _ [ 0 ] - > ( ) ) . "
" ; } 1 ;
And now we get :
$ perl - MTwo -e ' print One :: one '
Indirect call of method " Two : : two " on a block at One. pm line 8 .
Ca n't use string ( " foo " ) as a subroutine ref while " strict refs " in use at Two. pm line 7 .
And no indirect has kindly told us what 's actually happened ( and can be asked to throw an error in such cases if you want to bomb out in advance ) .
Now we 've found the mistake , we can either resolve the circular dependency , or if that 's not possible predeclare the sub with a prototype -
# Two.pm package
Two ; use strict ; sub two ( & ) ; use One ; no indirect ; sub two ( & ) { join ( ' , ' , $ _ [ 0 ] - > ( ) ) . "
" ; } 1 ;
At which point everything works fine again .
In summary : indirect object syntax evil , ' no indirect ' good .
And while you 're there you might also like to poke at no autovivification ; to help avoid accidental hash / array creation problems too ...

An insect with paper - thin wings may carry much the same defense technology as some of the military 's heavy - duty warships .
The finding that a species of tiger moth can jam the sonar of echolocating bats to avoid being eaten seems to be the " first conclusive evidence of sonar jamming in nature , " says Aaron Corcoran , a biology PhD student at Wake Forest University and the lead author of the paper reporting the discovery in today 's issue of Science .
" It demonstrates a new level of escalation in the bat–moth evolutionary arms race . "
Before Corcoran 's study , scientists were puzzled why certain species of tiger moths made sound .
Some speculated that the moths use it to startle bats .
A few pointed to its potential interference with their echolocation .
General consensus , however , fell with a third hypothesis : clicks function to warn a predator not to eat the clicking prey because it is toxic , or at least pretending to be .
To test these hypotheses , Corcoran and his team pitted the tiger moth Bertholdia trigona against the big brown bat Eptesicus fuscus , a battle frequently fought after sundown from Central America to Colorado .
High - speed infrared cameras and an ultrasonic microphone recorded the action over nine consecutive nights .
The process of elimination began .
If moth clicks served to startle , previous studies suggested the bats should become tolerant of the sound within two or three days .
" But that 's not what we found , " says Corcoran , explaining the lack of success bats had in capturing their clicking prey even through the last nights of the study .
How about the toxic warning theory ?
If this were the case , according to Corcoran , bats would not find the moths palatable or , if they were indeed tasty , they would quickly learn they 'd been tricked .
Either way , bats should start to ignore the moth 's unique ultrasonic clicks .
Also , bats partook readily when offered B. trigona that lacked the ability to click , and they kept coming back for more .
This attraction also held true for clicking B. trigona :
The predators persisted after their prey despite only reaching them about 20 percent of the time .
Bats actually launched four times as many successful attacks against a control group of silent moths .
These findings are " only consistent with the jamming hypothesis , " Corcoran notes .
" But the most distinctive evidence was in the echolocation sequences of the bats . "
Normally , a bat attack starts with relatively intermittent sounds .
They then increase in frequency — up to 200 cries per second — as the bat gets closer to the moth " so it knows where the moth is at that critical moment , " Corcoran explains .
But his research showed that just as bats were increasing their click frequency , moths " turn on sound production full blast , " clicking at a rate of up to 4,500 times a second .
This furious clicking by the moths reversed the bats ' pattern — the frequency of bat sonar decreased , rather than increased , as it approached its prey , suggesting that it lost its target .
The biological mechanism behind the moth 's defense strategy is still unclear to researchers .
" Most likely , moth clicks are disrupting the bat 's neural processing of when echoes return , " Corcoran says .
Bats judge how far away a moth is based on the time delay between making the cry and its audible return .
This " blurring " of the bat 's vision , he explains , " may be just enough to keep the moth safe . "
Harry ?
Harry , is that you ?
Oh wait , the sign says that this fellow is suspending panhandling , to focus on the national economy .
That can't be our Harry .

Sorry , but your party is also a party of no change and " no , we can 't , " as in " no , we ca n't get the votes for a public option . "

Hell , Baucus and Schumer just sat on their fat asses and laughed as they had single - payer advocates arrested .
You could practically see the crisp Franklins from the K Street Bribery Squads sticking out of their pockets .
Joe Stalin would have cheered them on .
Until there is a public option ( and one that is n't a watered - down , crossed - fingers - behind - the - back one ) , or , better yet , single - payer , I do n't see why I should support or vote for Democrats anymore .

The Atlantic cover story went on to examine emerging technologies , like solar energy , that lay at the heart of Lovins ’s vision .
While refraining from outright prediction , the author ’s hopes were clear .
In 1977 , the country appeared poised on the brink of a new age , with recent events having organized themselves in such a way as to make a clean - energy future seem tantalizingly close at hand .
A charismatic Democrat had come from nowhere to win the White House .
Reacting to an oil shock and determined to rid the country of Middle East entanglements , he was touting the merits of renewable energy and , for the first time , putting real money into it — $ 368 million .
But things peaked soon afterward , when Jimmy Carter installed solar panels on the roof of the White House .
“ A generation from now , ” Carter declared , “ this solar heater can either be a curiosity , a museum piece , an example of a road not taken — or it can be a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people ; harnessing the power of the sun to enrich our lives as we move away from our crippling dependence on foreign oil . ”
Now we have our answer : museum piece .
In one of the great acts of humiliating political symbolism , Ronald Reagan tore down the solar panels , which spent many years in purgatory before eventually finding their way to the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum in Atlanta , where they sit on display in silent reproach to all who drive Hummers and own high - wattage plasma television sets .
But having mostly followed the hard path since 1977 , the world has started to register the dire climatic effects Lovins warned of .
The concentration of atmospheric carbon , an important indicator of global warming , has shot from 280 parts per million in pre-industrial times to 386 ppm last year and appears to be accelerating .
Most scientists agree that beyond some critical threshold , climate change is irreversible and probably catastrophic .
But no one knows just where the threshold lies .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change takes 450 ppm as the benchmark , a level we ’re on pace to reach by mid-century — although the prognosis is grimmer than that would imply .
Because the effects of atmospheric carbon take years to show up as higher temperatures , limiting concentration to 450 ppm requires halting emissions at current levels .
This sudden imperative , coupled with the unlikelihood of action absent a major government intervention , has thrust national energy policy to the forefront of public debate for the first time since Lovins ’s heyday .
At least on a rhetorical level , a good portion of the country now seems eager to commit to the soft path .
It probably helps that the last administration was synonymous with oil and coal .
But last summer ’s spike in oil prices gave a nudge even to some who harbored Cheney - esque views of renewable energy .
The recent changes in Washington have made a significant shift in the nation ’s energy policy a real possibility for the first time in years .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Energy efficiency will do far more to help the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the short - term than carbon markets or unproven new technology , a report commissioned by Britain ’s Tony Blair said on Monday .
Former British Prime Minister and Middle East peace envoy Tony Blair testifies at a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington , May 14 , 2009 .

Countries must urgently take practical steps to save energy , by raising levels of renewable power and making cars , houses and factories more efficient , the study said .
That will cut the emissions blamed for global warming more quickly than waiting for emissions trading markets to improve or new technology to be developed , the report added .
The former prime minister urged countries meeting at the Major Economies Forum in Italy this week and in Copenhagen for U.N. climate talks in December to “ set the world on a new path ” by 2020 .
“ The important thing is actually to agree the measures that people will be taking , ” Blair told reporters .
“ In the short - term that is what will make the difference .
“ We will get out of Copenhagen an interim target ( for cutting emissions ) , whatever it may be , in the 25 - 40 percent range .
The thing that will make the difference is people saying : ‘ What is more , this is how we do it ’. ”
Three - quarters of the emissions cuts needed by 2020 could be achieved through measures available today , Blair said .
The world will need to spend about $ 1 trillion a year between now and 2050 on energy - saving measures , according to the report , which Blair published jointly with the Climate Group , a London - based group which campaigns for a low carbon economy .
It set out seven “ tried and tested ” measures that will help cut global emissions and protect the planet from the effects of climate change , such as rising sea levels and extreme weather .
Nearly 40 percent of the cuts could come from the power sector , the report said .
Governments should offer financial incentives such as feed - in tariffs to those generating energy from renewable sources such as solar and wind power .
A further quarter of the cuts could come from more efficient cars powered by electricity or hydrogen fuel cells .
Making industry more efficient could contribute 19 percent of the cuts , with improvements to buildings adding another 17 percent .
Governments and private companies must also start investing heavily in technology that will help cut emissions beyond 2020 .
Nuclear power stations , solar power and coal - fired plants fitted with carbon capture and storage technology will all be needed in the longer term , the report said .
The police officers ' murder marked an escalation of violence The Mexican government says it will never negotiate with drug gangs , after man purporting to be a leader of a violent cartel suggested a deal .
The man , who said he headed La Familia cartel , called a TV station in the state of Michoacan , to offer a pact .
Violence has flared over the past week , especially in Michoacan where 12 police officers were killed in an ambush .
Since 2006 , President Felipe Calderon has sent more than 45,000 troops across Mexico to tackle the drug gangs .
" The federal government does not ever dialogue with , nor reach deals , nor negotiate with organised crime , " said Interior Minister Fernando Gomez Mont .
" We will not give in to blackmail . "
See the Mexican cartels ' main areas of influence Mr Gomez Mont 's comments came after a man called a local TV programme in Michoacan saying he was Servando " La Tuta " Gomez , a leader of La Familia , a drug cartel based in the state .
" What we want is peace and tranquillity .
We want to achieve a national pact , " he said .
Michoacan has seen a wave of attacks over the past week that left at least 18 federal agents and two soldiers dead .
In the worst incident , 12 officers were tortured , killed and their bodies dumped by the side of the road .
LA FAMILIA Previously believed to answer to Gulf Cartel , listed as separate group in March 2009 government report Combines code of violence with idea of protecting people in Michoacan from outsiders
Also involved in counterfeiting , extortion , kidnapping , armed robbery , prostitution , protection rackets Authorities believe the violence is in retaliation for recent arrests , including that of La Familia 's operations chief Arnoldo Rueda last weekend .
The caller , in a rambling statement , said La Familia was only responding to attacks by the police and that investigators were coming to Michoacan to " fabricate charges " and " arrest innocent people " .
He said : " We want the president , Mr Felipe Calderon , to know that we are not his enemies , that we value him , that we are conscientious people . "
Officials have not commented on whether the caller appeared genuine .
But Mr Gomez
Mont insisted that the crackdown on the cartels would continue .

How many people will inhabit the planet before population growth finally levels off ?
The figure most commonly used is 9 billion by 2050 , up from 6.7 billion today — an extraordinary number , considering that there were only 1 billion humans in 1830 .
( Right now there are a billion people just between the ages of 10 and 19 . )
But there ’s a growing debate about this projection and what it means .
Optimists cite plunging fertility rates in some countries as evidence that Earth ’s human passenger list will not reach 9 billion .
Pessimists see a chance of zooming well past that mark , and they add that with all the signs of strained resources ( what ’s the price of oil today ? ) , this trajectory will lead to some hard knocks .
Some say we ’ve already shot over the edge of the cliff and , like Wile E. Coyote in the old cartoons , simply have n’t noticed .
Now the Worldwatch Institute , a nonpartisan Washington research group studying the issue for many years , has come out with a fresh analysis concluding that there is so much variability in fertility rates that we ca n’t know with any confidence how many people the future holds .
The study notes , for example , that the fertility rate is rising in the United States , violating the age - old dictum that rich countries do n’t make lots of babies .
The group sees hints that global numbers could well go higher .
The condition of women ’s lives remains a central influence on fertility trends .
A summary of the trends report by Robert Engelman , Worldwatch ’s vice president for programs “ World Population Growth : Fertile Ground for Uncertainty , ” has been posted .
The full report costs $ 10 .
Some highlights are below :
Although the average woman worldwide is giving birth to fewer children than ever before , an estimated 136 million babies were born in 2007 .
Global data do not allow demographers to be certain that any specific year sets a record for births , but this one cer­tainly came close .
The year ’s cohort of babies propelled global population to an estimated 6.7 billion by the end of 2007 .
The seeming contradiction between smaller - than - ever families and near - record births is easily explained .
The number of women of childbearing age keeps growing and global life expectancy at birth continues to rise .
These two trends explain why population continues growing despite declines in family size .
There were 1.7 billion women aged 15 to 49 in late 2007 , compared with 856 million in 1970 .
The average human being born today can expect to live 67 years , a full decade longer than the average newborn could expect in 1970 .
Only the future growth of the reproductive - age population is readily predictable , however : all but the youngest of the women who will be in this age group in two decades are already alive today .
But sustaining further declines in childbearing and increases in life expectancy will require continued efforts by governments to improve access to good health care , and both trends could be threatened by environmental or social deterioration .
The uncertain future of these factors makes population growth harder to predict than most people realize .
There ’s more on this coming in a new book by Mr. Engelman , which I just received and will read shortly and explore here .
It ’s called “ More : Population , Nature and What Women Want . ”
My colleague Nicholas Kristof is working on a book on women in poor places , which I ’m sure will do much to reveal the challenges that impede the progress of that half of the human race .
When girls in deep poverty have to spend their days toting water or collecting firewood instead of going to school , that ’s a population problem in the end , as well as a simple , and avoidable , waste of human potential .

Grayscale
Photoshop can’t save grayscale PNGs , so you would have to use OptiPNG after saving black - and - white images , like this :
optipng - o5 bw-image.png
Grayscale images takes much less space than RGBs , because each pixel described with only one byte , not three :
PNG - 24 ( Photoshop → true - color ) , 8167 bytes .
PNG - 24 ( Photoshop + OptiPNG → grayscale ) , 6132 bytes
Setting the Grayscale color mode ( Image → Mode → Grayscale ) for images prior to saving them in PNG is very important , especially for semi- transparent images ( see Dirty transparency method for more information ) .
Fewer Colors
This is an alternative to the Posterization method of reducing colors in an image .
Posterization can dramatically change the colors in your image , which is unacceptable if you have to blend the image into the background of your website .
This method gives you more control over color but is limited to 256 colors .
The method is basically to extract image data from the semi- transparent image ( i.e. remove transparency ) , convert it to an indexed color and apply the original mask .
Reducing the amount of colors will make image data stream packing by the PNG compressor more effective .
Let ’s see how it works .
1 . Open the original image in Photoshop and duplicate it ( Image → Duplicate ) .
63 KB
2. Remove transparency from the duplicated image ( Filter → Photo Wiz → Remove Transparency ) :
3 . Set the image mode to Indexed Color ( Image → Mode → Indexed Color ) .
In the new dialog window , enter the following settings :
Colors : 190 ,
Dither : Diffusion ,
Amount : 80 % .
4 . Set the image mode back to RGB and copy the image layer to the original file .
Align the copied layer with the referenced one and apply its mask .
Now save it to PNG - 24 :
51 KB
As you can see , these easy steps have saved us 11 KB of the original image without any noticeable effect on image quality .
But this method has another advantage : running OptiPNG on these images often saves even more bytes .
In this example , the image ’s size was reduced by 36 % , from 51 KB to 33 KB .
Instead of converting the image to Indexed Color mode , you can save it for the Web and apply the Influence mask to save extra bytes .
Please note that this method is not the same as PNG - 8 with palette transparency in Fireworks .
In most cases fewer colors will give you more than 256 colors , so you will have to save the image in PNG - 24 , not PNG - 8 .
Remember , solid red and 50 % - transparent red are two different colors .
Reducing Detail
This technique is useful for optimizing shadows , reflections , glows , etc .
The idea is to reduce detail in areas of the image that are barely visible .
As you will recall from the Dirty transparency method , each pixel of a true - color image with transparency is described in four bytes : RGBA .
The last one controls pixel transparency .
For pixels whose Alpha value is too low ( i.e. pixels that are barely visible ) , you can replace the RGB data for better image compression .
Let ’s try that .
1. Open iPod retro in Photoshop , again .
63 KB
2 . As you can see , the radio has a reflection below it , which is a good candidate for optimization .
Ctrl + click or ⌘ + click on the image thumbnail in the Layers palette to create a selection .
Go to the Channels palette and create a new channel from the selection :
3 . We have to localize only those pixels that are barely visible .
Invert the channel ( Image → Adjustments → Invert ) and open the Threshold dialog ( Image → Adjustments → Invert ) .
Setting the Threshold Level to 170 is good enough :
4 . We ’ve got the mask that includes barely visible pixels only .
Ctrl + click or ⌘ + click on the channel in the palette to create a selection .
Go back to the Layers palette , select the image layer and open Filter → Noise → Median .
This filter will smooth out pixels in the selection , making them more conducive to compression .
Set the Radius value to 5 :
Now save this image “ for the Web ” in PNG - 24 and see how its size has been reduced from 63 KB to 59 KB .
You can vary the threshold level and median radius to compress more or preserve more details .
More Tips For PNG Use And Optimization
1. Each optimization must begin with a thorough image analysis .
Choose the best technique for each image or combine techniques to achieve better results .
2 . Be creative .
Use these techniques as a starting point for your own methods customized to your particular images .
3 . Many people think that PNG - 8 is always better than PNG - 24 for low - color images .
It ’s not .
In some cases , PNG - 24 may give you better results :
PNG - 8 , 833 bytes
PNG - 24 , 369 bytes
In this example , there is an overhead in PNG - 8 : 3 bytes were used to describe the pixels in the color palette , and 1 byte to describe the pixel color in the image data stream , while PNG - 24 took up only 3 bytes for each pixel .
So , if you ’re saving low - color images in PNG without transparency , test whether PNG - 8 or PNG - 24 gives you the smaller file .
4 . If you are using an older version of Photoshop ( prior CS3 ) , you may find that PNG images in the image editor look different from ones in a Web browser .
This is because of the gAMA chunk that is saved in the PNG file , which controls image gamma .
You can safely remove it with tools such as TweakPNG ( Windows only ) or smush .it .
5. A “ special ” PNG image type allows you to save a semi- transparent image as an indexed - color PNG - 8 .
This image type is n’t available in Photoshop ( Fireworks has it ) , but you can prepare the image in Photoshop and then convert it with OptiPNG .
OptiPNG will convert truecolor images to 8 - bit palette by default if your image contains less than 256 colors .
To do this , you can apply “ Less colors ” and “ Lowering details ” techniques and “ guess ” number of colors .
But it may be very time consuming .
There ’s a tool called PNGNQ which can convert truecolor image to 256 palette , but you wo n’t have enough control over resulting image .
You will have to reduce the total amount of different colors , including semi- transparent ones , to 256 or fewer .
This format is “ special ” because of how it displays in IE6 :
IE6
Other browsers
As you can see , IE6 displays only the opaque pixels .
The good thing is that you can include such images with the regular tag or as background images ( i.e. without using the resource - greedy AlphaImageLoader CSS filter ) , making for graceful degradation .
6 . Do n’t use the “ Save As ” dialog to save PNG images for the Web ; use the “ Save for Web ” dialog instead .
By default , Photoshop saves an image preview as additional info in the file , making the file a few times larger than it needs to be .

A number of skeptics ask this question .
But God by definition is the uncreated creator of the universe , so the question Who created God ? is illogical , just like To whom is the bachelor married ?
So a more sophisticated questioner might ask :
If the universe needs a cause , then why does n't God need a cause ?
And if God does n't need a cause , why should the universe need a cause ?
In reply , Christians should use the following reasoning :
Everything which has a beginning has a cause .
1
The universe has a beginning .
Therefore the universe has a cause .
Its important to stress the words in bold type .
The universe requires a cause because it had a beginning , as will be shown below .
God , unlike the universe , had no beginning , so does n't need a cause .
In addition , Einstein 's general relativity , which has much experimental support , shows that time is linked to matter and space .
So time itself would have begun along with matter and space .
Since God , by definition , is the creator of the whole universe , he is the creator of time .
Therefore
He is not limited by the time dimension
He created , so has no beginning in time God is the high and lofty
One that inhabiteth eternity ( Isaiah 57:15 ) .
Therefore
He does n't have a cause .
In contrast , there is good evidence that the universe had a beginning .
This can be shown from the Laws of Thermodynamics , the most fundamental laws of the physical sciences .
1st Law :
The total amount of mass - energy in the universe is constant .
2nd Law :
The amount of energy available for work is running out , or entropy is increasing to a maximum .
If the total amount of mass - energy is limited , and the amount of usable energy is decreasing , then the universe cannot have existed forever , otherwise it would already have exhausted all usable energy the heat death of the universe .
For example , all radioactive atoms would have decayed , every part of the universe would be the same temperature , and no further work would be possible .
So the obvious corollary is that the universe began a finite time ago with a lot of usable energy , and is now running down .
Now , what if the questioner accepts that the universe had a beginning , but not that it needs a cause ?
But it is self - evident that things that begin have a cause no - one really denies it in his heart .
All science and history would collapse if this law of cause and effect were denied .
So would all law enforcement , if the police did n't think they needed to find a cause for a stabbed body or a burgled house .
Also , the universe cannot be self - caused nothing can create itself , because that would mean that it existed before it came into existence , which is a logical absurdity .
In Summary
The universe ( including time itself ) can be shown to have had a beginning .
It is unreasonable to believe something could begin to exist without a cause .
The universe therefore requires a cause , just as Genesis 1:1 and Romans 1:20 teach .
God , as creator of time , is outside of time .
Since therefore
He has no beginning in time , He has always existed , so does n't need a cause .
Objections
There are only two ways to refute an argument :
Show that it is logically invalid
Show that at least one of the premises is false .
Is the argument valid ?
A valid argument is one where it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false .
Note that validity does not depend on the truth of the premises , but on the form of the argument .
The argument in this article is valid ; it is of the same form as :
All whales have backbones ; Moby Dick is a whale ; therefore Moby Dick has a backbone .
So the only hope for the skeptic is to dispute one or both of the premises .
Are the premises true ?
1 . Does the universe have a beginning ?
Oscillating universe ideas were popularized by atheists like the late Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov solely to avoid the notion of a beginning , with its implications of a Creator .
But as shown above , the Laws of Thermodynamics undercut that argument .
Even an oscillating universe cannot overcome those laws .
Each one of the hypothetical cycles would exhaust more and more usable energy .
This means every cycle would be larger and longer than the previous one , so looking back in time there would be smaller and smaller cycles .
So the multicycle model could have an infinite future , but can only have a finite past .
2
Also , there are many lines of evidence showing that there is far too little mass for gravity to stop expansion and allow cycling in the first place , i.e. , the universe is open .
According to the best estimates ( even granting old - Earth assumptions ) , the universe still has only about half the mass needed for re-contraction .
This includes the combined total of both luminous matter and non-luminous matter ( found in galactic halos ) , as well as any possible contribution of neutrinos to total mass .
3
Some recent evidence for an open universe comes from the number of light - bending gravitational lenses in the sky .
4
Also , analysis of Type Ia supernovae shows that the universes expansion rate is not slowing enough for a closed universe .5 ,6
It seems there is only 40 - 80 % of the required matter to cause a big crunch .
Incidentally , this low mass is also a major problem for the currently fashionable inflationary version of the big bang theory , as this predicts a mass density just on the threshold of collapse a flat universe .
Finally , no known mechanism would allow a bounce back after a hypothetical big crunch .
7
As the late Professor Beatrice Tinsley of Yale explained , even though the mathematics say that the universe oscillates , There is no known physical mechanism to reverse a catastrophic big crunch .
Off the paper and into the real world of physics , those models start from the Big Bang , expand , collapse , and that 's the end .

2. Denial of cause and effect
Some physicists assert that quantum mechanics violates this cause / effect principle and can produce something from nothing .
For instance , Paul Davies writes : spacetime could appear out of nothingness as a result of a quantum transition .
Particles can appear out of nowhere without specific causation
Yet the world of quantum mechanics routinely produces something out of nothing .9
But this is a gross misapplication of quantum mechanics .
Quantum mechanics never produces something out of nothing .
Davies himself admitted on the previous page that his scenario should not be taken too seriously .
Theories that the universe is a quantum fluctuation must presuppose that there was something to fluctuate their quantum vacuum is a lot of matter - antimatter potential not nothing .
Also , I have plenty of theoretical and practical experience at quantum mechanics ( QM ) from my doctoral thesis work .
For example , Raman spectroscopy is a QM phenomenon , but from the wavenumber and intensity of the spectral bands , we can work out the masses of the atoms and force constants of the bonds causing the bands .
To help the atheist position that the universe came into existence without a cause , one would need to find Raman bands appearing without being caused by transitions in vibrational quantum states , or alpha particles appearing without pre-existing nuclei , etc .
If QM was as acausal as some people think , then we should not assume that these phenomena have a cause .
Then I may as well burn my Ph.D. thesis , and all the spectroscopy journals should quit , as should any nuclear physics research .
Also , if there is no cause , there is no explanation why this particular universe appeared at a particular time , nor why it was a universe and not , say , a banana or cat which appeared .
This universe can't have any properties to explain its preferential coming into existence , because it would n't have any properties until it actually came into existence .
Is creation by God rational ?
A last desperate tactic by skeptics to avoid a theistic conclusion is to assert that creation in time is incoherent .
Davies correctly points out that since time itself began with the beginning of the universe , it is meaningless to talk about what happened before the universe began .
But he claims that causes must precede their effects .
So if nothing happened before the universe began , then ( according to Davies ) it is meaningless to discuss the cause of the universes beginning .
But the philosopher ( and New Testament scholar ) William Lane Craig , in a useful critique of Davies , 10 pointed out that Davies is deficient in philosophical knowledge .
Philosophers have long discussed the notion of simultaneous causation .
Immanuel Kant ( 17241804 ) gave the example of a weight resting on a cushion simultaneously causing a depression in it .
Craig says :
The first moment of time is the moment of God 's creative act and of creation 's simultaneous coming to be .
Some skeptics claim that all this analysis is tentative , because that is the nature of science .
So this cant be used to prove creation by God .
Of course , skeptics can't have it both ways : saying that the Bible is wrong because science has proved it so , but if science appears consistent with the Bible , then well , science is tentative anyway .
A final thought The Bible informs us that time is a dimension that God created , into which man was subjected .
It even tells us that one day time will no longer exist .
That will be called “ eternity . ”
God Himself dwells outside of the dimension
He created ( 2 Timothy 1:9 , Titus 1:2 ) .
He dwells in eternity and is not subject to time .
God spoke history before it came into being .
He can move through time as a man flips through a history book .
Because we live in the dimension of time , it is impossible for us to fully understand anything that does not have a beginning and an end .
Simply accept that fact , and believe the concept of God 's eternal nature the same way you believe the concept of space having no beginning and end — by faith — even though such thoughts put a strain on our distinctly insufficient cerebrum .

In celebration of the upcoming 40th anniversary of humans setting foot on the moon , hackers placed a 1/2 scale replica of the Apollo Lunar Module on the Great Dome .
While the Apollo 10 mission of May 18 , 1969 did n't land on the moon , Apollo 11 mission resulted in the first humans setting foot on the moon on July 20 , 1969 .
The replica placed on the dome contained details such as an American flag , communications antennae , and an egress platform .
Shortly after the Apollo lander appeared , hackers also installed a large statue of Athena in Killian Court .
Some related hacks include Sputnik in Lobby 10 in 2007 , the Wright Flyer on the Dome in 2003 , and the NASA meatball on the Dot in 2008 .
At the most recent COMPUTEX , there was a chorus of buzz generated by Qualcomm , Acer , and ASUS around the possibility of using Google Android as a netbook OS .
Qualcomm and ASUS in particular were talking up Android as an OS for so - called " smartbooks , " which are netbooks that use ARM processors instead of Intel 's Atom , whereas Acer seemed to be looking to an x86 port of Android so that it could run the OS on Atom - based netbooks .
Today 's publication of a partial list of hardware partners ( Acer , Adobe , ASUS , Freescale , Hewlett - Packard , Lenovo , Qualcomm , Texas Instruments , and Toshiba ) for the newly announced Google Chrome OS — a list that features all three of the aforementioned companies , plus other ARM players — adds some color to the picture of those companies ' netbook and smartbook plans .
In particular , it seems likely that Chrome will be emerge as the smartbook OS of choice , and as a complement to ( not a replacement for ) Windows on netbooks .
The smartbook picture
When it comes to the netbooks scene , ARM and Atom are really two separate markets that happen to overlap a little , so I 'll deal with what Chrome OS means for ARM - based smartbooks and Atom - based netbooks separately .
First , let 's talk ARM .
In that COMPUTEX post linked above , I pointed out that Android was fairly ill - suited to be a real netbook OS , just like the current crop of ARM SoCs are ill - suited to be real netbook processors .
The problem in both cases is that the technology in question is too lean , mean , and power - conscious to support all of the features and performance that current netbook customers expect ( and these customers have already dialed their expectations in both areas way down , because Atom is so limited ) .
Android is still fairly limited under the hood ( it really is a mobile phone OS ) , and netbooks based on any ARM processor architecture prior to Core A8 will disappoint in the performance department for all but the most basic ( non-Flash , JavaScript - light ) browsing chores .
What 's needed to really make the smartbook work is a more robust processor and a more heavyweight ( in terms of multitasking , performance , stability , and APIs ) , browser - friendly OS .
In 2010 , ARM 's Core A9 will address the former need , and now it 's clear that Chrome OS will address the latter .
I expect that an A9 - based Chrome OS smartbook in the second half of 2010 will provide a solid Web experience that 's comparable in performance and battery life to anything Atom - based , though the ARM parts may end up one process node behind .
The netbook picture
Sony 's VAIO P netbook may run Windows , but it also can quick - boot to a small , stripped - down OS that provides a browser and some other basic functionality .
This barebones , fast - booting OS is practically begging to be replaced by Chrome OS as soon as possible , and not just on Sony netbooks , but on every Windows netbook .
In short , unless Microsoft is really gouging netbook users for whatever it puts on the devices in 2010 , there will be little reason not to ship both Chrome OS and Windows on Atom - based netbooks .
Users who want to use Google apps and surf securely can boot very quickly to Chrome OS , and if they need to use a Windows application then they can boot into Windows .
It 's also the case that anything that runs on Chrome OS will also run in the Chrome browser , so Chrome app users do n't have to sacrifice anything ( except perhaps some security and stability ) when booting into Windows .
Ultimately , netbook vendors will want to leave it to users to manage the tradeoff between boot time and functionality by offering their netbooks with both operating systems installed .
( Or , with Windows plus a possible Microsoft competitor to Chrome OS . )
ARMONK , N.Y. and CHICAGO - 28 Jul 2009 : IBM ( IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) and SPSS Inc. ( Nasdaq : SPSS ) today announced that the two companies have entered into a definitive merger agreement for IBM to acquire SPSS , a publicly - held company headquartered in Chicago , in an all cash transaction at a price of $ 50 / share , resulting in a total cash consideration in the merger of approximately $ 1.2 billion .
The acquisition is subject to SPSS shareholder approval , applicable regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions .
It is expected to close later in the second half of 2009 .
This acquisition is expected to further expand IBM's Information on Demand ( IOD ) software portfolio and business analytics capabilities , including the range of offerings available through IBM 's recently - announced Business Analytics and Optimization Consulting organization and network of Analytics Solution Centers .
The acquisition is also expected to strengthen IBM's Information Agenda initiative , which helps companies turn information into a strategic asset .
As companies attempt to control costs and use resources more wisely , IDC estimates that the worldwide market for business analytics software will swell to $ 25 billion this year , growing 4 % over 2008 .
(1)
IBM is expanding its focus on business analytics technology and services to meet growing client needs to cut costs , reduce risk , and increase profitability through predictive analytics capabilities , which include advanced data capture , data mining and statistical analysis .
These capabilities help organizations analyze trends and patterns found in historical and current data to drive new forms of competitive advantage by predicting potential future outcomes and optimizing all elements of their businesses , including product and service offerings for customers .
Helping Clients Forecast Future Trends
The ability to forecast future trends and spot shifts in consumer patterns or behavior even before they occur can give businesses a competitive advantage in today 's economy .
" With this acquisition , we are extending our capabilities around a new level of analytics that not only provides clients with greater insight -- but true foresight , " said Ambuj Goyal , general manager , Information Management .
" Predictive analytics can help clients move beyond the ' sense and respond ' mode , which can leave blind spots for strategic information in today 's fast paced environment -- to ' predict and act ' for improved business outcomes . "
The acquisition of SPSS will add a wide array of advanced analytic capabilities to IBM 's IOD software portfolio enabling many new industry - focused solutions including : customer acquisition and retention for financial services , patient care improvement for the healthcare industry , crime prevention for public sector and ideal store location for retailers and manufacturers .
In addition , software capabilities that address all industries will include demand forecasting , employee hiring and retention , customer profitability , credit scoring and fraud detection .
All of these new offerings will help clients drive better business outcomes within their specific industries .
Predictive Analytics in Action
Predictive analytics technology can also be used to help reduce credit risk , increase customer loyalty and detect and prevent fraud -- across diverse industries including finance , telecommunications , retail and government .
With the combined SPSS technology and IBM software and consulting capabilities , clients will be able to identify which customers to target , how to reach them , when to make contact and the most appropriate action to take .
For example , the recognition of patterns , based on intelligent , timely analysis of the thousands of incident reports , crime tips , and other data that police departments receive every day , is critical to fighting crime and protecting the public .
Police services often use predictive analytics to identify and predict patterns of criminal behavior to help forecast which minor crimes are most likely to escalate into violence .
By investigating dispatch data , the police can also create models that pinpoint crime " hot spots , " so they can place tactical units where they anticipate crime is most likely to occur .
The Richmond , VA police department provided the results of this kind of predictive analysis to detectives and saw a 20 - 30 percent decrease in violent crime and homicides in a 12 - month period .
This technology has also been used in political campaigns to zero in on likely voters to determine what campaign messages have the greatest impact on undecided voters .
With this type of technology , Internet merchants now know exactly which products customers are browsing and buying -- in real - time .
Search engines are now instantly mining information between customer queries and clickthroughs as the data flows in to determine which products are in the most demand at a given time .
These advances are also allowing retailers to use data in new ways .
With insight into future buying trends , retailers can address customer needs in a highly personalized manner .
If a customer purchases a specific seasonal product , the retailers can instantly give the online shopper options on additional items that he or she may also like to purchase as seasons change .
Consistent with IBM 's software strategy , IBM will continue to support and enhance SPSS technologies while allowing customers to take advantage of the broader IBM portfolio .
Following the close of the acquisition , IBM intends to integrate SPSS within IBM's Information Management software portfolio and into the many industry offerings already available .
Predictive analytics will also be an essential component of the smarter business systems that IBM is helping companies and organizations build to help confront the complex challenges presented by the exponential growth of data .

HOLLAND TOWNSHIP , Mich . — A native of the Holland , Mich. , area collapsed and died at her wedding reception in California , the victim of a brain aneurysm .
Amy Lynn Slenk , 26 , died on the day she married longtime boyfriend Cole Handley in a vineyard in Soledad .
The bride was enjoying “ the happiest day of her life ” on May 25 when she collapsed at the reception , said her mother , Diane Slenk of Ottawa County ’s Holland Township .
“ I know they were very excited about starting their lives together and starting a family , ” the mother said Wednesday to The Holland Sentinel .
“ They were planning on doing so many things together . ”
Following Amy Slenk ’s death , a California neurosurgeon told her family that although she appeared healthy , she had a pre-existing aneurysm and “ it could ’ve erupted at any time , ” her mother said .
Her daughter moved to the West Coast to pursue international studies and study Japanese at Pacific University in Forest Grove , Ore. Amy Slenk met her future husband there during their freshman year .
“ They were immediate friends , and they stayed friends for a couple years before they realized it was love , ” her mother said .
“ Cole was always so willing to take part in any of the crazy plans she had . ”
After graduating from college , Slenk lived in San Diego before moving to Soledad , where she ran a wine - tasting room .
The groom works at a golf course .
Although a funeral already was held in California , Slenk ’s family is planning a private memorial service in the Holland area because she was fond of where she grew up , her mother said .
“ She loved Michigan , ” she said .
“ She always loved being near the water . ”

We 've been collaborating with some of our favorite cartoonists to create short stories set in the world of Barbarous .
They 're all written by us , so they 're all canon !
We 're really excited to share these with you !
Our first short story is about Suzume , one of the Cerberus girls !
It was illustrated by Patabot ( twitter / instagram / linktree / shop ) , whose work you might know from Patata Comics !
Definitely check out her work , she 's amazing !
Thank you for working with us , Pat ! ♥
The comic was also lettered by our long - time collaborator , Tess Stone ( twitter / website ) !
He 's lettering all of the short stories , a million thank - yous Tess !
Now 's the perfect time to get caught up on Barbarous !

Nuklearwaffen gegen DDR - Städte Alexander Bahar
Hat die Bundesregierung noch 1986 an der Planung von Atombombeneinsätzen gegen Dresden und andere ostdeutsche Städte mitgewirkt ?
Diese Frage stellt sich spätestens nach den jüngsten Darstellungen des CDU - Bundestagsabgeordnete Willy Wimmer während der Tagung „ Frieden durch Recht ? “ in der Berliner Humboldt - Universität am 26./ 27 .
Juni 2009 .
Veranstaltet hatten die Konferenz die Juristen und Juristinnen gegen atomare , biologische und chemische Waffen ( IALANA ) und weitere Organisationen .
„ Ich bin wahrscheinlich der Einzige hier im Saal , der Atomkriegs - Erfahrungen hat “ , sagte der frühere Parlamentarische Staatssekretär im Bundesverteidigungsministerium .
Wimmer berichtete , so gibt eine Pressemitteilung von IALANA die Rede wieder , von seiner Teilnahme als „ Verteidigungsminister Üb “ an der NATO - Übung WINTEX / FALLEX im Jahre 1986 im damaligen Atombunker ( „ Dienststelle Marienthal “ ) der Bundesregierung ( Der Wahnwitz atomarer Kriegsspiele , Ausweichen und Eingraben ) .
Im Verlaufe dieser NATO - Übung habe das NATO - Hauptquartier in Brüssel um Zustimmung der zuständigen deutschen Stellen zu einem Einsatz von Nuklearwaffen gegen Ziele in der damaligen DDR ersucht , erklärte Wimmer weiter , u.a. gegen Dresden und eine weitere ostdeutsche Großstädte .
Wimmer , der angibt , von dieser Anforderung völlig überrascht worden zu sein , habe es entsetzt abgelehnt , auch an einer Übung zur Planung eines Atomwaffeneinsatzes auf Ziele in Ostdeutschland und damit gegen die Bevölkerung der DDR mitzuwirken .
Er habe dann Kontakt mit dem damaligen Bundeskanzler Helmut Kohl aufgenommen , der entschieden habe , dass sich die Vertreter der Bundesregierung nicht an diesen nuklearen Planspielen gegen DDR - Städte beteiligen sollten .
Deutschland habe die Mitwirkung an dieser NATO - Übung beendet , ohne deutsche Beteiligung fortgesetzt worden sei .
Nichts davon sei je in die Öffentlichkeit gedrungen .
Es gab im Regierungsbunker noch weitere WINTEX / FALLEX - Manöver der NATO .
Erst 1990 habe man sie endgültig beendet .
IALANA begrüßt die Enthüllungen des CDU - Politikers .
Solche Offenbarungen von Insidern sind in der Militär - und Sicherheitspolitik von besonderer Bedeutung .
Dadurch wird die Bevölkerung in die Lage versetzt , skandalöse Vorgänge dieser
Art kritisch zu diskutieren , auch um daraus Schlussfolgerungen für ihre Wahlentscheidungen zu ziehen - .
Im Bereich der NATO - Nuklearpolitik ist dies besonders wichtig , weil die deutsche Bundesregierung – trotz des von Deutschland in Art.
II des Atomwaffensperrvertrages und im sogenannten Zwei-Plus - Vier - Vertrag völkerrechtlich verbindlich erklärten Verzichts auf jede unmittelbare und mittelbare Verfügungsgewalt über Atomwaffen – weiterhin auf seiner „ nuklearen Teilhabe “ im Rahmen der NATO beharrt .
IALANA
Zur „ nuklearen Teilhabe “ gehört , dass Deutschland nach wie vor in der „ Nuklearen Planungsgruppe “ der NATO mitwirkt ( Nuklearer Teilhaber Deutschland ) .
Zudem werden in geheimgehaltenen Bunkern in Deutschland immer noch eine unbekannte Anzahl Atomwaffen mit einer vielfachen Zerstörungskraft der in Hiroshima und Nagasaki eingesetzten Nuklearwaffen gelagert .
Diese können im Spannungs - oder Kriegsfall von den US - Streitkräften auch deutschen Einsatzkräften der Bundeswehr für den Abwurf auf feindliche Ziele entgegen den Regelungen des Atomwaffensperrvertrages zur Verfügung gestellt werden .
Die Bundeswehr hält ferner nach wie vor Atomwaffenträger in Gestalt der Tornado - Flugzeuge bereit und übt regelmäßig mit einem im rheinland - pfälzischen Büchel stationierten Luftwaffenverband Atomwaffeneinsätze .
Am 8 . Juli 1996 hatte der Internationalen Gerichtshofs entschieden , dass der Einsatz und die Androhung des Einsatzes von Atomwaffen grundsätzlich völkerrechtswidrig sind und alle Mitgliedsstaaten des Atomwaffensperrvertrages nach dessen Art. VI daher verpflichtet seien , unverzüglich Verhandlungen über eine vollständige nukleare Abrüstung aufzunehmen und zu einem positiven Abschluss zu bringen .

Die „ nukleare Teilhabe “ verstößt nach der Entscheidung auch gegen den Atomwaffen - Nichtverbreitungsvertrags :
Jeder Nichtkernwaffenstaat , der Vertragspartei ist , verpflichtet sich , Kernwaffen und sonstige Kernsprengkörper oder die Verfügungsgewalt darüber von niemanden unmittelbar oder mittelbar anzunehmen .
Artikel II
Die auf dem Fliegerhorst Büchel praktizierte nukleare Teilhabe stellt eine „ mittelbare Verfügungsgewalt über Kernsprengkörper “ dar und ist damit völkerrechtswidrig , da die Bundesrepublik zu den im Vertrag genannten „ Nichtkernwaffenstaaten “ gehört .
Die Bundesrepublik ist ihrer Verpflichtung aus dem Atomwaffensperrvertrag seit rund 35 Jahren nicht nachgekommen .
Sie ist demnach , wie auch alle Atomwaffenstaaten , permanent vertragsbrüchig .
Auch angesichts der Ankündigung von US - Präsident Obama , eine atomwaffenfreie
Welt erreichen zu wollen ( Barack Obamas Prager Frühling ) , fordert die Juristenorganisation die Bundesregierung deshalb auf ,
endlich gegenüber der US - Regierung und den zuständigen NATO - Stellen darauf hinzuwirken , dass alle Atomwaffen aus Deutschland und den anderen Nicht - Atomwaffenstaaten abgezogen und dass alle Bundeswehrübungen von Atomwaffeneinsätzen , etwa mit den Tornados der Bundesluftwaffe , sofort eingestellt werden .
Ferner muss die NATO - Nuklearstrategie grundlegend verändert werden , um den völkerrechtlichen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden , die sich aus der Entscheidung des Internationalen Gerichtshofs vom 8 .
Juli 1996 ergeben .

( Alexander Bahar )
Subtitled " The Zen of not messing up your strings " .
Handling non-ASCII strings in Perl 5 is a real pain , because there are no real separate types for binary data and text strings .
Mostly the operation provides a context of either binary or string processing , but function like length do n't , so the answer is dependent on internal representations about wich the programmer should never care .
In the Perl 6 language design we decided not to repeat that mistake .
Since Strings are objects like everything else , it 's easy to invent new types .
So in essence we have two types relevant for our discussion , Str and Buf .
Str
A Str is notionally a sequence of characters , or a text string .
There 's no character encoding attached to it , and while it is surely stored in a specific encoding scheme internally , it 's nothing that programmer cares about .
A Str co-exists on two ( at least ) two levels , on codepoint and grapheme level .
A codepoint is everything that the Unicode consortium has assigned a number and a name , like U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E or U+0300 COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT .
A grapheme is either a codepoint or a sequence of codepoints that are visually represented together , for example the two codepoints mentioned before would be printed as a single grapheme è .
The default level is grapheme , because that 's closest to how humans usually think of characters and text .
Specific operations can override the default abstraction level , or it can be adjusted by pragmas like use codes ; .
Buf
Of course you can also handle binary data in Perl 6 .
Such data is stored in objects of type Buf .
Notionally a Buf is a list of integers of a fixed size .
It has subtypes for common sizes buf8 is a sequence of unsigned bytes , buf16 and buf32 store unsigned 16 and 23 bit integers .
When you communicate with anything outside of Perl 6 , you 'll need Buf objects for that , because files and terminals only understand byte streams , not character streams .
There are also a different kind of Buf s which enforce a specific encoding , for example utf8 can only hold byte sequences which can be interpreted as UTF - 8 .
They are not strictly necessary , but provide a nice , convenient interface for some operations .
Conversion
Conversion between Str and Buf is called encoding , the other way round is called decoding .
For example " møøse " is a Str , and " møøse " .encode ( ' Latin - 1 ' ) returns a Buf , more specifically a buf8 .
On the other hand if you read some bytes from a socket and want to treat the result as a text string , you decode it : my $ str = $ buf.decode ( ' UTF - 16LE ' ) .
Mixing a Str and Buf that does n't know about its own encoding in an operation like concatenation or comparison throws an exception , because those are the conditions where most Perl 5 programs mess up strings beyond all repair .
IO
If you read the above , maybe you think that printing a Str to standard output is an error because the string does n't know its encoding , so it can't represented as a byte stream .
That 's only half the truth ; the output handle can also have knowledge about its own encoding .
When you open a file , you can either specify that it 's opened as a binary file , or you specify an encoding .
In the former case reading from the handle returns Buf s , in the latter Str s .
For the sake of convenience a pseudo encoding called Unicode exists .
( Yes , we know that Unicode defines a character repertoire , not a character encoding ) .
If there 's a byte order mark ( short BOM ) at the start of the stream , it is used to determine the encoding .
If not , a very simple autodetection is used :
If the file is obviously UTF - 16LE , UTF - 16BE or UTF - 32 ( detectable by the position of the zero bytes when encoding ASCII characters ) then the detected encoding is used , otherwise as a fallback UTF - 8 is used .
This autodetection scheme is the default .
Conclusions
We learned from the experience that cramming too many different semantics into a single data type is harmful .
So now byte streams and text streams have different data types , and a clean interface for converting back and forth .
The specification is not set in stone so far , and no compiler implements the Buf type yet , but it is already planned for Rakudo .
Since this is an important topic to me I will continue to nag the implementors and language designers about it , and write tests to ensure a solid implementation .
A metal rod protrudes through the skin
The breakthrough , developed by researchers at University College London , allows the prosthesis to breach the skin without risk of infection .
The team says early clinical trials have been " very promising " .
It hopes the work - which is to be published in the Journal of Anatomy - may help survivors of the 7 July bombings , as well as other amputees .
The work paves the way for bionic limbs which are controlled by the central nervous system .
In the deer antlers it is very much to do with the structure and shape of the bone , and the porosity of the bone
Dr Paul Unwin
The metal implant passes through the skin and the artificial limb can be directly attached to it .
Currently , artificial limbs are fixed or strapped to an amputee 's stump .
Risk of infection , which could be caused by bacteria passing from the external limb through the rod to the bone , is avoided because the skin tissue meshes around the rod to form a seal .
Deer antlers
To work out how to attach live tissue directly to metal , the scientists from the Centre for Biomedical Engineering , UCL , led by Professor Gordon Blunn and Dr Catherine Pendegrass , looked at how deers ' antlers can grow through the animals ' skin without infection .
The scientists based their design on the bone in a deer 's antlers
Dr Paul Unwin , managing director of Stanmore Implants Worldwide , a medical devices company that worked in collaboration with the scientists , said : " The mobility of tissue is a big factor ; you do n't want the tissue to rip away from the piece of metal , so you need a structure under the skin that will allow the dermal tissues to attach into the metal .
" What we had seen in the deer antlers was that it is very much to do with the structure and shape of the bone , and the porosity of the bone .
" The tissue attaches in with long fibres , and it is like anchors attaching directly into it . "
He said that early clinical trials , which had taken place at Mount Vernon Hospital , Middlesex , on a small group of patients who had lost fingers or thumbs had been very encouraging .
The next stage , he added , would be to carry out trials on upper and lower limb replacements .
He said he expected victims of last year 's London bombing attacks who lost limbs to be involved .
He said that the technology could be widely used for thumb and forefingers in a few years , and upper and lower limb replacements using this method could be in place in five years .
Zafar Khan , chairman of the Limbless Association , said : " As an amputee , residual limbs are currently inserted into a socket , to which a prosthetic limb is attached .
" And when you walk or use the limb there is a movement and that causes rubbing and pressure sores .
The real benefit is that would not happen with this new technique .
" But on the downside , I would still be worried about infection . "
