Following its invasion of Lebanon this summer , Israel was said to have largely lost the PR battle to Hizbullah , but armed with a major web offensive , it 's fighting back
Amir Gissin runs what he calls ' " Israel 's Explanation Department " .
Which is why it is surprising to hear him admit that many Israelis think " the whole problem is that we do n't explain ourselves correctly " .
Last week , as al - Jazeera launched an Arab view of the world into English - speaking homes worldwide , Gissin was a man under pressure .
At the David Bar Ilan conference on the media and Middle East , he faced an audience of Israelis who were unhappy about the way the propaganda battle with Hizbullah was fought and lost during the war in the Lebanon .
They wanted to know how it could be done better next time , because most people in Israel seem to think there will be a next time with Hizbullah soon .
Gissin said the words of his English - speaking spokespeople could not compete with the power of the pictures of civilians killed in the Israeli attack on Lebanese towns like Qana .
And the Israeli parliament will not spend the money on an Israeli counterpart to al - Jazeera .
But Gissin was not down - hearted .
He declared there to be a " war on the web " in which Israel had a new weapon , a piece of computer software called the " internet megaphone " .
" During the war we had the opportunity to do some very nice things with the megaphone community , " he revealed at the conference .
Among them , he claimed , was a role in getting an admission from Reuters that a photograph of damage to Beirut had been doctored by a Lebanese photographer to increase the amount of smoke in the picture .
This was first spotted by American blogger Charles Johnson , who has won an award for " promoting Israel and Zionism " .
To check out the power of the megaphone , I logged onto a website called GIYUS ( Give Israel Your United Support ) last Wednesday afternoon .
More than 25,000 registered users of www.giyus.org have downloaded the megaphone software , which enables them to receive alerts asking them to get active online .
It did not take long for an alert to come through .
A Foreign Office minister , Kim Howells , had issued a press statement condemning that day 's Palestinian rocket attack which killed an elderly Israeli and wounded other civilians .
GIYUS wanted site users to " show your appreciation of the UK's response " .
One click took me to a pre-prepared email addressed to Dr Howells , and a slot for me to personalise my comment .
A test confirmed that the email would arrive at his office , as if I had spotted his comments on a news website , in this case Yahoo , and sent it to him with a supporting message .
In the emails , there would be no indication of the involvement of GIYUS , although Howells may have been suspicious that so many people around the world had read the same Yahoo story about him and decided to email him .
The Foreign Office confirms that emails were received last Wednesday but will not go into any more detail .
The most popular target of the online activists is the foreign media , especially the BBC , the news organisation which they love to hate .
Earlier this year I was a member of the independent panel set up by the BBC governors to review the BBC 's coverage of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
We reported on the high number of emails we had received from abroad , mostly from North America , and the evidence of pressure group involvement .
A majority of email correspondents thought that the BBC was anti-Israel , however if the emails that could be identified as coming from abroad were excluded , the opposite was true - more people thought the BBC anti-Palestinian or pro-Israel .
The BBC has already had one encounter with GIYUS - an attempt to influence the outcome of an online poll .
BBC
History magazine noticed an upsurge in voting on whether holocaust denial should be a criminal offence in Britain .
But the closing date had already passed and the result had already been published , so the votes were invalid anyway .
GIYUS supporters claim success elsewhere in " balancing " an opinion poll on an Arabic website by turning a vote condemning Israel 's attack in the Lebanon into an endorsement .
For some of Israel 's supporters , a primary aim of their war on the web is an attempt to discredit what they see as hostile foreign media reports , especially those containing iconic visual images .
One particular target has been the respected French TV correspondent , Charles Enderlin , whose Palestinian cameraman filmed 12 - year - old Mohammed al - Dura being shot and killed , as his father tried to shield him at the start of the second intifada .
Enderlin accused Israeli troops of shooting and killing the boy .
French supporters of Israel went online to claim the report was a distortion based on faked footage .
His network , France 2 , responded with legal action and , last month , in the first of four individual cases , a French court found the organiser of a self - styled media watchdog website guilty of libel .
Another online target has been the TV footage of bloodshed on a Gaza beach earlier this year .
A Palestinian girl was seen screaming as she saw the bodies of dead family members killed by what Palestinians allege was Israeli shellfire .
When I mentioned the impact of these pictures at last week 's conference , members of the audience shouted " staged " .
One person came up to me afterwards to suggest that the family had somehow died somewhere else and that their bodies had been moved to the beach to be filmed .
Where , for instance , was all the blood ?
I pointed out that I had seen everything that the cameraman had shot and that some pictures were too gruesome to be shown .
It is clear that the government of Israel wants to fight back against the impact of foreign media pictures like these .
Amir Gissin talked last week of plans to get Israeli video onto sites like YouTube which he said were viewed by opinion " shapers " .
And his cousin Dr Ra'anan Gissin , formerly Ariel Sharon 's media adviser , has endorsed the idea of having picture power at the country 's disposal ready for future conflicts .
Referring to Israel 's opponents , he put it in his usual direct way : " You need to shoot a picture before you shoot them . "

Like most Canuckistanis , I , too , have a cupboard full of empty plastic bags in which once groceries nestled happily and , generally speaking , somewhat cooperatively , although it must be admitted there was that one incident between the canned beans and the eggs … but about that we do not speak .
Those are the terms of the settlement , and we do not want to have to deal with a kitchen full of uniformed officers again .
Why , I just got rid of them last night around three .
Well , they were n’t actually in the kitchen , you understand ; no , the plumbers have not yet finished with my kitchen ( week three , but who ’s counting ? ) and so I am keeping everything out of there as instructed ie : remove all items from kitchen , and even though they did not specifically say , ferinstance , “ remove all cops ” still it did n’t say “ remove all cups ” either and I did , so
yeah .
When the man yelled and the gunshot went off , I called the cops .
As one does .
And soon enough they were here , and lo , it is greatly reassuring to all of us who live in raincoaster global hq that even cops ca n’t get in unless we go out and let them in , for yea they tried and tried in vain and eventually the dispatcher just asked me to go out and let them in , which I did .
It was n’t so much Good Cop , Bad Cop : more like Mutt and Jeff Cop , or Mute Cop , Loquacious Cop , or She ’s A Chick , You Talk To Her Cop , I ’m A Chick Cop , I ’ll Handle The Talking Cop .
But they checked things out , gave their professional opinion that the place was bloody impenetrable except ( and this is so useful , I should call the cops more often ) for that spot in the back corner of the parkade where the razorwire was beat down and that ’s where the binner is getting in , so yeah , gotta report that to the manager when he ’s back on duty , asked me yet again if I knew a gunshot from a smashed window , and then they left , telling me they ’d phone if they found out anything more about the gunshot incident .
Which , when you consider the roaring engine which immediately followed the shot , is unlikely .
Walking them back to the front door , through the hallway , I ran across a couple of my neighbors getting home and you know , lovely people , but that ’s just too late for a girl that young to be out , even if it ’s not a school night , but anyway , they nodded agreeably at me in Cantonese , as they always do , and I nodded back in Canadian , and they took in the two large , uniformed persons walking slowly behind me and did rather a double take , although I was not aware that the Chinese had such a concept : I thought it was a Jewish thing from New York , but anyway , to assuage their fears , be they in whatever language , I said , “ Oh , just out on the street , nothing here ” and they laughed , for indeed , what goes on out on the street is pretty much a joke , and then they nodded to us all in Cantonese and went into their apartment .
Where was I ?
Oh yes , at no point did the police enter my kitchen .
Just want to be clear about that .
Had they done so , they might have asked me why I had a cupboard so full of plastic grocery bags that I can barely close it .
And I would have replied , of course , I do n’t have a dog .
Every now and again I get all fired up about the planet and shit , and take a whopping sackful of these things over to Maclean Park , the park where dogs are not allowed .
You can identify it by the fact that there are always dogs there .
Why does n’t the City give up , I ask you ?
Some of them at City Hall have actually given up , as in one corner of the park , attached to the chainlink fence around where home plate would be if anyone played baseball there , which they do n’t as it is always full of dogs who would run off with your ball and then where would you be , eh ? is a little plastic contraption with a small , official - looking sign suggesting that you deposit your plastic bags there , for unspecified but easily imagined “ keep the park clean ” uses .
So that ’s what I do with my plastic bags .
This is what I obviously SHOULD do with my plastic bags .
Particularly as I look good in an A - line .
This lovely performance art piece has been brought to you by mleak
This was a project I started this summer .
I began by collecting grocery bags , which I cut into sheets and ironed together to form a fabric , and then I used them to sew this dress , with a design loosely based on a 50s housewife style .
Then I took it shopping …
Most people just gave me strange , long looks , but a few asked me about it .
Most just wanted to know if I was a designer , or what ( I love how “ I ’m an art major ” seems to be an excuse for anything ) .
One of the employees wanted to know where he ( ? ) could buy it , and then there was this one very curmudgeony old guy who started talking about industrial disposable aprons and saying “ This is n’t anything new !
This is n’t anything new ! ” I love my neighborhood .

Idiocratic Design
It is early in 2007 but the funniest ( and most scathing ) movie I have seen all year is without a doubt Mike Judge ’s — of Beavis and Butthead , King of the Hill and the turn - of - the - century - defining Office Space fame — latest effort : 2006 ’s Idiocracy .
A movie that , apparently , no one wants you to see , as it premiered with an extremely limited release ( in seven cities on a mere 125 theaters ) with no promotion from its studio ( 20th Century Fox ) , no screenings for critics and , as it released on DVD this February , still not a marketing peep to push sales or rentals .
But then again , who wants to see a movie about a future 500 years in the making — but unnervingly current — where stupidity , laziness , horniness and perverse , dictatorial branding have rendered society , government and etiquette into a messy , procrastinating and doomed world that has succumbed to sleazy pleasures and is dominated by corporate and retail companies , surrounded by mountains of garbage , and defined by language that has become the lowest common denominator of a combination of “ hillbilly , valley girl and slang ” ?
This is the world that the main character , played by Luke Wilson , and his prostitute partner - in - misery , played by Maya Rudolph , have woken up to 500 years after a military experiment to freeze their most competent men and women has , of course , gone awry .
An early montage paints the picture : A franchise of the suburb - friendly chain , Fuddruckers , is built on top of the military base and metamorphoses in a five - century - long process into a bubbly - lettered , now oddly - coloned Butt : Fuckers .
But Fuddruckers actually had it easy .
Everything in America , as we know it , has deteriorated to its exaggerated ( but nonetheless potentially realistic ) possibilities in this dystopian movie : Costco is the size of a small village and sells livestock , Carl ’s Jr. is the sponsor of the government which is now run by a porn star , a faux Gatorade - like product has replaced water , and civilians ( and the President of the U.S.A. ) happily fire automatic weapons into the air in celebration — or to get someone ’s attention .
What makes this movie so funny ( and scary ) is that we can imagine living in a world like this ; environments like Blade Runner , Minority Report or Children of Men are easier to dismiss as something that our grandchildren ’s grandchildren will have to face on their own and are perhaps easier to cope with , unlike Idiocracy where , despite its cheesy computer - generated imagery , we are drawn into this silly world — rubbernecking as it wrecks in its feasibility .
Still , I snickered and guffawed throughout the movie as Mike Judge hazes American culture , barraging through — and dragging it to its most asinine extremes — everything in his path : Economics , entertainment , health , food , politics , linguistics and even , to my sustained amusement , the visual and graphic language with which we communicate .
The movie spares no detail in the satire of branding and graphic design , turning every logo , sign and poster into a dumbed - down , Web 2.0 - ish , futuristic - looking style that may come sooner than 500 years from now .
Either a designer with a wicked sense of humor was hired to create the myriad of logos of real and invented corporations , or they simply tagged LogoWorks and asked them to do their best work .
Whichever case , Idiocracy displays some of the best graphic humor to appear in a feature film .
Here are some of my favorite screen - captured moments :
Signage on a hospital facade that does n’t fit .
But , I mean , has n’t this happened to all of us ?
Who has n’t run out of room when trying to hand - letter a sign ?
Brawndo , the faux - Gatorade product italicizes an italic for a gravity - defying slant !
Do check out the kerning in “ Mutilator ” , and the lower case “ i ” in an otherwise uppercased ad .
Carl ’s Jr. once friendly star is now adamantly pissed off .
Must be because one of its arms fell .
Cool Carl ’s Jr. swag .
But then again , everybody wears heavily branded T - shirts in this movie …
Hmmmm , Not much different from today ’s irony - clad apparel actually .
Probably does n’t make the cut as the “ most beautiful money in the world ” but , man , this is so money .
When the Police car first came out I knew this was going to be one of the best movies ever .
I ca n’t wait for the day when the N.Y.P.D. adopts some blackletter , bling and badass curly - cues as their identity .
New York ’s finest would look fine in these uniforms if you ask me .
Some of the funniest visual jokes are of existing brands and their corresponding idiotic makeovers .
Starbucks ’ mermaid is now as pissed as Carl ’s Jr. star and has replaced her crown with some sort of comrade beret and the typography has gone to the deep ends of poor taste and the shallow waters of leet speak with that “ 8 ” standing in for the “ B ” .
H&R Block retains its green square but has gained a multitude of bevels and shadows ( sound familiar ? ) and is now rendered in a kickass futuristic typeface with , count them :
One , two three strokes .
Costco , disappointingly , could actually be a redesign that would take place this decade in this way , perhaps without the multi-strokes .
Here , we see three logos : Pepsi , which looks like it came out from the T.26 library ; American Express , which must have been designed by the same agency that did H&R Block ; and SBC , which , in this context , looks deliciously old - school .
Hard to spot but , here at the top of the frame , we have FedEx getting the triple -x treatment , and it looks like the company has switched to shipping Ground only .
Yes , you are right , this logo is exactly like the 2007 version .
This is funny .
But not funny - haha .
Funny - sad .
Fox News as you may know is part of Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corporation , the same empire that owns the studio that made this movie , 20th Century Fox .
How sad that they could not play along .
This simply looks to be another manifestation of the problems that the studio had with this movie .
However , the tracking on “ channel ” is quite stupid .
Another laugh - out - loud moment was when the main characters ride the “ Time Masheen ” and come to a diorama explaining how the U.N. ( pronounce here as Unh ) saved the world by Uhn- nazing the Nazis .
The scene also reminded , in a non-funny way , of this poster by Israeli designer Yossi Lemel :
Perhaps not the most healthy and balanced recommendation , but at least it ’s a lot clearer than the USDA’s .
Despite his good intentions in the movie , Luke Wilson is the most hated habitant for the longest part of the movie in this mad mad world — I will spare you the details in case you do see this movie — becoming the most wanted criminal for the reasons listed in the frame below .
And I ca n’t help but think that this blink - and - you ’ll - miss - it frame is essentially the most important in the movie and the one that carries the heftiest moral :
The world will end up like this if we keep being dicks and fucking up lots of shit .
As designers we ca n’t do much to save the world but let ’s try to not fuck up lots of shit and not be dicks .
That ’s my biggest lesson for 2007 .
But it ’s still early in the year .

IF THERE were a club for pariah regimes , those of North Korea and Myanmar would be founder members .
As it is , it is tempting to ask if they have some secret channel for exchanging notes on how dirt - poor , vicious , dangerous dictatorships can fend off external pressure .
In practice , in the self - reliant spirit venerated in North Korea as juche , each has mastered the art by working it out for itself .
In Hanoi last month Condoleezza Rice , America 's secretary of state , linked the two , advising them both to follow Vietnam 's example and join in “ the prosperity of the region ” .
Diplomats and statesmen have to devote an extraordinary amount of time to dealing with them , among the world 's nastiest regimes : a dynastic communist kingdom , and a kleptocratic , superstitious junta .
Equally extraordinary has been the lack of positive results .
Years of painstaking diplomacy designed to ensure that North Korea did not acquire the bomb blew up in a radioactive haze in October .
Efforts to persuade Myanmar 's junta to be nicer to its people and to curb its miserable exports of refugees , heroin and AIDS have been utterly unavailing .
The outcasts share three principal survival stratagems .
The first is to exploit divisions among the foreigners .
North Korea walked a tightrope through the cold war by playing off the Soviet Union against China .
Now it uses its neighbours ' fears of its total collapse to resist American demands for harsher sanctions .
This week , only two months after North Korea 's nuclear test , South Korea 's “ unification ” minister , Lee Jong - Seok , part of whose job seems to be to ensure that unification remains in the distant future , hopped across the demilitarised zone .
He was visiting a South Korean - financed tourist resort at Mount Kumgang , an important source of foreign exchange for the government , and hence for its bomb factories .
Russia , meanwhile , was refusing to comment on a report in a Japanese newspaper that Pyongyang had offered it exclusive rights to deposits of natural uranium , in exchange for diplomatic support at talks on North Korea 's nuclear programme .
Myanmar is similarly blessed with squabbling interlocutors .
A decade ago South - East Asian diplomats , to justify their contentious decision to invite Myanmar into their regional club , ASEAN , argued that otherwise the country would become a cockpit of Sino - Indian rivalry .
The upshot has been that it has become a cockpit of ASEAN - Sino - Indian rivalry instead .
Any international sanctions against the regime have been undercut by the “ engagement ” of its neighbours .
Part of this stems from commercial greed for Myanmar 's timber and gas , part from a strategic fear of the growing influence of rivals .
AFP
Dirt - poor in Naypyidaw
But engagement is not holding Myanmar 's generals back from further isolation .
Last year without explanation they moved their capital away from Yangon , to Naypyidaw in the remote mountains .
( Perhaps they feared invasion .
Perhaps their fortune - teller thought it a good idea . )
In October they told the International Committee of the Red Cross to close its field offices , cutting links with even the most scrupulously neutral and discreet of international humanitarian groups .
Yet — and this is the second stratagem — to avert further sticks , there must be a smidgen of hope that carrots will work .
So , last month , the junta did allow a senior United Nations official a rare glimpse of Aung San Suu Kyi , the detained , election - winning , opposition leader .
Similarly , despite its officials ' occasional unguarded comments that North Korea has no intention of renouncing its nukes , Pyongyang has to hold out some flicker of hope of a deal .
Such a deal — economic assistance in exchange for abandoning the bomb — would obviously serve the interests of the people of North Korea .
But that , of course , is the third shared stratagem : ignore the people 's interests , and lock up , torture or kill those who might voice them .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Despite the Bush administration ’s insistence it has no plans to go to war with Iran , a Pentagon panel has been created to plan a bombing attack that could be implemented within 24 hours of getting the go - ahead from President George W. Bush , The New Yorker magazine reported in its latest issue .

The special planning group was established within the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in recent months , according to an unidentified former U.S. intelligence official cited in the article by investigative reporter Seymour Hersh in the March 4 issue .
The panel initially focused on destroying Iran ’s nuclear facilities and on regime change but has more recently been directed to identify targets in Iran that may be involved in supplying or aiding militants in Iraq , according to an Air Force adviser and a Pentagon consultant , who were not identified .
The consultant and a former senior intelligence official both said that U.S. military and special - operations teams had crossed the border from Iraq into Iran in pursuit of Iranian operatives , according to the article .
In response to the report , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said : “ The United States is not planning to go to war with Iran .
To suggest anything to the contrary is simply wrong , misleading and mischievous .
“ The United States has been very clear with respect to its concerns regarding specific Iranian government activities .
The president has repeatedly stated publicly that this country is going to work with allies in the region to address those concerns through diplomatic efforts , ” Whitman said .
Pentagon officials say they maintain contingency plans for literally dozens of potential conflicts around the world and that all plans are subject to regular and ongoing review .
The article , citing unnamed current and former U.S. officials , also said the Bush administration received intelligence from Israel that Iran had developed an intercontinental missile capable of delivering several small warheads that could reach Europe .
It added the validity of that intelligence was still being debated .
The article also included an interview conducted in December with Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah , who said that while he had no interest in initiating another war with Israel , he was anticipating and preparing for another Israeli attack sometime this year .
Israel launched a cross - border offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon last July .
Nasrallah also said he was open to talks with Washington if such discussions “ can be useful and influential in determining American policy in the region , ” but they would be waste of time if the purpose was to impose policy .

レポジトリの準 備
サーバ側で公開するレポジトリを手元で作り , サーバにコピーする .
その際にサーバ側で必要な設定( hgrc の記述 ) も済ませておく .
# クライアント側 : $ mkdir hello-hg $hg init hello - hg $ vi hello - hg / .hg/hgrc
hgrc の中味はこんなかんじ ：
[ web ] push_ssl = false allow_push = *
" allow_push = * " は任意のユーザにチェックイン( push ) を許す設定 .
アクセス管理は apache に任せるので , ここでは素通ししていい .
" push_ssl = false " は push の際に SSL を使わず素の HTTP を許す設定 .
このサーバは SSL を使えないから仕方なし .
準備ができたらレポジトリをまとめてサーバにコピーする.
# クライアント側 : $ tar cvzf hello - hg. tgz hello-hg $ scp hello - hg.tgz ....
サーバ側でそれを適当な場所に展開する. ついでに CGI から書き換え可能なアクセス権を与える .
# サーバ側 : $ cd ~/work / $ tar xvzf ~/tmp/hello-hg.tgz # hello-hg ディレクトリができる $ find hello - hg - type d | xargs chmod 777 # おおざっぱすぎるかも ... $ find hello -hg - type f | xargs chmod 666

マニュアルによると , ローカルレポジトリの .hg / hgrc に設定を書けばいいらしい .
( 私はまだ試してない . )
[ http_proxy ] host = proxy.example.com:8080
ざっとみたところ , Mercurial は GET と POST しか使わなそう .
この素朴さも Mercurial の利点になるかもしれない .
( . htaccess のサンプルは PUT もチェックしてるけど ... )
Subversion は PROPFIND のようなマイナーメソッドを使うため , 保守的な proxy をくぐれないことがある .
余談
Mercurial は受け入れられつつある .

Mercurial は私の好みにあう .
なのでしばらく応援していきます. まともな GUI クライアントができないかなあ .
会社その他でも勧めやすくなるのに .
By Caroline Wyatt
BBC News , Paris
The French are patriotic and have a strong sense of civic pride I know that it is time to leave Paris because directly above my office desk , right over my head , is a leak .
And not the sort of leak that journalists usually like .
No , this is an unwelcome and persistent drip - a suspiciously brown , watery stain that spreads slowly across our ceiling from a bathroom above .
The BBC office here is in a slightly down - on - its luck apartment block in a chic area of Paris , where the glorious facades of the imposing stone buildings are kept clean by law .
Their inhabitants are commanded to blast clean the elegant outsides every 10 years , to ensure a show of cleanliness in the City of Light .
But beneath the sparkling surfaces , it is a different story - a city of leaks and gently peeling hallways .
The plumber who eventually meandered in to mend the latest leak gave a superb example of the Gallic shrug .
His verdict - what can you do ?
The pipes of Paris are old and rotten , and need to be replaced from top to bottom .
Easier said than done .
Getting our building 's inhabitants to club together to replace eight storeys ' worth of pipes is , well , a pipe dream .
There is no law to make them do it , so nobody bothers .
It is someone else 's problem .
Precious little " solidarite " there then , never mind " egalite " or " fraternite " .
We have simply had to ask the lady upstairs not to bathe too often during office hours .
And soon , I too shall give a Gallic shrug and a rueful smile and pass the leak onto my successor , along with the task of covering the new France .
Urgency of change
But our leak seems a gloriously opportune metaphor for the state of France .
On the outside , everything looks wonderful : a nation whose quality of life and public services , even its high - speed trains , are the envy of the world .
Its family - friendly policies have even given France Europe 's highest birth rate .
But beneath the beautiful facade , much is quietly falling apart .
In 2006 young people protested against employment reforms
This is a country where decades of selfishness - from the trades unions to the political classes and their friends in big business - have brought things to a standstill , leaving a quarter of the young unemployed and many immigrants stuck in outer - city ghettoes , excluded from the workforce .
Not to mention passing on the unaffordable cost of those splendid services to their children and grandchildren , creating an increasingly bitter younger generation who know that they never will have it so good .
It is a state of affairs only just beginning to be slowly and painfully unblocked .
And as President Sarkozy - France 's new chief plumber if you like - surveys the state of the nation , he will find there is rather a lot of work to be done .
For this is a place uncertain of the present and fearful of the future , now realising the urgency of change .
French bureaucracy
I was warned when I first moved here from Moscow that France was the only place , apart from North Korea , that still genuinely believed in communism .
I thought they were joking .
Until I moved here , and discovered that stroppy French officialdom , hatred of the boss class , grumpy shop assistants and supercilious waiters could give even surly Muscovites a run for their money .
Business is waiting to see what Mr Sarkozy does next My first clash with French bureaucracy came in my first week , with the carte de sejour - that precious official document that gave me the right to live and work in France .
Except under EU law , that should have been automatic .
But not in France in 2003 .
Getting it involved an almost daily trip to the local immigration ministry .
A gloomy corridor that resembled the seventh circle of hell became my new home , as I took a seat alongside the other supplicants .
They looked as though they had spent hopeless months bathed in the yellowing light reflected from the 70s orange plastic seating in the grand but decaying municipal building .
On the first day , I brought every document I needed .
Not good enough .
Another day , another hatchet - faced Parisian official in a computer - less office , her face half - obscured by precarious piles of paper .
The only smile came as she told me : " Non , madame , you have n't got your original birth certificate .
We 'll need that too . "
On the third day I was rebuffed again : a crucial document was in English - it had to be in French .
On the fourth day , I came well - armed with every official - looking piece of paper I possessed .
" Voila ! " I crowed .
" Every document in triplicate , just in case ! "
The official looked up , grunted and finally grudgingly stamped the treasured carte de sejour into my passport .
He then allowed himself the smallest of smirks .
" Voila , madame .
Your carte de sejour .
Although from today , you 'll find you no longer need one to work in France .
The rules have just changed . "
Outward perfection
Yet , four years on , I have come to love France and even the French themselves in all their contradictions , their public rudeness and private courtesy and warmth - though perhaps not Parisians , a species justifiably loathed by the rest of the country .
Caroline Wyatt has been the BBC's Paris correspondent for four years
For a born and bred Parisian , the city is a walkway on which to parade , a stage with all the Parisians in it players , and tourists or foreigners merely a financially - necessary blot on the otherwise perfect city .
Except that the elegantly - attired Parisians walking their obnoxious fluffy dogs barely seem to notice as their pet piles up the excrement on the pavements , wafting past in a cloud of perfume , oblivious to the muck below .
But perhaps Paris has changed me too , as these days I very rarely step in it any more .
And I can waft past with the best of them .
When I first arrived , I used to go to work wearing trainers and trousers for my bike - ride .
But years of unconcealed sneers from poodle - toting Parisians , clacking past on kitten heels as they took in my sad British appearance , made me realise : never mind the inner beauty , outward perfection counts here .
That French perfectionism has its benefits though .
I began writing this on a train - a TGV whizzing me to the south , from Paris to Marseilles in just three hours .
A French TGV went 356 mph to break a world record in April A smartly - dressed conductor inspected my ticket and wished me " bon voyage " in a peaceful carriage in which mobile phones were banned .
Anyone using one was frowned out of the carriage in shame .
Bliss .
It was a brand new train , the interior designed by no less than Christian Lacroix - probably the closest my bottom will ever get to one of his expensive creations .
Yet the ticket cost less than 60 euros ( £ 40 ) return , and the train arrived bang on time .
The SNCF may be proof of a command economy , but that belief in well - run public services - and providing the means to get to work on time - still makes France one of the most productive nations in Europe .
Civic pride
For the past decade or so , the French have looked across to Britain with a curious mix of envy of our economy , and pity for the state of our public services and public spaces - not to mention scorn for " le binge drinking " .
A sense of civic pride is one of France 's most enduring qualities .
As almost every British family moving here to re-conquer the French countryside house by house will notice , nearly every village has an immaculate green , and a flag hanging proudly from the mayor 's office .
The French may grumble that the state spends too much and employs too many , but they can see where the tax money goes , whether to local doctors who still pay home visits day or night , or schools that produce children who can read and write .
Yet there is a limit to what even the French state can do , although not everyone wants to believe it .
Driving from Marseilles along the winding roads of the southern coast to the Languedoc region , we went on the trail of France 's " wine terrorists " , a shadowy , improbable group called the CRAV , who demanded that President Sarkozy raise the price of wine - or else .
Belief in the state
Their demand showed a touching , and perhaps not so misplaced , belief in the power of the French state .
President Sarkozy recounts in his most recent book what he calls the ' historic day ' , when - as finance minister - he called in the major supermarket chains and made them lower the price of groceries .
Little wonder he was elected President .
I am not sure the same could happen in Britain - nor would people expect it to , with market forces deemed to be beyond anyone 's control .
But not in France .
There is a belief that the government can and must stand up to the worst aspects of globalisation and temper the wilder ravages of capitalism for the public good .
On a hot southern afternoon , the neatly - combed vineyards of the Languedoc shimmering in the haze , we meet small independent wine - growers who will not admit to being members of the CRAV , but clearly support the group 's demands .
" My family has taken care of these fields for generations , " one tells me , " but I am the first not to be able to make a living from them .
And yet this is our heritage , and we must pass it on to the next generation to ensure that our children too know what it is to make good wine and look after the countryside . "
French wine - growers go guerrilla
Even the owner of the local chateau agreed that the government must act to preserve their way of life .
Surveying the perfectly - groomed lawn outside the family castle , Jean - Marc Ribet poured another glass of Chateau de la Vernede and condemned falling wine prices and rapacious middlemen with equal vigour .
Yet he no longer sells his wine in France - the customers are too poor , and the mark - up too big for most French on small salaries .
Americans are his best customers .
But like many now , Monsieur Ribet is optimistic that President Sarkozy will bring change - whether it is making the French value hard work again or lowering their taxes .
Economy a paradox Somehow , though , the economy remains a French paradox .
Its small companies may be hampered by a thousand rules but its big businesses are among the world 's most successful .
Until recently , they have made their money quietly , and spent it discreetly .
The battered Renault outside could belong to the biggest boss or the most junior employee .
Ostentatious displays of wealth have been unpopular in France since Marie - Antoinette 's time .
And the national suspicion of le patron , the boss , is another enduring French trait .
But perhaps the national scorn for the making of large sums of money is what makes this nation so appealing to the overworked British visitor as we come to enjoy a week or two off , watching enviously as the French take the whole of August to enjoy it with their family .
All that though , I suspect , will change .
President Sarkozy has already dismayed MPs by decreeing they must sit in Parliament from June until August , so that he can push his reforms through before the nation shuts down for the holidays .
Passion for food
But some things in France , I hope , will remain eternal .
My friends have teased me for being the BBC's French food and wine reporter , rather than its Paris correspondent , but in truth they are one and the same .
Change France but keep the lunches Food and wine are central to " la vie francaise " , a passion that unites everyone from the street - sweeper to the stockbroker - as vital a part of French life as arguing ferociously over politics , evading your taxes or denouncing your neighbour to the authorities .
" A meal is never just a meal , " confided Le Figaro 's food critic .
" A meal is the story of all the other meals you 've ever had , from the chicken that your mother used to roast when you were young , to the first dinner you shared with your lover . "
And covering France has been a little like that .
Each tale has been a story within a story , mingling layer upon layer of contradictions , and the memories of France 's great times past with its struggle to deal with the future and the changing world outside .
And now , at last , there is a genuine sense of hope that with a new generation in charge , things are moving again .
I am sad to leave without knowing how the story of France under President Sarkozy ends , nor if the leak above my desk ever will be repaired .
But I look forward to my successor keeping me well - informed on the progress of both .

What are these ?
Two emerging space companies have won a NASA competition to provide low cost commercial transport to the International Space Station .
SpaceX , founded by PayPal 's Elon Musk , is developing its two - stage reusable Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft , but it is making changes after the loss of Falcon 1 during its maiden launch .
Rocketplane Kistler 's K - 1 is a two - stage reusable launch vehicle that has been in development for over a decade .
Both companies represent a departure from business as usual at NASA .
Boeing and Lockheed Martin are the largest companies in the aerospace industry and win most NASA contracts .
Here , Dr. Arthur Jensen of our advisory board won the 2003 Kistler Award given by the Foundation for the Future for his contributions to science .
Another UC - Berkeley professor , Dr. Vincent Sarich , whom I recall from a large lecture hall at Berkeley , won the 2004 award .
A strong secondary interest we have is space travel and the commercialization of space , of which cognitive training ( such as with the Cognitive Labs ' tests ) is a component and will only become more important over time to deal with subtle changes in the brain and body .
Here is what we learned at NASA regarding modifications that accrue from space travel .
The cognitive effects are not completely understood ; people such as Dr. Yesavage at Stanford and another expert at UC - Davis have studied consciousness in spaceflight and pilots ; in addition to the former astronauts ( at the Stanford - VA they have a flight simulator for research on interactions between substances and cognitive performance , e.g. , medications for Alzheimer 's effects or even nicotine , and have been a leader in studies of retired Air Force and Naval Aviators )
The effects on the body are known to researchers but not really noticed by the public .
Here are a few effects : 1 . The body loses mass ; the longer you stay in space , the thinner you get .
Weight loss of 50 lbs is not uncommon2 .
Water leaves the tissues of the body2 .
The limbs become longer and thinner3 .
Acclimating upon return to earth can in some cases be fatal , particular if the individual is over 50 years old4 .
Physical anomalies will become worse upon return than before departure
The above related to trips of a year or less to the ISS .
Witnessed effects on longer stays or even a second generation in space ( space baby ) are not yet known , but would presumably be more exaggerated .... for both mind and body
Iraq to bar press from blast scenes
Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday May 13 , 2007 Print This Email This
BAGHDAD - Iraq 's interior ministry has decided to bar news photographers and cameramen from the scenes of bomb attacks , operations director Brigadier General Abdel Karim Khalaf said Sunday .
His announcement was the latest in a series of attempts to curtail press coverage of the ongoing conflict , which has already attracted criticism from international human rights bodies .
" There are many reasons for this prohibition , " he told AFP .
" We do not want evidence to be disturbed before the arrival of detectives , the ministry must respect human rights and does not want to expose victims and does not want to give terrorists information that they achieved their goals , " Khalaf said .
" This decision does not imply a curtailment of press freedom , it is a measure followed all over the world , " he added .
International and local media coverage of Iraq 's deadly sectarian conflict generates dozens of images and reports of carnage every day , as insurgent bomb attacks continue .
A perplexed European asked me a question :
Why , she asked , have there been no general strikes in America to end its aggression in the Middle East ?
Why , she asked , are Americans so unwilling to force their government do what must be done ?
These are not new questions .
Everyone with an inkling of history and a modest awareness of international news realizes that Americans , completely contrary to the foundation myth of the American Revolution , are incredibly docile .
It stings , however , when someone from the outside points out an obvious weakness .
Citizens of other industrialized countries are able to organize national actions to achieve common goals .
Americans at the university , labor , middle class and working class levels , however , seem to be utterly impotent and thoroughly disorganized in any long - term , coordinated endeavor that extends beyond electoral politics .
We literally struggle to organize coordinated national events .
A general strike is one of the most powerful tools of non-violent civil disobedience .
In a general strike all work stops , businesses shut down , consumers do not spend money , teachers and students stay away from school , employees call in sick , lawyers do not try cases , assembly line workers do not assemble , teamsters park their rigs , pilots do not fly , doctors practice only emergency medicine , and commerce grinds to a halt .
General strikes are not violent , but they cause tremendous economic hurt .
When properly coordinated and prepared , they are very persuasive .
General strikes have toppled governments , such as in Argentina , and they have prevented the implementation of anti-labor legislation , most notably in France and in Italy .
Some argue that Americans are simply too economically comfortable to participate in any political action more strenuous that penciling an X on a ballot .
That can not be the answer .
Indeed , the notion that Americans live better than everyone else is part of our national mythology .
Although many Americans reside in spacious ( and heavily mortgaged ) houses and , by incurring massive debt , own lots of " stuff " , citizens of several European industrialized nations live , on average , healthier , more secure lives and work far fewer hours than most Americans .
Certain Asian countries are not far behind .
Notwithstanding their better living conditions , Germans , French , Italians and Spaniards , for example , are still more willing to take concerted political action than are Americans .
There are several reasons for Americans ' complacency and Europeans ' engagement .
The Legacy of Slavery
Labor often takes the political lead in Europe , but not in the United States .
The historical fact of American slavery has resulted in an easily manipulable working class , particularly one that is comprised of ethnically diverse peoples .
By exploiting superficial racial phenotypes , big business interests have turned American workers one against the other .
In the nation 's first hundred years , slavery was a mechanism for controlling " free labor " .
After emancipation , freed slaves ( though hardly free in any real sense of the term ) were used as a cheap labor reserve that both in the South and in the North was manipulated to hold back wages all across the industrial horizon , from Black to White .
By inciting White workers to extreme racial animus against Black " competitors " , business interests succeeded in preventing the creation of a unified labor front that could have benefited everyone
Subsequently , poor European immigrants , women and children have been exploited in the United States for the same reason and in the same way , just as were immigrant laborers imported from China and the Philippines during the industrial expansion of the late 19th Century .
The entire American immigration policy of the 19th Century was an effort to control wages by bringing in cheap labor from overseas , much as " globalized " labor is used today .
In the 21st Century , migrant workers from Mexico , Haiti and Central America now serve the government sanctioned role of restraining wage growth among America 's assembly line , service and agricultural working groups .
Contrary to the more infamous immigrant xenophobes of the Republican Party , big business owners in the United States prefer a legalized " guest worker " system .
That " guest worker " system would permit cheap labor to temporarily enter the United States while preserving the option of throwing that cheap labor away whenever it gets injured , old or demands fair wages or benefits .
Furthermore , the neoliberal globalization of capital permits businesses to move rapidly around the globe pursuing the cheapest labor and the fewest regulations , thus adding to the wage - depressing effect .
Although the best defense against such wage - depressing tactics would be to improve everyone 's working conditions world wide , American labor has , instead , been led down the path of trying to protect its own turf by defending against both immigration and the outsourcing of jobs .
The net effect of these intentionally debilitating efforts has been the lack of pan-labor cohesion that characterizes the American working class .
In a sense , American labor 's class consciousness has been lobotomized .
Labor in America tends to be parochial -- it has been trained , by centuries of racism seeded from above , to shun coordination with workers from different parts of the world .
In sum , by taking the bait of racism , American workers have repeatedly manacled their own legs and ensured their own , and all other labor movements ' , feebleness as a political force .
But the legacy of slavery is not enough , by itself , to explain the docile American .
The Conspiracy Against The Working Class
In the late 19th and early to mid 20th Centuries certain active labor unions ( like the West Coast Longshoremen led by Harry Bridges , the early Steel Workers , the early UAW , United Mineworkers and Cesar Chavez 's United Farmworkers ) were able to coordinate industry wide or regional strikes .
The assertiveness and the successes of these activist unions scared the pants off the ownership class .
As documented by Alex Carey in Taking the Risk Out of Democracy and by Australian university professor Sharon Beder in her books and articles about corporate and professional power relationships , business interests in the United States , such as the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers ( NAM ) , embarked on a long - term program , a true conspiracy to " educate " the American public about the benefits of capitalism and the evils of democracy , socialism and unionism .
It was a well - oiled , well - financed campaign , and , in part , it was a counter - reformist reaction to the increasingly socialized community that was evolving in Europe after WWII .
The decades - long propaganda ( 1 ) effort continues today through the efforts of NAM 's sister organization for the services industries , the ISM ( Institute for Supply Management ) .
Joining the pro-capitalism propaganda campaign are many of America 's best known reactionary " think tanks " like the American Enterprise Institute , the Hoover Institution , the Heritage Foundation , the Discovery Institute and various large and ostensibly benevolent " funding institutions " on whom so many non-profit organizations depend financially .
The concerted effort was highly successful in subverting the American school curriculum , the mass media and American popular culture .
By the 1950s , a majority of Americans thought it proper for the federal government to intervene on behalf of big business to " break " national strikes .
The most well known modern example of these types of manipulation was Ronald Reagan 's mass firing of the air traffic controllers in the 1981 PATCO strike and his use of military air controllers and non-union controllers to destroy the union .
Reagan 's aggressive use of the 1947 Taft - Hartley Act -- a thoroughly labor - hostile statute that persists even to the present day -- was actually applauded by the majority of Americans who , thanks to many years of cultural indoctrination , identified more with the interests of big business than with their own class interests .
Whereas many labor unions in Europe have socialist or communist affinities , contemporary American labor unions have been cowed by the well financed and ceaseless barrage of pro-capitalist propaganda .
As a result , they avoid any political alliance more meaningful than the slightly less business - oriented Democratic Party .
Thus have the ownership class in America , through a concerted campaign of " education " and misinformation , succeeded in steering the American public away from the allure of European style union activism .
But the legacy of slavery and the conspiracy against workers alone cannot account for Americans ' lack of political focus .
Religion as Antidote to Politics
Religion holds the greatest sway over the least politically thoughtful peoples .
This is not an accident .
The particular flavor of religion that dominates in the United States generally preaches doctrines of pacifism , obedience to authority and a focus on rewards in a life after death .
It promotes a culture of minimal secular resistance and maximal secular resignation .
With a strong focus on otherworldliness , passivity and subservience , it is no mystery why American culture and class politics favor religious institutions .
In absolute violation of 1st Amendment prohibitions , churches are granted tax concessions , they receiving federal funding through " faith based " initiatives and are otherwise supported as the main social structure of American society .
Curiously , notwithstanding its overt religiosity , American society is extremely violent in sports , sexual relationships , and crime .
More curiously , beneath the religious veneer of submission , self - abnegation , sacrifice and spirituality lies a capitalist economic system that rewards violence , aggression , materialism , colonialism , self aggrandizement , selfishness and duplicity .
The right wing " muscular " religious movements that have manifested themselves from time to time in United States history are amalgams of all of the social vices described above , plus racism wrapped in " patriotism " , together with the traditional religious submission to secular authority .
These " muscular " religious movements often work in silent partnership with ownership interests in the spheres of big business and politics , often to the disservice of the very people who make up the majority of these movements ' lay membership .
Not all religious institutions are the same .
Since the end of the anti-war movement of the Vietnam War era , the stamp of the moderately " liberal " religious wing has marked many of the " activist " movements in the United States .
Although there is nothing wrong with polite protest , modest acts of very civil disobedience and cordial petitions to government authorities to do the right things , they have been , more often than not , ineffective .
The mythology of meekly petitioning the government to seek redress comports well with the predominant American church mainstream and it has completely overshadowed the concept of the civil servant as the people 's servant .
In other words , the moderately liberal church - led form of civil protest prays for relief just like supplicants would pray for God 's intercession -- on bended knee .
They demand nothing and they would never dream of organizing a national general strike any more than they would threaten their ministers or God herself .
Unfortunately , nations like the United States that have a strong religious bias are also more oriented toward arguments of faith than reason .
If a people are brought up to accept miracles and mysteries at face value , then they are also susceptible to believing the miracles and mysteries of 9 - 11 , the official ( and oft changing ) rationale for America 's Wars of Middle Eastern conquest , and political authority generally .
Rendering unto Caesar what is Caesar 's is not a good foundation for demanding a better material life for the here and now .
Faith in a higher authority also marches with faith in political authority , faith in elections and the judicial system , and an unwillingness to believe that leaders are anything less than wise and well - meaning .
Faith can lead one blindly to accept the mysteries of religion and , when exalted to a level of jingoism , can cause one blindly to accept the mysteries of foreign and domestic policy .
Thus religion , as currently practiced in the United States , no matter how ennobling of the spirit , is frequently a brake on political activity and not the slightest threat to established power .
It tends to dissipate resistance to authority while celebrating the wholesomeness of non-confrontational and supplicating appeals to the other side 's rather dubious souls .
Over time , the spiritual approach to politics can leave people out of practice , exhausted and wholly unused to more vigorous ( but still non violent ) resistance to authority .
Eventually , as they unavailingly beat their heads against institutional walls , citizens ' aspirations and organizational skills may atrophy , they may lose their collective social memory , lose their momentum and lose the self - confidence necessary to assert control of their own destinies .
In many polite American street demonstrations , church groups are in the forefront of organization .
In every European general strike , by contrast , churches rarely play a secondary role , if any at all .
The Fear of Unemployment
Although all of the preceding causes partially explain Americans ' political timidity , probably the single biggest reason why Americans do not take more direct actions like a general strike is their legitimate fear of losing their livelihoods .
In those European countries where the citizens are most politically engaged , they also enjoy the strongest social safety nets .
Whereas Americans depend on their employers for their retirement pensions , unemployment benefits and health insurance , Europeans are generally guaranteed all of that as basic entitlements of citizenship .
These guarantees make Europeans freer than Americans to express their opinions and demand redress from their governments and their employers .
The European social safety nets -- socialized medicine , free or heavily subsidized higher education , public transportation and rich unemployment benefits , among others -- are paid for by compressing the range of income between the working and the management classes , taxing excess personal and corporate income , taxing the added value of manufactured or processed goods sold in commerce ( thus placing the highest tax burden on those who consume the most ) , and by NOT spending a lot of money on the military .
It is no coincidence that when American workers were the most strident ( during the early days of the union movement ) , they also had the worst working conditions and the fewest employment benefits to lose if they were fired .
Currently , any American worker who participates in a general strike stands to lose his or her job in an anemic economy where many jobs are low - paying service positions that provide dismal benefits .
The American striker risks not only her job , but the loss of retirement benefits and , most importantly , health insurance for the worker and the worker 's family .
European workers simply do not have to take that risk .
Whether employed or not ( and their job protections are vastly stronger than in the United States ) , Europeans tend to have extended unemployment and health care benefits that mitigate the fear of unemployment .
Indeed , we should ask :
Why was the American health care system designed as a system of private " insurance " in the first place ?
Why should the American health care system be tied to work ?
Insurance makes sense for allocating risk among people who choose to participate in certain electives like driving a car or owning a house .
Insurance is also appropriate if , upon your own death , you wish to provide money for your family .
Insurance is not a requirement of life because you can live without a car , you can live perfectly well without life insurance and you can rent if you will not own property .
Health care , however , is different .
No matter who you are , no matter how you live , sooner or later you will become old , sick and need medical help .
When you need medical care you will be the least able to afford it .
Why should this be a matter of private insurance ?
And why should this " insurance " be tied to your job ?
Why do Americans always think of health care as a matter of employer provided " insurance " when this is not the way it works elsewhere in the world ?
The answer is precisely because it ties Americans ' health care to their jobs , and by that tie so are they are also tied up .
Americans are understandably afraid to do anything that might jeopardize their employability because there is far more at stake than just a paycheck .
That fear rules out making too many demands on employers , it rules out doing anything that risks the stigma of arrest or criminal prosecution and it certainly rules out the possibility of a general strike .
Americans have been chained to their jobs by the fear of losing health benefits for themselves and their families just as medieval peasants were tied to the land that they were forced to work for others .
The system has been rigged , brilliantly so , to make sure that American workers are forever serfs and forever politically hamstrung .
Polls show overwhelming public support for socialized medical care ( 2 ) in the United States , yet politicians step gingerly all around the subject .
The most that the majority of politicians are willing to do is to expand in tiny increments the preexisting private insurance system .
For that they expect applause , but deserve none .
Retaining the existing health care structure is not just about preserving the profit gravy train for the insurance industry .
Most importantly , it is a well crafted political system that was designed to keep American workers in thrall , in a state of constant insecurity , tied to their paychecks and politically blunted .
For these very reasons , the American system undoubtedly appeals to those in other parts of the world who also would like to weaken or dismantle their own socialized health programs in order make their citizens as tame as Americans are .
Big business will resist any wholesale abandonment of the current American medical care system of employer - based private health insurance unless , in so doing , it can slough off the cost of employer provided medical insurance and put yet another financial handcuff on its employees .
For small and family - owned businesses , however , socialized medicine is a necessary equalizer that gives them the ability to compete in a business landscape that is otherwise heavily weighted in favor of huge corporations .
The European model shows that socialized medicine is essential for a democratic society .
That model also shows that it is affordable in the United States if , as in Europe , we more tightly compress the range of compensation between the working and the management / ownership classes , eliminate the frictional costs associated with the private administration of health care ( 3 ) , fairly and appropriately tax individual and corporate income especially at the highest ranges , impose a value added tax on consumer items , eliminate hidden government subsidies for the likes of energy conglomerates , agribusiness and Wall Street , and , most importantly , drastically reduce military spending .
So long as their necessities of life remain tied to their jobs , Americans will remain docile and there will never be an American national general strike .
So long as Americans are incapable of organizing a national general strike , they will lack one of the most useful non-violent democratic tools to bring their own government to heel .
For the very reason that the present system perpetuates the status quo , those people and entities who profit the most from it will fight tooth and nail to preserve it .
But for that reason alone , in order to begin the process of freeing the American people from a culture of political servility , everyone else should fight tooth and nail for socialized medicine and other basic needs that are totally and unequivocally independent of employment .

ENDNOTES
(1) The word " propaganda " derives from the Latin and is related to the verb " to propagate " , or to multiply , disseminate or breed .
In the 17th Century , Pope Urban VIII instituted a college of Propaganda constituted to educate mission priests around the world .
" Propaganda " was a more or less neutral term until the last century when , as part of a pro-capitalist counter - propaganda campaign , it was " negativized " and associated with communism or socialism .
(2) Socialized medicine in the United States is known as either " universal " health care or " single - payer " health care .
The words " socialized " or " socialist " are strictly taboo in American politics due , in large measure , to the success of the " educational " campaigns of the ownership class described above and the antipathy of the religious institutions to any coherent political creed that challenges their own cultural hegemony .
(3) The notion that the " private sector " is always more efficient than the public sector is another myth propagated by business interests .
Because the private sector requires that " owners " extract " profit " from an enterprise , that profit must come from someplace .
It usually comes from reduced wages of workers , higher worker " productivity " at the cost of employee layoffs , higher consumer prices , a reduction in the quality of goods or services or , most usually , a combination of all four .
Privatized public utility companies with their history of providing less service at higher prices are a good example of how the reality of private enterprise rarely matches its hype .
In the field of private health insurance , William McGuire , the CEO of UnitedHealth Group Inc. , left office last year with a retirement package worth about $ 1.1 billion .
That represents a lot of health care premiums and it is but one example of the private sector 's diversion of assets from the commonwealth to personal wealth .
We have always been told there is no recovery from persistent vegetative state - doctors can only make a sufferer 's last days as painless as possible .
But is that really the truth ?
Across three continents , severely brain - damaged patients are awake and talking after taking ... a sleeping pill .
And no one is more baffled than the GP who made the breakthrough .
Steve Boggan witnesses these ' strange and wonderful ' rebirths
For three years , Riaan Bolton has lain motionless , his eyes open but unseeing .
After a devastating car crash doctors said he would never again see or speak or hear .
Now his mother , Johanna , dissolves a pill in a little water on a teaspoon and forces it gently into his mouth .
Within half an hour , as if a switch has been flicked in his brain , Riaan looks around his home in the South African town of Kimberley and says , " Hello . "
Shortly after his accident , Johanna had turned down the option of letting him die .
Three hundred miles away , Louis Viljoen , a young man who had once been cruelly described by a doctor as " a cabbage " , greets me with a mischievous smile and a streetwise four - move handshake .
Until he took the pill , he too was supposed to be in what doctors call a persistent vegetative state .
Across the Atlantic in the United States , George Melendez , who is also brain - damaged , has lain twitching and moaning as if in agony for years , causing his parents unbearable grief .
He , too , is given this little tablet and again , it 's as if a light comes on .
His father asks him if he is , indeed , in pain .
" No , " George smiles , and his family burst into tears .
It all sounds miraculous , you might think .
And in a way , it is .
But this is not a miracle medication , the result of groundbreaking neurological research .
Instead , these awakenings have come as the result of an accidental discovery by a dedicated - and bewildered - GP .
They have all woken up , paradoxically , after being given a commonly used sleeping pill .
Across three continents , brain - damaged patients are reporting remarkable improvements after taking a pill that should make them fall asleep but that , instead , appears to be waking up cells in their brains that were thought to have been dead .
In the next two months , trials on patients are expected to begin in South Africa aimed at finding out exactly what is going on inside their heads .
Because , at the moment , the results are baffling doctors .
The remarkable story of this pill and its active ingredient , zolpidem , begins in 1994 when Louis Viljoen , a sporty 24 - year - old switchboard operator , was hit by a truck while riding his bike in Springs , a small town 30 minutes ' drive east of Johannesburg .
He suffered severe brain injuries that left him in a deep coma .
He was treated in various hospitals before being settled in the Ikaya Tinivorster rehabilitation centre nearby .
Doctors expected him to die and told his mother , Sienie Engelbrecht , that he would never regain consciousness .
" His eyes were open but there was nothing there , " says Sienie , a sales rep .
" I visited him every day for five years and we would speak to him but there was no recognition , no communication , nothing . "
The hospital ward sister , Lucy Hughes , was periodically concerned that involuntary spasms in Louis 's left arm , that resulted in him tearing at his mattress , might be a sign that deep inside he might be uncomfortable .
In 1999 , five years after Louis 's accident , she suggested to Sienie that the family 's GP , Dr Wally Nel , be asked to prescribe a sedative .
Nel prescribed Stilnox , the brand name in South Africa for zolpidem .
" I crushed it up and gave it to him in a bottle with a soft drink , " Sienie recalls .
" He could n't swallow properly then , but I helped him and sat at his bedside .
After about 25 minutes , I heard him making a sound like ' mmm ' .
He had n't made a sound for five years .
" Then he turned his head in my direction .
I said , ' Louis , can you hear me ? '
And he said , ' Yes . '
I said , ' Say hello , Louis ' , and he said , ' Hello , mummy . '
I could n't believe it .
I just cried and cried . "
Hughes was called over and other staff members gathered in disbelief .
" Sienie told me he was talking and I said he could n't be - it was n't possible , " she recalls .
" Then I heard him .
His mother was speechless and so were we .
It was a very emotional moment . "
Louis has now been given Stilnox every day for seven years .
Although the effects of the drug are supposed to wear off after about two and a quarter hours , and zolpidem 's power as a sedative means it cannot simply be taken every time a patient slips out of consciousness , his improvement continues as if long - dormant pathways in his brain are coming back to life .
I see Louis before his daily medication , yet he is conscious where once he would have been comatose .
Almost blind because of a separate and deteriorating condition , there is a droop to one side of his mouth and brow because of brain damage .
His right arm is twisted awkwardly into his side .
Louis is given a pill , and I watch .
It is 8.30 am .
After nine minutes the grey pallor disappears and his face flushes .
He starts smiling and laughing .
After 10 minutes he begins asking questions .
His speech is impaired because of the brain damage and the need , several years ago , to remove all his teeth , but I can understand him .
A couple of minutes later , his right arm becomes less contorted and the facial drooping lessens .
After 15 minutes he reaches out to hug Sienie .
He pulls off her wedding ring and asks what it is .
" It 's a suffer - ring , " she jokes .
And he says , " Well , if you 're suffering , you should make a plan ! "
The banter continues and he remembers conversations from the previous day and adds to them .
" Louis , " I ask , " do you feel any change in awareness before and after the pill ? "
" No , " he says .
" None whatsoever . "
Whatever is happening , he feels the same .
" How do you know this is your mother ? " I ask , referring to Sienie .
Remember , Louis can not see .
He says : " Because I recognise her voice and I know she loves me . "
Nel was as amazed at Louis ' awakening as everyone else .
A GP in Springs for 40 years , when he is n't seeing up to 100 patients a day , he spends his time restoring vintage cars .
Married with three grown - up children , he has lived in the same house all his life .
" Something strange and wonderful is happening here , and we have to get to the bottom of it , " he says .
" Since Louis , I have treated more than 150 brain - damaged patients with zolpidem and have seen improvements in about 60 % of them .
It 's remarkable . "
After Louis ' awakening was publicised in the South African media , Dr Ralf Clauss , a physician of nuclear medicine - the use of radioactive isotopes in diagnostic scans - at the Medical University of Southern Africa , contacted Nel to suggest carrying out a scan on Louis .
" The results were so unbelievable that I got other colleagues to check my findings , " says Clauss , who now works at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford .
" We did scans before and after we gave Louis zolpidem .
Areas that appeared black and dead beforehand began to light up with activity afterwards .
I was dumbfounded - and I still am . "
Clauss says immediate improvements in the left parietal lobe and the left lentiform nucleus were visible .
In lay terms , these are important for motor function , sight , speech and hearing .
" I remember saying to Dr Nel that we were witnessing medical history , " says Clauss .
No one yet knows exactly how a sleeping pill could wake up the seemingly dead brain cells , but Nel and Clauss have a hypothesis .
After the brain has suffered severe trauma , a chemical known as Gaba ( gamma amino butyric acid ) closes down brain functions in order to conserve energy and help cells survive .
However , in such a long - term dormant state , the receptors in the brain cells that respond to Gaba become hypersensitive , and as Gaba is a depressant , it causes a persistent vegetative state .
It is thought that during this process the receptors are in some way changed or deformed so that they respond to zolpidem differently from normal receptors , thus breaking the hold of Gaba .
This could mean that instead of sending patients to sleep as usual , it makes dormant areas of the brain function again and some comatose patients wake up .
In Kimberley , the once booming home of the De Beers diamond empire , Riaan Bolton 's family heard of Nel 's work after he and Clauss had papers published in the medical journal NeuroRehabilitation and the New England Journal of Medicine several months ago .
Riaan suffered severe brain trauma when he was thrown from a car in a traffic accident in July 2003 .
A keen cricketer and rugby player , the 23 - year - old was studying to become an industrial engineer but still found time to play guitar in a band .
" One specialist said he had a 5 % chance of recovering , another said he had no chance whatsoever of regaining consciousness , " says his mother , Johanna .
She and her husband , Tinus , spend about £ 1,000 a month on round - the - clock care for their son in a converted garage at their home , but until June they had seen no sign of awareness in him .
Then they asked their doctor , Clive Holroyd , to contact Nel for advice .
" There was no movement , no recognition , just nothing , " says Tinus .
" Then we gave him the pill and we noticed him moving the fingers in his left hand and touching them against each other .
His eyes went big and he began looking from left to right .
" The doctor started asking Riaan questions .
He said , ' Look at me , Riaan ' and Riaan looked straight at him and focused on his face .
Then the doctor asked him to move his hand and he moved it .
And then he lifted his head from the pillow and began looking around .
I could n't believe it . "
I watch as Riaan is given his medication .
As with Louis , his face flushes and his eyes begin to sparkle and focus within minutes .
Gone is the 1,000 - yard stare .
He hugs his mother and looks at her face , but even though I am amazed , the family reckon this is n't his best day so far .
They show me a number of DVDs they shot in July .
In them , Riaan responds to questioning , nods and shakes his head , drinks through a straw , often laughs and says , ' Hello . '
He remains severely brain damaged , but there is clear evidence of understanding and communication .
" It has given us hope , " says Johanna .
" To have communication with him again , to know he becomes aware of us and to tell him we love him - knowing he can hear us - is simply beyond belief .
It has been a very moving experience . "
Holroyd remains perplexed .
" There is a measurement of the depths of coma called the Glasgow scale , with three being the worst and 15 being normal , " he says .
" Riaan was six , but within 10 minutes of taking the pill he is up to nine .
It 's simply unbelievable .
And the mind - boggling thing about this is that it 's done with a sleeping pill .
" Some time ago , Riaan had a cardiac arrest and it was a difficult call as to whether or not to resuscitate him .
His mother insisted he should be , and look at him now .
From now on , this will cause serious ethical issues over whether to let such coma victims die . "
Those issues became even more complicated last week , when a British woman believed to be in a persistent vegetative state astonished doctors by responding to their voices .
Although these awakenings are the most dramatic aspect of the zolpidem phenomenon , Percy Lomax , the chief executive of ReGen Therapeutics , the British company funding the South African trials , believes Nel 's work with less brain - damaged patients could be the most significant .
Many stroke victims , patients with head injuries and those whose brains have been deprived of oxygen , such as near - drowning cases , have reported significant improvement in speech , motor functions and concentration after taking the drug .
" The potential for this drug is enormous , " says Lomax .
" ReGen has applied for a patent to use the drug , now out of patent and generically available , for the treatment of secondary brain injury after brain trauma .
The object of the clinical trial is to scientifically establish that the compound works in the way it has been shown to work in individual cases .
It will be carried out on patients known to react well to zolpidem , and by lowering the dosage it is hoped that the sedative side - effects will be reduced but the brain stimulation will still continue .
" It may be that further research will allow us to better understand the way the drug works and to develop a new generation of better - targeted pharmaceuticals . "
He says market research estimates the potential market for zolpidem in brain - damaged patents could top $ 4.3 bn ( £ 2.3bn ) .
The company that first developed zolpidem , Sanofi-Aventis , was contacted by Nel and Clauss but appears to have chosen not to become involved in the trials or the use of the drug on brain - damaged patients .
Instead , the brain scans on up to 30 patients will be carried out at the Pretoria Academic Hospital by Professor Mike Sathekge , head of nuclear medicine , and Professor Ben Meyer , one of South Africa 's most renowned physicians .
" The results so far could be potentially very important , " says Meyer .
" We have never before spoken of damaged cells in the brain going into hibernation - we have thought of them as necrotic , or dead , cells .
But we know cells can go into hibernation in the heart and thyroid , so why not the brain ?
If there are hibernating cells in damaged brains , it may be that this drug helps to wake them in some people . "
In South Africa , I meet a procession of brain - damaged patients who feel the drug has changed their lives for the better .
There is 32 - year - old Miss X , who can't be named for legal reasons .
She suffered four cardiac arrests and hypoxia , a lack of oxygen to the brain , when a hospital 's apparent failure to diagnose a gall bladder problem resulted in her contracting septicaemia four years ago .
She can barely stand , her arms are in spasm , she cannot speak - although her intelligence has not been affected - and the left side of her face droops .
She was given zolpidem for the first time just a week before I see her and her parents say the improvement was such that she has come back for more .
Miss X is given a pill by Nel at 4.37 pm .
By 4.50 the left side of her face is no longer drooping , her eyes sparkle and she smiles broadly .
At 5.02 , her arms have relaxed enough for her to fold them and she is laughing with her parents .
Ten minutes later , she stands up , stretches to her full height and claps her hands .
Using a card keyboard , she spells out answers to questions I have for her .
" Can you use the keyboard more quickly with the medication ? "
She answers : " Yes . "
Does she feel an improvement ?
" Yes , I am not falling over .
I am not coughing so much .
I can swallow easier .
I feel my limbs are much more relaxed . "
But does she feel more tired ?
" No " .
What is she hoping for ?
" To talk again .
I 'd love to be able to call my cats to come to me . "
At 5.22 pm , Miss X issues a long , drawn - out " Wall - eeee ! " and hugs Nel .
Then there is Wynand Claasens , 22 , who suffered severe brain damage five years ago when he was assaulted outside his school .
A series of subsequent strokes left him wheelchair - bound , depressed and aggressive .
He used to be a long - distance runner .
Nel gave him Stilnox for the first time in early July this year .
" I was struggling to walk , my left eye was hanging lower and was smaller than my right eye , I was feeling very angry , I had pains in my knees and I was having trouble going to the toilet , " Wynand says .
" Now I 'm walking with one stick , my face has evened up , I can go to the toilet when I 'm ready and the pain in my knees has gone .
I take one 10 mg tablet each night and I feel about 60 % better . "
The list goes on .
Heidi Greven , who is now 21 , was starved of oxygen to her brain at birth .
Her mother , Babs , says she used to sit in silence , locked inside her own head , never communicating and looking terribly unhappy .
When I meet Heidi , she is walking around , curious about everything .
She examines the shorthand in my notebook .
Although too shy to speak ( she will always be brain damaged ) , she jokes with Nel .
At home , she now chats with her parents .
" I 'll never forget the first time she was given the medication , " says Babs .
" It was in July 2002 .
After 10 to 15 minutes it was like a curtain being lifted from her eyes .
I could n't believe it .
She suddenly started looking around and fiddling with magazines .
Then she went outside the door and looked into the other rooms in the surgery .
She found a portable radio and put it up to her shoulder and began listening to it .
Beforehand , she would just sit there doing nothing .
" That was a Saturday .
When she went to [ a special ] school on the Monday , her teacher sent a note home asking what we had done to make Heidi come alive . "
There are others , too : Paul Ras , a 69 - year - old runner who suffered brain damage after a traffic accident .
Now he is convinced zolpidem is responsible for a recovery that allows him to run races up to 50 km - with only one hip .
And Theo van Rensburg , a 43 - year - old lawyer who suffered severe brain injuries in a car crash in 1991 .
He also suffered a stroke while in a coma for three months .
He took Stilnox in 1999 and reported an improvement in balance , co-ordination , speech and hearing .
" I go horse - riding now , " he says .
He still has difficulty speaking , but I can understand him .
" It 's really good for my balance . "
Finally , I meet 22 - year - old Janli de Koch , whose eyesight was damaged in a car accident in Switzerland in December 2004 .
The injury resulted in a restriction of her visual field to two corners of her eyes ; she cannot see below a certain point , so that she bumps into things and falls over .
Last month , she was prescribed zolpidem and now says she can already see more than she used to .
She hopes the improvements will continue .
In 1969 the neurologist Dr Oliver Sacks used the then new drug L - Dopa to awaken a group of catatonic patients who had survived the 1917 - 1928 epidemic of the mysterious " sleeping disease " , known as encephalitis lethargica .
The 1990 film Awakenings chronicles Sacks ' delight at his patients ' progress and his despair when the medication stops working and they slip back into a catatonic state .
The hope with zolpidem is that the improvements will continue and there will be no regression .
In the patients who have used the medication longest - such as Louis Viljoen and Theo van Rensburg - the signs are that progress continues .
But time will tell .
Perhaps the last word should go to Pat Flores , the mother of George Melendez , the 31 - year - old coma patient who reassured his parents that he was n't in pain after taking Ambien , as zolpidem is known in the US .
He was starved of oxygen when his car overturned and he landed face down in a garden pond near his home in Houston , Texas , in 1998 .
" The doctors said he was clinically dead - one said he was a vegetable , " says Pat .
" After three weeks he suffered multi- organ failure and they said his body would ultimately succumb .
They said he would never regain consciousness . "
He survived and four years later , while visiting a clinic , Pat gave him a sleeping pill because his constant moaning was keeping her and her husband , Del , awake in their shared hotel room .
" After 10 to 15 minutes I noticed there was no sound and I looked over , " she recalls .
" Instead of finding him asleep , there he was , wide awake , looking at his surroundings .
I said , ' George ' , and he said , ' What ? '
We sat up for two hours asking him questions and he answered all of them .
His improvements have continued and we talk every day .
He has a terrific sense of humour and he carries on running jokes from the day before .
" It is difficult to describe how it feels to get someone back who you were told you had lost for ever .
There is a bond that has been restored and it validates our absolute belief that all along George was locked inside there somewhere .
It tells us that we were right and the doctors were wrong .
George , and his personality , were in there the whole time " .
What is persistent vegetative state ?
Though it sounds unkind to refer to a human in such terms , even medical dictionaries define persistent vegetative state ( PVS ) as the condition of living like a vegetable : in other words , existing without consciousness or the ability to initiate voluntary action .
Though people in this state may occasionally give the impression of being awake and sentient , making random movements and opening their eyes and even appearing to smile or cry , they are unable to respond to communication or demonstrate awareness of their environment .
This is different from an ordinary coma , in which the patient 's eyes are closed , and which rarely last more than four weeks .
The other key difference is that a person in a coma has n't necessarily lost all cognitive function ( ie , brain power ) ; they are just temporarily unable to access it .
If they recover - and many do - they may have cognition afterwards .
PVS is the result of irreparable damage to the cerebral cortex - the " thinking , feeling " part of the brain - but it is not to be confused with brain death .
And while the " persistent " bit in the title indicates that the condition , unlike coma , is generally deemed permanent , there are intermittent reports of " recoveries " .
Last week , it was reported that a 23 - year - old woman who has been in a vegetative state since suffering devastating brain damage in a traffic accident was suddenly able to understand speech .
And in 2003 an Arkansas man , Terry Wallis , returned to consciousness 19 years after he was injured in a car accident , stunning his mother by saying " Mom " and then asking for a drink of fizzy pop .
Such breakthroughs are controversial , in both medical and legal circles .
The British Medical Association , for example , currently deems such miraculous events not as recoveries from PVS , but as an indicator of an earlier misdiagnosis .
Because legal systems do not generally equate PVS with death , and diagnosis is difficult , there have been several famous court cases involving people in this condition .
The most high - profile centred on Terri Schiavo , a 26 - year - old Florida woman who went into a PVS after collapsing and suffering a heart attack in 1990 .
In 1998 her husband , Michael Schiavo , petitioned for her gastric feeding tube to be removed ; her parents did not believe the diagnosis and took the case to court to prevent medical care being withdrawn .
Ultimately , the court challenges were unsuccessful and in 2005 Schiavo 's feeding tube was removed , leading to her death .
There is no treatment for PVS .
Instead , the medical team concentrate on preventing infections and maintaining the patient 's physical state as much as possible .
The most common cause of death for a person in a vegetative state is infection such as pneumonia .
For most such patients , life expectancy ranges from two to five years ; survival beyond 10 years is unusual .

In recent weeks , Stippy has been receiving much attention and many comments and questions based around our Tokyo Yakuza Wars and Prison in Japan articles .
One of the questions we received was what is the difference between the Yakuza and the Right - Wing Nationalist groups ?
Are they different parts of the same organization , or are they in fact completely different ?
For the average foreigner living in Japan , both the Yakuza and the Right - Wing Nationalists have very stereotypical images , and are easy to pick out from a crowd .
The Yakuza are big , bulldog types with black glasses , often seen waiting quietly outside or by the bosses car , or in groups in the local Almond cafe .
The Right - Wing Nationalists on the other hand , usually seem to be skinny undernourished guys , wearing a Long Live the Emperor style head bands , who cant say anything unless its standing on a big black vans through a megaphone so distorted that it is impossible to make out a word they are saying .
Despite the obvious differences , the first reaction is to put them in the same group , and assume that the vans , megaphones , Toyota Century cars , shouting in the streets , rallies on public holidays such as National Foundation Day ( 建国記念日 ) , etc are all part of the same overall group , out to scare and control the public , and that they are mostly the same people on the same side of society .
The mass media in Japan also tends to do so by portraying the Nationalists as “ violence gangs ” ( 暴力団 ) .
However , after the recent breakout of Yakuza Wars , and the Rise of Ishihara - style Patriotism in Japan , our research has shown that the two groups are surprisingly different , and have a very complex relationship .
Now , there are elements of the two groups which are the same - i.e. members of both groups who “ wear both pairs of sandles ” .
For example , Yakuza ’s have been know to form ad hoc Nationalist groups for specific purposes , and some members of the Nationalist group who cant make enough money to live , have joined Yakuza gangs .
But in general , they are two completely separate organizations .
The most basic difference is what they are each working to protect .
The Yakuza endeavors to protect its turf .
This turf is an area within a city , and they compete with similar Japanese Yakuza groups for that turf , such as the Sumiyoshi-kai and Yamaguchi - gumi over Nishi Azabu .
On the other hand , the area that the Nationalists attempt to protect is the entire country of Japan .
“ From the Senkaku Islands in the south ( 尖閣諸島 ) , to the Hopporyodo Islands ( 北方領土 ) in the north ” .
( Read here for an amazing Government conspiracy about the Happoryodo ’s uncovered by Stippy . )
Another related difference is that all Yakuza work completely for the benefit and the honour of a Boss , known as an Oya - bun ( 親分 ) 、the top of their own Yakuza organization .
Each Yakuza group in Japan has its own Oya - bun .
No specific knowledge or education is required for this line of work .
However , the Nationalists work with complete and ultimate loyalty to the Emperor of Japan , and act only in the interest of Japan as an independent nation .
To do this successfully , the Nationalists need to study history , philosophy and politics to fully understand exactly what they are attempting to protect .
In the post - war decades , the Nationalists had strong and wealthy organizations , but in more recent decades , it is the Yakuza that have tipped the balance due to both higher membership numbers and greater economic wealth .
The two tipping - points for the Nationalists were in both 1981 and 1997 , with revisions to the Japanese Commercial Code putting a stop to two of the Nationalist ’s most profitable activities , Soukai - ya ( 総会屋 ) , which is where minority Nationalist stock holders arrive at corporation ’s AGMs and cause trouble and extort cash , and also kigyo - mawari ( 企業回り ) , where Nationalist members would sell the organizations internal magazines and publications to corporations .- large numbers of copies at extremely high prices .
This was a large source of income for them which funded their activities , but the new laws diminished their power greatly , and the Yakuza began to take over .
One of the Nationalists main activities , is denouncing in public those who they believe have done wrong by the country , and by the Emperor .
This is where they stand in the middle of a public place , on top of a van , and shout denunciations through a megaphone .
However , in many situations , those person being denounced will seek refuge with the local Yakuza boss , and the boss will call up the Nationalists , and they hit down and talk it out .
Usually they will come to a middle ground of exactly how far the Nationalists are allowed to go in their denouncements .
Although these two groups are different , and work for different causes , there is friction between them .
But this rarely escalates into violence , which is avoided .
As the original founder of the Chuko - juku Aikoku Renmei Nationalist Group ( 忠孝塾愛国連盟 ) famously quipped , in an unfamiliar street , a Yakuza must walk down the footpath with his eyes to the ground , whereas anywhere in Japan , a Nationalist can walk down the middle of the road , with his head held high .
" No one had any idea what this thing was , but everyone in the car
was visibly freaked out by it . "

私は、不登校児の親を支援するボランティア団体をお手伝いしていて、その関係で直接間接にいろいろなケースを見聞きする。それを直接ブログのネタにしたことは無いが、それは、子供の問題というのは千差万別で、ちょっと覗いたくらいで簡単に論じられるようなものではないからだ。
しかし、一方で、不登校の問題は家庭の問題でもあって、その切り口から見ると、むしろ実にワンパターンであると思える所がある。
ひとことで言えば、家庭の中で「お母さん」方は、実に損な役回りを押しつけられているということだ。
今時は、不登校の問題はどこでも認知されていて、単純にお母さんが孤立し途方に暮れるというようなことは無い。学校や行政からの支援は、時に的外れだったりして地域によるバラツキはあるが、とにかく様々な方策がある。夫や親族や地域社会も簡単な問題ではないことは理解していて、有形無形の援助はたくさんある。
しかし、何らかの重要な「決断」を必要とする場面において、ほとんどの場合、お母さんたちはたった一人で物事を判断しなくてはならない。
たとえば、保健室登校などでようやく学校へ行っている子供がいよいよギブアップした時、少なくとも当面は学校へ行かせないし毎朝の行かせる努力も中断する、そういう決断が必要になる場面は不登校に関してたくさん発生する。
これは、 「別に学校へ行くだけが人生じゃないし」とか他人事としては口にしてたような人たちにとっても、いざ自分の子供がそうなった時には、かなりの重荷になる決断である。
そういう決断の時に、お母さんたちは孤立している。
この孤立のあり方は、談合社会の談合的意思決定の中でよく見られる形である。誰も物事の優先順位を明確にしない。たとえば不良債権の処理において、決算の名目上の数字を取るか会社の実質の資産を守りダメージを軽減するか、「どちらも重要だ」と言う野次馬はたくさんいるが、片方を切り捨てることの責任を取る人は誰もいない。
夫や親族は、アドバイスしたり相談にのってくれけど、その「アドバイス」の実態は、責任をシェアすることでも具体的な方策を明解に示すことでもなく、無理難題をふっかける「圧力」でしかない。
状況が変化して、今まで両立していたものが両立しなくなった時、どちらを取るか。会社では、誰かが明確に決断して指示すべきであり、失敗した時は実行者でなくその責任者が責任を負うべきだ。家庭では、みんなが相談して共同責任でリスクを受け入れるべきだ。
ちょっと誇張して言えば、そういう時、多くの夫が「まかせるからお母さんのいいようにしてくれ」と言う。そして、休ませた結果不登校が長びいたり、無理を重ねて子供が原因不明の熱を出したりすると、その決断ミスをお母さんのせいにして批判する。
この巧妙に責任回避しつつ微妙に自分の要望を圧力として伝える術は、談合社会の中では大人の生き方として正解とされている。夫たちは、妻や子供を愛していないわけではないが、ついつい職場における会議の時のようにふるまってしまうのである。会議における意思決定は、参加者が責任を公平にシェアするのではなく、責任者がいないまま押しくらまんじゅうのように物事が決まる。それを家庭でやるから、お母さんが押し出されるようにして決断をさせられ、結果責任を負うことになってしまう。
学校でも支援団体でも、相談に来た女性に「お母さん」と呼びかけるけど、そもそも「お母さん」というこの言葉が、このことのアンフェアさを象徴していると私は思っている。(だから、この文章では無理してその言葉を使っている)
選択を間違えた時の責任を決して個人が負わなくていいようにできている談合社会があれば、誰かを家庭の中での役割で呼ぶことは問題ない。主体も無いけど責任も無いから釣り合っていると思う。そういう社会が残っているなら、誰かの母親に「お母さん」と呼びかけるのは筋が通っている。
しかし、現代の 「お母さん」は決断を強いられ責任を負わされる。しかも、子供のことを完全に理解していて、間違いがなくて当然と思われている。責任を強いるなら、主体であることを認めるべきで、「○○さん」と名前で呼びかけるべきである。名前で呼べば呼ぶ方も呼ばれる方も、時に間違いをする人間であることを認めやすくなる。
もっと極端な例を言えば、たとえば、子供の状況に適した塾なりフリースペースなりが見つかったが、それが遠い所にあって送り迎えが必要だったとする。この場合、「子供さんにはそれが最適だけど、とても時間がかかってお母さんの負担が大きいので、他の所を探しましょう」と言われて、家族はそれを素直に受けいれられるかどうか。「お母さん」自身が素直にそれを受け入れ、家族に余計な言い訳なしで結果を報告できるかどうか。
「 お母さん」は子供のために、生活の全てを犠牲にするのが当然と思われている。どちらも大事な家族だから片方を犠牲にするような解決は本当の解決ではない。そういう発想が普通にできてはじめて、母親を一人の個人として認めたことになる。
談合社会にぶらさがっていれば、自動的に職が与えられ子供が健全に育つような世の中は、もうすでに無い。だから、誰もが、自分が決断をする主体であることを受け入れ、相応の責任を持ちながら助け合わなくてはならない。みんながそこから逃げると誰かに皺寄せがいく。
談合社会では押しくらまんじゅうの果てにすぐ人が死ぬようになり、家庭では「お母さん」という損な役回りから全力で逃げ出す人が増えて、人が生まれなくなっている。
不登校っていうのは、子供が学校に行っても行かなくてもたいした問題ではない。むしろ、この「お母さん」という言葉が象徴する問題の方がずっと根の深い問題だと思う。

マクロな責任感の構造が家庭内に入り込んでいる
そうそう、私が一番言いたいのはそれです。
デリケートな問題なのでうまく書けているか不安でしたが、こういう的確な要約を見ると安心して励みになります。
In a flagrant attack on the longstanding international legal principle that it is illegitimate for any country to expand its territory by military means , the U.S. House of Representatives , by an overwhelming bipartisan majority , passed House Concurrent Resolution 152 congratulating Israel for its forcible " reunification of Jerusalem " and its victory in the June 1967 war .
The resolution , passed by a voice vote on June 5  the 40th anniversary of the Israeli conquest of East Jerusalem and other Arab territories  states that U.S. policy should recognize that Jerusalem is " the undivided capital of Israel . "
There is no mention that Jerusalem  which has the largest Palestinian population of any city and which for centuries served as the commercial , cultural , education and religious center for Palestinian life  should also be recognized as the capital of a future Palestinian state .
The resolution was sponsored by House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Lantos ( D - CA ) , widely recognized as the Democratic Party ’s chief foreign policy spokesman , and co-sponsored by such Democratic Party foreign policy leaders as Howard Bermaen ( D - CA ) , Eliot Engel ( D- NY ) , Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , Joseph Crowley ( D - NY ) , and Middle East subcommittee chairman Gary Ackerman ( D - NY ) .
Israel has formally annexed East Jerusalem and surrounding lands , unlike the rest of the West Bank , which is either under the control of Israeli military administration or the Palestine Authority .
No government outside Israel recognizes this illegal annexation or supports the idea of a Jerusalem united under exclusive Israeli sovereignty .
International organizations and leaders of major religious bodies throughout the world have repeatedly stressed the importance of not allowing Israel ’s unilateral takeover to remain unchallenged .
UN Security Council resolutions 252 , 267 , 271 , 298 , 476 and 478  passed without U.S. objections during both Democratic and Republican administrations  specifically call on Israel to rescind its annexation and other efforts to alter the city ’s legal status .
Given that Article 5 of resolution 478 specifically calls on all UN member states not to recognize Israel ’s annexation efforts , the Democratic - controlled Congress is effectively calling on the Bush administration to put the United States in direct violation of the UN Security Council .
Who Controls Jerusalem ?
Jerusalem has been conquered and re-conquered more than 37 times in its 3000 - year old history .
Yet , with the establishment over the past century of clear international legal principles forbidding such military conquests and of international organizations with enforcement mechanisms , there has been a persistent hope that the fate of Jerusalem could  along with other territories seized by the Israeli armed forces  be resolved peacefully and with deference to international law .
UN Security Council resolution 242 , long seen as the basis for Arab - Israeli peace , emphasizes the " inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war . "
Congress appears to think differently , however .
The bipartisan decision to pass a resolution celebrating Israel ’s military conquest at a time when there is a growing consensus among Palestinians , Israelis , and the international community that a shared Jerusalem is imperative for a durable peace appears to have been designed to undermine the peace process .
As M.J. Rosenberg , director of the Israel Policy Forum ’s Washington Policy Center , observed , " Congress has a role to play in the Middle East … but that leadership is not expressed by resolutions celebrating a war but by using its authority to promote security for Israelis and Palestinians . "
Virtually no one would like to see Jerusalem return to its 1948 - 67 status , when it was divided by sentry posts , barbed wire , and snipers , with neither Israelis nor Palestinians able to cross to the other side .
However , there are a number of other options , including making Jerusalem an international city as originally called for by the UN in 1947 , creating a joint Israeli - Palestinian administration , or repartitioning the city but with full access by residents and visitors to both the Israeli and Palestinian sides .
For example , the Geneva Initiative  signed by such prominent Israeli officials as former Justice member and Oslo Accord architect Yossi Beilin , former Labor Party Leader Avram Mitzna and former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg ( along with equally - prominent Palestinian leaders )  call for Jerusalem ’s Jewish neighborhoods and holy sites to be under Israeli control and the Palestinian neighborhoods and Muslim and Christian holy sites to be under Palestinian control , a position that public opinion polls indicate a majority of both Palestinians and Israelis supports .
An overwhelming bipartisan majority of the U.S. House of Representatives , however , in a clear rebuke of such initiatives , insists that the entire city be under exclusive Israeli control .
This led to protests by more moderate voices in the House .
As Rep. David Price ( D - NC ) put it in the floor debate prior to the vote , since " the idea of an undivided Jerusalem under sole Israeli sovereignty has not been part of any serious peace proposal . . . in the last several years , " the resolution thereby " undermines U.S. efforts to secure the trust of all sides in the search for peace . "
Rep. Lois Capps ( D - CA ) observed how " it has long been understood that a permanent agreement about the Palestinian areas of Jerusalem will be left to final - status negotiations .
. . .
I think we tread on dangerous territory when Congress adopts positions that run counter to issues that have yet to be negotiated . "
Rep. Earl Blumenauer ( D - OR ) was among those noting the irony of the House passing what many would label a pro-Israel resolution that " would place Congress out of step with large parts of the Israeli political spectrum . "
The United States , like all other nations with diplomatic representation in Israel , has its embassy in Tel Aviv pending resolution of the status of Jerusalem .
However , the Lantos resolution calls on President Bush to unilaterally move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem prior to a peace settlement , despite the president ’s recognition , like that of his predecessors , that doing so would sabotage U.S. diplomatic efforts and needlessly evoke enormous hostility throughout the Islamic world .
In the eyes of the Democratic - controlled Congress , there is nothing to negotiate : Israel is the undivided capital of Israel by right of conquest .
Israel ’s Occupation
Whatever the position of the U.S. Congress might be , however , the fact remains that the residents of East Jerusalem never voluntarily ceded sovereignty to Israel through a referendum or other methods ; their part of the city was seized by military force .
By any definition , this constitutes a military occupation .
To this day , Israeli occupation forces patrol the streets and engage in ongoing human rights abuses against residents who oppose Israeli rule continue .
The Israeli government has confiscated or destroyed homes and other property belonging to longstanding Muslim and Christian residents of the city .
Several UN bodies , along with Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and other reputable human rights organizations have frequently cited Israel for its ongoing violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention in East Jerusalem and surrounding areas .
Despite this , the House resolution commends Israel for having " respected the rights of all religious groups " during its 40 - year occupation .
Meanwhile , the Bush administration , like the Clinton administration , has refused to raise any objections to Israeli occupation forces banning access by most Palestinians to the schools , hospitals , businesses , and cultural venues of Palestine ’s largest city .
This ban has caused enormous suffering to the population .
And just as the Jordanians refused to allow Israeli Jews to visit their holy sites in the Old City when the Hashemite Kingdom controlled East Jerusalem between 1948 and 1967 , Israel now severely restricts access by Palestinian Muslims and Christians from the Gaza Strip or the rest of the West Bank from visiting their holy sites in the Old City .
Despite the resolution ’s claims to the contrary , those of us who have actually been to Jerusalem in recent years recognize that it is hardly a unified city .
One hardly ever sees any Israelis other than soldiers and journalists in Palestinian residential neighborhoods or business districts .
During one recent visit , my Israeli cab driver from the airport refused to take me to my hotel in the Palestinian half of the city , instead dropping me off at the pre-1967 dividing line and insisting I get an Arab cab for the remaining ten blocks of my trip .
Unlike the U.S. Congress , the Israeli Knesset did not pass a resolution celebrating the 40th anniversary of the conquest .
Indeed , Israel ’s elected institutions tend not to commemorate their wars except to honor their dead .
As with Israel ’s war on Lebanon last summer , Congress is willing to offer near - unanimous support for policies for which the Israelis themselves are willing to engage in serious self - criticism .
Indeed , the congressional resolution celebrating the humiliating defeat of Arab armies will likely only increase anti-American sentiment throughout the Arab world .
That victory brought hope to many Israelis that , with the leverage made possible by its conquest of Arab lands , and Israeli withdrawal could be exchanged for a permanent peace agreement with its Arab neighbors .
Congress , however , has it made clear in a bipartisan fashion that the most important part of the occupied territories is not subject to negotiation .
Given the centrality of Jerusalem to any comprehensive peace settlement , U.S. policy has made it extremely difficult for a lasting peace settlement to be implemented .
As Rep .
Price observed , " the only thing likely to fully guarantee Jerusalem as the permanent capital of Israel is the official , international recognition of Israel ’s neighbors and the entire international community  and this recognition is unlikely so long as Palestinian claims to their own capital and sacred city are denied . "
What the U.S. Public
Thinks
Public opinion polls in the United States show that , unlike most of their congressional representatives , a sizable majority of Americans supports a shared Jerusalem .
And fortunately , despite the backing of both the Republican and Democratic leadership , there have been signs that this dangerous and reactionary policy initiative is not universally supported within Congress either .
Julie Schumacher Cohen of Churches for Middle East Peace observed that the failure of the resolution to get more than fourteen co-sponsors and the avoidance of a roll call vote " may reflect a lack of confidence in the outcome of such a vote and Congressional weariness with resolutions like these that do not help move the peace process forward and undermine U.S. diplomatic efforts . "
Similar resolutions regarding Jerusalem passed by Congress in previous years received even greater bipartisan support .
There is more at stake here than Israeli - Palestinian peace .
It is very dangerous , in this era of American military dominance , for such a large majority of Congress to go on record challenging the principles enshrined in the UN Charter that international boundaries be recognized on the basis of law , not the force of arms .
The American public must not allow the Democratic Party , given control of Congress by the voters last November , to squander its mandate by supporting resolutions that not only undermine the rights of Palestinians and the long - term security interests of Israel and the United States , but also undermine important and longstanding principles of international law .

This month , the Brookings Institution released a report that condemned rent - to - own stores for allegedly preying upon consumers .
Last month , the Buffalo News , as part of a series on industries that supposedly preyed upon the poor ( " preying upon " evidently meaning " offering a service no one else was providing " ) , denounced these stores for the allegedly exorbitant monthly payments they charged their customers .
These denunciations suffer from two major flaws .
First , much of their anecdotal evidence points not so much to the wickedness of rent - to - own stores as to the silly and irresponsible spending patterns of people who should watch their money more responsibly – a character flaw for which these stores are not to blame .
Second , they fail to acknowledge the indispensable service that these stores provide to poor people with bad credit histories who cannot acquire the substantial items they need on any terms anywhere else .
Rent - to - own stores work as follows .
Customers can rent merchandise for the short term – as little as a week – or they can rent into the longer term by making monthly payments .
Once a customer completes his contract with the store , which typically runs no longer than 24 months , and sometimes even 12 , the merchandise becomes his .
( He also has the option of buying the product for less at any time earlier in the contract . )
Merchandise is delivered free within 24 hours , serviced for free while the customer is making payments , and is replaced if it should break .
The Buffalo News tells us the story of Nicole Hennegan , who bought a used 36 " color television from a rent - to - own store .
Her monthly payment was $ 80 .
After she missed her fourth payment , the television was repossessed .
As if this were n't unjust enough , had she continued to make the payments she would have wound up paying over $ 900 for a set that would have cost her $ 300 at a retail store .
Before getting into the economics of all of this , a good question might involve why the family needed a 36 " color television when it was obviously so financially unstable , or why Ms. Hennegan was spending her limited income so irresponsibly .
When I was young , our TV could n't have been more than a 10 " black - and - white , and that was what we had until my family became financially stable enough that purchasing a larger one became a sensible decision .
Any large electronics store today can furnish you with a good 13 " color TV for less than one of the monthly payments Ms. Hennegan assumed for her much larger TV – a TV that , until about five to ten years ago , hardly anyone but the wealthy or the merely ostentatious would have owned .
Since self - described advocates for the poor typically treat them as helpless imbeciles incapable of making sensible decisions or doing just about anything , we have to pause to consider the litany of objections to my 13 " television scenario .
Now if these points seem patronizing or insulting – as indeed they should to any self - respecting poor person – bear in mind that it is the left - wing excuse factory , not me , that comes up with them .
Ms. Hennegan may not have had a large electronics store nearby .
She may also not have had a car , or any friends who had a car , or any friends who had a car who knew how to get to an electronics store .
She could n't have used public transportation , though it is not exactly clear why not .
She could n't order the product online , since she lacked Internet access .
She knew no one who had Internet access that she could use for ten minutes .
She was also unable to go to the public library , where Internet access is available for free .
She could not use public transportation to get to the public library ; see # 3 above .
Even if she could have ordered the television online , she could n't have purchased the television because she lacks a credit card .
You do n't need a credit card to order merchandise from Amazon.com – just a checking account – but she could n't order the TV there because , well , she just could n't .
In spite of all this , Hennegan is portrayed in the story as a helpless victim rather than a responsible adult who made a stupid decision that is no one 's fault but her own .
Mary Hayward wanted to buy a dryer and a computer for her 17 - year - old granddaughter , and agreed to a $ 184 monthly payment for both .
Naturally , she will wind up paying much more for these items over time than she would have paid at a retail store had she had cash or modest credit .
" It makes me feel sick , " she complained .
" They 're terrible .
They 're charging too much . "
This week 's Best Buy circular features a new $ 300 eMachines desktop with an Intel Celeron D processor 352 , 256MB PC3200 DDR memory , 100GB of hard disk space and double - layer DVD±RW / CD - RW drive – in other words , a stupefyingly more robust computer than anyone in the 1980s , when I was growing up , could possibly have imagined , much less owned .
The $ 300 also includes a flat - panel monitor .
If you can afford rent - to - own payments , why not save up your money for a few months instead , and then buy a system like this ?
People got by just fine without computers for more than 99 percent of human history , so waiting ninety days to save up for one is unlikely to lead to anyone 's premature death .
Is it really so unreasonable to expect adults to make simple decisions like this , or to demand that they make themselves at least minimally informed ?
Thanks to rent - to - own stores , the poor are able to acquire household items that in some cases no one , rich or poor , could have had even a generation ago , and on terms that no one else is willing to extend to them .
That must count for something , right ?
" Activists " do n't see it that way .
" You 're stuck paying $ 20 a week , and by the time you 're done paying for it , you 've paid three times what it 's worth , " says East Side activist Michelle Johnson .
" It 's robbery . "
But that 's also true in a sense for 30 - year mortgages : by the time I 'm finished making the payments on my house , I have paid far more than the house is " worth . "
The point is that the house is " worth " more to me in the present than in the future .
I suppose I could live in a hut somewhere while I save up the money to buy the house in cash , but it turns out I 'm willing to pay extra – a lot extra – to live in a house right now rather than hut now , house later .
That is also the logic of the rent - to - own store : being able to use the merchandise up front , without a credit check and without having to pay out a substantial lump of cash , is a valuable service for a great many people .
Alma Medina , for example , a 24 - year - old single mother , bought two beds for her children from a rent - to - own store , paying $ 184 per month for them .
If there were another place from which she could have purchased the beds she would presumably have done so .
Unattractive as it seems to us , the rent - to - own store was her best option , her next - best option being to get them even more expensively or , perhaps , not to have any beds at all .
" Medina now owns her beds , " the Buffalo News tells us toward the end of the story .
The reporters then add , without the slightest sense of irony , " Just over a month after she started paying , her children 's father used his tax refund to buy the beds from the rent - to - own . "
Want to hold your breath with me while we wait for the Buffalo News 's indictment of the withholding tax as an injustice toward the poor ?
There are a lot of companies that , understandably , hesitate to enter into credit exchanges with people who have a poor history of meeting their obligations .
Rent - to - own stores are willing to lease merchandise to people who are obviously credit risks ( or who would n't be shopping there in the first place ) .
I like the way economist David Henderson puts it : you do n't help the poor by looking at their list of options and eliminating the one they actually chose .
Rent - to - own stores are guilty of making furniture and large appliances available to people without credit or substantial savings , and at a relatively low monthly cost .
If government should punish the industry with price caps and other regulations ( Brookings suggests that local governments use " licensing and zoning authority " to " crack down " and " curb the development of these businesses " ) , marginal rent - to - own stores will simply close altogether and fewer will open in the first place .
Less and less will the poor be exploited by sinister appliance renters .
Sure , they probably wo n't be able to get the appliances , computers , or furniture they 'd like any longer , but at least people like East Side activist Michelle Johnson can console themselves that justice has been done .

Luba Lee , FNP -BC , MS Master 's Degree , Nursing , University of Tennessee Knoxville Expert Answer
Pillows should support the natural curves of your spine and depending on the position you sleep in , they can assist in proper and supportive spinal alignment .
For example , if you sleep on your back , then use a pillow to support your neck .
Pick the pillow that is not too high and not too low but fits and keeps your cervical spine ( the area of your spine in your neck ) neutral .
It should not be flexed forward or extended back .
Also , if you sleep on your back you may use a pillow under your knees to keep the lower curve of your spine neutral .
This is especially useful if you have low back pain .
But even if you do n’t have back pain , having a pillow under your knees will feel good and relieve the pressure on your lower back .
If you sleep on your side , use a full body pillow and place it between your arms and legs in addition to the head pillow that keeps your neck leveled with the shoulders .
These methods are aimed at keeping your spine neutral and supporting its natural curves .

亚搏vip手机 版1月29日讯 萨拉戈萨主帅维克托-费尔南德斯出席了与皇马的国王杯赛前新闻发布会。
“ 毫无疑问我们现在的首要目标，唯一的首要目标就是联赛升级，所以我的决定肯定是基于这个逻辑的，所以我们在国王杯还是延续之前的思路，那就是尽可能使用那些轮换球员，让我们的每个球员尽可能都能有出场机会，明天也是如此。 “
“ 当然，我们知道明天的比赛我们要面对的是皇马，这是我们能够遇到的最强的对手了，但是我们还是该怎么做就怎么做，享受这场比赛。对我们来说，无论明天的比赛胜负如何，我们都已经赢了。所以，无论是胜利还是失败，我们都要泰然处之。 ”
“ 我们要尊重自己身上的球衣，尽可能全力以赴，毫无疑问，这是萨拉戈萨的精神，那就是争取胜利。但是还是那句话，周日我们要和榜首加迪斯进行一场关键的比赛。而明天的国王杯，我们将争取全力以赴，为大家带来精彩的表现。 ”
对于皇马轮换多名球员，维克托表示：
“ 我不认为这样的调整会影响皇马的实力，因为皇马的阵容非常强大，而且上一轮皇马的首发里面，只有卡塞米罗和伊斯科没有入选，拉莫斯，本泽马，这说明很多的问题，说明齐达内先生很重视这场比赛，他带来大多数自己的最好的球员，说明他们也很想赢。 ”
维克托-费尔南德斯此前曾经担任皇马青训部门主管，而当时齐达内正是皇马卡斯蒂亚主帅，对于这段共事经历，维克托表示：
“ 我和齐祖关系很好，当时我到拉法布利卡的时候，他正执教卡斯蒂亚，和他在一起工作，你会感到很安心。齐达内作为球员履历无需赘言，而作为教练经验也非常丰富，是一个优秀的教练，也是一个很棒的人。 ”
“ 齐祖应该说生来就是为这样的位置而存在的，他为皇马的球迷带来了很多的欢乐。我很开心能够和他共事，这是我在皇马两年中最好的回忆之一。我为他的成功而开心，同时也相信他将继续在这一行工作很久。 ”
“ 当然明天他会以战胜我为目标，而我也会努力去击败他。但是在皇马的经历很美好，我相信那段经历是我职业生涯很重要的一个阶段，因为当时我一度以为我不会回去继续执教了，但是在皇马的两年让我做出了更多的变化，很幸运能够和齐达内这样的人共事。 ”
最后，被问到可能战胜的希望，维克托表示：
“ 足球就是这样，什么都可能发生，比如说一次点球，一个判罚，可能90分钟内会发生很多的事情，而作为教练是不能面面俱到的。想要战胜皇马，我们首先需要表现得超常，其次，我们需要对手不在状态。同时还需要运气，以及球迷们的支持。 ”
“ 就像我上星期说过的，如果需要我来选择，我更愿意输给皇马，然后在周日的联赛关键战战胜加迪斯。当然，我们没有选择的权力，所以我们要做的就是，面对皇马全力以赴，然后，面对加迪斯，继续全力以赴。 ”

My Flatron 915FT + computer monitor from LG Electronics began malfunctioning last winter , so I called LG to arrange for service under the warranty .
I wish I had never even bothered .
After all , it was just the green gun that was periodically flickering .
The occasional pink tint to the picture would have been much more tolerable than the warranty repair ordeal .
I first called on February 11 .
This process ended on August 30 , when I received a check for $ 105 less than the monitor 's value .
During this process , LG Electronics has repeatedly lied to me , misled me , defrauded me and DHL Airborne Express , and provided the absolute worst call - center support I have ever encountered .
I would n't have even believed this timeline myself if I had n't recorded every step in a forum thread .
Read the long version if you own an LG Electronics product or are thinking of purchasing one .
I 'll simply offer the summary here :
February 11 : Requested shipping labels to send the monitor to LG .
They did n't come until March 1 .
March 18 : Received the " repaired " monitor with a huge crack in the casing .
LG insists it 's not their fault , even though they said the box had no visible damage and the monitor was packaged properly .
March 19 - 27 : Requested a claim from the shipper , DHL Airborne Express .
March 27 - April 30 : Constant phone - tag with LG to get required documentation for my claim .
April 30 : DHL voids my claim because I was shipping an item for warranty repair with a declared value of over $ 100 , which is against their policies .
But I was just using the labels that LG sent me .
I confirmed with both DHL and LG that yes , in fact , LG is breaking DHL 's policy with every warranty shipment .
The manager of LG 's warranty repair services , Scott Nelson , said that they do about 2,000 warranty " swaps " per year and they have no intention of changing the policy .
However , admitting fault , he agreed to issue me a refund for my monitor .

However , admitting fault , he agreed to issue me a refund for my monitor .
May 18 : Shipping labels arrived to send the monitor to LG again , violating DHL 's policy again .
LG promised me a check by June .
May 18 - August 29 : The check did n't arrive .
Every 2 weeks , I called and was assured that my check was in the mail .
I was told that since I faxed a copy of my original receipt , I will get a full refund of $ 350 .
August 30 : I received a check for $ 245 .
Norita Fredericks , who originally told me that I would get $ 350 , changed her story and promised that the people who calculate the numbers would call me back .
They did n't .
During this process , LG's call center has performed awfully :
I called over 25 times .
I was promised 9 return calls .
Only 2 were returned .
On 6 occasions , I called during normal business hours and was told by another employee that nobody in PC Support was present , and he did not know when anyone would return .
I changed my address in May .
The first time I told them , they did not record this information .
Good thing I asked about it during the next call .
My customer record is almost empty .
They have CRM software that logs every call , but nobody stores any comments .
In addition , the employees cannot tell who spoke to me , since the name is stored only as 2 initials that nobody was ever able to decode .
The manager , Scott Nelson , was rarely available during normal business hours , despite his voicemail message telling me to call back during normal business hours .
He never returned messages .
Most employees provided incorrect information about the functions of other departments , and which department I needed to call .
Few employees would give me any identification except for a first name , preventing me from keeping detailed records or holding any employee responsible for his actions and words .
" John " in PC Support should be fired .
Meanwhile , " John " in Electronics Support is the best employee at LG .
I will never purchase another product from LG Electronics , and I urge you to avoid them as well .
No company should treat its customers this way .
It 's unacceptable , rude , dishonest , and illegal .
The Chinese government has become increasingly sophisticated at controlling the internet , taking a multilayered approach that contributes to precision in blocking political dissent , a report released Thursday finds .
The precision means that China 's filters can block just specific references to Tibetan independence without blocking all references to Tibet .
Likewise , the government is effective at limiting discussions about Falun Gong , the Dalai Lama , Tiananmen Square and other topics deemed sensitive , the study from the OpenNet Initiative finds .
Numerous government agencies and thousands of public and private employees are involved at all levels , from the main pipelines , or backbones , hauling data over long distances to the cybercafes where many citizens access the internet .
That breadth , the study finds , allows the filtering tools to adapt to emerging forms of communications , such as web journals , or blogs .
" China has been more successful than any other country in the world to manage to filter the internet despite the fast changes in technology , " said John Palfrey , one of the study 's principal investigators and executive director of Harvard Law School 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society .
Saudi Arabia , for example , largely controls the internet by having all traffic flow through a central agency , where it can be monitored .
Visitors trying to access a banned site get a message saying it has been blocked , Palfrey said .
" China is much more subtle than that , " Palfrey said .
" You do n't know what you do n't know .
It 's more effective than if you see it but know you can't access it . "
With filters at multiple points , including some search engines , content is simply removed rather than replaced with a notice , he said .
Google has acknowledged its Chinese - language news service – introduced on a test basis last fall – leaves out results from government - banned sites , though the company says that is done so users wo n't end up clicking on links that lead nowhere because of the Chinese filters .
Palfrey added that Chinese filtering methods are effective because they constantly change , keeping its users off - balance .
China , which has the world 's second - largest population of internet users behind the United States , promotes internet use for business and education , while trying to curb access to political dissent , pornography and other topics the communist government deems sensitive .
Many users do find ways around the controls – for instance , using " proxy " servers that mask a site 's true origin .
It is through similar proxy servers and long - distance calls that researchers outside China managed to test what users inside China see .
The researchers also employed volunteers inside the country to conduct more extensive testing .
The researchers deployed software and physical equipment called packet sniffers to monitor the flow of traffic and try to gauge where content gets dropped .
Palfrey would not elaborate on techniques , other than to say many internet systems have security flaws through which outsiders can sneak in software .
Funded by George Soros ' Open Society Institute , the OpenNet Initiative is a collaboration of researchers at Harvard , the University of Cambridge and the University of Toronto working on issues of internet censorship and surveillance .
Their testing determined that :
Though some dissidents complain that e-mail newsletters sent in bulk are sometimes blocked , individual messages tend not to get filtered .
Much of the filtering occurs at the backbone , but individual internet service providers sometimes deploy additional blocking .
Cybercafes and operators of discussion boards also control content proactively under threat of penalties .
Filtering tends to be triggered by the appearance of certain keywords , rather than a visit to a specific domain name or numeric internet address .
The keyword - based filters also allow blogs to keep people from completing posts containing banned topics .
" You can filter much more precisely at a keyword level , " Palfrey said .
" China wants to be able to enable its citizens to use the internet and grow its economy .
Shutting down all blog servers does n't seem like a great idea , but it does n't want to let through all forms of political dissent . "

For each word , iterate over the set of permutations of the characters in the word ( e.g. for " hello " , one permutation would be " loleh " ) .
-
For each permutation , iterate over the set of partitions of the permutation ( e.g. for " loleh " , one partition would be ( " lol " " eh " ) ) .

For each partition , if every string in the partition is an english word , we have found an anagram !
- Iterate over every word in a set - For each word , sort the characters of the word and stash any value in a hash - table against that key ( e.g. for " hello " the key is " ehllo " )
- Iterate over every word , w1 , in a set - Iterate over every word , w2 , in a set - Concatenate w1 and w2 .
Sort the resulting string , and see if the result is a key in the hash - table you prepared earlier .
If so , you 've got an anagram .

What 's next
Dan Connolly : Anyway ... if we do n’t see a whole lot more trust and cooperation than I ’ve seen lately , we ’ll either have to leave a bunch of stuff unspecified or get creative about decision - making processes
Question :
Who would benefit most from a widespread perception that the W3C HTML Working Group is mostly dysfunctional ?
Compare : The Atom Design Principles consisted of four bullets and approximately fifteen words .
Compare : The HTML Design Principles ( Proposed ) have four categories of principles and over eighteen hundred words .
But perhaps most significant difference here is that the third Atom principle has been placed in the “ Disputed Principles ” category by the HTML Working Group .
Inclusive or Exclusive ?
David Hyatt : Maybe we fundamentally disagree on this point , but to me an HTML5 document should be a superset of an HTML4 document .
Any HTML4 document should render correctly as an HTML5 document
Anne van Kesteren : HTML5 gives you one better .
It has in fact removed ( obsoleted , if you wish ) presentational markup
Both statements are mostly true , contradictory , and ( in an absolute sense ) false .
Here ’s a document which is spec compliant , and will be declared as such by the W3C Markup Validation Service ( and the beta ! ) , yet is n’t handled correctly by any major browser vendor , nor does it conform to the current HTML5 draft .
The reality is that validators that accept documents that nobody supports and yet spew out reams of dire warnings that bear little correlation to what is actually implemented tend to get ignored .
Of all groups , the HTML Working Group should be the one most acutely aware of this fact .
Follow Draco or Postel ?
T.V Raman : I still dont want to see a language that “ blesses ” ill - formed authoring and turns it into something that all of us have to repeatedly implement
James Graham :
If HTML5 were to take the path of ensuring well - formedness , I would expect HTML4 , presumably with all the same interoperability problems we have today , to remain the defacto current HTML for much of the web
Again , both statements are mostly true , contradictory , and ( in an absolute sense ) false .
For the moment , put yourself in the shoes of the vendor who both enjoys the largest market share in this arena , and accordingly shoulders a disproportionate need to maintain absolute compatibility .
To such a vendor , the desire to follow a plan such as the following must be overwhelming :
Define a lean , clean language .
Define how legacy bits map to the clean language .
Now add a backdrop where the W3C has proven to be a bit , well , constipated in this area — a situation that now is markedly improving , but only years after that same vendor has been executing on an alternative plan — and that ’s exactly the point where this story gets a bit interesting ...
Silverlight and SVG Side - by - Side
Let ’s start with this page which includes a simple four color logo rendered in both SVG and Silverlight .
View Source .
The similarities are striking ... mostly capitalization differences ... almost reminiscent of C# vs Java , but let ’s not digress ...
Depending on your browser and what plugin you have installed , you may not see either image , or only one .
If anybody finds a browser that displays both , I ’d be interested in hearing about it .
IE refuses to display any content served as application / xhtml+xml , other browsers will only display SVG if the content is served as application / xhtml+xml , and the Firefox plugin that Microsoft provides wo n’t display Silverlight content if the content type is application / xhtml+xml , or ( as near as I can tell ) if there is a DOCTYPE that triggers standards mode ( and , yes , this includes HTML5 ’s minimal doctype ) .
All this notwithstanding , I have managed to find a combination that works .
On Firefox .
On Windows .
But again , I do n’t want to get sidetracked .
The more important thing to note is that the entire page is well - formed according to XML ’s definition of the term .
More on that in a minute .
But first , let ’s look at a slightly more complicated example .
Here you can see a bit of divergence , and the Silverlight sample seems to be a bit more verbose .
That could be my ignorance of the idioms showing through , but in any case , the parallels between the SVG and Silverlight implementation are obvious , and the Silverlight version is still quite readable .
In developing that sample , and trying to follow this advice , I became aware of one thing : Silverlight is draconian .
I ’m not talking about mere well - formedness checks , I ’m talking about a much more extreme sense .
Simply include a single element or attribute that is not recognized , and absolutely nothing in the entire canvas will be rendered .
Nothing .
It is my guess that the reasoning is thus : experts will find a way to make it work ; and non-experts will make use of a tool , and sometimes even a moderately expensive tool at that .
Future
I certainly have no crystal ball , and the potential futures are many .
One potential future is that HTML has survived many assaults from the likes of Flash , has assimilated and / or accommodated all of them , and is still going strong .
Another one is that HTML has rested on its laurels for a bit too long , and the lessons of REST and Flash have been well learned .
A worst case scenario may very well be that , over time , increasingly more and more content gets rendered by a common plugin that is closed source and controlled by a single vendor .
To achieve this would require a multi- pronged attack : step 1 might be to sign up a string of vendors to provide content , enough so to entice users to download the plugin .
Step 2 would be to provide some unique hook that will appeal to developers .
And do so with an permissive license that is assured to be picked up by others .
After all , in the final analysis , a solid implementation with a no-excuses license often is the sure path to ubiquity , and quicker than a capital - S “ Standard ” too .
For example , just imagine how fast the Rails guys will climb aboard if they can be assured that 80 % of the Mac developers already have the ability to directly run Ruby in the browser installed on their machine .
Particularly if Ruby runs fast there .
This certainly has the potential to significantly raise the bar for Tamarin .
And if it should so happen to inconvenience vendors that chose to defect , so be it .
In any case , as tempting as it may be to place the blame on any one vendor , the true villan in all this may be the unreasonable desire to funnel all innovation through one specification , and in the process shut down extensions .
While it is true the incremental change is often the key to successful evolution , it is equally true that random change and Darwinian weeding are the fuels that drive progress .
Footnote1 : XAML
I ’ve seen references to XAML vs SVG or XAML vs XUL , but in reality XAML is nothing but a window into the underlying class libraries provided by the runtime in question .
An XML binding , if you will .
Ellipse , for example , is a class .
One that is not standardized by ECMA , but rather provided by Microsoft with the proprietary CLR implementation .
Nor is it provided with the permissively licensed DLR .
Footnote2 : XHTML and other alternatives
XHTML meets Microsoft ’s criteria for an explicit “ opt in ” .
Of course , this flies in the face of conventional wisdom that was the requirement to include quotes around attribute values and slashes in empty tags that did XHTML in , and not , say , the lack of compelling new features .
Or perhaps not .
Perhaps it was the insistence of the browser vendors that happened to implement namespaces like SVG and MathML to stick to the letter of the XML specification whereas these same vendors had long ago collectively chosen to not follow the SGML specification quite as closely .
A third possibility would be that an entirely new vocabularly , such as XUL or Apollo would address the issue .
As would the mega draconian Silverlight itself , should Microsoft chose to pursue that path .
Perhaps what HTML needs most of all is a Roadmap .
P.S .
The correct answer to the rhetorical question posed at the top of this post is “ nobody ” .
Design Indaba update : a condom applicator designed to help AIDS prevention has been named the Most Beautiful Object in South Africa by Dutch designer Jurgen Bey .
Bey , who was in Cape Town to speak at the Design Indaba conference last week , selected the product from a shortlist of 15 products at the Design Indaba Expo .
The applicator , invented by Willem van Rensburg and designed by industrial designer Roelf Mulder of South Africa 's XYZ Design , allows a condom to be put on easily and rapidly .
The user holds the device with the thumb and forefinger of both hands , pulling the condom down over the penis in a single rapid movement .
See video demonstrations of the product here and here .
It is hoped the design will encourage the use of condoms , thereby helping reduce the spread of AIDS .
The applicator , which was selected for the SAFE exhibition at MoMA in New York two years ago and is in the museum 's permanent collection is now being marketed and sold under the Pronto brand .

Lenticular clouds , technically known as altocumulus standing lenticularis , are stationary lens - shaped clouds that form at high altitudes , normally aligned at right - angles to the wind direction .
Where stable moist air flows over a mountain or a range of mountains , a series of large - scale standing waves may form on the downwind side .
Lenticular clouds sometimes form at the crests of these waves .
Under certain conditions , long strings of lenticular clouds can form , creating a formation known as a wave cloud .
Power pilots tend to avoid flying near lenticular clouds because of the turbulence of the rotor systems that accompany them , but sailplane pilots actively seek them out .
This is because the systems of atmospheric standing waves that cause " lennies " ( as they are sometimes familiarly called ) also involve large vertical air movements , and the precise location of the rising air mass is fairly easy to predict from the orientation of the clouds .
" Wave lift " of this kind is often very smooth and strong , and enables gliders to soar to remarkable altitudes and great distances .
The current gliding world records for both distance ( over 3,000 km ) and altitude ( 14,938 m ) were set using such lift .
Lenticular clouds have been mistaken for UFOs ( or " visual cover " for UFOs ) because these clouds have a characteristic lens appearance and smooth saucer - like shape .
There is also a fascinating print medium called Lenticular Printing .

Lenticular Cloud Over Hawaii
November 26 , 2003 - Space.com
Astronomers are always looking up .
Sometimes they see interesting things that are n't as far up as we normally think they 're looking .
Peter Michaud , a public information officer for the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii , took this picture yesterday of an unusual cloud formation above the islands .
It is called a lenticular cloud , due to its lens - shaped appearance .
These clouds are formed by so - called mountain waves of air created by strong winds forced over high mountains .
In this case , the mountain is Mauna Kea , a 13,796 - foot peak ( 4,260 meters ) where one of the two Gemini telescopes sits , along with several other observatories .
( A twin to the Hawaiian Gemini scope is situated in Chile . )
" At the high points in the wave , moisture in the air condenses out to form a cloud , " Michaud explained .
" In the photo you can see that the wave established this morning displayed two peaks .
Actually there were four -- two more were downstream from Mauna Loa , but the other two were not as impressive as Mauna Kea's ! "
A leading network of online communities , a platform for featuring free online classified ads , and originating as a neat and simplistic text - based website , Craigslist is something that has driven huge curiosity about its popularity and success .
Here we break down the secrets of Craigslist ’s success whose founder Craig Newmark once said , “ Everything on the site is based on user feedback .
Frankly , I have no vision whatsoever . ”
The most prominent reason for the success of Craigslist is that it follows a local approach .
Users have the option to choose the city and even the area where their listings would appear and this drives huge local traffic .
On the other hand , websites like eBay would show the top sellers for any product searched but how costly and impractical becomes buying , say graphics card replacement or battery replacement , from across the continent .
Statistical Facts About Craigslist
Before further exploring the success - mantras of this immensely popular website , let ’s gulp down some amazing facts about it .
Craigslist was initiated back in 1999 , and till last year it was serving 700 distinct cities in 70 countries across the world .
Till last year , it was known to be generating revenue to the tune of $ 1 billion .
Without any advertising , marketing , or promotion , it ranks in the top 20 websites in the US , surpassing the popularity of Netflix , Walmart , LinkedIn , Pinterest , or even CNN .
By 2007 , it was serving about 7 billion page - views per month coming from 200 servers .
To top all of it , all this is achieved by only 50 employees , as of last year .
Again , how do they pull it off ?
The key reason is that is neatly organized , has high functionality , and easy navigation .
Essentially , it serves the requirements of its users without bombarding them with irritating ads now and then which are of no use to them .
Take your mind back to 1999 and imagine how many people would have been familiar with the Internet ?
People were used to seeing classified ads in print newspapers and Craigslist , with its text - based approach , provided them a convenient transition from print to the screens but with classifieds in huge volume and vast fields .
Let 's have a look at some of the many , many issues on which Ron Paul places himself squarely in opposition to me and , presumably , you :
Abortion : Ron Paul's " libertarianism " famously does not extend to the right of a woman to control her body .
In February he introduced H.R. 1094 , " [ t ] o provide that human life shall be deemed to exist from conception . "
He voted against overriding Bush 's veto of the stem cell bill .
The Environment : Ron Paul may be a Republican , but he 's certainly not a Republican for Environmental Protection .
That fine organization gave Paul a shameful 17 percent rating on its most recent Congressional Scorecard ( warning : PDF ) .
He does n't fare much better in the eyes of the American Wilderness Coalition or the League of Conservation Voters .
Paul 's abysmal record on the environment is driven in large measure by his love of sweet , sweet oil : in the 109th Congress alone , he voted to voted allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , to shield oil companies from MTBE contamination lawsuits , against increasing gas mileage standards , to allow new offshore drilling , and to stop making oil companies pay royalties to the government for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
Par for the course for a man who called the Kyoto accords " bad science , bad economics and bad domestic policy " and " anti-Americanism masquerading as environmentalism . "
Immigration : Paul marches in lock - step with the xenophobic right wing on immigration , calling last month 's compromise immigration bill " a compromise of our laws , a compromise of our sovereignty , and a compromise of the Second Amendment . "
Yet even the hardcore nativists in the immigration debate have been hesitant to support repealing birthright citizenship as enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment , as Paul has done .
His proposed Constitutional amendment , introduced as H. J. Res 46 on April 28 , 2005 , reads : " Any person born after the date of the ratification of this article to a mother and father , neither of whom is a citizen of the United States nor a person who owes permanent allegiance to the United States , shall not be a citizen of the United States or of any State solely by reason of birth in the United States . "
Only four other Representatives , all Republicans , were willing to cosponsor this proposed amendment .
Civil Rights :
Paul does n't much care for ensuring your right to vote .
Like when he voted with just 32 other members of Congress against reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .
Or when he voted for the bogus " Federal Election Integrity Act " voter suppression bill .
But at least Ron Paul knows who 's responsible for racism in America : you are .
" By encouraging Americans to adopt a group mentality , " he writes , " the advocates of so - called ' diversity ' actually perpetuate racism .
Their intense focus on race is inherently racist , because it views individuals only as members of racial groups . "
So now you know .
( Apparently , saying that " [ i ] f you have ever been robbed by a black teen - aged male , you know how unbelievably fleet - footed they can be " is not racist , as long as it's said with a proper appreciation for free - market economics . )
Gay Rights : Paul 's rigid , uncompromising libertarianism leads him to take a number of positions that liberals find objectionable or even reprehensible but which should not in themselves be taken as ipso facto evidence of bigotry .
His reflexive opposition to the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 , for example , is consistent with libertarian positions on federalism and the right of the individual to be free from government " coercion , " even if that means limiting the ability of minorities to seek employment and housing free from discrimination .
Still , libertarian orthodoxy can't fully explain Paul 's hostility to gay rights , and indeed to gay people in general .
The Libertarian Party , which nominated Paul as its presidential candidate in 1988 , has strongly opposed the so - called Defense of Marriage Act from the beginning ;
Paul supports it .
While he opposed the " Federal Marriage Amendment " that would have outlawed gay marriage everywhere , he actually cosponsored the odious " Marriage Protection Act , " which would nonsensically bar federal courts from considering challenges to the Defense of Marriage Act , which is a federal law .
" The definition of marriage - - a union between a man and a woman - - can be found in any dictionary , " he writes condescendingly .
Despite Paul 's disingenuous claims that he is a " strict constitutionalist , " most legal scholars agree that the so - called Marriage Protection
Act would be unconstitutional .
You also will not find Paul listed among the 124 co-sponsors of the Military Readiness Enhancement
Act of 2007 , which would repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy barring gays and lesbians from serving in the military .
Maybe he 's worried that they 'll take their " gay agenda " to far - flung corners of the world .
He also does n't want gay people adopting children while they 're not serving in the military , either .
On a personal level , we have this 1993 quote wherein Paul equates homosexuality with " sexual deviance . "
And let 's not forget his wink - wink characterization of Hillary Clinton as " a far leftist with very close female friends " .
Church - State Separation : From keeping " under God " in the Pledge of Allegiance to co-sponsoring the school prayer amendment to keeping the Ten Commandments on a courthouse lawn , this " strict constitutionalist " is n't a big fan of the Constitutionally - mandated separation of church and state .
" Religious morality will always inform the voting choices of Americans of all faiths , " he writes .
" ... The collectivist left " -- that 's you !-- " is threatened by strong religious institutions , because it wants an ever - growing federal government to serve as the unchallenged authority in our society ....
So the real motivation behind the insistence on a separation of church and state is not based on respect for the First amendment , but rather on a desire to diminish the influence of religious conservatives at the ballot box . "
And just in case the dirty liberals in the federal court system might take it into their heads to enforce the Establishment Clause , Mr. Strict Constitutionalist introduced a bill to bar the federal courts from hearing any such cases .
No wonder James Dobson 's Family Research Council gave Paul a 75 percent rating on their 2005 scorecard .
International Relations : Like crackpot paleoconservatives everywhere , Paul wants us out of the United Nations , which is just a bunch of un-American non-Americans out to destroy America .
Darfur is also filled with non-Americans , so you certainly wo n't find Ron Paul lifting a finger to stop the genocide , or even acknowledge that genocide is taking place .
I guess that 's why he's one of only four members of Congress to receive an " F " rating on Darfur from the Genocide Intervention Network .
Peace and Military Issues : With all the hooting and hollering about Paul 's opposition to the Iraq war , it sure seems like he should have been able to get better than 58 percent from PeacePAC , does n't it ?
Even Joe Lieberman managed to get 63 percent .
( Still , it beats the 45 percent Paul got from them in the previous Congress . )
He did a little better from Peace Action , managing 67 percent -- easily the top score for a Republican , but a below - average score for Democrats .
( Still , it beats the 40 percent he got from them in 2004 . )
And while Paul may oppose the Iraq war , he does n't seem to have much use for the men and women who have to fight it .
Paul received an " F " rating from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
It 's not easy to get an F from the IAVA ; Paul shares this distinction with only six other members of the House .
Taxes :
Do we even need to go into this one ?
If you audaciously believe that we need a progressive system of taxation in this country , here 's what Ron Paul thinks of you :
" [ W]e have exactly the kind of steeply progressive tax system championed by Karl Marx .
One might expect the left to be happy with such an arrangement .
At its core , however , the collectivist left in this country simply does n’t believe in tax cuts .
Deep down , they believe all wealth belongs to the state , which should redistribute it via tax and welfare policies to achieve some mythical ' social justice .'...
The class war tactic highlights what the left does best : divide Americans into groups .
Collectivists see all issues of wealth and taxation as a zero - sum game played between competing groups .
If one group gets a tax break , other groups must be rallied against it - even if such a cut would ultimately benefit them ....
Upward mobility is possible only in a free - market capitalist system , whereas collectivism dooms the poor to remain exactly where they are . "
" Collectivist politicians forget that the American dream of becoming wealthy is alive and well .
They seek to encourage resentment of the wealthy , when in truth most Americans admire successful people .
They forget that upward mobility , the chance to start from humble beginnings and achieve wealth and position , is virtually impossible in high - tax socialist societies .
Most of all , however , the pro-tax politicians forget that your money belongs to you .
As a society , we should not forget their dishonesty when we go to the polls . "
Screw this ; this diary 's way too long already .
Worker rights : Voted to defund OSHA 's ergonomics rules .
Voted against increasing mine safety standards .
Hates unions .
Campaign finance reform : Opposes .
Social Security and Medicare : Repeats the Republicans ' lies about the programs ' solvency .
Consumer protection : Voted for the bankruptcy bill .
Voted to make it harder to file class - action lawsuits .
Universal health care : do n't make me laugh .
Privatizing everything : the Internets are not large enough to hold all the citations .
" But he 's against the war ! "
Yes , he is .
So is Pat Buchanan .
So is David Duke .
If either of them were on the stage in New Hampshire today , full of sweet words about the war , would you be as quick to praise their " independence , " to gush about how well of course I would n't vote for him myself but he sure is awesome anyway ?
Do you truly require nothing from a political candidate other than that he oppose the war ?
Think about it .
Heidi Klum and some of the other Victoria ’s Secret Angels were on hand to promote the LA launch of the new Very Sexy make up line .
The were on hand in the LA store at The Grove to sign autographs and take lots of publicity snaps .
The public were also able to get full makeovers provided by experienced make up artists until midnight .
So if you ’re in LA , pop into a Victoria ’s Secret store and be one of the first in the world to get your hands on some of the Very Sexy make up collection .
With itâ€™s “ sleek and modern ” packaging and pretty shades ( according to Beauty Addict ) , itâ€™s not something to put off buying .

HONG KONG --
For decades , Chinese filmmakers have n't made a major feature film about one of the country 's biggest wartime atrocities : the Nanjing massacre of 1937 .
Now at least two directors are preparing to make a movie set against the Japanese military 's brutal killings in the former Chinese capital .
Historians say at least 300,000 civilians were slaughtered and tens of thousands of women raped in the Japanese rampage .
Trying to tell the Nanjing story on the big screen has been hard for Hong Kong director Yim Ho and his mainland counterpart Lu Chuan .
They have gone through tough vetting by the Chinese government that reflects conflicting agendas of Chinese nationalism and good diplomatic relations with Japan .
Both say they 've received governmental approval , but only after an elaborate vetting process that involved multiple departments , despite both having Chinese state - run movie studios as partners .
Yim , a respected art - house director who made the 2001 movie " Pavilion of Women " featuring Willem Dafoe , said his script was first rejected by China 's Film Bureau several years ago before getting approval on a second try this year .
Lu , a rising Chinese director , said the approval process for his movie , titled " Nanking Nanking , " took five months .
Nanjing was known as Nanking by in the West at the time of the massacre .
" The process was more tense than usual .
It was more complicated than usual , " he said .
In Yim 's case , he said his movie was vetted by the Film Bureau , the Chinese foreign ministry and the Chinese Communist Party 's Central Propaganda Department .
The Chinese government 's careful handling of the two movies are apparently motivated by the desire to promote nationalism and boost the image of the Chinese Communist Party , and to maintain strong ties with economically important Japan on a year that coincides with two sensitive anniversaries .
This year marks both the 70th anniversary of the massacre and the 35th anniversary of Sino - Japanese diplomatic ties .
The Japanese invasion of China helped expose the failures of the then - ruling Nationalist Party , said Phil Deans , a scholar on Sino - Japanese relations at Temple University 's Japan campus .
" How can you make that pot simmer without making it boil ?
That 's the delicate balance the party has to do , " said Deans , who predicts the new movies may portray the atrocities as being committed by a clique not representative of the Japanese people .
Yim 's movie is a $ 35 million ( euro26 million ) English - language production with Hollywood investment that the director hopes to craft into a star - studded project .
The Hong Kong director 's movie , called " Nanking Xmas 1937 , " revolves around a group of foreigners who sheltered locals from Japanese brutality .

As James Randi continues his recovery from heart surgery , he 's asked Hal Bidlack to line up some stellar guest writers for Swift .
This Week 's Swift was written by Hal Bidlack , David Federlein , and James Randi .
A CLARIFICATION
Let me begin this week ’s commentary with a clarification on last week’s .
A reader emailed me to express his concern that in my comments as to the power of history to inspire and motivate , I was saying knowing actual dates of historic events was unimportant .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The point I was trying to make was that if history is taught only as dates to memorize , the subject loses much of its magic , its excitement .
Certainly , people should know the framework of dates and places , but I think a good teacher uses that basic knowledge to help his or her students soar well beyond just rote memorization .
Learn the dates and places , please , but as part of a larger educational program , m’kay ?
MEDICAL ALTERNATIVES
This week our guest writer talks about his battle with cancer and how that experience educated him on alternative medicine , and a variety of silly things people believe .
This subject is exceptionally close to my heart .
As those of you who heard my talk at TAM4 know , I lost my wife to cancer in 2003 .
During that time I was dealing with her medical challenges , supporting our children , and often running a gauntlet of well - meaning people urging us to try a variety of highly questionable medical ideas .
I turned down well intended offers of magnetic blankets , special vitamins , herbs , and other wonders .
The people who sell this snake oil must truly be the lowest form of human life .
To be willing to profit on the suffering of others , to be willing to dissuade people from using proven medical treatments in order to swallow their hokum , is to be homicidal and vicious .
I do not for one moment blame the sick for falling into these traps .
I blame the charlatans .
But there is also a part of me that is concerned about the label “ alternative medicine . ”
I feel this label is too broad .
Many current mainstream techniques were once seen as wild and suspect .
Alexander Hamilton , during a yellow fever crisis , was publicly chastised for daring to not follow the traditional medical procedure of bleeding when his children fell ill .
They survived , many treated with the traditional medicine of the time did not .
President Washington was , essentially , killed by his doctors , who drained him of large amounts of blood to ‘ cure ’ what we now think was simply a bad case of strep throat .
The “ alternative medicine ” of the day , warm compresses and tea , might have prevented a case of iatrogenic death in the father of our nation .
[ 1 ]
And who might have guessed , 50 years ago , that the bark of the Pacific yew tree would yield taxol , a critically important anti-cancer drug ?
Alternative is not always bad , it seems to me , when the word refers to new and testable .
I worry that with our skeptical hats firmly in place , we may from time to time dismiss out of hand a viable and important medical advance because it seems , in the context of the time , too weird .
I know from my own family experience that , for example , one ’s mental attitude toward chemotherapy can play a significant role , not in the effectiveness in killing cancer , but rather in the ease or discomfort with which one endures the side effects of the treatment .
So how do we distinguish between “ good ” alternate and “ bad ” alternate medicine ?
Happily , the scientific method awaits as the tool of choice .
Double blind studies , proper clinical trials , and good basic research will suggest which new alternatives in treatment are useful , and which are bogus .
I want to be very , very clear here : I am NOT supporting a single bit of the nonsense that masquerades as medical treatment today that is not based on quality scientific research .
This is why I wish we had two terms for what is now called “ alternative medicine . ”
I worry that a reader may think I am endorsing magnets , crystals , or peach pits in place of proven treatments .
Nothing could be farther from the truth .
What I support is what I assume most folks support : common sense .
If a method of treating an illness can be shown to be truly effective , it is retained .
If not , it is discarded .
So a better term could be something like “ new and untested alternatives ” and the other “ fake junk that does n’t really help alternatives . ”
Perhaps that is a bit wordy though .
Sometimes , however , the lines are not as clear as they might be .
This can be illustrated clearly in the realm of psychiatric illness .
By way of example , due to my experiences in the Pentagon on 9/11 , I ’ve developed a case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that mostly manifests itself in regular nightmares .
These get tiring after a while , so I sought help from what the Air Force calls the “ Life Skills ” office . [ 2 ]
None of the “ talk therapy ” seemed to do me much good , so I was offered the chance to experience “ Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing , ” or EMDR .
This treatment , as I experienced it , involves talking about the traumatic experience while the doctor waves a pen or a finger back and forth in front of you .
Your job is to track the object with your eyes while talking about the upsetting event .
The theory , as it was explained to me , is that your brain is forced to multitask .
Part of your brain is watching the pen , and part thinking about the bad stuff , and , together , your brain sections are able work better .
Well , it certainly did n’t work for me , and it seemed very questionable as an alternative treatment to me .
In point of fact , as I sat there my mind wandered to other things , and I was suddenly amused by how I would explain this silliness to Mr. Randi .
After all , I was one of the enlightened ones , who knew bunk when he saw it .
I did more research , however , and found that while it did nothing for me , EMDR does seem to have helped others .
I ca n’t help but think my suspicion a priori may have doomed the treatment .
Had I believed it might work , perhaps it might have .
What ’s my point ?
Simply that in the case of psychiatric illness , what seemed radically “ alternative ” to me may have been an effective treatment for others .
Clearly , this is more likely in the mental heath area .
One cannot “ believe ” his or her appendicitis away .
But we must be careful to ensure we do not dismiss out of prejudice , but out of scientific analysis .
I believe skepticism is always the logical starting point for medical claims , and from there logic , evidence , and reason should be our guides .
[ 1 ]
With apologies to our international readers , for whom Washington was likely not the father of their nations .
[ 2 ]
It was more commonly known as the Mental Health Clinic , but the name was changed some years back .
I suspect in part this stemmed from concern over the stigma sometimes attached to seeking such help .
In my own case , I confess I do feel some level of embarrassment over the PTSD , but I have decided I should not .
I would not be ashamed of , say , a case of psoriasis , so why should I be ashamed over seeking treatment for the after effects of 9/11 ?
Therefore , I share this with you .
Hal Introduces DAVID FEDERLEIN
And with that rambling diversion , I ’m pleased by two things this week .
First , is the pleasure of introducing David Federlein to you .
As you will read below , his story is most compelling .
He ’s a nice fellow , and I ’m so sorry he has had to endure such illness .
But I ’m also so very pleased that scientific advancements have made such a significant difference for him as he battles cancer .
Secondly , I ’m very happy to report my imminent firing as “ guest commentary guy . ”
Mr. Randi continues to improve daily , and he seems very much his old self to me now .
And while the healing process continues , he is now ready to write again !
This is good news without qualification .
I feel very honored to have participated in the SWIFT for the past few weeks , and I am very grateful to the kind folks who provided me with their thoughts and words .
But , in the words of T.S. Eliot , " What we call the beginning is often the end .
And to make an end is to make a beginning .
The end is where we start from . "
And so , with this end , we start again with Mr. Randi .
I ca n’t wait .
And so , I introduce to you , David Federlein …
DOING THE LEAST TO SAVE YOUR LIFE
Good morning , good day , good afternoon , good evening and good night , as Randi once said in his radio broadcasts .
I am honored to be writing this for James Randi ’s commentary as he recovers .
It was with tears of joy and relief that I listened intently to his mp3 messages , and it is with empathy and hope that I wish him a fast recovery .
I have only met Randi once at TAM 4 .
He was every bit as gracious and kind as I had expected .
He was also saucy enough to rib me about the length of my beard in contrast to my friend , who looks like a member of ZZ - Top.
Randi , when you read this , I want you to know that I fully expect you to re-evaluate my beard ’s “ seriousness ” at TAM5 .
Since you aptly noted at TAM4 that my beard was not of length specifications befitting a proper skeptic , I now strive to grow such serious grooming as to befit skeptical standards , albeit to the minor annoyance of my soon - to - be wife .
Hey , sacrifices must be made .
Ok , on a serious note , let me introduce myself .
I ’m not an eloquent and well published skeptic .
I am not the founder of a women ’s skeptical movement .
I have not single - handedly debunked a fraud collecting money on her lies besmirching the gravity of 9/11 nor have I written a vast resource of skeptical topics in dictionary form .
I do n’t know much about astronomy , and I ’m not even famous despite my best musical efforts .
I ’m simply a struggling musician and sound engineer , and unfortunately what brought me to the JREF and my conversion to skepticism is n’t even unusual .
It was cancer and sadly , cancer is an all too common affliction .
I was diagnosed with Solitary Plasmacytoma of Bone in early 2004 .
By the time it was caught in MRI scans , my 9th thoracic vertebrate was completely obliterated .
I could barely walk and was losing feeling from the waist down .
In November 2004 , I had an 11 - hour operation to restore my spine using bone grafts and titanium implants , and began radiation treatments shortly thereafter .
I have 95 % of my mobility back , 100 % feeling in my legs again , and I now do bone surveys , blood tests and bone marrow biopsies every 3 months or so to determine if my Solitary Plasmacytoma has developed into Multiple Myeloma .
Like Randi , I owe my life to very talented , and dedicated medical professionals .
I owe my life to science .
Now that we ’ve gotten that out of the way , I want to discuss several things regarding modern medicine , and the science that forms the solid brick foundation of medical advancements .
You see , there ’s some folks out there that believe some very strange things .
Some believe magnets can heal anything .
Others believe that disease is caused by negative emotions .
I ’ve even heard of some cancer “ cures ” that are downright laughable .
The problem in telling the difference between something that is good science - based treatments with supporting evidence and those unproven , untestable , and at the best ineffective ( at the worst harmful ) treatments is often difficult due to the very real and very difficult emotional states a patient and their family is in .
From the moment I was diagnosed it seemed a flood of information about the newest “ Alternative Treatments ” submerged me for weeks .
Coral Calcium , magnet therapy , touch therapy , crystals , homeopathic treatments , meditation - you name it , I heard it .
I received no less than 5 copies of Kevin Trudeau ’s book .
Cancer is pretty scary , and in desperation , sometimes critical thinking is lost .
I began to read Quackwatch.com .
I began asking my oncologist about everything .
I wanted to know everything I could about what was the most proven and effective treatment .
I ’ll share what I have learned with you .
Firstly , I want to address the clique of “ alternative therapists ” that advocate magnet therapy .
The average power of a kitchen magnet ’s magnetic field , if of high quality , is roughly 1000 gauss ( .1 tesla . )
These magnets sold as bracelets , rings , or pendants are said to cure chronic pain of muscles and bones .
The average MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) scan has a magnetic field power of 30,000 gauss ( 3 tesla . )
Here is the MRI scan of my spine before the surgery :
I can assure you , I was still in pain after that MRI .
If I was n’t cured of pain after that , surely it follows that a kitchen magnet is not actually relieving pain .
The power of suggestion to temporarily relieve symptoms is known as the Placebo Effect .
In the long run , placebo does nothing .
Homeopathy is another “ alternative ” treatment that works on the placebo effect .
Medically it does nothing to cure any disease .
Diluted water dripped on a sugar pill does nothing .
Period .
Any effect of this treatment is also the power of suggestion , and temporary .
Coral Calcium also has no proven effect on cancer along with laetrile or shark cartilage .
Vitamin C in the 1970 ’s was shown to kill cancer cells in massive dose in a test tube , but has no ability to effect cancer cells when ingested , and massive doses of vitamin C would do more harm to the person taking it than to the cancer itself .
In fact , studies show ingested vitamin C is not even effective against the common cold or flu .
The suggestion is sometimes made that negative emotions cause cancer .
This is a very disturbing way to blame the cancer patient for the disease , and it is fairly offensive to me .
That a cancer patient would have negative emotions is to be expected .
How dare anyone insinuate everything should be flowers and puppies during such a frightening and stressful time .
More to the point , though , I have yet to see any scientific evidence that negative emotions are capable of affecting cells in a way as to cause a faulty mitosis and clone out of control .
It simply does not work that way .
However , something must be said for meditative techniques aimed at controlling stress and the high emotions that accompany such an ordeal as cancer .
I am not going to tell you these activities will cure cancer in any way , but they can help relaxation and help to gain control of the wild emotional moods normal to cancer patients and families thereof .
This is n’t woo treatment , however .
This is the very real , very earthly ability to use breathing techniques to regain composure , and calm oneself .
What is at the heart of this problem is simply the inability of “ alternative ” treatments to actually effect disease and recovery in meaningful and empirical ways .
Science uses double blind testing for a reason :
The power of suggestion can fool even the most intelligent scientist .
Confirmation bias can mask the reality that a given hypothesis regarding treatments is completely wrong .
Carl Sagan said it best in “ Demon Haunted World . ”
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence .
This is why medical treatments are not approved based on testimonials alone .
Should you trust your doctors ?
Yes , though a second opinion is always recommended .
Should you trust someone with no evidence to back up their claims ?
Never .
Finally , I want to say that this conspiracy theory of “ Big Pharma ” is a horrible red herring .
Yes , companies do want to make money .
The business of medicine ’s flaws are not compelling reasons to distrust the empirical studies medicine is based on .
In other words : just as humans make mistakes so do corporations .
In the end , “ alternative ” treatments do not have scientific study to show their effectiveness .
When it is your life , your health , and your recovery on the line would n’t you want the best possible treatments that are shown to be effective based on real evidence ?
To place your health in the hands of wishful and magical thinking will eventually only end in tragedy .
Everyone has their wishful thinking .
Everyone has their own untestable beliefs .
Mine is that one day the Detroit Lions might actually make it to the Super Bowl , but the past evidence certainly does not support it .
When it comes to untestable beliefs , people are more important than faith .
Your life is more important than magical thinking about unproven medical treatments .
I would hope everyone makes choices about their health care based on fact , not fiction .
Thank you for your time , and thank you to James Randi and the JREF , who continue to be a source of inspiration , education , and hope to so many .
You Seem to Have a Dent in Your Brain Chakra
Mike McCarron was nice enough to send us this from www.mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com:
I was watching television yesterday for the sole purpose of getting myself pissed off enough to write a blog entry .
Somedays life is too good and I have to remind myself that I 'm incredibly lucky by watching crap on TV that highlights the weirdos and charlatans that take advantage of folks .
One such show called Unexplained Mysteries was about " Psychic Healers " and whether or not they 're real .
Due to the fact that I 'm writing this , I 'm sure you can guess the answer they gave .
The show talked , in part , about a man named Henry Rucker , who is a " healer " that seemingly works with people 's " energy " to fix what ails them .
He was backed up by a man named Dr. Norman Shealy who had worked with Henry for years and years .
I took the liberty of looking up Dr. Shealy on the interhole and found this tidbit of information .
How many " doctors " that you know endorse something called , " Magic Oil " or " Sacred Water " ?
Seriously , take a couple of minutes and read through that linked page there - it's worth it just for such gems as , " ( T ) his Sacred Water acts like a lubricant .
It seems to detoxify the body " ...
Super Water , Holy Water , Sacred Water .
We may well be on the verge of discovering the Fountain of Youth " , and , " Magic Water is the basic liquid found in the origin of life , and compares to the vital liquid of embryonic fluid " .
And the show I watched used this guy as a credible resource .
Oh , one last note on Shealy ; he uses this little phrase in all seriousness : " ... if you have accepted your mortality , if you are planning to grow old and die , then these products should not be incorporated into your life , as they may seriously interfere with your graceful aging and demise ... a living organism , such as the human body , ( is like ) rechargeable batteries , noting that if it is maintained at peak operating efficiency , it will last a very long time , and theoretically forever . "
Yeah , maybe he should hook up with Deepak " Green Jaguar " Chopra and just start saying " quantum " every six seconds in the hopes that someone will take him seriously .
Also , check out the Skeptic 's Dictionary entry on DHEA .
The show also did a segment on " psychic healer " Dean Craft ( Kraft ? ) .
After searching for him a bit I found that the most information I could dig up was on sites about Laverne and Shirley where viewers were asking about how to find him .
( Cindy Williams , who played Shirley , was " healed " by Dean and gave a ringing endorsement - is there anything that C - list " celebrities " do n't know ?
Also , Henry Winkler produced the show - Fonzie , you 've dropped so low ... )
Surprisingly , it seems that Kraft ( or Craft ) charges $ 750 / session and is quite hard to find .
I 'd think that if I could cure ALS with mind power , I 'd be yelling pretty loudly .
Maybe Dean is just shy .
Next up is Roger La Borde , who claims to contact coma victims .
If you go to his site , you 'll see the usual stuff ( there 's the obligatory Einstein quote about " mystery " , and of course it 's called " shaman 's door " ... of course it is ) , but you 'll get an intersting view of him in the " Roger " section under " Door Swings Open " .
There it describes his life falling apart prior to his " discovery " of entering the " shaman 's world " .
It has been my experience that people who think they have special powers usually have had something in their lives go horribly wrong , most times it 's having their spouse leave them , thus making them feel worthless .
They need something to make them " special " again .
There was a woman who came to talk to our massage therapy class in our graduating year , and I apologize that I can't remember her name , but she claimed to do " energy work " and proceeded to do the standard sideshow tricks of pushing down on the arm , etc .
She said that , " ... the body cannot tell a lie " , and used the arm trick to diagnose problems .
I remember asking her that if the body can't lie , basically you should never make an incorrect diagnoses because all you'd have to do is play 20 Questions to narrow the illness to its specific name , then treat accordingly - so why do we need all these expensive imaging machines and such ?
She danced around that question and then said that she guides people through past - life experiences to heal them .
Did you get that ?
Past life regression therapy .
Man ....
My point about her is that she also related a divorce story where her husband left her before she " discovered " her gifts .
Seems to be a common trait .
A man on the Unexplained Mysteries show who had been in a horrible accident and was n't supposed to walk again was " healed " by a special person , then proceeded to become a " healer " himself .
Tragedy + belief + placebo effect = new healer .
Lastly , I have to tell you that one Russian woman was actually " proven " to be effective by use of ... wait for it ... Kirlian photography .
No foolin ' .
I never fail to be amazed at the rehashing of debunked crap , its steaming carcass flung on the public for one more sniff .
Hey , let 's prove psychics are real by using phrenology !
We need a bigger skeptical presence on television to call these people out and show them for what they are - disillusioned , dishonest , or fraudulent .
Please can I be on the show with John Edward ?
Please !?
Man , I hope that guy gets a papercut .
In Closing ...
Randi comments :
Thank you , Hal , Mike McCarron , and Mr. Federlein .
These contributions have kept SWIFT going , and now that I ’m much more mobile and somewhat stronger , it ’s time for me to saddle up and lead the troops again .
I ’ve stuck my “ walker ” in the closet , I only use my cane occasionally , and I ’m slowly being weaned off the spectrum of medications assigned to me .
My voice quality improves daily , I actually had a haircut , and tap - dancing is just around the corner !
I ’ll just drop in a couple of items for you here , to show that I have n’t lost my touch .
An application for the JREF prize – one that is too irresistible to not mention – has arrived , and I simply must quote from it :
Colors are actually electromagnetic energies that are contained within each photon of white light …
No , I wo n’t go into the depth of ignorance shown here ; that ’s beyond my diminished energy level .
I ’ll just give you a critical point that this applicant makes , to show how some 60 pages of his mad theory can be bypassed , and a proper test decided upon .
He writes :
We shall also prove the existence of auras and the exact relationship between physics and psychology ; solve the mysteries of the Holy Trinity and the Seven Rays of Hinduism ; and prove the exact nature of God and the Superstring .
So there .
But I ’ll settle on “ the existence of auras ” for a test .
After deciding what the applicant wants to offer as proof of an “ aura , ” we can conduct such a test easily by finding a willing volunteer in Tennessee .
Pending the outcome of that test , we can proceed .
A second gem of news is that Dr. Gary Schwartz , the professor of Psychology at the University of Arizona who first came to our attention back at www.randi.org/jr/03-23-2001.html, and who believes he has established the idea that consciousness lives on after we die , now believes that some people who have received organ transplants seem to undergo major personality transformations , and even develop new abilities which the organ donor possessed .
No , read that again ; there are no errors of translation .
Now , how Schwartz can possibly believe that a transplanted heart – for example – would contribute to the recipient such a quality as playing the piano , is beyond me , and perhaps equally beyond you .
However , this is the Woo - Woo Land we examine , willy - nilly .
Finally , go to www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006120265,00.html and see the photo of Uri Geller that appears there .
How the man would ever permit such a representation to be published , is beyond me .
But read the accompanying article , and you ’ll see just how desperate he must be to grab media space …
Also , we 're very excited to announce that Banchek will be joining us on the Amaz !ng Adventure .
He 's a world reknowned mentalist and a very good personal friend of mine , and he will knock your socks off .
There 's still time to book at a 10 % discount , but only for a few more days .
Visit www.amazingmeeting.com for more info .
Until next week , this is Amazing telling you all that your encouragement and good wishes brought me to my recovery much faster , I ’m sure , and that sounds a bit paranormal .
Surely , with the recent research that bombed out prayer as an aid to cardiac bypass patients , the argument can be made that since millions did not pray for me , I did as well as observed …?
It seems to be Spring season for rich - interface technologies .
Most trying to blossom with a story about how they ’ll rescue developers from the perils of web programming and its dirty tech of HTML , CSS , and JavaScript .
These stories are told with a shadow assumption that the only reason developers put up with this trinity of web specs is because of what they get back in form of ubiquitous distribution .
That assumption then leads to the fallacy that if only someone could come along and give us a competitive distribution story using more “ advanced ” and “ rich ” interface technology , they ’d surely be golden .
That all web developers are waiting on is someone to save them from the browser mess and deliver them the clean desktop - development experience of yester - century .
In the immortal words of Eric Cartman : Bullcrap .
As a web developer , I ’d like to confess my deep appreciation of the restricted canvas that we get from the basics of the web .
We ’ve entered an era where the browsers are good enough , compatible enough , and , most importantly , our understanding of how to use what we got has been raised to a level where things are finally looking pretty good .
I actually find the development experience between a modern web - application framework , Firebug , and current JavaScript libraries more than just bearable , I find it downright pleasant .
Even more so because it ’s born out of the pragmatism of not needing to be perfect .
It has evolved over a decade of experimentation .
On the user experience side of things , we ’re not even close to tapping out the potential of HTML .
The majority of web sites and applications still suck .
And if most developers and designers can’t make a clean run with the training wheels and constricted playground of HTML , then we probably are in no rush to start playing with a Ducati on the Autobahn .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- James Jackson , a 26 - year - old black employee of 180 Connect , was preparing for another day of installing cable , telephone and Internet service to residential customers of Cablevision in Nassau County , New York on December 7 .
When he walked to the fenced - off area to pick up equipment for the day 's jobs he looked up and was shocked to see a vicious , racist symbol in his workplace .
A noose was hanging in the fenced - off equipment area , visible to the dozens of installers , the majority of whom are black , but accessible only to his boss and an equipment manager , both of whom are white .
Jackson , a former messenger who had worked at 180 Connect for a year and a half , immediately confronted the equipment manager , Dave Willie .
" I asked Dave , " Jackson told CNN , " ' What is that hanging up there ? ' and he said , ' That is a noose ' and I said , ' I know it 's a noose , but why is it up there ? '
And he walked away . "
Jackson and his co-workers say they were distraught .
" I just wanted to leave .
I wanted to get out of there , " 180 Connect employee Ralph Satterwhite told CNN .
" I was disgusted . "
The installers say they never complained to Human Resources .
Instead , they consulted with a labor attorney , documented the incident , and decided to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
Installer Shomari Houston , according to the complaint , says he asked his white boss , Gary Murdock , why a hangman 's noose was in his workplace .
He says the response was :
To hang two black employees .
" He said , ' Yo , I like that , it 's cool , I am gonna hang Russell up there .
Think we can get James up there ? ' " Houston recalls Murdock saying .
" I looked at him like , ' You serious . ' "
Jackson says he continued to ask that the noose be taken down , and openly recorded the following conversation with Willie .
Jackson : " Who 's that for , the rope ? "
Willie : " For anybody who goes past that door that I do n't want them in there . "
Jackson : " Hang 'em ? "
Willie : " Yeah . "
Company says it has no tolerance for racism
After a week of complaints , the noose finally came down .
The next day , December 14 , the installers went public with their gripe , announcing their plans to file the EEOC discrimination claim .
180 Connect says it has zero tolerance for racism .
" It 's inappropriate to put up any sign of violence in the workplace , " said 180 Connect attorney Joel Cohen .
" The company is aware that a noose could have racial connotations and could be a very negative symbol to African - American people .
" The company does not tolerate racism in the workplace and if anybody in the company engaged in wrongdoing , that will be dealt with and will be dealt with in a responsible way . "
180 Connect has suspended Willie with pay , pending results of an investigation .
In a statement , Willie told CNN , " I am deeply saddened that a few of my co-workers have chosen to publicly air allegations of racism which they know to be false . "
Willie 's attorney , Richard Gertler , says his client 's comment had no racial intent .
" He was saying it tongue in cheek .
It 's taken out of context , " said Gertler .
Willie , Gertler stresses , is no racist .
" My client 's first marriage for 17 years was to an African - American woman .
So I do n't think he 's racist . "
Gary Murdock continues to oversee the warehouse at 180 Connect .
Murdock did not return CNN 's phone calls .
180 Connect has retained former National Labor Relations Law Judge Edwin Bennett to conduct an investigation .
The installers , however , are refusing to appear before the judge without their attorney , which the company is not permitting , arguing it is not a legal proceeding .
Although the installers do n't work directly for Cablevision , they also named the cable operator in their suit , saying company employees saw the noose and took no action .
Cablevision told CNN , " We are deeply troubled by the allegations about 180 Connect 's workplace .
We expect 180 Connect to conduct a thorough and credible investigation , to cooperate with any external investigation , and to take any appropriate actions . "
180 Connect has more than 4,000 employees around the country .
Among the cable television companies it provides installation services for is Time Warner Cable , a division of CNN 's parent company , Time Warner .
180 Connect 's operations are almost all in the United States , but the company has its corporate headquarters in Canada and trades on the Toronto stock exchange .

Let your kids know you made the
right choice in 2008 ( and 2012 ) !
The colors of the rooms in your home are a direct reflection of your personality .
While most of us may not spend a lot of time thinking about room color , it affects us every day .
Room color can influence our moods and our thoughts .
Color affects people in many ways , depending on age , gender , ethnic background and climate .
Certain colors ( or groups of colors ) tend to get a similar reaction from most people ; the variations come from the shades or tones used .
This is why it ’s so important to choose colors wisely when it comes to decorating .
You do n’t have to worry about trends in order to have a beautiful home .
Color trends will come and go .
The people who live in a home make it beautiful by choosing colors that reflect their preferences and personalities .

Choose Wisely
Keep in mind that each color has a psychological value .

To create peace and harmony in your home , choose your colors wisely ; some colors in large amounts might have the opposite effect on you and your loved ones .
What mood do you want to create ?
Which colors will help you achieve that mood ?
If you need help answering these questions , look at magazines , decorating books , blogs and websites for ideas .
Also , let your textiles be your guide .
Fabric , carpeting , furniture and tile are available in a more limited range of colors than paint , so choose them first and then decide on your paint color .
Once you find something you like , limit the number of colors in a room to no more than three or four .
Too many colors can make a room look busy or cluttered .
Paint is fairly inexpensive and transforms a room more quickly than anything else , so you can afford to experiment a little .
Room Colors and Their Effects
Colors act in three basic ways : active , passive and neutral .
You can easily match every room ’s colors to your personal desires , to your taste and to the room ’s purpose .
Light colors are expansive and airy , making rooms seem larger and brighter .

There 's no swearing .
There are no sex scenes .
There 's some violence , but that is integral to the plot .
And ultimately there 's a happy ending .
That 's where similarities to Hollywood end , though .
There 's no glamour , no stars , and certainly no Cecil B DeMille .
At first sight , Jesus , or the Jesus Film as it has come to be known , is an unlikely candidate for the title of most watched - and most translated - film .
Shot on location in the Holy Land , and with a white British Jesus , it is instead a straight - faced retelling of Luke 's gospel .
It was made in 1979 , by coincidence the same year as Monty Python 's Life of Brian .
WHO'S THAT MAN ?
Jesus played by Brian Deacon , a Shakespearian actor Filmed in Israel , mostly with Yemenite Jews in the cast
The reason is simply the work of an American evangelical organisation , Campus Crusade .
Funded by its supporters and well - wishers , it sends teams around the world , even where they are not particularly welcome .
There they record new translations of the film , organise screenings to inquisitive crowds in improvised cinemas , and distribute copies to whoever they can .
Rather than concentrate on places like the UK , its focus is on the far corners of the world , although it has of late been sending unsolicited VHS copies to US households .
Among the crusade 's goals are to make a translation for every language .
With some 7,000 languages on the planet it has some way to go yet .
The crusade 's controversial plea
Rather than address the differences between Christianity and Islam , the project has made a new , 15 - minute film , which highlights their similarities , particularly the common ground of the creation story .
The new film 's British director , Andi Hunt , says : " The purpose of it was always to create context for the story of Jesus ...
Jesus is in the Koran , he 's a big part of the Islamic faith , so a lot of care was taken in the introduction to keep that viewer in mind . "
Even though sensitivities were heightened by the shadow of war in Iraq , the new film received its premiere in a village in a politically volatile - but staunchly Islamic - area of northern Egypt .
The project members took a screen , a 16 mm projector , and some leaflets .
Documentary - maker Deep Sehgal filmed the screening as part of a six - month venture to record the work of the project .
His film , Selling Jesus , is to be broadcast in the UK on BBC Four next week .
" Follower of Jesus " Paul Eshleman
" These are not Stepford Christians with glazed expressions and dogmatic platitudes .
These are dedicated , caring and liberal people who believe that they have stumbled upon the one great Truth , and will die for their right to share it . "
From palatial premises in Florida , Paul Eshleman , the head of the crusade , looks the part of the archetypal American evangelist .
And yet his words do n't quite fit the part , preferring for instance to be called a " follower of Jesus " rather than a Christian .
" The word Christian is so loaded with things that have been done in the name of Christ , " he says .
Conviction is one thing - diplomacy is however another .
Even the fact that the organisation calls itself a crusade pinpoints the delicacy of the issues at stake , particularly after President Bush used the term - and quickly dropped it - after 11 September .
AID WORKERS
In 2001 , US aid workers Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer were arrested by the Taleban
They had shown the film to an Afghan family ( but were n't working for the project ) US Marines rescued them George Bush welcomed them home : " It 's been an uplifting experience to talk to these courageous souls "
Eshleman offers no apology for spreading the gospel he believes .
" People ask ' Why do you go to those far away places ? '
It 's because those people have n't had a chance .
That 's all we want to do - to give them a chance to hear the message of Christ in an understandable language near where they live . "
It is people like John Meyer , one of the team which goes into the field to make new translations of the film , who have put that vision into practice - and put the film into the record books .
" I 'm willing to lay down my life for Jesus , should it come to that , " he told Sehgal .
" So if there 's a recording in a war - torn country , I 'm more than willing to go .
Or anywhere else , to be honest . "
These comments on the story were received after the original broadcast .
Just because you support Jesus does n't mean everyone else has to .
I would n't impose it on the people in Iraq .
There will be a backlash .
You should n't preach your religion - it only causes problems .
I'm a Hindu and I certainly would n't go around telling people who they should follow - especially in another country , it 's disrespectful .
Sanjeev , England
The film may help bring hope to the people of Iraq regardless of their religious affiliation .
Gerald Nyerere , Tanzania
Thank you for featuring this wonderful project - from the tiny , once Christian villages now without a functioning church , to little Muslim communities bounded by the desert , this project is bringing the Gospel to people who would never hear otherwise .
Mike Farley , UK
Yet another attempt by the Christian church to indoctrinate people over to them and steal their money under the pretence that they are offering salvation .
Kobe , Wales
Trying to sublimate the dominant religion in another country is , if nothing else , an insult to the sensibilities and belief systems of its indigenous people .
It 's exactly what starts wars in the first place .
Eric , US
It is one of the most powerful films ever made , powerful due to its simplicity and the realistic way in which it is telling about the life of Jesus .
Alex , UK
I would have thought that ordinary Iraqi people had enough to worry about without being outcast from an Islamic or Muslim community .
Ca n't the Americans help them rebuild their country without imposing their beliefs on them as well ?
It is about winning hearts and minds , not brain washing a downtrodden country into Christianity .
James Bainbridge , Britain
Fair play , of course Christians want to share and spread their faith .
But why is the Jesus in the video a white European ?
Does n't that somewhat undermine the realism , and even hint at some underlying prejudices ?
Puzzled , UK
I think that in order to make a judgement on the movie , people should actually watch it first .
If they did they would realize that it is the story of the life of Jesus Christ .
It is not a " turn or burn " sermon that thumps the Bible proclaiming that all who do n't believe are going to hell .
Would you say that same thing if it was a movie on the life of Mother Theresa ?
CS , Australia
These people are so arrogant !
It really annoys me when anyone thinks their religion is better than someone else's .
Why do n't these Christians convert to another religion first , just to see how insulting it is , before they go around giving the " natives " the " benefit " of their religion ?
P Fatania , England
Most of those commenting here are missing the point - it appears that the introduction of this film is not about " imposing " a religion on anyone , it is not about " sublimation " or indoctrination , it is simply allowing access to the Christian gospel and giving those who may not have heard the " good news " an opportunity to do so .
No one is forcing anyone here to do anything .
People watch the film out of curiosity or by choice and therein lies the point .
Christianity is about free will - not coercion .
Sharing faith with others who have different views is not " disrespectful " - it is one of the foundations on which human discourse is based .
Robert , UK
Most of these evangelical groups funded by rich US sponsors and the influential Christian right have an agenda of converting Iraq to Christianity by any means .
They believe their intentions are noble and compassionate .
Having said that , I am baffled by their lack of compassion on the humanitarian side .
Do they care about the deteriorating law - and - order situation , soaring unemployment , lack of power and water etc. in Iraq ?
Nachiketa , US
According to the excellent Dan Cruickshank programme , Iraq has one of the oldest monasteries in the world .
Iraq has been practising Christianity continuously since before the 4th Century .
That is 1200 years before it crossed the Atlantic .
Do n't you think in intervening 1600 years they have had time to work out , individually , which vendor they prefer to purchase their religion from ?
I thought Christianity was about tolerance !

A new study says that on average , more than half of the ink from inkjet cartridges is wasted when users toss them in the garbage .
Why is that interesting ?
According to the study , users are tossing the cartridges when their printers are telling them they 're out of ink , not when they necessarily are out of ink .
The study by TÜV Rheinland looked at inkjet efficiency across multiple brands , including Epson ( who commissioned the study ) , Lexmark , Canon , HP , Kodak , and Brother .
They studied the efficiency of both single and multi-ink cartridges .
Espon 's printers were among the highest rated , at more than 80 percent efficiency using single - ink cartridges .
Kodak 's EasyShare 5300 was panned as the worst printer tested , wasting 64 percent of its ink in tests .
TÜV Rheinland measured cartridge weights before and after use , stopping use when printers reported that they were out of ink .
That 's the first problem .
Printers routinely report that they are low on ink even when they are n't , and in some cases there are still hundreds of pages worth of ink left .
The second issue is a familiar one : multi-ink cartridges can be rendered " empty " when only one color runs low .
Multi-ink cartridges store three to five colors in a single cartridge .
Printing too many photos from the air show will kill your cartridge faster than you can say " blue skies , " as dominant colors ( say , " blue " ) are used faster than the others .
Therein lies the reason Epson backed the study : the company is singing the praises of its single - ink cartridge approach , an approach which is necessarily more efficient in terms of wasted ink because there 's only one color per cartridge , and thus only one cartridge to replace when that color runs out .
Single ink cartridges are n't exactly perfect , however .
Such cartridges still were reported as empty with an average of 20 percent of their ink left , which means that an entire cartridge worth of ink is wasted for every five which are used .
Given the sky - high prices of ink , this is an alarming find .
Epson 's own R360 posted the best numbers , with only 9 percent wasted .
Yet again , Epson commissioned the tests , so we must ask what 's missing .
The study did not measure how much ink is lost due to lack of use , or through cleaning processes .
Inkjet cartridges are known to suffer from quality problems if they are not used for long periods of time , sometimes " drying up . "
This problem has been addressed in recent years , but it has not been eliminated .
The study also did not calculate the total cost per page , which arguably is more important than efficiency .
If Epson 's multicartridge approach is more efficient , it could nonetheless still be more expensive per page than multi-ink cartridge systems .
In its defense , Epson and TÜV Rheinland said that their study focused on the ecological impact of inkjet printing .
This is a familiar argument : hybrid cars have also been criticized for their supposed efficiency , with debates raging as to whether or not your average driver will ever see cost savings from better miles - per - gallon given the relative expensive of hybrid engines .
As such , anyone in the market for an inkjet printer still needs to compare specific models to one another to get a feel for efficiency , and Epson 's efficiency claims needs to be weighed next to the comparative cost of competing inkjet solutions .
Still , the unintended result of this study is that regardless of the battle between single - and multi-ink cartridges , inkjet printers themselves are significantly off the mark when it comes to reporting the fullness of their cartridges .
As the Eagles would say , you 're best off when you " take it , to the limit . "
( Or with a laser printer , one can always do the toner cartridge cha-cha . )

Top federal student loan official in US resigns amid controversy
By Naomi Spencer
12 May 2007
On May 8 , the US Department of Education announced that its top student loan official is stepping down .
According to a statement from Education Secretary Margaret Spellings , Theresa Shaw , chief operating officer of the Federal Student Aid office , will leave her position on June 1 .
Before her appointment in 2002 , Shaw was senior vice president of Sallie Mae , the largest for - profit student loan company in the US , with $ 127 billion in loan assets .
She worked at the company for two decades , then served as CEO of eNumerate Solutions , a technology firm with a client base including Sallie Mae and other major banking and lending companies .
Department officials have not given reasons for her departure and have maintained it is unrelated to the investigations .
In an email obtained by the Washington Post , Shaw claimed that she was leaving the Education department “ to pursue other career opportunities . ”
Nevertheless ,
Shaw ’s resignation is clearly aimed at containing a burgeoning scandal that has exposed the way in which the federal agency responsible for regulating student loans has been turned over to the lending companies .
The resignation came just three days after the Inspector General ’s office at the Education Department opened an inquiry into conflicts of interest and improper financial arrangements between student aid officials , schools and lenders .
It came two days before Spellings was scheduled to testify before Congress .
The Education Department , and particularly its Student Aid office , has come under pressure by outside investigations to appear uncompromised , despite its intimate ties to the $ 85 billion a year loan industry .
Congressional Democrats , seeking to posture as opponents of the corrupt lending procedures , requested personnel records of Shaw and 26 other employees in the department last month .
The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill May 9 that calls for an end to the practice in which lenders provide gifts to school personnel in exchange for a spot on a school ’s “ preferred lender ” list .
At least half a dozen other Bush appointees in the department were also former employees of Sallie Mae , and many more officials have ties to other major lenders .
A manager in the office directly under Shaw , Matteo Fontana , had come from Sallie Mae , to eNumerate Solutions , then to the Education Department , where he was put in charge of a database containing the borrowing patterns and personal information of 60 million students .
Last month , Fontana was placed on leave after New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ’s office discovered he had sold shares worth $ 100,000 in student loan stock in 2003 .
The database was also briefly closed to lenders , which had been mining the system for information and soliciting students based on their borrowing histories .
It was reopened May 3 .
Disclosure of Fontana ’s improper stock holdings came a month after former Deputy Secretary of Education Eugene Hickok admitted holding Bank of America stock during his tenure .
The government reached a $ 50,000 settlement agreement with Hickok , who continued to hold 800 shares in the lender after ethics officials in the department told him to sell .
A number of other revelations have emerged in recent weeks that , taken together , describe conflicts of interest endemic to the revolving door between regulatory agencies and the private sector .
On May 1 , the Washington Post reported that a 2001 proposal aimed at curbing financial inducements from lenders to schools and administrators was quashed by new Bush appointees in the Department of Education .
In addition , hundreds of millions of dollars in federal loan subsidies were collected by loan companies by means of loopholes left open by department officials .
On May 9 , the New York Times reported that repeated warnings about student loan companies abusing rules on federal subsidies and improperly collecting hundreds of millions in government payments were also scuttled by the Bush administration .
The subsidies , set aside by Congress in a worsening economic situation in the 1980s , were intended to ensure the availability of low - cost student loans by guaranteeing lenders a 9.5 percent rate of return on loans financed by tax - exempt bonds , which would shield private lenders from loss and excess cost .
When interest rates had dropped in the early 1990s , Congress cut back parts of the program .
Lenders , eager to collect on the interest rate difference , began finding ways to push their loans into the program by reclassifying them in superficial ways .
A long - time researcher in the Education Department , Jon Oberg , discovered that several large lenders were fleecing the program for hundreds of millions of federal dollars , claiming higher loan amounts as eligible .
He told the Times that when he informed his supervisor in 2003 , he was told to drop it .
His supervisor , a Bush appointee , told Oberg in an email that the department “ does not have an intramural program of research on postsecondary education finance .
In the 18 months you have remaining , I will expect your time and talents to be directed primarily to our business of conceptualizing , competing and monitoring research grants . ”
Oberg ’s job description was subsequently rewritten in order to prohibit further research into the subsidies .
On May 10 , Education Secretary Spellings delivered some defensive remarks before a House committee about the loan investigations and alleged lender abuse of federal subsidies .
Spellings said that the student aid system was “ crying out for reform . ”
“ The system is redundant , it ’s byzantine and it ’s broken , ” she said , essentially presenting the department ’s relations with the for - profit loan industry as a progressive streamlining .
House Education and Labor chairman George Miller , a California Democrat , disagreed , pointing out that regarding alleged conflicts of interest , “ The department has n’t acted on this with any haste or urgency . ”
Miller also criticized Spellings for declining to recover $ 278 million in federal subsidies that a 2006 Education Department audit had found were overpaid to student lender Nelnet , a major Republican Party campaign contributor .
Rather than pay back the $ 278 million , Nelnet agreed not to pursue $ 900 million in federal subsidies the company insisted the department owed it .
The department “ gallowed somebody to get away essentially with theft , ” Democratic Representative John Tierney noted .
In 2005 , Spellings overruled an inspector general recommendation that $ 36 million be recovered from another lender .
“ When I look at the whole body of evidence that has been amassed , ” Miller said , “ it is clear that , at a minimum , the Education Department ’s oversight failures have been monumental . ”
Spellings bristled , pointing out that Congress owned some of the blame for failings in the student aid program by neglecting to reauthorize the Higher Education Act , expired in 2003 , which established federally funded scholarships and low - interest rate loans .
Congress also bears blame for repeatedly denying an increase in the federal Pell Grant while tuition rose substantially .
Whatever the Democrats ’ posturing , they have not taken any serious steps to address the problems confronting American students since gaining control of Congress in January .
The cost of attending college , which has risen by more than a third in the past five years , has left students and their families with little choice but to finance part of educational expenses with loans .
The lending industry has grown exponentially during this period , driven mainly by a 730 percent spike in private loan volume .
Investigations into the relationships between loan companies and university student aid offices have uncovered extensive corruption .
Scores of schools and nearly 100 alumni associations are being investigated for receiving financial inducements and gifts in exchange for endorsement of and promotion of lenders , who may or may not offer the best loans or interest rates for students .
On May 10 , New York Attorney General Cuomo ’s office announced it had reached a $ 3 million settlement agreement with financial company CIT Group and its subsidiary Student Loan Xpress following revelations of lavish gifts and stock deals with university and federal officials .
CIT Group agreed to adopt Cuomo ’s code of conduct , and to cooperate with his investigation into the Education Department official Matteo Fontana , who had held Student Loan Xpress shares .
Separately , New Jersey Attorney General Stuart Rabner announced that his office was subpoenaing 61 universities in the state and 17 student loan companies and banks , including Student Loan Xpress , Sallie Mae , Wachovia , Education Finance Partners , JP Morgan Chase , and Nelnet .
A 2004 memo by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff formalized the separation between the two branches , which had been in place since the end of the Vietnam War .
Apparently , that separation has been getting in the way of fully informing Americans about all the good news coming out of Iraq lately .
A senior military officer close to Petraeus said the memo now in place prevents coordination between the information - operations officers and public - affairs officers .
" The way it is written , it puts a firewall between information operations and public affairs , " the officer said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
" You shut down things that need to be done . "
Outright revocation of the memo might cause a fuss .
Instead Petraeus has been told that a " new policy outlining the relationship and interaction between information operations and public affairs " will be developed .
In the meanwhile he 's been given the green light to let the two branches work together :
Pentagon officials have told Petraeus 's aides that , while the new policy is being developed , they should not interpret the Myers memo as a prohibition against coordination between public affairs and information operations ...
" Conflicting efforts could impede operational success , " the proposed new wording warned , emphasizing the need for the two branches to " be aware of each other 's activities . "
The wall between the two branches has come down at least once before ( that we know of ) , though only within Iraq itself :
In one highly controversial information - operations undertaking , the U.S. military used the Lincoln Group , a Washington defense contractor , to pay Iraqi editors to publish articles casting the American military in a favorable light .
Although the articles , written by U.S. troops , were truthful , some public - affairs officers criticized the practice after it was revealed in the Los Angeles Times in 2005 , because it appeared as if the military was peddling propaganda to journalists .
Um ...appeared ?
Supposedly the two branches will merely " coordinate extensively . "
The " aggressive information management " types would prefer for the public - affairs officers to report to the information - operations officers , but they 've been overruled – for now .
" Public - affairs officers will not be involved in deception operations , " the officer said .
" There are red lines public affairs will not cross .
They will not jeopardize their credibility . "
But if they do – when they do - how would we ever know ?
After all , is n't the whole point of a policy like this to make sure we 're fed just the news they want us to know ?
March 14 , 2007  --
The Navy mobilized a search - and - rescue operation Tuesday night after it believed one of its submarines , the USS San Juan , had gone missing off the coast of Florida with 140 crew members aboard .
Communications were re-established early this morning , and it all appears to have been a case of miscommunication .
The concern was so high that Defense Secretary Robert Gates was notified of the situation overnight , as was White House national security adviser Stephen Hadley , who was preparing to brief President Bush with the news when communications were re-established with the missing submarine .
The Navy had also begun notifying the families of the 140 crew members that the submarine was missing .
The incident is under investigation with the focus being on why the ship missed a pre-established communications period with surface ships .
Communications with the submarine were first lost at 7 p.m. Tuesday and were finally re-established by 5 a.m. today .
The ship reported no problems , and both crew and officers were unaware of the effort under way to locate them .
According to Lt. Cmdr. Chris Loundermon , a spokesman for the Navy 's Submarine Force , " They were operating as … though normal … and had missed a communication period they were not aware of . "
According to Loundermon , no mechanical problems were found aboard the submarine and officials were looking at why the submarine had missed its communication period .
The Los Angeles class submarine , based in Groton , Conn. , was operating off the coast of Jacksonville , Fla. , as part of predeployment training with the USS Enterprise Carrier Strike Group when communications were lost .
Navy officials say the search was launched after surface ships spotted what appeared to be a red flare in the vicinity of where the submarine had been operating .
A red flare is an indicator that a ship is in distress .
With the loss of communications , a search - and - rescue effort was immediately launched .
During exercises , surface ships have a general idea of where submarines are operating underwater , but still have a hard time locating them .
A Navy official said to ABC News , " It 's like any other adversary .
We hope they can't find them .
They 're doing their mission of being seen , but unseen . "
The Navy also notified the International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office , based in Norfolk , Va. ISMERLO contacts international partners to deploy rescue systems in the event of a submarine accident .
The fatal sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk in August 2000 prompted an international rescue effort ; 118 crew men died in that incident .
Family members were called at 4 a.m. today with word that communications had been lost with the submarine .
Two hours later they received the good news that communications had been re-established .
A family meeting was held today for 30 family members to explain what happened and to reassure them that the USS San Juan was operating as normal .
Marijauna appears to constrict blood vessels
The National Institute on Drug Abuse in Baltimore found users have faster blood flow in their brains - even after a month of not smoking .
The findings suggest marijauna use narrows blood vessels , in way similar to that found in heart disease .
Details of the study are published in the journal Neurology .
This suggests that marijuana use leads to abnormalities in the small blood vessels in the brain
Dr Ronald Herning
They used sophisticated ultrasound technology to measure blood flow in volunteers ' brains at the beginning of the study and after a month of abstinence .
Marijauna smokers had a faster blood flow , both at the start of the study , and after they had refrained from their habit for four weeks .
The smokers also had a higher pulsatility index ( PI ) score .
This is a measure of the resistance to blood flow .
The researchers believe the higher PI is caused by narrower blood vessels .
Abnormalities
Researcher Dr Ronald Herning said : " The marijuana users had PI values that were somewhat higher than those of people with chronic high blood pressure and diabetes .
" This suggests that marijuana use leads to abnormalities in the small blood vessels in the brain . "
The research also found that after a month of not smoking , people who had been moderate users - smoking up to 70 marijuana cigarettes a week - showed signs of improved blood flow .
However , a month of abstinence had no positive impact on blood flow among heavy users , who smoked up to 350 joints a week .
Dr Herning told the BBC News website that if blood supply to the brain was reduced , then its cells would be starved of oxygen , and unable to function at full capacity .
" In the long - term one might see cognitive difficulties , such as problems with memory and thinking , " he said .
He said it was also possible that using the drug may increase the risk of a stroke , which is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the brain .
There are case reports of strokes among young marijauna users .
" My advice would be to abstain from using the drug , " Dr Herning said .
Research by a team at McGill University in Montreal has found that long - term cannabis users lose molecules called CB1 receptors in the brain 's arteries .
This reduces blood flow to the brain , causing attention deficits , memory loss , and impaired learning ability .
Professor Peter Weissberg , medical director of the British Heart Foundation , said : " This paper adds to the growing body of evidence that marijuana has important and persistent physiological effects on blood flow to the brain that may have longterm consequences .
" This , coupled with the likelihood that marijuana uses are often also tobacco smokers , points to potential longterm risks for frequent users . "

De Lackner HZ - 1 Aerocycle
During the 1950s and 1960s the United States Army spent considerable energy developing one - and two - man flying machines to carry its soldiers into battle .
These vehicles were intended to offer a powerful advantage in scouting and observation , and to give infantrymen unprecedented freedom of movement on the battlefield .
Ultimately the US Army hoped to give the common foot soldier a set of wings .
The US National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics ( NACA ) began to conduct feasibility research on such technology in the early 1950s .
After some encouraging results in the laboratory using compressed air , several companies went on to build experimental vehicles .
This brief fad of military aviation gave rise to a number of unique contraptions , including such unlikely inventions as backpack helicopters , hovering platforms , and flying jeeps .
The research was first spawned by NACA engineer Charles H. Zimmerman , who determined that a helicopter - style vehicle would be significantly more stable if the rotors were mounted on the bottom rather than on top .
Furthermore , he suggested that a human ’s innate balancing mechanisms could be used to keep such a machine upright .
He referred this as “ kinesthetic control , ” a set of reflexes similar to those which allow humans to ride bicycles and surfboards .
Among the first flying platforms was the HZ - 1 Aerocycle from De Lackner .
It used a forty horsepower outboard motor to turn two counter - rotating helicopter blades .
The two opposing rotors cancelled one another ’s torque , allowing the mounted platform to maintain orientation rather than spinning .
Secured by safety belts , the soldier - pilot stood on a platform just above the churning blades , using motorcycle - like handlebars to turn the vehicle and to change altitude .
Directional control was achieved by leaning in the desired direction of travel , with a maximum velocity of 65 - 70 mph .
Hiller VZ - 1 Pawnee
Captain Selmer Sundby , an experienced pilot with over 1,500 hours of flying experience , was the test operator for the Aerocycle .
He made many flights , with times varying from a few seconds to over forty minutes .
The HZ - 1 was designed to be used by soldiers after twenty minutes of instruction .
Captain Sundby said , “ . . . it only took me one flight to realize that a non-flyer would have considerable difficulty operating it . ”
Twice during testing the contra-rotating blades flexed and collided , causing the apparatus to fall out of the sky .
Sundby was lucky to survive both incidents , one of them from forty feet in the air .
The project was cancelled after the second accident , and Sundby was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts .
A similar prototype was the VZ - 1 Pawnee developed by Hiller Aviation .
As with the Aerocycle it was hoped that soldiers could operate the Pawnee with only an hour or two of instruction .
Using two 44 horsepower engines , the platform was lifted by two counter - rotating five - foot - wide rotors in a round enclosure , a configuration known as a ducted fan .
In horizontal flight , the VZ - 1 demonstrated an automatic self - righting tendency .
This occurred because the leading edge lip of the duct generated more lift than the trailing edge , causing an upward pitch .
This force worked to balance the pilot ’s weight as he shifted the platform in the direction he wanted to fly .
Consequently , the platform was almost impossible to topple .
The Army saw some promise in the design , and two larger prototypes were built which also worked quite well , but ultimately the project was abandoned as too impractical .
The idea that a soldier could use the Pawnee to snipe at the enemy turned out to be a fantasy , as it was very noisy and made the soldier a highly vulnerable target .
Another shortcoming was that the Pawnee had a top speed of only 16 mph .
A few companies applied the hovering concept to larger vehicles .
The best attempt at making a flying jeep was the VZ - 8 Airgeep built by Piasecki .
The VZ - 8 was built around two ducted fans driven by a pair of 180 horsepower engines .
Both power plants were connected to a single central gearbox so that both rotors would continue to turn even if one engine failed .
Controls for the Airgeep were very much like conventional helicopter controls .
Piasecki VZ - 8 Airgeep
Although the Airgeep was intended to operate within a few feet of the ground it was also capable of flying at altitudes of several thousand feet .
The Airgeep was a very stable weapons platform and could hover or fly around most any obstacle .
A larger , more powerful version called the Airgeep II was developed in 1962 , and it proved even more capable .
Further evaluation of the concept , however , led the Army to conclude that the design lacked the ruggedness and flexibility of conventional helicopters , and that its maintenance demands were too high .
The Airgeep was abandoned in the early 1960s .
At around the same time , Bell Aerosystems was developing a series of rocket and jet packs for military use .
The army lost interest when it found that maximum practical flight time was less than thirty seconds , but the small kerosene jets used in these jet packs were later employed in other configurations .
This engine would become the basis for Williams Research Corporation ’s WASP ( Williams Aerial Survey Platform ) .
Test pilots would come to give it the nickname “ Flying Pulpit ” .
The WASP , later named the X - Jet , was the result of fifteen years of development .
It looked a bit like a flying garbage can , with the pilot standing on the fuel tank and a 600 - pound turbofan engine mounted in front of him .
Performance of the WASP was impressive , with a speed of 60 mph and a service ceiling of 10,000 feet .
Maximum flight time was just over 30 minutes .
The craft was listed in Jane ’s All the World ’s Aircraft as late as the 1985 edition but once again the army , which had financed its development , lost interest .
Today the Williams Corporation makes compact jet engines for cruise missiles and jets .
Williams WASP
The United States Army also tested a series of one - soldier assault helicopters , including a device named the Hiller Rotorcycle which could collapse into the volume of a large trunk .
Several attempts were also made to develop backpack helicopters , but the idea never got off the ground because the machines were much too large and heavy to be practical .
Moreover , the constant vibrations during short test flights left operators extremely disoriented and unable to properly control the craft .
By the 1970s the US military largely abandoned such flights of fancy .
Although a one - or two - man light aircraft was an intriguing concept , all of the vehicles shared common weaknesses in regards to maintenance , noise level , vulnerability , and the lack of practical applications .
There were also very valid concerns about the stability of the small aircraft in windy conditions .
Examples of these unique military aircraft can currently be found at aviation museums all over the country .
Maybe the slow acquiescence to the ghastly here -- not in Baghdad , not in Rwanda , here -- is rooted in the intensive news coverage of the hurricane 's aftermath : floating bodies and obliterated towns equal old news .
Maybe the concerns of the living far outweigh the dignity of a corpse on Union Street .
Or maybe the nation is numb with post - traumatic shock .
Wandering New Orleans this week , away from news conferences and search - and - rescue squads , has granted haunting glimpses of the past , present and future , with the rare comfort found in , say , the white sheet that flaps , not in surrender but as a vow , at the corner of Poydras Street and St. Charles Avenue .
" We Shall Survive , " it says , as though wishing past the battalions of bulldozers that will one day come to knock down water - corrupted neighborhoods and rearrange the Louisiana mud for the infrastructure of an altogether different New Orleans .
Here , then , the New Orleans of today , where open fire hydrants gush the last thing needed on these streets ; where one of the many gag - inducing smells -- that of rancid meat -- is better than MapQuest in pinpointing the presence of a market ; and where images of irony beg to be noticed .
The Mardi Gras beads imbedded in mud by a soldier 's boot print .
The " take - away " signs outside restaurants taken away .
The corner kiosk shouting the Aug. 28 headline of New Orleans 's Times - Picayune : " Katrina Takes Aim . "
Rush hour in downtown now means pickups carrying gun-carrying men in sunglasses , S.U.V.'s loaded with out - of - town reporters hungry for action , and the occasional tank .
About the only ones commuting by bus are dull - eyed suspects shuffling two - by - two from the bus- and - train terminal , which is now a makeshift jail .
Maybe some of them had helped to kick in the portal to the Williams Super Market in the once - desirable Garden District .
And who could blame them if all they wanted was food in those first desperate days ?
The interlopers took the water , beer , cigarettes and snack food .
They did not take the wine or the New Orleans postcards .
I had noticed a recent review paper on progress in calorie restriction ( CR ) research over the past year or so ; unfortunately it has no freely available abstract , which makes referencing fairly pointless for the majority of readers here and at the Longevity Meme .
However , the folk of the Calorie Restriction Society mailing lists have more information :
Selected quotes from CR research progress report over the past year .
The PDF article is quite technical .
I may have missed numerous significant points .
I cherry - picked those of interest to me ( that I could understand ! ) .
1 . CR Lifespan increase appears to be very robust and plastic
The fact that alternate pathways promoting longevity are induced in [ yeast ] strains lacking respiratory capacity [ no mitochondrial retardation of aging ] does not negate a role for mitochondrial metabolism where the organelles are functional .
The important finding from these studies on strain dependent differences is that CR may extend lifespan by impacting multiple pathways and that there may be a certain amount of mechanistic plasticity .
2 . TOR pathway affects nutrition , metabolism and longevity
The influence of TOR on mitochondrial function is of particular interest in the context of CR , because mammalian studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial metabolism and [ free radical ] generation are altered in tissues from restricted animals compared to controls .
3 . CR does not work in some genetically altered species
In rodents , CR extends the lifespan of the Ames dwarf but does not further extend the lifespan of the growth hormone receptor knockout ( GHRKO ) mouse ( Bonkowski et al. , 2006 ) .
So in short , as I mentioned the other day , it seems likely that sirtuins are not the end of the calorie restriction story insofar as genes and biochemistry goes .
In addition , it is clear that scientists are making real progress in narrowing and clarifying the focus on the core biochemistry of CR - induced longevity and health benefits - what is essential , and what is not .
It would not surprise me to see mitochondrial function amongst the important changes brought about by the practice of calorie restriction , given the prominent role most likely played by mitochondria in causing aging .
A fair amount of money is presently going towards calorie restriction studies - certainly much more than in past years , even if modest in comparison to many other fields of medical research .
Expect to see much more progress in the next couple of years , especially as some calorie restriction mimetic drugs start to move ahead in the pipeline .
Now if we could just raise more effective longevity and anti-aging research - based on repair rather than metabolic manipulation - up to even this level of funding ...

Saddam Hussein , looking healthy despite a hunger strike the led him to be fed with a tube , said today that he had been forced to attend his own trial , and that if he is convicted , he preferred to be shot , not hanged .
On a day of relative calm in Iraq , with fewer than a dozen people reported killed or found dead in Baghdad , Mr. Hussein offered what could be a final dose of public defiance .
He praised the insurgents who attack Americans .
He denounced the court as illegitimate .
He denied that he or his seven codefendants deserved to be charged with executing 148 men and boys in Dujail after a supposed assassination attempt in 1982 .
Mr. Hussein ’s main defense lawyers have boycotted the trial since July 10 to protest the proceedings , so court - appointed lawyers offered closing arguments for him today .
They said that there was not enough evidence to show that Mr. Hussein ordered the killings .
People are strange .
I ’m not just talking about your Uncle Cedric with the hairy feet and stale piece of toast with the image of Tina Turner he swears will grab six - figures on eBay , I mean it more in terms of our mental capabilities .
Think about how brilliant we are compared to a tape recorder , but how hopelessly inaccurate our ability is to remember a conversation .
Ask any police officer who ’s interviewed six eyewitnesses and he ’ll give you six different accounts of the same event .
$ 200 Dinners
It ’s widely accepted in the world of research that humans remember meaning rather than fact .
As an example , if I told you “ I went to the mall the other day , ” it ’s likely that in 10 minutes you would remember the sentence as “ I drove to the mall the other day . ”
In other words , the meaning would stick rather than the details .
Let ’s take Fred as an example .
Fred is on his way to a job interview for a position as a software developer .
His experience meets all the requirements , and based on his resume he ’s the top candidate out of the 50 or so that applied .
Fred arrives , dress to impress in his $ 149 suit from TJ Maxx and $ 20 black leather shoes from Payless .
The interview goes extremely well ; he builds rapport with the interviewer , answers most of the technical questions correctly , and manages to craft an artful LEFT OUTER JOIN on the whiteboard .
Fred is on top of the world until , to his surprise , he notices a huge ink stain on his shirt .
It turns out Fred likes to keep fountain pens in his shirt pocket ( because the ladies dig it ) .
On this fateful day , that pen decided to gush its payload all over Fred ’s brand new cotton dress shirt .
Fred ’s embarrassment is palpable as the interview wraps up and although he makes it out of there alive , he does n’t get the job .
Why ?
You could say it ’s because I made this story up and can twist it any way I want to prove a point .
That ’s valid , but how about this : after interviewing four more candidates over the next two weeks the hiring manager does n’t have point by point recall of every interview .
In fact , although he made a few notes here and there , all he can do is go with his gut feeling about who would be the best fit for the position .
And you know what ?
Even though Fred fit the position perfectly , there ’s a voice in the back of the hiring manager ’s mind that wo n’t let him hire Fred .
He does n’t know why , but he has an awkward feeling about the whole experience .
All because of a lousy fountain pen .
The moral of the story is to buy high - quality fountain pens .
* ahem * I mean , the moral of the story is that human beings remember meaning rather than fact .
This means that the impression they take away from an experience is much more important than what actually happens .
This is why restaurants like The Melting Pot can charge 50 bucks a person for fondue when you can make it at home using the change in your sofa .
It ’s also why , two years after you see a crappy movie , you wo n’t be able to remember the character names , dialogue , scenes , or much of the plot , but you will remember that it was terrible .
It ’s all because the experience of these events is forever lodged in our brains , while the fact of a $ 200 dinner have long since departed .
This is easily translated into advice for interview day : do everything within your power to make sure you leave the interviewer feeling like she ’s hugged a warm puppy .
Be cordial , do n’t show negative emotions , have excellent manners ( the ones you never use around the house ) and never , ever act indignant about answering technical questions .
Some people think it ’s unfair to ask candidates to write code on the fly ; you may be one of these people .
The interview is not the place to voice that opinion , whether verbally or through your body language ( like the “ leaking tire ” noise you make when asked – I actually had a candidate do this once ) .
I ’ve also had candidates act bored or roll their eyes at basic programming questions .
If explaining how GET is different than POST is beneath you , suck it up , answer the question , and hope the interviewer moves on to topics worthy of your genius soon .
If not how will he ever discover how you built a Ruby on Rails compiler in assembler on your Commodore Pet ?
Finally , it ’s been shown over and over that attractive people fare better in job interviews , get more promotions , and earn more money .
Unless you ’re Brad Pitt you should show up showered , shaved , and wearing a suit .
It does n’t matter if you do n’t believe in suits and do n’t ever plan to wear one to work – everyone looks better in a suit ( even Brad Pitt ) .
Bring Something Real
People also remember things that are related to other memories ; the more connections , the easier something is to remember .
This is why commercials contain catchy jingles that are really just remakes of pop songs with the words slightly modified .
It ’s because these songs touch on a piece of our brains that will somehow relate the “ coolness ” of the song to the product .
If the marketers did their jobs , the next time you hear the song you will likely have an urge to run out and buy yourself a new pair of insoles .
These insoles may hurt your feet so bad you ’ll feel like you ’ve been dancing on broken glass , but somehow they ’ll still seem cool because Britney Spears sang “ Oops , I bought insoles again . ”
This is also why every single memory improvement book revolves around relating things to common objects you encounter in everyday life .
Be it a list of items or peoples ’ names , the more memories you have that link to an object , the stronger the memory of that object becomes .
To capitalize on this , bring something memorable to the interview .
You want the interviewer to link you with as many “ good feeling ” thoughts as possible .
Bring glossy , color print - outs of a UI you worked on or prettied - up copies of a data model you designed .
You could even bring sample products from your current or former employer .
Your company makes soft drinks ?
Bring a 6 - pack of root beer .
Your company prints newspapers ?
Bring a few copies of today ’s edition .
Bring something real that the interviewer can look at and touch once you ’ve left .
This brings me to a concept I ’ve been cooking up for quite a while : a HireMeTM book .
With cheap , high quality , on - demand publishers like Lulu and Blurb , creating a few copies of a custom tome is economical and requires minimal time investment .
For around $ 10 a pop you can print your own commercial - quality paperback containing your resume , samples of your work , and , if you ’re the creative type , a section of “ Reasons to Hire Me . ” I plan to devote a future essay to the concept and design of a HireMeTM book .
The Self - Reference Effect
Psychologists have discovered a phenomenon they call the self - reference effect , which boils down to the following : people tend to remember information that refers to themselves .
This is why you easily remember someone with the same name as your brother , while forgetting the other 19 people you meet in an evening .
This is also why the Jack in the Box commercials during Soccer games have Jack racing after a soccer ball ; the marketers are trying to relate to something that a large chunk of the audience will find as a self - reference .
In addition to remembering names and marketing quasi - food , the self - reference effect is amazingly effective at making interviewers relate to you , remember you , and maybe even like you .
Before your interview try to find out as much as possible about your interviewers .
If necessary , politely request a list of names to help with your preparation , and head to Google .
With common names , try to narrow your search by including terms like the name of the company , or the name of the city where the company is located , or even something as generic as “ software developer . ”
If you find a personal homepage or can pull up a resume you ’re golden .
This type of information allows you to build a picture in your mind of who they are and what they ’re about .
With this information in mind , try to honestly relate to them during the interview .
If they publish a lot of articles , be sure to bring up recent articles you ’ve written .
If they like to water ski , bring up the fact that you go every summer .
Do they play the guitar ?
Mention your Taylor that you play every chance you get .
Obviously , this is n’t a license to lie about things you ’ve never done to make yourself more familiar ; trust me , you ’ll get caught .
But anything you can do to relate to this person is not only a step towards a connection , but it ’s a step towards being burned into their mind forever …or at least until your start date .
The self - reference effect , when used appropriately , is extremely powerful .
Finishing Touches
These techniques are like a coat of Carnuba wax on a Corvette ; they add shine , but the underlying paint has to look nice , too .
These techniques wo n’t salvage a lack of technical knowledge or a disregard for punctuality , but used in conjunction with basic interviewing skills they will improve your chances of landing a job .
Just be sure to leave the fountain pen at home .

From the Guardian report :
In the first few days after the captives were seized and British diplomats were getting no news from Tehran on their whereabouts , Pentagon officials asked their British counterparts : what do you want us to do ?
They offered a series of military options , a list which remains top secret given the mounting risk of war between the US and Iran .
But one of the options was for US combat aircraft to mount aggressive patrols over Iranian Revolutionary Guard bases in Iran , to underline the seriousness of the situation .
The British declined the offer and said the US could calm the situation by staying out of it .
London also asked the US to tone down military exercises that were already under way in the Gulf ...
At the request of the British , the two US carrier groups , totalling 40 ships plus aircraft , modified their exercises to make them less confrontational .
The British government also asked the US administration from Mr Bush down to be cautious in its use of rhetoric , which was relatively restrained throughout ...
A senior Iranian source with close ties to the Revolutionary Guard , told the Guardian : " If this had been between Iranian and American soldiers it could have been the beginning of an accidental war . "
With the crisis now over , a remarkable degree of consensus is emerging among British , Iranian and Iraqi officials about what happened over 13 nervous days - namely that the decision to seize the Britons was taken locally , and was not part of a grander scheme cooked up in Tehran .
As it turns out ( though we did n't hear about this factor at the time from either the Bush administration or from reporters ) , most of the Iranian leadership was on vacation for the new year festival , and did not re-assemble in Tehran until earlier this week .
As soon they were able to assess what the trouble - makers in the " Revolutionary Guards " had done in their absence , the leading factions in the Iranian government decided to bring the crisis to an end .
In the meantime , Bush could easily have provoked a major war if he'd been left to his own devices .
One of the real fears connected to US saber - rattling in the Gulf has been that an accidental conflict could escalate quickly into war for little reason .
The administration is undoubtedly planning some sort of action , but has n't decided whether to carry it out .
The danger lies in inadvertent escalation , where a saber - rattling United States and a rattled Iran stumble into a war that neither really wants .
Indeed sending large naval task forces into the Gulf seemed designed to create exactly that spark to a conflagration .
But the administration 's actions are increasing the chances for an accidental confrontation .
People do n't realize how small and narrow the Gulf is , especially as you approach the Straits of Hormuz .
The tanker / container and related commerce traffic is incredible and it goes on twenty - four hours a day .
We 've already got one carrier battle group there and now we 're going to put in another one , which will add a huge footprint .
When you have , on both sides , nineteen - year - olds manning weapons , it 's a formula for an accident that could spin out of control .
This minor incident looks to be the war - that - did n't - quite - happen .

Palast exposed 2004 voter attack scheme by appointee Griffin , a Rove aide on BBC Newsnight in 2004 .
Black soldiers and the homeless targeted .
There 's only one thing worse than sacking an honest prosecutor .
That 's replacing an honest prosecutor with a criminal .
There was one big hoohah in Washington yesterday as House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers pulled down the pants on George Bush 's firing of US Attorneys to expose a scheme to punish prosecutors who would n't bend to political pressure .
But the Committee missed a big one : Timothy Griffin , Karl Rove 's assistant , the President 's pick as US Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas .
Griffin , according to BBC Television , was the hidden hand behind a scheme to wipe out the voting rights of 70,000 citizens prior to the 2004 election .
Key voters on Griffin's hit list : Black soldiers and homeless men and women .
Nice guy , eh ?
Naughty or nice , however , is not the issue .
Targeting voters where race is a factor is a felony crime under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .
In October 2004 , our investigations team at BBC Newsnight received a series of astonishing emails from Mr. Griffin , then Research Director for the Republican National Committee .
He did n't mean to send them to us .
They were highly confidential memos meant only for RNC honchos .
However , Griffin made a wee mistake .
Instead of sending the emails — potential evidence of a crime — to email addresses ending with the domain name “ @GeorgeWBush.com ” he sent them to “ @GeorgeWBush .
ORG . ” A website run by prankster John Wooden who owns “ GeorgeWBush.org . ”
When Wooden got the treasure trove of Rove-ian ravings , he sent them to us .
And we dug in , decoding , and mapping the voters on what Griffin called , “ Caging ” lists , spreadsheets with 70,000 names of voters marked for challenge .
Overwhelmingly , these were Black and Hispanic voters from Democratic precincts .
The Griffin scheme was sickly brilliant .
We learned that the RNC sent first - class letters to new voters in minority precincts marked , “ Do not forward . ”
Several sheets contained nothing but soldiers , other sheets , homeless shelters .
Targets included the Jacksonville Naval Air Station in Florida and that city 's State Street Rescue Mission .
Another target , Edward Waters College , a school for African - Americans .
If these voters were not currently at their home voting address , they were tagged as “ suspect ” and their registration wiped out or their ballot challenged and not counted .
Of course , these ‘ cages ' captured thousands of students , the homeless and those in the military though they are legitimate voters .
We telephoned those on the hit list , including one Randall Prausa .
His wife admitted he was n't living at his voting address : Randall was a soldier shipped overseas .
Randall and other soldiers like him who sent in absentee ballots , when challenged , would lose their vote .
And they would n't even know it .
And by the way , it 's not illegal for soldiers to vote from overseas — even if they 're Black .
But it is illegal to challenge voters en masse where race is an element in the targeting .
So several lawyers told us , including Ralph Neas , famed civil rights attorney with People for the American Way .
Griffin himself ducked our cameras , but his RNC team tried to sell us the notion that the caging sheets were , in fact , not illegal voter hit lists , but a roster of donors to the Bush - Cheney reelection campaign .
Republican donors at homeless shelters ?
Over the past weeks , Griffin has said he would step down if he had to face Congressional confirmation .
However , the President appointed Griffin to the law enforcement post using an odd little provision of the USA Patriot Act that could allow Griffin to skip Congressional questioning altogether .
Therefore , I have a suggestion for Judiciary members .
Voting law expert Neas will be testifying today before Conyers ' Committee on the topic of illegal voter “ disenfranchisement ” — the fancy word for stealing elections by denying voters ' civil rights .
Maybe Conyers should hold a line - up of suspected vote thieves and let Neas identify the perpetrators .
That should be easy in the case of the Caging List Criminal .
He 'd only have to look for the guy wearing a new shiny lawman 's badge .

Are you one of those people who spend entirely too much money on groceries every month ?
You are not alone , as this is a big problem for many people all over the country .
Everybody needs to eat , however , though you certainly do n't want to spend so much that you blow through your budget and put your finances at risk .
Would n't it be nice if there were a way to spend less money on groceries without really seeing much of a change on what you have stocked in your refrigerator ?
This may sound difficult , but the challenge is not nearly as daunting as it appears .
Here are three easy tips that can save you a bundle of money every month :
1. Shop at Budget Stores
Rather than opting for regular supermarkets , seek out those that are known for offering budget prices - some of the most popular options include Aldi and Bottom Dollar Food .
You do n't have to shop solely at these stores , but you can supplement your grocery shopping by picking up a number of items at a greatly reduced price .
Believe it or not , many of these stores have the same brands that you have grown accustomed to .
Does this mean that you need to make an extra stop every time you go grocery shopping ?
It 's likely .
However , the money that you can save is well worth the effort .
2. Use Coupons
In the past , there was a perfectly viable excuse for not clipping coupons :
You had to purchase a newspaper in order to find them and realize the savings .
But nowadays , this is no longer the case .
With the help of the Internet , you can search for and print coupons for just about anything .
From food , to personal hygiene items , to pet supplies , and much more , there are endless supplies of coupons online , available for the taking .
Do n't be shy about printing out as many coupons as you can find .
You may not use each and every one on your next shopping trip , but it 's nice to have many options at your disposal .
Just remember , most coupons have expiration dates , so be sure to use them on time .
3. Shop With a Full Stomach
I never thought this would help me save money until I tried it - and now , I never head to the grocery store on an empty stomach .
When I am full , there is a less of a chance that I will make impulse purchases for items I do n't need .
When I am hungry , anything that looks good ends up in the cart .
Give this a try .
You may find that it is the best way to spend less money on groceries .
Final Thoughts
Some people ignore the fact that they overspend on groceries , solely because they consider groceries to be an absolute necessity .
While this may be true , this does n't mean you can't save money .
There a number of ways to spend less at the supermarket without sacrificing the quality of food you bring home .
Having a few extra dollars in your bank account at the end of the month makes it well worth the effort .
What other ways can you suggest to save money on groceries ?
If you want to peer into the furthest reaches of space , a regular telescope wo n’t do .
You need to harness the power of a massive galaxy to bend light from an even more distant galaxy – a gravitational lens .
And a team of European astronomers have found one of the luckiest discoveries of all , an Einstein ring , where the lens and more distant galaxy line almost perfectly .
Because of its unique shape , they ’re calling it “ The Cosmic Horseshoe ” .
The discovery was made by more than a dozen astronomers from a handful of European universities , from England to Russia .
They published their discovery in a research paper called The Cosmic Horseshoe : Discovery of an Einstein Ring around a Giant Luminous Red Galaxy , which has been submitted to the Astrophysics Journal .
They turned up the object after poring through data in the massive Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
This survey uses robotic telescopes to capture images of the night sky ; eventually it will map out 25 % of the sky , seeing 100 million objects .
Astronomers regularly look through this vast quantity of data , and pull out all kinds of interesting objects .
Such as the Cosmic Horseshoe .
Then they did follow - up observations using the 2.5 metre Isaac Newton Telescope in La Palma and the 6 metre BTA telescope in Russia .
This gave the detailed image attached to this story , as well as the spectral information to determine the chemical constituents of the lens and lensed object .
Look at the picture , and you can see a red spherical galaxy surrounded almost completely by a blue ring .
In reality , this is a relatively nearby galaxy , located 4.6 billion light - years away ( the lens ) , and then a more distant blue galaxy located 10.9 billion light - years away ( the lensed object ) .
The two line up perfectly from our point of view , so that light from the blue galaxy is focused by the gravity of the lens .
Light that would head off into space is turned back towards the Earth .
All this additional light allows astronomers to see what would normally be an invisible object .
In fact , the two are lined up so perfectly , that the lensed galaxy has been turned into a ring that wraps 300 - degrees around the lens .
The lens is an extremely massive luminous red galaxy , containing 5 trillion times the mass of the Sun .
For comparison , our own Milky Way only contains 580 billion solar masses .
And this is just the “ telescope ” .
The more distant , lensed object is a starburst galaxy undergoing furious rates of star formation – evidenced by the blue spectrum of its light .
If it were n’t behind the lens , astronomers would n’t even know it was there .
But because it ’s directly behind the lens , its light has been focused into a nearly complete ring around the lens .
Since it ’s 10.9 billion light - years away , we see it at a time when the Universe was less than 3 billion years old .
This discovery gives astronomers two useful directions for further research : dark matter distribution around luminous red galaxies , and the formation of stars in the early Universe .

WELCOME to the SECOND CENTURY
of the LORD KELVIN'S Entropic Transcendence !
Dec. 17 , 1907 - Dec. 17 , 2007
Start the Century right ...
YOU TOO can be
CONSERVED FROM ENTROPY !
Ask me how ...
Who Is This Man Called Kelvin ?
Who is the Lord Kelvin ?
Perhaps you have asked yourself this as you have heard others speak of Him .
Well , I have good news for you : the Lord Kelvin Loves you and wishes to Conserve you from Entropy .
" Now , slow down a minute buddy !
I do n't quite understand what all THIS means ! "
You are , no doubt , wanting to say to me .
That 's OK , for I was once like you and did n't know about the Lord , the one true Lord Kelvin .
Let me tell you about our Lord , for He is your Lord as He is mine : the Lord Kelvin chose to come among us as a Man so that He may give us His teachings .
He did n't have to , He chose to !
He did this because He loves us , for we are His Creation .
As is our Universe .
The Lord Kelvin created it all .
For
He is more than just the Man that moved among us , He is the Lord of Our Universe , the Second Wrangler who is also the Senior Wrangler !
The Sublime Mystery that is the Lord Kelvin transcends our ability to grasp , but all we need to know is that He LOVES us and wants the best for His Children .
JOIN THE KELVIN CONSCIOUSNESS MOVEMENT TODAY !
The Lord Kelvin delivers a sermon from His Lecture Hall .
The Lord Kelvin delivers a sermon from His Lecture Hall .
LORD KELVIN :
Giver of Laws The Lord Kelvin , in His infinite wisdom , has given the Universe Laws by which to govern itself THERMODYNAMICALLY :—
The Laws of Thermodynamics Law The Zeroth : Two systems in Thermal Equilibrium with a third are in Thermal Equilibrium with each other Two systems in Thermal Equilibrium with a third are in Thermal Equilibrium with each other The property that characterizes Thermal Equilibrium is Temperature .
The Lord Kelvin tells us that there is an ABSOLUTE Temperature !
Since bodies that are in contact with each other will eventually reach Thermal Equilibrium , it follows that by being in contact with the Lord Kelvin we may come to be one with Him .
Law The First : Energy Is Conserved Energy
Is Conserved The Lord Kelvin , in His infinite benevolence , has deigned that the total Energy Content of the Universe shall remain constant ; never being Created nor Destroyed , but only Transformed from one form to another .
Law The Second : Universal Entropy Increases Universal Entropy Increases
Over the Universe as a whole , Entropy will increase .
Entropy is that Energy that no longer is Ordered .
It is Death of the most Absolute kind !
All is susceptible to its Chilly Grasp : plants , animals , information , even The Human Soul !
Sure , all those things , even our Souls , will have time until that happens ; until the Universal Entropy consumes everything in the Great Heat Death , but THEN what ?
What will you do ?
Law The Third : A Pure Crystal 's Entropy Is Zero At Zero Kelvins A Pure Crystal 's Entropy Is Zero At Zero Kelvins The Purest Crystal of them all is The Lord Kelvin himself !
The Lord Kelvin is without Entropy .
Furthermore , since Absolute Zero is unattainable via a finite series of processes , it follows that the Lord Kelvin is Infinite !
This implies that His powers are also Infinite , meaning that the Lord Kelvin can transcend His own Law The Second and Conserve you from Entropy ! .... Absolute Temperature From Law The Zeroth we see that the Lord Kelvin tells us that there IS an ABSOLUTE Temperature !
Do n't listen to the lies of the Thermic Relativists ; the TRUTH of the Absolute Nature of Temperature will warm your Mind & Heart and fulfill you as nothing they will ever spew could .
Because the Lord Kelvin gave us the gift of the Knowledge of the Absolute Temperature , we honor His wisdom and the beauty of His creation by measuring Temperature in Kelvins .
Do not use the hurtful and deceitful Celsius and Fahrenheit scales !
They are the tools of Relativists and other sad , twisted haters of the Lord Kelvin .
And remember : never say " degrees Kelvin " , just say " Kelvins " , as in " 273.16 Kelvins " .
Every time you do , you bring a smile to His face .
Entropy : Must It ALWAYS Increase ?
Entropy is disorder , chaos , death .
The Lord Kelvin tells us that Entropy must increase in a closed system .
But is this an Absolute ?
Must it Always increase ?
Well ... yes .
But there is a way out of this Fate .
The key is the closed nature of this system we call the Universe .
If we could find a way to Open up a doorway , a window , to the Lord Kelvin so that He may Energize us with His Infinite and Non-Entropic Rays of Love , then we may escape , be Conserved from , the Neverending Death of Entropy .
The Divine Hand Of The Lord Kelvin The Divine Hand Of The Lord Kelvin
The only path to Conservation from Entropy is through the Lord Kelvin !
Only
He may Transgress the Immutable Laws of Thermodynamics and allow you to escape the Increase in Entropy that is the Fate of all those who are without Him in their Minds & Hearts .
To be Conserved , all you have to do is ask Him .
That is all .
Ask the Lord Kelvin to come into your Mind & Heart , give yourself over to His Infinite Beatitude .
He will instruct you further on how to LIVE your life according to His wishes .
But what is the best method to ask ?
The road to knowing the wonder that is the Lord Kelvin can be got to via the on-ramp of Kelvinian Meditation ( KM ) .
With KM , a scientifically validated technique to cause a local decrease in your personal Entropy , you will lay Trans - Oceanic Communication Cables to the shores of the Land of Kelvin Consciousness .
He will hear and see your desire to be Conserved from Entropy and will help you to reach a state of Non-Entropic churning cheerfulness because He Loves and Values you , His Creations !
Please tell those you care about that He Cares about them !
The Lord Kelvin does not want His Creations to increase in Entropy ;
He wants to Conserve all those who simply ask him .
But those that do n't are in grave danger of having their Soul fall to chaos and disorder !
Do n't let this happen to your friends and family ; tell them how the Lord Kelvin loves them and wants to Conserve them from Entropy .
Teach them to apply the Kelvinian Meditation techniques in all aspects of their lives .
They will thank you for showing them the light .
True Nature Of Reality : Knotic Æther Light is a Wave .
So what is it a wave in ?
What is waving ?
Light waves , like all waves , must be carried by a medium .
A wave on the ocean has its water ; a sound wave has its air ; light waves ( or Electromagnetic waves , not to be confused with the imaginary subject of the pseudoscience of Radiationism , ) have their medium too .
This medium is the Aether , a rarefied substance that permeates all of space and that is the clay out of which the Lord Kelvin sculpts Material Reality .
Three entwined Vortices of Aether , drawn by the Lord in His Notebook # 55 .
Three entwined Vortices of Aether , drawn by the Lord in His Notebook # 55 .
The Lord Kelvin tells us that the true Nature of the Material Realm is Knotic .
Material Atoms are nothing more than Knots in the Aether .
The Knots are themselves formed out of Vortices of the Aether .
The form of the Knot gives Atoms their stability and vibrational properties .
If we were to tabulate all Knotic forms , we would have created a table of all Material and Metamaterial Elements .
It was the Lord Kelvin Himself that brought this Truth to us .
Sadly , after
He left His physical manifestation on Earth , those that held hatred and jealousy in their hearts for the Lord Kelvin tried to silence it .
Talk of the Aether , not to mention the Knotic nature of Material Reality itself , was ridiculed and those that dared to broach this taboo were censured and found their professional careers in jeopardy .
Truth was replaced by false dogma , such as Relativism and Quantum Mechanics , and Darkness fell on the field of physics .
Only now is the hegemony of the Relativististic Radiational Physics Establishment crumbling .
Slowly but surely , the Truths that were brought to us by the Lord Kelvin are being acknowledged as undoubtfully Righteous .
Such first steps to a New Awakening as String Theory and the concepts of Virtual Particle Flux and Quintessence show that Honest intellectual investigation will always lead us to the Lord Kelvin .
" But , " You are asking , " what has this to do with my personal relationship with the Lord Kelvin ? "
The answer is as simple as it is beautiful .
The Love of the Lord Kelvin is a Warm Light that shines brightly through the increasingly cold Universe , so it follows that the Aether is the medium of the Lord Kelvin 's Love !
That we are made out of Knots in the Aether is then just another way of saying that we are crafted out of the Love of the Lord Kelvin .
The Light of His Love is the substrate that makes our physical existence possible !
THE LORD KELVIN LOVES YOU !

War of the Worlds .
In a simplified way , the story of the collapse of the Soviet Union could be told as a story about grain and oil .
That is from Yegor Gaidar .
In the 1980s it was necessary to import more and more grain , and Saudi Arabia was no longer supporting oil prices .
It worked like this :
The timeline of the collapse of the Soviet
Union can be traced to September 13 , 1985 .
On this date , Sheikh Ahmed
Zaki Yamani , the minister of oil of Saudi Arabia , declared that the
monarchy had decided to alter its oil policy radically .
The Saudis
stopped protecting oil prices , and Saudi Arabia quickly regained its
share in the world market .
During the next six months , oil production
in Saudi Arabia increased fourfold , while oil prices collapsed by
approximately the same amount in real terms .
As a result , the Soviet Union lost approximately $ 20 billion per
year , money without which the country simply could not survive .
The
Soviet leadership was confronted with a difficult decision on how to
adjust .
There were three options–or a combination of three
options–available to the Soviet leadership .
First , dissolve the Eastern European empire and effectively stop
barter trade in oil and gas with the Socialist bloc countries , and
start charging hard currency for the hydrocarbons .
This choice ,
however , involved convincing the Soviet leadership in 1985 to negate
completely the results of World War II .
In reality , the leader who
proposed this idea at the CPSU Central Committee meeting at that time
risked losing his position as general secretary .
Second , drastically reduce Soviet food imports by $ 20 billion , the
amount the Soviet Union lost when oil prices collapsed .
But in
practical terms , this option meant the introduction of food rationing
at rates similar to those used during World War II .
The Soviet
leadership understood the consequences : the Soviet system would not
survive for even one month .
This idea was never seriously discussed .
Third , implement radical cuts in the military - industrial complex .
With this option , however , the Soviet leadership risked serious
conflict with regional and industrial elites , since a large number of
Soviet cities depended solely on the military - industrial complex .
This
choice was also never seriously considered .
Unable to realize any of the above solutions , the Soviet leadership
decided to adopt a policy of effectively disregarding the problem in
hopes that it would somehow wither away .
Instead of implementing actual
reforms , the Soviet Union started to borrow money from abroad while its
international credit rating was still strong .
It borrowed heavily from
1985 to 1988 , but in 1989 the Soviet economy stalled completely …
The money was suddenly gone .
The Soviet Union
tried to create a consortium of 300 banks to provide a large loan for
the Soviet Union in 1989 , but was informed that only five of them would
participate and , as a result , the loan would be twenty times smaller
than needed .
The Soviet Union then received a final warning from the
Deutsche Bank and from its international partners that the funds would
never come from commercial sources .
Instead , if the Soviet Union
urgently needed the money , it would have to start negotiations directly
with Western governments about so - called politically motivated credits .
In 1985 the idea that the Soviet Union would begin bargaining for
money in exchange for political concessions would have sounded
absolutely preposterous to the Soviet leadership .
In 1989 it became a
reality , and Gorbachev understood the need for at least $ 100 billion
from the West to prop up the oil - dependent Soviet economy .

Distracted by the brain
About a year ago , I referred readers to Paul Bloom 's discussion of Deena Skolnick 's study of how mixing in a bit of irrelevant talk about neuroscience " turned bad [ psychological ] explanations into satisfactory ones " ( " Blinded by neuroscience " , 6/28/2006 ) .
Now a paper documenting that research is in press : Deena Skolnick Weisberg , Frank C. Keil , Joshua Goodstein , Elizabeth Rawson , & Jeremy R. Gray , " The seductive allure of neuroscience explanation " , Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience .
Here 's the abstract :
Explanations of psychological phenomena seem to generate more public interest when they contain neuroscientific information .
Even irrelevant neuroscience information in an explanation of a psychological phenomenon may interfere with people ’s abilities to critically consider the underlying logic of this explanation .
We tested this hypothesis by giving naïve adults , students in a neuroscience course , and neuroscience experts brief descriptions of psychological phenomena followed by one of four types of explanation , according to a 2 ( good explanation vs. bad explanation ) x 2 ( without neuroscience vs. with neuroscience ) design .
Crucially , the neuroscience information was irrelevant to the logic of the explanation , as confirmed by the expert subjects .
Subjects in all three groups judged good explanations as more satisfying than bad ones .
But subjects in the two non-expert groups additionally judged that explanations with logically irrelevant neuroscience information were more satisfying than explanations without .
The neuroscience information had a particularly striking effect on non-experts ’ judgments of bad explanations , masking otherwise salient problems in these explanations .
Here 's a sample of the material used in their experiment .
Here are the results from the novices and from the students in the neuroscience course .
Note that for the neuroscience students as well as for the novices , the addition of irrelevant information about brain localization turns bad explanations into satisfactory ones , on average .
It 's also worth noting -- and hardly surprising -- that the neuroscience students also were more impressed by the good explanation when a bit of irrelevant neuroscience was mixed in .
If you thought of the novices as the general public ( at least its more intellectual strata ) , and the neuroscience students as science writers ( of the better - educated sort ) , you probably would n't be too far wrong .
Here are the results from the grown - up cognitive neuroscientists .
Adding irrelevant neuroscience did n't impress them , I 'm happy to say -- their ( average ) opinion of the bad explanations was not significantly improved , and their opinion of the good explanations actually declined :
The authors suggest that the same sort of experiment would also work in other fields , as I 'm sure you can imagine .
Are bad moral arguments " improved " by adding scriptural references ?
Do foolish system designs look better by references to the latest software - engineering methodology ?
What about bad teaching methods and fashionable educational buzzwords ?
I 'd guess that the answer to such questions is usually " yes " : if you mix in irrelevant material from a fashionable subdiscipline in an authoritative - sounding way , you 'll impress novices and apprentices , and make it harder for them to judge whether the substance of what you 're saying makes sense .
There 's a potentially embarrassing question for each group : are the experts better able to see through such displays of authority symbols ?
In some cases , I ( unkindly ) suspect that the " experts " might be worse than the novices -- sometimes expertise is little more than the learned ability to be distracted by artfully - deployed symbolic smokescreens .
( But not in my field , nor in yours , of course ... )
Skolnick et al. observe that neuroscience has a number of properties that make it especially effective as a rhetorical distractor , beyond the previously documented ( and more general ) " seductive details effect " -- it points to reductionist and materialist explanations , it provides an almost unlimited source of jargon , it sits at the intersection of several high - status occupations , and ( though not in this experiment ) it offers pretty pictures .

I ’m not sure if it ’s just me , but I find it incredibly annoying when non-tech people assume that system administrators are walking computer encyclopedias .
With this in mind , here are a few pieces of advice that will get you a few extra brownie points from your favorite system administrator :
1- Asking questions about how to fix your home system is fine , as long as you are being reasonable about it .
We do n’t like spending half our lunchtime answering your personal computer questions .
We ’re human beings too , you know !
We need to take a break sometimes .
If you need your home computer fixed , just hire us to do the job .
Just because we ’re work colleagues does n’t mean that you can make us your tech slaves .
2- Ask our permission before you start telling all your friends that we can fix computers .
Just because we helped you does n’t mean we want to help everyone .
3- Please stop assuming that since we work with computers , we automatically know how fix and operate all electronic devices operating on the earth ’s surface .
Why would I know how to program your coffee machine or home DVD recorder ?
4- We like chatting about stuff besides computers .
Star Wars , Star Trek and Dungeons & Dragons are fine conversation starters , too !
Seriously , geeks like to chat almost about anything .
Try it sometime , and you ’ll see that we ’re a fun bunch .
5- Stop thinking that all we do is surf the Internet all day .
Yes , we do spend a fair amount of time online , but it is for good reasons .
And even if we ’re not always extremely busy during the day , we often have to work late at night and into the weekends .
I ’ve often worked past midnight , and yes , I had to come in to the office the following day .
You did n’t know that right ?
Why do you think that the IT enrollment rate in schools has dropped approximately 50 % in the past 5 years ?
6- If you are getting an error message , do n’t forget to write it down before calling us .
We do n’t know what “ I ’m getting an error ” means unless you tell us exactly what it says !
7- When we fix something for you , do n’t forget to thank us .
Even though we ’re being paid to do it , we like hearing that we ’re doing a good job , just like everyone else does .
By following those seven simple steps , you ’ll be on the road to having a better relationship with your system administrator .
If any of you would like to add additional points to this list , feel free to do so by leaving a comment at the bottom of this post .
This has been moved from the essay section to this post in the blog archives .
THE number of internet hosts fell for the first time since 1993 , according to the Internet Domain Survey , published twice - yearly by Internet Systems Consortium .
Hosts are separate computer “ addresses ” that are contacted when a website or domain name is called up .
Their number fell by some 6 m in January 2007 to 433 m , the first decrease ever .
Generally , more hosts means more websites , more computers and a growing internet .
However this is not necessarily the case .
Instead , it may simply be that counting hosts accurately is getting more difficult : for instance , in Wi-Fi and corporate networks , hundreds of computers can share one address and so count as just one host .

Faye Turney was interviewed by the BBC last week

Tony Blair 's spokesman said that if the talks were unsuccessful , the government may have to become " more explicit " .
He said they were " utterly confident " the 15 had been in Iraqi , not Iranian , waters , when they were captured .
Meanwhile , Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett will shorten a visit to Turkey to fly home to help manage the crisis .
The 15 sailors and marines from HMS Cornwall were captured on Friday after searching a boat in the Gulf , off the coast of Iraq , which they suspected was smuggling cars .
' No doubt '
Iran says the British personnel were trespassing in Iranian waters when they were seized - but the prime minister said the group were in Iraqi waters under a UN mandate .
The prime minister 's spokesman said the matter was being dealt with " privately " but the Iranians could be " in no doubt that we expect the immediate release of our personnel " .
Earlier , Mr Blair warned of a " different phase " if diplomacy failed to secure their release .
His spokesman said he was referring to a " different way " of handling talks , which could involve making public reasons why the UK was certain the group was in Iraqi waters .
It is understood this could include producing evidence such as boat co-ordinates and details of the searched vessel apparently still anchored in Iraqi waters .
The spokesman told reporters : " We are utterly confident that we were in Iraqi waters , and not just marginally in Iraqi waters but in Iraqi waters .
It 's a case of tactics and if and when we have to prove that . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
The country of Iran needs to have a good long hard look at how this situation will look to the rest of the world
Gary , UK
Send us your comments Iranian view on stand - off
However , one high - ranking Iraqi official has expressed surprise that British forces were operating in the area .
Brigadier - General Hakim Jassim , commander of Iraq 's territorial waters , said : " Usually there is no presence of British forces in that area , so we were surprised and we wondered whether the British forces were inside Iraqi waters or inside Iranian regional waters . "
The BBC has been told the group are being held at an Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps base in Tehran .
They have been held for five days , but are said to be being treated humanely .
Commons statement
On Tuesday , Defence Secretary Des Browne chaired a meeting of ministers and officials - under the auspices of the government 's " civil contingencies committee " known as Cobra - to discuss the situation .
Officials said it was intended to ensure coordination across Whitehall and keep civil servants updated on the latest developments .
Cobra leads responses to national crises and convened in recent years for the 7 July London bombings , the fuel protests and 11 September attack .
It is understood that while still in Turkey , Mrs Beckett spoke to Iran 's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki to push again for immediate consular access to them .
The Associated Press news agency reported that Iranian officials had repeated assurances that British diplomats would get access to the detainees once their inquiry into the incident was complete .
On Wednesday , Mrs Beckett is expected to make a statement to the Commons .
Faye Turney , one of the 15 captured , was interviewed by the BBC last week .
She said : " Sometimes you may be called upon , and when you do you 've just got to deal with it and get on with it " .
Meanwhile , her family , from Shrewsbury , Shropshire , have said it is a " very distressing time " for them .
France wants to track file sharers - users fight back with civil disobedience
The French Council of State decided last week that record companies can automatically track P2P users that share more than 50 files within 24 hours and keep their records for further legal proceedings .
The decision comes as a blow to the French National Commission for Data protection and the Liberties who ruled in the fall of 2005 that automatic surveillance of P2P networks violates local privacy laws .
French file sharers are n't too happy with the decision either .
Some folks have now started a civil disobedience protest called " 51 fichiers " ( 51 files ) against the ruling .
The website 51 fichiers.org explains Guess France - based P2P internet label Jamendo might see a whole bunch of new users soon ...

Artist 's concept : A planet is seen as it transits a star
The spacecraft was launched on 27 December last year and is the first to hunt for Earth - like planets from space .
Corot scientists said to find a planet so early on " significantly exceeded pre-launch expectations " .
The new body is called Corot - exo - 1 b and can be found 1,500 light - years away in the constellation of Monoceros .
Corot hunts for planets by monitoring stars for tiny dips in brightness that result from objects transiting their faces .
The instrumentation onboard the 650kg ( 1,400 lb ) satellite is so sensitive that it is capable of detecting rocky exoplanets ( the term used to describe planets outside our Solar System ) just a few times bigger than Earth .
The Corot spacecraft looks at starfields for days on end
Dr Suzanne Aigrain , a co-investigator on the mission and an exoplanet expert from the University of Exeter , UK , was pleased to have found a planet so soon after the launch .
She told BBC News : " It 's a giant planet of similar basic structure to Jupiter , but bigger ; it is about 1.3 times more massive than Jupiter and has approximately 1.5 to 1.8 times the radius .
" It 's a lot closer to its star , which is quite similar to our Sun , and it orbits it every 1.5 days . "
The discovery of this large planet indicated that the onboard systems were working well and that discovering smaller , Earth - like planets was well within its grasp , she said .
This technique is similar to seismology , which uses earthquake waves to study the Earth 's interior .
But instead , Corot monitors the subtle changes in light created as " starquakes " - waves generated deep inside a star - ripple across the star 's surface .
Analysis of this data , which is still being undertaken , will be used to determine the star 's mass , age and chemical composition .

A stereotypical Mormon , former missionary and married in the Mormon temple , discovers God to be the equivalent of a Cosmic Terrorist ..
An Excellent Summary
I am 40 years old , a returned missionary , a BYU graduate , have served in numerous stake and ward positions , and am a survivor of cognitive dissonance caused by LDS Church doctrine , speculation and folklore .
The following is a description of how I 've dealt with that noise as well as a discussion of my wife 's and my own somewhat lengthy personal odyssey out of the LDS Church .
Along the way , I 'll make a few random observations and discuss just a few of the tactics used by the church to obfuscate the truth on a variety of topics - from the size of its faithful membership to specific doctrines that bothered me .
First , I 've read with interest many of the letters posted by Mormon apologists on this web site .
One of the more intriguing is the assertion that only deadbeats - " those who ca n't find a job " are those that leave the church .
I 've essentially left the church , am a father of four well adjusted , achieving , loving children , have a great marriage with a wonderful lady , and otherwise live a successful life employed as a regional sales manager of a widely recognized Fortune 500 company .
I do n't believe my associates would describe me as a deadbeat .
Another assertion made in one of these letters is that they all seem to have a common thread - they come from either converts of the church or from members of less than active Mormon families .
While that may or may not possibly be true with some of the stories posted , I do n't believe in any way that the largest number of disaffected Mormons are converts or from inactive families .
I believe the silent majority are from multi-generational Mormon families .
I see the very visible fringes of a huge religious movement of both converts and multi-generational Mormons alike away from Mormonism despite the claims of the LDS Church 's PR machine that membership rolls are swelling which Mormon doctrine position as the fulfillment of prophesy .
As both foreign and domestic former missionaries will readily admit , there is in fact a fairly rapid growth rate of Mormonism - particularly in 3rd world nations through the baptism of individuals of lower socio / economic strata .
This growth rate however is offset by a high degree of inactivity .
The church rarely addresses this issue .
It does n't fit with the folklore of the gospel pervasively marching across the earth like a storm of locusts .
I firmly believe that there are 10s of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands of disenfranchised multi generational Mormons people who describe themselves variously as ' inactive ' , ' social Mormons ' , ' fringe Mormons ' and the like .
From the church 's perspective , these are folks that just seem to drop off the map and are simply categorized as ' inactive ' by the church census takers .
Not a lot of effort is made by the Mormon hierarchy to understand much about them once they tell their home teachers to not bother coming by .
I number my own immediate family as being among this group who no longer want visits from the home teachers .
Between my wife and I , we have eleven brothers and sisters - all ' active ' in the church .
We however no longer consider the church to be what it represents itself to be and general apathy , or better , lack of recognition of the authority of the church , prevent us from requesting either excommunication or having my family members ' names permanently removed from the church rolls .
We simply fall into the amorphous category of ' inactive ' Mormons .
It 's kind of like being a member of a record club you joined a decade ago , where you satisfied the obligations by buying the obligatory 20 albums , and are now only bothered perhaps by an annual piece of junk mail of the ilk , " It 's been a long time since we heard from you . "
So goes the annual exercise of telling the unfortunate new comer to the Elders Quorum who is assigned inactive members , that you would just as soon not receive his visit .
Perhaps one day , we 'll do the responsible thing and get off the rolls once and for all , but for now the annual ' encounter ' is a minor irritation and quite frankly there is a certain satisfaction in subtly communicating that you consider your LDS Church membership to be the equivalent of a troublesome record company membership .
Observers should remember that at any given point , something less than 30 % of the LDS membership worldwide is ' active . '
Of those that are , many of these are the aforementioned ' social Mormons ' living in Utah and other strongholds of Mormonism , who have real problems with the faith .
They occasionally express their cognitive dissonance to one another in hushed tones , usually out of a desire to protect and maintain social and familial harmony .
Their lives have a high degree of connectedness to their Mormon families and members of their Mormon social circle .
They consequently rarely wander outside the fence preferring instead to swallow the three weekly hours of church attendance , and live with all the idiosyncrasies of Mormon life - particularly in Utah , where Mormonism is n't so much a religion , but a way of life .
Deep down inside , they are miserable .
They believe strongly in their heart of hearts , that the foundation of Mormonism is flawed and based on folklore , fancy , fallacy , and error .
These same people use a whole variety of defense mechanisms to deal with their cognitive dissonance .
I 've had numerous discussions with folks in these circumstances and usually the discussion comes full circle and concludes with a fairly predictable admission :
" Well , I really do n't have that strong a testimony . . . in fact I have serious doubts , but if I continue to live the religion - even if it 's wrong , what have I really lost ?
And if it 's right , I 'll be in the Celestial kingdom .
And by the way , are there really that many bad fruits of Mormonism ?
The church does a lot of good . "
I 've not seen the Church 's budget so I can't objectively state whether it really does a lot of good other than toss a few crumbs here and there to its
Welfare members ( several of whom from my personal experience are pretty adept at working the system ) , but my gut tells me that a disproportionate percentage of the Church 's investment in its membership takes the form of the construction of monuments to its greatness - those silly cookie cutter buildings that aspire to Frank Lloyd Wright design , called " Ward Houses " and " Stake Centers . "
In the meantime , like any large enterprise with a large cash position , the Portfolio Management team of this extremely profitable tax exempt corporation , responsible for reinvesting its huge cash reserves in the stock market and other outside investments , is most assuredly one of the more important groups of people in Church Headquarters .
I wonder how it might work ? . . .
Get a 35 % annual return and have your calling and election made sure , get a 20 % return and get a blessing that you 'll at least make it to the bottom rung of the Celestial Kingdom .
Get a passbook rate return , and . . . well I digress .
Being one of these multi generational non practicing Mormon 's - a member of the other 70 % of the Church populace , I am a fourth generation Mormon as is my wife .
Both of us are returned missionaries responsible for many souls having been saved from the clutches of Catholicism in our respective European and Latin American missions - I in the 1975 - 77 time frame and my wife , 1974 - 1976 .
After completing our missions , and after I graduated with a business degree from Brigham Young University , we went about fulfilling our LDS destinies - having four children and building our Celestial Kingdom bank accounts through numerous church callings .
My wife served as President and councilor in numerous Primary and Relief Society presidencies and I served as Scoutmaster and in various Elder 's quorum presidencies .
> From the time that I can remember going to Primary while growing up in Provo , Utah , I always felt the effects of the social aspect of Mormonism ( and in all honesty , they were mostly good ) but I nonetheless , always wondered what all the religious devotion was all about .
In latter years , it became clear that the depth of doctrinal and church history understanding by the church populace was a mile wide and an inch deep - and only explored insofar as an Elders Quorum lesson plan contained in 2 - 3 small notebook sized pages would allow in the 10 minutes left over from a quorum meeting where the more important topics dealt with home teaching statistics and assignments for the Saturday morning ward building cleanup projects .
So though I felt doubts about the doctrinal elements of Mormonism from the time I was very young , the full realization of how empty it was did n't really hit me until after my mission , temple marriage , and a few years into my career with a large multinational computer company .
Sometime after the birth of our last child , I obtained a copy of the " Changing World of Mormonism " , by those famous servants of Satan - " The Tanners . "
I had my entire Mormon life been warned of " anti-Mormon " literature but nonetheless read quite a lot of different pieces authored by the likes of Dr. Walter Martin and members of various born again Christian groups when I entered BYU .
Emerson 's observation ' the unexamined life is not worth living ' along with the challenges issued with a high degree of smugness by various LDS Leaders ( Legrand Richards and Heber C. Kimball come immediately to mind ) to just try and disprove the bulletproof LDS doctrines , were all the encouragement I needed to embark on a study to validate my beliefs .
My initial study failed to derail me during my college years and during my mission .
If anything , it strengthened the persecution complex that the church uses to its advantage ( ' If it were n't true , why would so many people be attacking it ? ' ) and I found most of the arguments generally supported by contradictions documented in the bible to be fairly unconvincing .
After all , like all Mormons I only believed the bible as far as it was translated correctly .
I even suspected at one point , that many of these " Anti " authors were possibly hired by the SLC hierarchy in some conspiratorial plot to strengthen testimonies and otherwise fuel the persecution complex .
Martin and certain others were just plain goofy to me .
The Tanners ' book on the other hand had quite another effect on me .
I had previously been exposed to many of the dialogues dealing with Mormon problems , albeit perfunctorily , such as : Blacks and the Priesthood , Polygamy , Adam God Theory , etc . . . and my collective impression was " sure , there may be some problems , but God 's ways are n't Man 's ways and with time , I 'll understand some of these mysteries / apparent contradictions .
But for now , I have that still small voice telling me the Church is true " .
To not have that still small voice was to admit candidacy for something other than the Celestial Kingdom , and I certainly did not want that .
Therefore , I always had the still small voice telling me what the brethren wanted me to believe .
The seeds of doubt withered simply because I was too afraid to approach the door of a philosophical or doctrinal LDS problem , for fear that the more important door to the Celestial kingdom would close on me .
Back to my apostasy - a term with such a nasty connotation ! -- but used pejoratively by the LDS faithful to identify a person who is either to be condemned , shunned , pitied , or fellowshipped - sometimes , all of the above .
Other than the scriptures , I rarely read a book , unless it is fiction , from front to back - choosing instead to read a book with more of a specific research approach .
When I picked up the Tanner 's book , I wanted to bypass all the peripheral discussions of Adam - God , Black and Priesthood and the like .
I ( inaccurately at the time ) thought the church apologists had done an adequate job of explaining these away .
What I really wanted to focus on was the very premise of Mormonism , i.e. , " How plausible was it really , that a 14 years old would really be visited by not one , but a myriad of Heavenly beings ( John the Baptist , Peter and other of the twelve apostles , Moroni , and the list goes on and on and on ) , over the course of his prophetly career , in order to restore through him the fullness of ancient truths and authority of God 's will .
I read and reread the Tanner 's arguments .
During my mission , I knew there were quite a few problems with Joseph Smith 's reputation .
He was positioned by the Church however as an innocent product of his times - a young man , not unlike others around him , given to folk magic and a reputation for looking through magic glasses and stones , digging for buried treasure , and engaging in other questionable activities .
Nonetheless , though difficult to understand how God could put his credibility on the line by dealing with this flaky kid , he was my flaky kid , and I initially accepted these idiosyncrasies as normal behavior for a youngster growing up in New England .
In short , I cut Joseph Smith a lot of slack .
What I did n't really understand until I started to feast on the Tanner 's book as much as I feasted on the Mormon scriptures , was that the pivotal event that purportedly changed his life , and on which the rest of the empire of Mormonism is constructed - the 1st Vision - the story that I recited in my sleep during the proverbial ' best two years of my life , ' had gone through quite a bit of modification .
Particularly disturbing was the discovery that the officially canonized version that I recited during my mission was recorded a full 18 years after the purported visit by Eloheim and Jehovah to the young fourteen year old ( or was it 15 ? a point of fact still under contention by Church historians ) and that it varied rather substantially from earlier versions - especially the one authored earlier by Joseph Smith himself .
That version had him seeing disembodied angels / spirits , and hearing a message that was quite different from that covered in the Pearl of Great Price version .
What was wrong ?
Surely the most important event in human history next to Christ 's resurrection ( and among some Mormons , even this is debatable ) would at least be consistent in its main points .
Joseph after all saw two glorious , separate and distinct members of the Godhead .
He asked a specific question .
He got a specific answer .
This was supposed to be an actual VIVID event , not something he dreamt up in a trance while pondering the nature of God .
In the canonized version , he described seeing two personages whom introduced themselves as God and his son Jesus - whose glory defied all description .
I marveled at how the test of reason failed with the multiple earlier accounts of this incident , i.e. , if a normal human saw two glorified , resurrected beings who identified themselves as God the Father and Jesus Christ , and who gave young Joseph a crystal clear message . . . how reasonable would it be to claim in some other recounting of that event that he saw angels ( whose implied identity was not known ) and fail to be consistent in the main messages of such a visitation ?
In short , if such an event really happened , would not at least the top 3 or 4 elements be burned into the brain of any normal human being ?
Would there not be very , very little variance in the main elements of each successive telling of this story ?
After I thoughtfully considered this dilemma , I began cutting Joseph Smith less and less slack but I was still numbered among the elect of God .
My faith was only being tested .
I would overcome though the echoes of cognitive dissonance were getting more noisy .
Eventually - and I can't pinpoint any one particular watershed event that changed my thinking in a binary way - it eventually all started to make sense .
Smith 's early views of Monotheism , fully supported by the Book of Mormon and early accounts of the 1st Vision , evolved into the polytheistic view as supported by successive Mormon scripture , the 1938 version of the 1st Vision , and Mormonism of today .
The not so insignificant early renditions of the 1st Vision clearly needed fixing .
This understanding was very disturbing , and several months went by before I picked the Tanners book up again .
As I read other sections - particularly the chapter dealing with the Book of Abraham , I became very agitated when I considered the spin doctoring that took place as a result of the egg on the face discovery that the text of the Papyrus that Hugh Nibley tried to ' translate ' , had nothing at all to do with Abraham nor the Creation .
Aside from this , I just could n't figure out how the Church hierarchy could rationalize why the prophet , seer , and revelator at the time did not do any prophesying , foreseeing or revealing .
After all , a Prophet of God is intended not only to be an administrator , he is supposed to speak for God and one of his gifts is the gift of translation .
Instead , in this particular case he was either too busy administrating ( how busy could he really be , given the magnitude of the opportunity to once and for all demonstrate in a rather dramatic way that Joseph Smith did in fact translate with the gift and power of God ? ) , or he temporarily lost his gift .
Instead , David O. McKay left it to the supposed resident church academician / expert on Egyptology at BYU to validate the premise that Joseph Smith translated from a fragment of papyrus which was undisputedly the same fragment that had come into possession of the church again in 1967 .
Once that academician discovered the problem he had on his hands , the spin doctoring machine went into full tilt .
Contrary to Smith 's documented claims that he translated from the fragment of papyrus , the papyrus all of a sudden became the source of inspiration from which Smith received revelation of what Abraham somehow intended - all this from Pagan funeral texts .
I went on to read the Tanners book with great relish , and upon its completion , I read additional works that convinced me that Mormonism was a very opportunistic religion .
A very strong restorationist movement of the 1800s in upstate New York .
Viola !!
A church fully restored by a cast of thousands ( OK , at least dozens ) of heavenly visitors .
Numerous contemporaries of Joseph Smith in upstate New York having celestial visitations !
Voila !
Joseph has not just ONE but does them one better - he has numerous visitations , from John the Baptist to all the apostles and other stars of the Old and New Testaments .
Joseph became a pretty pivotal chum to all the religious stars .
A pervasive temperance movement .
Viola !!
No smoking or strong drinks ( meaning Coffee and tea .
I 've always found it interesting that Cola soft drinks - whose caffeine content is much greater than most coffees are OK ( even if discouraged ) for temple recommend qualification .
My last Bishop was a five can a day man . . . but I digress again ) , Severe social pressure on the Church due to the Blacks and the Priesthood issue that make it very difficult for the fighting Cougar machine to keep on trouncing other members of the WAC , the embarrassing baptisms of white skinned Negroes in South America in the ' 70s .
Voila !!
Inspiration that gives blacks the priesthood .
An informal survey of temple recommend holders on their attitudes towards the temple ceremony that reveal that they are disturbed by the hand across the throat gesture .
Voila !!
Special revelation .
No more offending gesture .
The list goes on and on and on and on . . .
A lot of screwed up revelation that gets fixed .
What ever happened to God being the same yesterday , today , and tomorrow ?
This was certainly the argument that got me into many a Catholic household during my mission .
Increasingly , there were just too many doctrinal , historical and philosophical conundrums that I could no longer rationally deal with .
Like layers of an onion , as I peeled away at Mormonism with the knife that the Tanner 's book initially provided me , I went on to discover many successive problems in these layers as I read other works and discussed additional contradictions with others .
I then started thinking about the nature of what I believed God to be , influenced of course by Mormon doctrines .
For a perfect eternal being - our God to restore truth to the earth , and surround that truth with soooooooo much obfuscation , was a cruel act - but not inconsistent with his reputed behavior of trying the faith , patience and confidence of those he loves ( ? )
In the background , there was the constant badgering of the brethren to live close to the spirit , pray for them , obey them and not be influenced by the self righteous members of the pseudo intelligentsia .
After all " Evil Speaking of the Lord 's Annointed " earns a very special punishment in the temple ceremony .
At this point , I really started to question the nature of the Mormon God(s ) .
The righteous , benevolent , serene , friendly , approachable and caring God ( the one whose Son was represented in the Primary picture as having that beatific , serene , kind smile while gathering numerous children around him at story telling time ) seemed to take a nasty turn for the worse for me .
He was becoming worse than the vicious and vindictive God of the Old Testament .
He DEMANDED my faith , worship , and respect for his power .
He was evidently the same god who tried Job , who asked Abraham to sacrifice Issac , and all of a sudden he was asking me to believe in a myriad of inconsistent , unholy , and problematic doctrines for no other reason than to test my faith .
I struggled with this dilemma for months .
He became to me little more than a Cosmic terrorist - who in exchange for the promise of exalted eternal life , wanted to hold hostage my intellect and sense of reason .
As I further contemplated the nature of " Worship " , I could no longer reconcile my image of a loving being who was supposed to operate on an eternal level according to the earthly father / child model .
Unlike a loving , caring father , he was doing nothing to earn my love , respect , and admiration , but instead was extracting through dark suited , somber , repetitive , retired businessmen in SLC , my trust and faith in the face of too many irreconcilable doctrinal and historical problems .
In the harsh light of day , as I determined that I either needed to reconcile my doubts or get out of the church - at least metaphorically , I reflected on my heartfelt impressions of my first visit to the temple at age 19 and the assault that experience had on my sense of reason and sensibility .
It was both funny , bizarre and quite frankly , a bit scary .
My overall impression was of the Flintstones cartoon of Fred and Barney 's membership in the local Lodge - the men's club headed by the Grand Phooba ( spoof on the Shriners organization complete with the Fezzes and special handshakes . )
Later reflections of these memories caused me to ponder the new information that I had acquired .
I considered the rapid rise in Masonic circles that Joseph Smith enjoyed in his early exposure to Masonry and the more than coincidental introduction of the plagiarized Masonic temple ceremony positioned as new revelation from God .
This ceremony seemed to me to be far from inspiring , holy , and uplifting to me .
When I first donned the silly little apron and hat , I felt pangs of guilt and unworthiness for wondering why nobody else recognized that the king had no clothes .
I just could n't figure it out , and determined that with enough repetition and worthy living , I would eventually come to understand the secrets of the temple ceremony but very serious seeds of doubt had been planted , repressed and now were again uncovered causing me great discomfort .
I eventually came to the conclusion that the king really was n't wearing any clothes and that you could just as easily gain great eternal insight from repeated viewings of Laverne and Shirley reruns while wearing a bathrobe .
It started to get clearer to me that somehow , some way , there was a huge empire built around these fabulous claims of the early to mid 1800s that somehow mutated sociologically so that very few people continued to associate the church 's culture with Brigham Young and Joseph Smith , but rather with the wholesome image of today as an organization with warm , touchy feelings , and a lot of great ' programs ' for its members .
It is interesting to observe that when these doctrinal and historical problems surface , there are numerous homilies and alibis that are used by the Mormon faith to bully its members from crossing the line from faith to rational thought .
The following two are especially convenient : " God 's ways are not Mans Ways " and " In the last days , even the very elect will be deceived " and they are extremely effective .
At least they were for me as they succeeded in cowering me into submission for the majority of my life .
As I discussed my concerns with more and more people , I discovered that the church seemed to want to scuttle a lot of history under the carpet , with other homilies like " God wants his children to drink milk before they eat meat " , " doctrinal and historical problems are intended to be tests of faith " , etc.... , etc ... I found it very curious , that dead Mormon prophets were best interpreted by living Mormon prophets , and that many of the silly , incomprehensible musings of Brigham Young , were not revelation at all , but rather ' speculation ' of what may be truth .
In the meantime , all the feelings that were stirred up in my young childhood psyche , came rushing back .
As a child , I could remember going to Primary , MIA , and all the other meetings , and having the impression that biting into the Mormon religion was the equivalent of eating angel food cake - nice and sugary tasting , but pretty hollow and without a lot of substance .
Did I ever experience deep feelings of religiosity ?
Yes , whenever I 'd hear the strains of " Oh how lovely was the morning " and whenever I 'd look at the large stained glass wall of the young Joseph Smith kneeling in the grove of trees in the chapel of my sister 's ward in SLC that I would visit quite frequently .
They never failed to stir up such great feelings of warmth .
That is why my initial focus on the first vision , yielded such a shock when I discovered that the two white haired beings standing in mid air above the kneeling Joseph Smith , were likely fabrications that grew , mutated and evolved somehow between 1820 and 1838 .
In all my years of either sitting in the tabernacle or watching " the Brethren " on TV twice each year at General Conference time , there certainly did n't seem to be a lot of revelation and Godly direction coming out of their mouths .
Neither did " I get it " in the all - day Sunday marathons of my youth .
Instead , I remember these very emotional once a month testimonies of people testifying that they knew this or that was ' true ' on the foundation of how they felt , not on what they thought and even as a kid , this made me uncomfortable .
The people who most emotionally expressed these feelings always struck me as being those who had the most difficulty in dealing with everyday life .
Most of these testimonies were like recordings .
They were silly and even at age 6 , I grew irritated at the testimonies of these people who knew the church was true , that " Joseph Smith was true , that their bishop was a holy man and ' true ' and other of the dozens of other wrote testimonies .
It all seemed silly and contrived .
To these observations , Mormon pundits are likely to predictably observe , " Well , this just proves he never did have a testimony . . . he never was fully grounded , did n't have the spirit , was n't ' really ' foreordained , etc . . . "
Such a reaction is to be expected of those that view me as a fallen soul .
Notwithstanding their pity - sincere or not , I thank the Heavenly Being , the Universal Spirit within us , the power of Karma ( I still believe a higher power exists , though I believe he / she / it manifests itself differently to different people according to their spiritual needs ) for blessing me with just enough synaptic connections to help me eventually make sense of all this .
After several years of careful reflection , I simply decided that my intellect - what my head told me , was more important than what the whisperings of autosuggestion created through several years of Mormon indoctrination were trying to tell me .
I stumbled recently upon a brilliant assessment of the problem of religious truth , " Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . "
In the absence of such evidence , where religious truth is granted as a gift to those who exercise extraordinary faith - particularly when that faith collides so violently with reason , the almighty is reduced to simply being a Cosmic Terrorist .
I fundamentally believe that he / she / it is more than that , a caring and loving being or power and not an extortionist .
My wife 's exit out of the church was slightly different .
She had none of these kinds of issues in her youth .
She grew up in a family of seven children and was the model Mormon .
Her doubts started only after she returned from her mission and in an effort to keep that Missionary ' spirit ' , found herself reading only ' uplifting ' and ' inspiring ' books coming out of Deseret and Beehive Books - all having pretty interchangeable titles along the lines of " Recipe for Salvation " , " Live Righteously and Rejoice " , etc . . .
She discovered after reading several dozen of these books , that there was nothing new and that many of the authors seemed to plagiarize each other .
The failure of the LDS scriptures , and the books intended to interpret them , to shed any new real illumination on the human condition , was the beginning of the end of her beliefs .
Her thoughtful consideration of the premise of the Celestial law of Eternal Marriage , was the final straw .
That premise is , if a man is faithful to his priesthood vows and responsibilities and is loyal to his wife in the earthly sphere , he earns the right to copulate with as many multiple wives as he wants / can handle for the rest of eternity .
A little sacrifice now , in exchange for a big reward later .
This just did n't seem to ring of truth , and further investigation into Smith 's character and the origins of polygamy and crimes against the US government , did little to inspire her that the foundation of Mormonism was too terribly stable .
The event that capped my own growing sense of discontent with the premise of divine revelation coming through the pyramid of the dark suited prophets and apostles in SLC , was the behavior of many of them in their dealings with Mark Hofman .
When I realize how the little curmudgeon whom Mormons currently call their prophet , manipulated the Utah legal system and otherwise obstructed justice , I grow incredulous that such violations of morality do not go unrecognized by the world at large .
As I thought further about this incident , the passage from 1st Nephi , " It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle in disbelief " took on special significance .
From all appearances , Hinkley ( or more accurately , the SLC prosecuting attorney , a Celestial Kingdom bound Mormon , who could n't help but take a specific course of action through implied pressure from the first presidency - few people in SLC believe there is anything that closely resembles separation of church and state ) took this quite literally .
Metaphorically , the deaths of two faithful Mormons were allowed to pass unpunished so that the Mormon nation might not dwindle in disbelief .
The SLC prosecuting attorney brought about the virtual acquittal through plea bargaining of the most serious of Hofman 's charges , and in the process , sent Hofman to prison with the possibility of Parole , rather than to death row which he rightfully deserved .
The SLC prosecuting attorney 's plea bargain was tantamount to being down three points in the final seconds of a key game , and on the third down while on the opponents two yard line , deciding to kick a field goal to tie the game .
As a tough prosecuting attorney , there clearly was only one decision to be made .
Send Hofman to the gas chambers , the gallows , the firing squad , or whatever the method of execution was in Utah at the time .
As a practicing Mormon with Celestial Kingdom ambitions , the prosecuting attorney was much less motivated to execute well on his earthly professional charter .
What was the risk ?
By putting Hofman on the stand in a court trial , certain pandemonium within Mormondom would erupt if the whole sordid story broke about how the Lord 's inspired " Prophet in Training " , Gordon Hinkley was successfully duped through his numerous one on one meetings with Hofman into sponsoring the Church 's purchase of forged documents - all out of a desire to secret these ' non faith promoting ' documents away so that they would not see the light of day .
Hinkley had the audacity after these repeated meetings with Hofman to tell police investigators that he really could n't remember Hofman .
After all , he was a very important and busy executive and Hofman was a bit player on the stage of his life .
It seemed to me that before Hofman started planting his bombs in SLC , just a few moments alone with the Lord would have told Hinkley that these funds which contributed to Hofman 's sense of invincibility , could have best been spent towards helping some new members in Guatemala .
I still wonder how Hinkley sleeps at night knowing of his contribution to the miscarriage of justice .
When asked by my Mormon friends why I 've quit the church , I feel compelled to share with them my observations in an effort to get them to just use what the Almighty purportedly gave them - their sense of reason and intellect .
Our discussions usually start with the Hofman bombings !
So today , though some would describe my wife and I for our beliefs ( or at least our lack of beliefs in Mormonism ) as Anti-Mormons , we prefer instead to think of ourselves as advocates of rational thought .
We are not militant in the sense that we are actively searching out Mormons in an effort to undo the evangelism that we did during our missions , but we do in fact share our observations when asked .
Most rational human beings are truth seeking .
We really feel we are somewhat like a bunch of rats dropped into a maze and it is certainly nice when one of the rats ahead of who has bumped into a dead end just a few too many times , yells back to the other rats to try a different route .
It is the sense of humanity that causes us to want to help each other through the maze of life .
Thank you Jerald and Sandra Tanner for telling me about the dead - end in the maze !!
In past years , one of the observations that is often made by those Mormon friends of ours , still ' active ' but usually doubtful , is : " My , my , you must have been offended by someone " ( a common indictment of someone who no longer attends church ) to which my wife promptly replies , " Nobody ever offended me , . . . do n't think so little of me to believe that I would forsake a set of beliefs because of some personal squabble " whereupon she goes on to explain that if anything , she is offended by LDS doctrine and history and that she chooses to live by reason rather than emotion .
It 's funny what time and perspective will do .
During my youthful Mormon days , Joseph Smith was a man of God - one of the most important prophets in the history of mankind and despite the angel food cake taste in my mouth about the whole Mormon experience , even in my early 20s , I still held Joseph Smith in awe as I thought about the 1st Vision stained glass chapel of my youth and the warm feeling of convincing others in the mission field to my set of beliefs .
What a fortunate thing it was to be a member of this wonderful church that had all the keys , knowledge and power necessary to get me into heaven .
Even after I learned as a young teenager about Polygamy , . . . er Celestial Marriage , I accepted it without a lot of thinking ( after all that happened in the 1800s - a million years ago ) and I considered it to be a bit odd - but a gospel principle nonetheless .
I was one of the elect .
The elect are subject to different laws .
Today , I view things quite differently .
I view Joseph Smith much the same way I view other charismatic religious leaders who with the acquisition of power , come to believe their own press , and go on to take heavenly liberties .
The pattern is all too predictable .
A charismatic religious leader discovers that a bunch of people really do depend upon him for their psychological well being and he comes to believe that God really does wants him to live according to different standards .
One of those differing standards allows sexual promiscuity since the elect of God are somehow above earthly law .
After all , what is marriage ?
what is monogamy ?
They are only earthly traditions .
To understand heavenly law - ah , that is the special gift .
Uh , huh .
Today , I view Smith no differently than I view the likes of David Korresh or Jim Jones .
I 'm entirely convinced , given Smith 's belief that the Kingdom of God was above earthly law , which manifested itself with a strong secessionist movement from the U.S. , the creation of a special currency , and evil speaking of the U.S. government , that had AK - 47s existed in the 1800s , there would have been quite an arsenal built up in Nauvoo and Missouri .
Its doubtful that Mormonism would have grown from its small beginnings to its hugely metamorphosed state of today , had there been comprehensive CNN coverage of its cult like activities - which were despised just as much in the 1800s as cult activities are despised by reasoned people today .
After all , today , Mormonism , is exactly that - a cult , and despite its respectable veneer of today , it is an organization with some very subtle elements of mind control and programming .
With the benefit of an unclouded mind , I truly have an objective perspective and I can see Mormonism for what it is .
A logical question at this point .
Am I bitter ?
In all honesty , there is an element of bitterness .
I think that is normal given the claims that the church is the Lord 's ONLY vehicle for exaltation .
It is like loosing a bunch of money through a pyramid scheme as the result of putting trust in a close friend who ultimately defrauds you .
Certainly if you 're asked , you 're going to warn all the other rats in the maze to not invest their money with the evil guy who stole your money .
Fortunately , I did n't loose too much money in this maze during my tithing paying years ( after all , what 's 10 % among friends ? ) , but I did lose faith and confidence in human nature - a very painful experience , which is a million times more costly and traumatic than losing money .
Discovering that the Mormon religion was the proverbial king with no clothes , was infinitely more stressful on me psychologically than being told as a youngster that Santa Claus did not exist .
After a period of mourning , I started to regain that trust , but it has been difficult .
Life is a series of opportunity costs .
When you do one thing , it means you 're not doing some other alternative thing .
I resent that I spent two years engaged in pretty mundane activity in my European mission .
No , these were n't the best two years of my life though that claim is absolutely mandatory for ' acceptable '
Sacrament meeting talks , and certainly for admission into the Celestial Kingdom .
Though successful ( read , I baptized a lot of people ) , I came away from my missionary experiences with an impression that has similarly been made in another one of other letters in this website that the nature of a mission has more to do with salesmanship and effective organizational management , rather than anything having to do with truly helping people ..
I also resent having attended Brigham Young University instead of attending another University where I 'm confident I would have received a more balanced education and formed a better world view .
I was intrigued last week to receive a solicitation in the form of a brochure , for a donation to my Alma Mater .
With the background of smiling , clean cut faces ( all of course from the four corners of the earth - the Church is very politically correct these days ) , was a " We are better than the World " type of quote of a past Prophet that pretty well typifies another Mormon attitude .
By sending money to BYU , the brochure suggested I would help fulfill a prophesy that the Lord 's university would far surpass other institutions of higher learning in all things temporal .
Clearly , in addition to the persecution complex , Mormonism thrives on its feeling of superiority .
I 'm also still bitter about the dogmatic behavior of individuals who ' feel ' and ' know ' , without thinking , and who constantly fail to apply the standards of logic to their religion that they apply in all other elements of their daily lives .
The claims of Mormonism are serious .
It is not a live and let live religion .
It is dogmatic in its claims .
Mormonism keeps its hold by suggesting that the elect will discount the assaults on logic , and remain faithful .
Obedience , worship , and sublimation of will are the earthly tests for eternal companionship with the Cosmic terrorist known as Eloheim .
Mormons are fighting for your eternal soul , and in the process , they cause many people to experience a loss in the richness of the here and now of this life .
Like a rat moving through the maze , I am concerned for other rats behind me .
I 've gone beyond my personal modus operandi in writing this letter ( as previously stated , after the period of final discovery , I really have n't discussed my thoughts with others unless first asked ) but I trust my observations might possibly give comfort to those who feel isolated as the result of living with the cognitive dissonance that I have lived with .
So what do I believe ?
As Steve Winwood ( of " Traffic " and " Blind Faith " fame . . . yes , I still like the Tabernacle Choir although I like Eric Clapton better ) sang in a song a few decades ago - articulating the essence of many of the beliefs of history 's greatest thinkers , " Heaven is in your mind . "
It is all about living the fullness of life today - living heaven on earth .
What is the true church and how will I get to heaven ( after this life ) ?
Hell if I know .
Nor do I care any longer .
After all , all we REALLY do KNOW is what we can perceive and learn on THIS earth , THIS day .
What is important is loving and helping other people today , out of the right motivation and not engaging in service to your fellow man as if it were a means to accumulate credit points towards earning a celestial reward .
Getting out of Mormonism has much more greatly helped me appreciate the concept of fully enjoying the here and now rather than frantically working towards a possible reward so I can join Eloheim , Brigham Young , Joseph Smith , et. al. in the Celestial Kingdom , practice eternally sanctioned adultery and otherwise terrorize my own eternal offspring living in worlds without measure .
The price of such an eternal reward is apparently quite easy - many weekends of boring Priesthood meeting lessons , working at the Ward meeting house every now and then , paying 10 % of your income , pretend the king is in fact fully clothed while donning the funny little costume in the heavily marbled and chandeliered palace called the house of the Lord , standing up in Sacrament meetings a couple of times a year to parrot the thoughts and admonitions of the brethren , testifying in Fast and Testimony meetings every couple of months that you know your leaders are ' true ' , and making obligatory 10 minute monthly visits to other Eternally aspiring families .
The other part of the price of working towards such a reward is not at all easy - the general sublimation of your will to a Cosmic Terrorist who expects you to Obey , Follow and Worship rather than Think - with all the tremendous cognitive dissonance this creates .
In the spirit of contrived , stilted Victorian English affected speech that has found its way into Mormon scripture , conjecture , and folklore from the days of Joseph and Brigham to the present day speeches of the likes of Hinkley , Monson and Maxwell - uttered of course , AFTER that deep sanctimonious humble sounding sigh ( that connotes " I 'm a holy man and I 've got the world 's burdens on my shoulders " ) , let me summarize my position and in the process , coin some new scripture : " ( santimonious sigh ) I know not what others may do , but for me and my household , we will serve the God of common sense according to the gospel of logic . "
Best of luck to you all in your journey through life and try to remember the rats behind you in the maze .

THERE are about 300,000 row houses in Philadelphia , which means there are about 300,000 row house owners in Philadelphia who would like to see their tax assessments lowered .
Some of them get in touch with the city ’s Board of Revision of Taxes .
A caller may say , “ Our house is in the worst condition of any on the block , ” said Barry Mescolotto , the board ’s assistant administrator .
These days , Mr. Mescolotto has a good answer : “ I ’ll say , ‘ I ’m looking at a photo of your house , and it looks to be about the same as all the others . ’ ”
“ That usually ends the conversation , ” Mr. Mescolotto said .
Until recently , assessors had to accept homeowners ’ claims or visit the properties themselves .
But in 2003 , the city hired the Pictometry International Corporation , a company in Rochester , N.Y. , to provide images of every building in the city .
The Problem
By the year 2050 , nearly 80 % of the earth ’s population will reside in urban centers .
Applying the most conservative estimates to current demographic trends , the human population will increase by about 3 billion people during the interim .
An estimated 109 hectares of new land ( about 20 % more land than is represented by the country of Brazil ) will be needed to grow enough food to feed them , if traditional farming practices continue as they are practiced today .
At present , throughout the world , over 80 % of the land that is suitable for raising crops is in use ( sources : FAO and NASA ) .
Historically , some 15 % of that has been laid waste by poor management practices .
What can be done to avoid this impending disaster ?
A potential solution : Indoor farming
An MRI Scanner Darkly
OR : Abu Ghraib and Philip Zimbardo ’s psychology of evil , and how the message of cult sci- fi author Philip K. Dick ’s “ authentic humanity ” may just save the Earth …
Ivan “ Chip ” Frederick , the now 40 year - old son of a coalminer and a homemaker from Oakland , Maryland , describes his mother as supportive and caring , and his father as very good to him .
All of his life he has attended Baptist church services , and to this day considers himself a spiritual and moral person .
His sister adored him – she fondly remembers the delight Chip took in feeding the family dog peanut butter .
After attending the local community college , he found work as a correctional officer , demonstrating an almost blameless record , before joining the United States Army in 1984 , where his exemplary performance led to the award of nine medals .
Frederick described himself as a perfectionist , loved neatness , and disliked being alone or feeling rejected by others – he was willing to change his mind to accommodate others so that they would not be “ mad at [ him ] or hate [ him ] . ”
In his recent novel The Castle in the Forest , Norman Mailer invokes the Devil in the genesis of young Adolf Hitler ’s nascent psychopathology ; in Hannibal Rising , Thomas Harris ’s recent prequel to his serial killer series , the author cites Nazi atrocities as pivotal in young Lector ’s upbringing .
By contrast with these demonic early traumata , we find in Chip Frederick ’s biography a young man who likes Nascar and pressing his trousers neatly , and who gets depressed when left alone .
In October 2003 , Frederick found himself responsible for 400 prisoners in a facility in Camp Vigilant , one of four compounds in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq – a step up from the 100 prisoners he had supervised back home , but one with which he could initially cope .
However , shortly after President George W. Bush announced “ Mission Accomplished , ” instead of the compliant and joyful Iraqi citizenry of which Bush administration pre-war propaganda had confidently prophesied , with the country rapidly disintegrating into insurgent violence , the number of detainees under Frederick ’s watch had tripled by December 2003 .
With no special training for this new assignment , under no supervision , Frederick worked the 12 - hour night shift for forty nights straight .
When he was n’t working , he slept in a prison cell .
He describes his working conditions to Stanford psychologist and author Philip Zimbardo thus :
I could n’t find supplies to keep the facilities clean .
The plumbing was bad .
Shit was backed up in the Porta - Potties .
There was trash and mold everywhere … .
It was nasty in there .
There were human body parts in the facility … .
There was a pack of wild dogs running around [ still present from the days when those executed by Saddam were buried in part of the prison and wild dogs would dig up their remains . ]
You know I was so mentally drained when I got off in the morning , all I wanted to do is sleep .
One night near the end of October , Frederick attached electrodes to the left hand of Satar Jabar , the Iraqi prisoner whose hooded spectral image was to become the iconic representation of Abu Ghraib ’s atrocious descent into hell .
Under Frederick ’s watch , prison guards watched or directly participated in the torture or humiliation of numerous prisoners .
Frederick , who feared the disapproval of his peers for not fitting in , had been driven into barbarism .
As with Adolf Eichmann , famously psychopathologised by Hannah Arendt in 1963 in her seminal work Eichmann in Jerusalem : A Report on the Banality of Evil , no sulphur and brimstone announced the metamorphosis of Ivan Frederick from Joe Normal to Lucifer : demonic acts appear , in both cases , to have emerged from the minds of “ normal ” men .
How does this happen ?
For Zimbardo , who went on to testify as an expert witness in Frederick ’s defense at his military trial , Frederick was strongly influenced by “ situational pressures ” that determined the scope of his actions .
As opposed to the classic “ bad apple ” argument advanced by then U.S Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld – that is , putting the blame for the atrocity at the feet of individual rogue soldiers – Zimbardo argued that Frederick ’s mental processes and behaviors were heavily influenced by the dehumanizing conditions of Abu Ghraib and the explicit disavowal of human rights made by Frederick ’s military and civilian superiors , all the way up the chain of command to Rumsfeld and Bush themselves .
Zimbardo quotes a Human Rights Watch investigation citing evidence that Rumsfeld explicitly authorized torture at Abu Ghraib .
Thus , Frederick was not so much a “ bad apple , ” as one apple in a “ bad barrel ” : the whole system was rotten , Zimbardo argues in The Lucifer Effect .
Like the professor ’s pioneering 1971 investigation into the social psychology of evil — the so - called Stanford Prison Experiment ( in which a simulated prison quickly descended into sadism ) —
Frederick ’s personal moral intuitions had been corrupted by social forces .
The judge at Frederick ’s trial rejected Zimbardo ’s mitigating arguments , sentencing the accused to eight years in prison , forfeiture of pay , a dishonorable discharge and a reduction in rank to private .
( To apotheosize Sergeant Frederick ’s Sophoclean descent from suburban normality to felon , his wife subsequently divorced him . )
But where justice has so far failed to deliver equitable punishments to all parties responsible ( in Zimbardo ’s opinion ) for Abu Ghraib , Zimbardo calls for an international prosecution of the broader criminal case .
As parties directly complicit in the Abu Ghrab atrocity , Rumsfeld and Bush deserve to be charged with crimes against humanity , Zimbardo argues ( a forthcoming website set up by Zimbardo will allow readers to vote on the guilt or innocence of President Bush and other top administration officials on war crimes charges ) .
So far , so grimly familiar : homo sapiens may lie somewhere halfway between ape and angel , but the vicious half of the human psyche seems tragically irrepressible despite quantum leaps forward in our material and technological capacities , the evolution of morality failing to keep pace with the advance of guns and steel .
By this logic , only so many missile defense shields and Jack Bauer - style torture interrogations can stave off inevitable atrocity and apocalypse , or as Bertrand Russell put it :
There lies before us , if we choose , continual progress in happiness , knowledge , and wisdom .
Shall we , instead , choose death , because we cannot forget our quarrels ?
We appeal as human beings to human beings : Remember your humanity , and forget the rest .
If you can do so , the way lies open to a new Paradise ; if you cannot , there lies before you the risk of universal death .
Yet the optimism nestled in Russell ’s scary proposal is the inviolability of free will .
( Was St. Augustine on to something , after all , with his doctrine of the felix culpa , or “ fortunate fault ” – the idea that humanity ’s propensity for wrong - doing is the pre-requisite of our freedom of consciousness ? )
In a much criticized work , The Blank Slate , Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker argues that nature almost invariably wins out over nuture and that hardwired ( mainly brutish ) behavioral tendencies will always out .
But such Hobbesian socio- biological yarns purportedly demonstrating the mighty clout of the selfish gene in rendering evil unavoidable ignore the striking counter - evidence of humanity ’s better half .
Evolutionary models sometimes go further and argue that even altruism or heroism are genetically determined as the result of “ group selection , ” but this logic quickly collapses into a Just So story , neatly subsuming all irksome counter - evidence in an ever - ballooning explanatory circle .
Conclusive proof of genetic determinism notwithstanding , we are faced with a humanity perhaps mired in the gutter but still looking at the stars – a commingling of meat and mystery .
If so , the question then becomes : will good yet triumph over evil , and if so how ?
If evil is a choice rather than a biological destiny – if atrocity and war are perhaps theoretically eradicable in the same way that civilization consigned female infanticide and slavery to the historical dustbin – what are the likely candidate strategies for making sure we avoid an eternal return of our species ’ bloodiest blunders ?
First , we will need to answer Joel Surnow , creator or hit television drama series 24 .
As The New Yorker reports of the show ’s classic approach to the ethical conundrum of whether torture is ever morally justifiable :
Terrorists are poised to set off nuclear bombs or bioweapons , or in some other way annihilate entire cities .
The twisting story line forces Bauer [ the protagonist ] and his colleagues to make a series of grim choices that pit liberty against security .
Frequently , the dilemma is stark : a resistant suspect can either be accorded due process — allowing a terrorist plot to proceed — or be tortured in pursuit of a lead .
Bauer invariably chooses coercion .
With unnerving efficiency , suspects are beaten , suffocated , electrocuted , drugged , assaulted with knives , or more exotically abused ; almost without fail , these suspects divulge critical secrets .
While the “ ticking time bomb ” scenario frequently depicted by the show may be fanciful , and the efficacy of torture as an intelligence - gathering tool questionable ( according to the U.S. Army , quoted in the New Yorker piece ) , a post - 911 urgency highlights fault - lines in the classic utilitarian defense of violence in regard to the ethics of torture and the attendant debate about the nature of wartime “ evil . ”
Early in The Lucifer Effect , Zimbardo defines evil thus :
Evil consists in intentionally behaving in ways that harm , abuse , demean , dehumanize , or destroy innocent others – or using one ’s authority and system power to encourage or permit others to do so on your behalf .
Interviewed by phone and email for this article , Zimbardo conceded that the word “ innocent ” applied to “ others ” in this definition raises the problematic issue of defining “ guilt ” or “ innocence ” in relation to those victimized by the perpetrators of evil .
Asked about the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 , Zimbardo uncategorically classes the Hiroshima bombing as evil and the Nagasaki bombing as “ doubly evil ” ( the latter thus because it was really the first act of the Cold War , rather than the last act of WWII : at least 70,000 people burned as a message to Joseph Stalin ) .
Zimbardo ’s insistence on the absolute moral wrongness of the bombings stands in brave defiance to the common defense that the bombs “ saved lives ” by preventing a U.S. invasion of the Japanese mainland .
However , since the “ innocence ” reference of his definition might lead some readers to wonder if there are indeed hypothetical cases in which victims are not innocent and whose treatment , however painful , could not therefore be construed as “ evil ” ( this , after all , is the Hiroshima defense , the Abu Ghraib defense , the Dick Cheney defense ) – I press Zimbardo for a redefinition .
He offers the following :
Evil is the exercise of power to intentionally harm ( psychologically ) , hurt ( physically ) or destroy ( mortally or physically ) other people .
To this definition , Zimbardo adds a striking coda that speaks beyond the phenomenon of evil itself to its seductive societal and psychic allure :
Our fascination with evil is less from its consequences than from its demonstration of power and dominance to control people , animals or the environment , and is greater the more creative and unique it is , more raw and absolute .
If this coda is accurate , does Hollywood mythologize the Zodiac killer or John Wayne Gacy because they symbolize an enviably extreme concentration of power and dominance ?
Some theorists have argued that psychopaths lack a Theory of Mind – an intuitive understanding that you think and feel pretty much just like I do – and that this deficit is possibly related to the activity ( or lack thereof ) in cells of the orbitofrontal cortex called mirror neurons that contribute to the simulation of internal experience in other human beings .
Hence the psychopath , perhaps lacking this critical simulacrum of the sentient
Other , feels no pain when he induces it in his victim , and can thus dominate his prey with unconscionable liberty .
By contrast , a compassionate person experiences a neighbor ’s suffering as partly her own , because at the neuronal level she mirrors this suffering .
( In Deconstructing the Psychiatric Bible , I showed how neuropsychonalysis is now replacing “ single skull ” neurology with an interpersonal and interpsychic model of development and psychopathology ; I will be excited to find out more about mirror neurons and their role in this model . )
If so , what happens to the Sergeant Fredericks and Adolph Eichmanns of the world once they ’ve been lured to the Dark Side : how and why do the mirror neurons stop reflecting the pain outside ?
One answer to this question may lie in the unlikely form of How to Build A Universe That Does n’t Fall Apart Two Days Later , a 1978 speech by science fiction novelist Philip Kindred Dick , an author whose cultural and philosophical influence has grown to near - cultic proportions since his death four years thereafter – a popular blossoming in recent times arguably driven by a gradual convergence between the real world of post - 911 existential paranoia and the spooky Gnostic ruminations of the writer ’s imaginative terrain .
Creator of the novels A Scanner Darkly and Minority Report ( both now movies ) and the short story on which the film Bladerunner is based , Dick used his fiction to explore the nature of reality and the question of what it means to be “ authentically human , ” this latter issue proving especially perplexing for the literary psychonaut , since he believed that reality is multiple , often hidden from plain sight , and distorted by powerful elites for malign purposes .
For Dick , the cosmos resembles a colossal prison experiment designed to no apparent purpose by an invisible hand : “ some of us are prisoners , and some of us are guards , ” as Bob Dylan sang .
That the prison is simulated does not diminish its power ( as the subjects of Zimbardo ’s 1971 Stanford experiment discovered ) .
However , to realize the prison ’s simulated nature is to illuminate the artificer ’s hand , and thus potentially to shift the shape of the simulation .
“ The mind is its own place and in itself , can make a Heaven of Hell , a Hell of Heaven , ” wrote Milton in Paradise Lost .
But are there limits to such solipsistic grandiosity ?
Yes , we must ultimately face the constraints of Reality , defined by Dick as follows : “ Reality is that which , when you stop believing in it , does n’t go away . ”
( Hopefully , President Bush is not real ) .
But within these limits of the Real , there ’s a great deal of creative freedom .
To be authentic is to resist the seduction of groupthink , to endure the aloneness that Chip Frederick could not tolerate and without which his Baptist principles meant zero .
Dick writes :
The authentic human being is one of us who instinctively knows what he should not do , and , in addition , he will balk at doing it .
He will refuse to do it , even if this brings down dread consequences to him and to those whom he loves .
This , to me , is the ultimately heroic trait of ordinary people ; they say no to the tyrant and they calmly take the consequences of this resistance .
Their deeds may be small , and almost always unnoticed , unmarked by history .
Their names are not remembered , nor did these authentic humans expect their names to be remembered .
I see their authenticity in an odd way : not in their willingness to perform great heroic deeds but in their quiet refusals .
In essence , they can not be compelled to be what they are not .
Zimbardo retired from lecturing at Stanford this week .
He also announced that , after a distinguished career investigating the horrible things that people do to each other , in this era of “ extraordinary renditions ” and terrorist dirty bomb plots he is now more interested in a corresponding topic which Dick would admire : the nature of heroic acts , big and small .
If Dick is to be believed , perhaps there is hope for humanity and grist for Zimbardo in the next generation :
The power of spurious realities battering at us today — these deliberately manufactured fakes never penetrate to the heart of true human beings .
I watch the children watching TV and at first I am afraid of what they are being taught , and then I realize , They ca n’t be corrupted or destroyed .
They watch , they listen , they understand , and , then , where and when it is necessary , they reject .
There is something enormously powerful in a child ’s ability to withstand the fraudulent .
A child has the clearest eye , the steadiest hand .
The hucksters , the promoters , are appealing for the allegiance of these small people in vain .
True , the cereal companies may be able to market huge quantities of junk breakfasts ; the hamburger and hot dog chains may sell endless numbers of unreal fast - food items to the children , but the deep heart beats firmly , unreached and unreasoned with .
A child of today can detect a lie quicker than the wisest adult of two decades ago .
When I want to know what is true , I ask my children .
They do not ask me ; I turn to them .
“ Blank slate ” romanticism ?
Maybe .
But let ’s not forget that Theory of Mind – our mirroring , compassionate capacity – apparently emerges in toddlerhood , and that arguably the roots of good and evil may well lie there , too .
Let ’s also remember the fate of Adam in Book XI of Milton ’s Paradise Lost : after his ejection from Eden for eating the apple from the Tree of Knowledge , Adam is transported by the Archangel Michael to a high hill , from which he observes a seemingly infinite succession of future progeny corrupted by his first taste of evil , of which Michael remarks :
Adam , now ope thine eyes , and first behold
The effects which thy original crime hath wrought
In some to spring from thee , who never touched
The excepted Tree , nor with the Snake conspired ,
Nor sinned thy sin , yet from that sin derive
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds .
Milton gives Adam and Eve the power to resist the Snake and put an end to violent deeds in the future : “ The world was all before them , ” reads the poem ’s last stanza .
So , if Zimbardo and not Lucifer triumphs , maybe the world really wo n’t fall apart in the next two days after all …
Chances are you ’ve heard of SARMs before , but many people have n’t heard of a SARM called S23 — and it ’s a shame , it really is .
S23 is one of the more powerful SARMs on the market , which some recreational users claim can even rival RAD 140 and Ligandrol .
Is it true , though ?
Can the S23 SARM really transform your physique in just one cycle ?
Or is it just a bunch of bro science served up by marketers ?
In this article we ’ll cover everything you need to know , A - Z , about S23 , ranging from side effects , to the benefits , dosage , clinical studies , and more !
WILLIAM BRATTON , the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department ( LAPD ) , likes to say that “ cops count ” .
They certainly seem to count when Mr Bratton is in charge of them .
New York 's crime rate withered when he ran its police force in the mid-1990s , and Los Angeles has become more law - abiding ever since he arrived in 2002 .
Burglaries are down by a fifth , murders by a third and serious assaults by more than half .
The setting for innumerable hard - boiled detective novels and violent television dramas is now safer than Salt Lake City in Utah .
Yet Los Angeles 's good fortune is not replicated everywhere .
Compared to ten years ago , when crime was in remission across America , the current diagnosis is complex and worrying .
Figures released this week by the FBI show that , while property crimes continue to fall , the number of violent crimes has begun to drift upwards .
In some places it has soared .
Oakland , in northern California , had 145 murders last year — more than half again as many as in 2005 .
No fewer than 406 people died in Philadelphia , putting the murder rate back where it had been in the bad old days of the early 1990s .
The most consistent and striking trend of the past few years is a benign one .
America 's three biggest cities are becoming safer .
Robberies in Chicago , Los Angeles and New York have tumbled in the past few years , defying the national trend ( see chart ) .
Indeed , the big cities are now holding down increases in overall crime rates .
Between 2000 and 2006 , for example , the number of murders in America went up by 7 % .
Were it not for Chicago , Los Angeles and New York , all of which notched many fewer , the increase would have been 11 % .
This is especially surprising given the big cities ' recent woes .
Thanks to a cut in starting salaries and poaching by suburban forces , New York 's police department has lost more than 4,000 officers since 2000 .
Chicago and Los Angeles also have fewer cops than they did in the late 1990s — and the latter has more people .
The LAPD labours under a court decree , imposed in 2001 following revelations of corruption and brutality , which forces it to spend precious time and money scrutinising itself .
The three police forces , though , look increasingly alike when it comes to methods of tackling crime .
The new model was pioneered in New York .
In the mid-1990s it began to map crimes , allocate officers accordingly ( a strategy known as “ putting cops on the dots ” ) and hold local commanders accountable for crime on their turf .
Since 2002 it has flooded high - crime areas with newly qualified officers .
The cops ' methods are sometimes crude — police stops in New York have increased five - fold in the past five years — but highly effective .
Crime tends to go down by about a third in the flooded areas , which has a disproportionate impact on the overall tally .
In the past few years Chicago and Los Angeles have adopted similar methods : although , having fewer officers , they are less extravagant with them .
The Los Angeles police targeted just five hot spots last year .
But both cities have put local commanders in charge of cutting crime on their patches .
And , like New York , they are moving beyond putting cops on the dots .
They now try to anticipate where crimes will occur based on gang intelligence .
Wesley Skogan , a criminologist at Northwestern University , reckons such methods are the most likely cause of the continued drop in big -city crime .
He has diligently tested most of the explanations proffered for Chicago 's falling crime rate and has been able to rubbish most of them .
Locking lots of people up , for example , may well have helped cut crime a decade ago .
But it can't account for the trend of the past few years : the number of Chicagoans behind bars has declined since 1999 .
The police simply seem to be doing a better job of deterring lawlessness .
The big cities ' methods may sound obvious , yet they are surprisingly rare .
Many police forces are not divided into neighbourhood units .
Oakland 's struggling force , for example , is organised into three daily shifts , or “ watches ” , which makes it hard to hold anybody accountable for steadily rising crime in a district .
Even when smaller police forces track emerging hot spots , they often fail to move quickly enough to cool them down .
There is , however , a limit to what even the best police forces can do .
Outside New York , in particular , the thin blue line can be very thin indeed .
Los Angeles , a city of 3.8 m people , tends to have about 500 officers on general patrol at any time .
However shrewdly the cops are deployed , they might not have cut crime so dramatically if social trends had not also been moving in the right direction .
The most obvious change is that , thanks in part to high property prices , all three cities are shedding young people .
Together they lost more than 200,000 15 - to 24 - year - olds between 2000 and 2005 .
That bodes ill for their creativity and future competitiveness , but it is good news for the police .
Young people are not just more likely to commit crimes .
Thanks to their habit of walking around at night and their taste for portable electronic gizmos , they are also more likely to become its targets .
Another change is that poor Americans have been displaced by poor immigrants — who , as studies have repeatedly shown , are much better behaved than natives of similar means .
This trend is symbolised by the disappearance of blacks .
Roughly half of America 's murder victims and about the same proportion of suspected murderers are black .
In five years America 's three biggest cities lost almost a tenth of their black residents , while elsewhere in America their numbers held steady .
None of which detracts from the achievement of America 's biggest police forces .
After all , they managed to cut crime when several trends , from the growing availability of crack cocaine to the continued breakdown of poor families , were against them .
It is nice to have some help , but cops do count .

Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The last soldier to see Army Ranger Pat Tillman alive , Spc. Bryan O'Neal , told lawmakers that he was warned by superiors not to divulge -- especially to the Tillman family -- that a fellow soldier killed Tillman .
O'Neal particularly wanted to tell fellow soldier Kevin Tillman , who was in the convoy traveling behind his brother at the time of the 2004 incident in Afghanistan .
" I wanted right off the bat to let the family know what had happened , especially Kevin , because I worked with him in a platoon and I knew that he and the family all needed to know what had happened , " O'Neal testified .
" I was quite appalled that when I was actually able to speak with Kevin , I was ordered not to tell him . "
Asked who gave him the order , O'Neal replied that it came from his battalion commander , then - Lt. Col. Jeff Bailey .
" He basically just said ... ' Do not let Kevin know , that he 's probably in a bad place knowing his brother 's dead , ' " O'Neal told House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman .
" And he made it known I would get in trouble , sir , if I spoke with Kevin on it being fratricide . "
The military instead released a " manufactured narrative " detailing how Pat Tillman died leading a courageous counterattack in an Afghan mountain pass , Kevin Tillman told the committee .
( Watch Kevin Tillman accuse the military of lying )
Also Tuesday , former Pfc. Jessica Lynch told the House panel that the military lied about her capture .
Lynch testified that after her vehicle was attacked in Iraq in March 2003 , she suffered a mangled spinal column , broken arm , crushed foot , shattered femur and even a sexual assault .
But it only added insult to injury , literally , when she returned to her parents ' home in West Virginia , which " was under siege by media all repeating the story of the little girl ' Rambo ' from the hills of West Virginia who went down fighting , " Lynch said .
( Watch Lynch set the record straight )
" It was not true , " she said before gently chiding the military .
" The truth is always more heroic than the hype . "
Waxman , D - California , said the military " invented " tales about Tillman and Lynch .
( Watch Lynch describe her bond with the Tillman family )
" The bare minimum we owe our soldiers and their families is the truth , " Waxman said .
" That did n't happen for two of the most famous soldiers in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars . "
Brother calls tale ' calculated lies '
As the tide was turning in the U.S. battle against Afghan insurgents -- and as media outlets prepared to release reports on detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib in Iraq -- the military saw Pat Tillman 's death as an " opportunity , " Kevin Tillman told the panel .
Even after it became clear the report was bogus , the military clung to the " utter fiction " that Pat Tillman was killed by a member of his platoon who was following the rules of engagement , the brother said .
" Revealing that Pat 's death was a fratricide would have been yet another political disaster during a month already swollen with disasters , " Kevin Tillman said .
" The facts needed to be suppressed .
An alternative narrative had to be constructed , crucial evidence destroyed . "
Tillman bristled at the military claim that the initial report was merely misleading .
Clearly resentful , he told the panel that writing a field report stating that his brother had been " transferred to an intensive care unit for continued CPR after most of his head had been taken off by multiple 5.56 rounds is not misleading . "
" These are deliberate and calculated lies , " he said .
Pat Tillman , who became a national hero after he gave up a lucrative contract with the NFL's Arizona Cardinals to join the Army 's elite Rangers force , was awarded the Silver Star , the military 's third - highest combat decoration , after the Army said he was killed leading a counterattack .
O'Neal testified that his superiors had him write a statement about the incident for Tillman 's Silver Star commendation .
He said the final version contained false statements about enemy fire that had been inserted by someone else .
Thomas F. Gimble , the Defense Department 's acting inspector general , said that investigators could not determine who altered O'Neal 's statement and that no attempt was made to examine the document 's electronic history .
The Army later acknowledged not only that Tillman was killed by his fellow soldiers , but that officers in Tillman 's chain of command knew the counterattack story was bogus .
Still , Senior Chief Petty Officer Stephen
White told the official heroism - under - fire story at a May 3 , 2004 , memorial service for Tillman .
" It 's a horrible thing that happened with Pat , " White , a Navy SEAL who was Tillman 's friend , told the committee .
" I 'm the guy that told America how he died , basically , at that memorial .
It was incorrect .
That does not sit well with me . "
Though the military blamed the erroneous report on an inadequate initial investigation , Mary Tillman told ESPN Radio last month that everyone involved in the shooting knew immediately that her son had been shot three times in the head by a member of his platoon .
" The Tillman family was kept in the dark for more than a month , " Waxman said .
" Evidence was destroyed .
Witness statements were doctored .
The Tillman family wants to know how all of this could 've happened . "
Lynch : Truth ' not always easy '
Lynch 's testimony began with a recollection of the March 23 , 2003 , attack and her purported rescue nine days later .
As she and her fellow 11 soldiers drove through Nassiriya , Iraq , they noticed armed men standing in the streets and on rooftops .
Three soldiers were quickly killed when a rocket - propelled grenade slammed into their vehicle , Lynch said .
The other eight died in the ensuing fighting or from injuries suffered during the fighting , she said .
Lynch later woke up at Saddam Hussein General Hospital .
" When I awoke , I did not know where I was .
I could not move .
I could not call for help .
I could not fight , " she said , explaining she had a six - inch gash in her head and numerous broken bones .
" The nurses at the hospital tried to soothe me , and they even tried unsuccessfully at one point to return me to Americans . "
On April 1 , U.S. troops came for her .
" A soldier came into the room .
He tore the American flag from his uniform , and he handed it to me in my hand and he told me , ' We 're American soldiers , and we 're here to take you home . '
And I looked at him and I said , ' Yes , I 'm an American soldier , too , ' " she recalled .
She was distraught to come home and find herself billed as a hero when two of her fellow soldiers had fought bravely until the firefight 's end and another had died after picking up soldiers and removing them from harm 's way .
" The American people are capable of determining their own ideals for heroes , and they do n't need to be told elaborate lies , " she said .
" I had the good fortune to come home and to tell the truth .
Many soldiers , like Pat Tillman , did not have that opportunity .
" The truth of war is not always easy .
The truth is always more heroic than the hype , " she said .
Lynch became a celebrity after U.S. troops filmed what they said was a daring raid on the hospital .
Hospital staffers , however , said there were no Iraqi troops at the hospital when the purported rescue took place .
In the March 23 , 2003 , attack , Lynch , the Army claimed , was shot and stabbed during a fierce gun battle with Iraqi troops that left 11 of her comrades dead .
It was later learned that Lynch never fired a shot during the firefight because her gun was jammed with sand .
Are Multicore Processors the Root of a New Software Crisis ?
It 's just over a year since I first got my grubby little mitts on a machine with a dual - core processor ( the fact that it took me over 12 months to get the rest of the machine fully working with my other equipment is annoying , but irrelevant to this entry ) .
Such processors are gradually finding their way into more and more peoples hands .
The era of widespread multi- processor machines is finally upon us - albeit rather later than many of us expected , and in the form of multicores rather than multi-processors .
The advent of such machines is having an odd effect on many in the software community , which is having what amounts to a collective crisis of confidence in its ability to fully utilise such machines .
But before exploring this further , let 's take a step back in time .
The software crisis I remember as an undergraduate being told - in Dickensian tones that suggested This Is The Way It Always Has Been And Always Will Be - that we were in the midst of a software crisis .
Software was always behind schedule , over budget , unreliable , lacking features , and generally unusable .
To a large extent I bought into this self - flagellating view of the world - after all , I saw software crash all the time .
Then a few years back , I was at an OMG dinner ( in Disneyland in California , but that 's a detail I 'd prefer to forget ) , and among the 10 or so people there , the topic of conversation shifted onto the software crisis .
Various people shook their fists and banged the table - metaphorically speaking - decrying the terrible state of software .
Then Jim Rumbaugh - of UML fame , and who retired from IBM / Rational last year - said something that I initially dismissed , but realised some time later was incredibly profound .
To paraphrase Jim : " We 've forgotten how incredible software is today .
I loaded Photoshop onto my computer last week and within minutes I was manipulating photos in ways that would have been impossible for even world experts a few years ago .
And that photo editing requires a reliance on many large , complex software systems that have been packaged in a way that my family of non-experts can fairly easily use . "
What Jim was saying changed my thinking on software .
While software could certainly be better , could n't everything in life ?
The fact that things can be improved does n't mean that the current state of affairs is intolerable in an absolute sense .
In actual fact , for normal people the software that they interact with is pretty decent these days .
It may not be perfectly reliable , but it 's generally more than reliable enough ( gone are the days where machines need to be rebooted 5 times a day to keep them stable ) .
It may not be as easy to use as it could be , but normal people manage to do most of the tasks they need to without huge problems and that 's the ultimate acid test .
A substantial reason why we worked our way out of the software crisis is that we have become much better at developing software over the last 20 years .
We have better languages and tools ; we understand many of the problems more thoroughly ; we have been able to disseminate knowledge about software creation fair and wide ; and we have become much better at reusing the increasingly large number of mature , stable programs available .
While one still does hear people witter on about the software crisis from time to time , this is gradually diminishing because the reality of software today is that it 's largely fit for purpose .
Is there a multicore software crisis ?
I have a feeling that software people secretly miss the opportunity to whinge about the software crisis .
But somethings coming along that may replace it .
Put simply : " Now we 've got these multicore processors , and we can't fully utilise all that power , all our development methods are dead . "
Cue throwing toys out of prams etc .
While I understand the reasoning behind this mode of thought , I largely disagree with it .
Here 's why .
When I was talking about the software crisis earlier , I missed out the other factor in the demise of said crisis : hardware .
Todays computers are so incredibly fast , so capable of dealing with mind - boggling quantities of data , that they bear little relation to those of 25 years ago .
The huge increase in horsepower has made many software practises that were previously untenable - e.g. using dynamically typed languages like Python - more than useable .
Consequently we have been able to develop software with increasingly little concern of the underlying hardware .
In my opinion , reasonably priced PCs are more than fast enough for virtually every task that normal people throw at them , and this has been the case for the last 5 or 6 years .
Hardware speed increases since that point have been largely lost on your average computer user , because the machines were already fast enough .
The last sentence of that last paragraph is absolutely key for me : for the vast majority of tasks , for the vast majority of users , machines are already fast enough .
Of course we 'll take more speed if it 's given to us , but the lack of speed is n't generally holding us back any more .
So if you 're developing a desktop application , or a standard web site , or a back - end processing system , the chances are that your development tools , languages , and methods are actually largely adequate .
More accurately , the next generation of tools , languages , and methods will probably be a useful - but not radical - evolution of the current generation .
Why then are many people preaching that we need to rip all of our tools , languages , and methods to shreds and start again ?
Are there situations where we need to rethink software for multicores ?
I rather enjoy having a multicore desktop machine as it enables me to work quite a bit faster than before .
The reason for that is - and I 'm man enough to admit it - I 'm not normal .
When I use a computer , I 've often got a long - running CPU bound task going on , or I 'm switching rapidly between different applications .
Because all these things run as different processes , my OS is able to share a reasonable amount of the grunt work between cores , thus ensuring that my machine remains responsive .
The fact of the matter is that only a tiny minority of people will ever run their machines in such a way - and for those of us that do , the technology for distributing processes across cores is already more than adequate .
As this suggests , the vast majority of todays software is more than adequate for the multicore world as users will perceive it .
I do however think that there are certain classes of problems that could benefit substantially from multicores , but which are not efficiently decomposed into coarse - grained processes .
The most compelling for me is computationally intensive scientific applications .
Some of these applications crunch numbers like there 's no tomorrow , and often have aspects which are highly parallelizable at the fine - grained level .
It might also be that some computer games could benefit similarly ( given that many of them are number crunchers aimed at the entertainment domain ) , but frankly I 'm so out of touch with that area that I do n't feel qualified to offer an opinion .
My fundamental points here are : most people wo n't notice the difference in speed from multicores ; for those of us who do benefit , coarse - grained process decomposition pushes utilisation more than high enough ; and only a few very specialised domains will really benefit from multicores .
How do we best utilise multicores ?
For most cases , the answer to me is clear : breaking systems up into a small number of cooperating processes is more than sufficient .
In a small number of cases , threads might be an answer , but threads are too often a ticking time - bomb ( my prediction is that multicore processors will highlight huge numbers of timing problems in existing multi- threaded applications ) .
Existing languages , tools , and methods , are perfectly suited to the former , and are sometimes adequate for the latter .
For those rare , specialised domains such as computationally intensive scientific applications I think a new approach is needed .
I say this not to advocate change for changes sake , but because I believe that the developers of such applications are unusual in that they are prepared to absorb a large amount of implementation pain if they can significantly improve their execution time .
Step forward functional languages without mutable state .
I often enjoy teasing the FP community .
Frankly FP has never shown itself as being a practical way to develop most systems : cute 10 line programs simply do n't reflect the ugly realities of changing requirements and developers of varying abilities .
But FP without mutable state has two inherent advantages over imperative approaches .
First , it can largely do away locks , since locks are generally only needed to protect mutable state .
Second , functional programs are often amenable to more analysis than imperative programs , and consequently parallelization optimisations are more likely to be identified automatically .
I think that this is an area where FP could finally find its niche .
The path has been somewhat mapped out by Erlang , but Erlang is an outlier in that , while it 's an FP language without mutable state , it does n't have static types .
Every other FP language without mutable state that I know of has a static type system .
Most such type systems are merely odd on a good day , but wilfully obscure on a bad day - they get in the way too often .
If someone can come up with a statically typed language which is as relatively easy to use as Erlang , but can provide large parallelization benefits , then there will be a specific class of real user out there who will gobble it up .
Conclusions
My main contention is that multicore machines are n't really going to make a big impact on most people or most developers .
The vast majority of software will continue to be developed using methods that are familiar in tone to todays developers , and the resulting software will be sufficiently efficient , feature rich , and stable .
However for a small class of users , existing techniques are lacking .
In todays software world , which is more tolerant of heterogeneous systems than ever before , this provides a niche opening for FP if it can be packaged in a reasonable fashion .
I do want to make clear though that I do n't think that FP in any of its forms will ever take over the world , but I 'm going to be interested to see if FP finally manages to carve out a distinct niche .

MSNBC website tags Republican ex-DC Madam client as a Democrat Michael Roston
Published : Friday July 13 , 2007 Print This Email This The MSNBC website misidentified a Republican Senator from Louisiana on Friday as a Democrat .
The erroneously captioned photo was posted with a news story about Senator David Vitter , who outed himself on Tuesday as a client of the so - called DC Madam , Deborah Palfrey .
" Sen. David Vitter , D - La. , may not be Bill Clinton , but he may wish his wife was Hillary Clinton , " reads the MSNBC caption .
A screen capture is presented below .
The photo accompanied a National Journal story by John Merucurio , which has a content - sharing arrangement with MSNBC .
In his " PolitiScope " column , Mercurio discussed whether or not Vitter would receive the same kind of forgiveness that former President Bill Clinton was granted for his affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky .
Notably , Mercurio did not identify Vitter in the story as a Democrat or Republican .
The original story at the National Journal website , available only to subscribers , did not include a photo .
The original caption accompanying the AP photograph that MSNBC attached to the story rightfully identified Vitter as a Republican .
" Sen. David Vitter , R - La. , speaks speaks at a news conference at the Port of New Orleans , in this Wednesday , March 30 , 2005 file photo in New Orleans , " the AP noted in the July 9 picture .
MSNBC is not the only news outlet to identify Vitter as a Democrat .
A photo attached to an archive of stories about Senator Johnny Isakson ( R - GA ) at the Huffington Post calls Vitter a Democrat , although it appears possible that the photo was posted long before Vitter revealed that he had hired women from Palfrey 's agency .
A Huffington Post editor clarified to RAW STORY that this error was generated by a third party content source .
A Google search also shows that other sources have misidentified Vitter 's party affiliation , including an April 2005 press release from Senator Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , as well as a July 2005 story from the newspaper The Hill .
( Note : Some time after publication on Friday night , the caption was corrected at MSNBC 's site so that it now correctly identifies Vitter as a Republican )
Remember those ‘ Spot the difference pictures ’ puzzle games when you were a kid ( or even as an adult ? )
Remember how long it took you to find them all ?
I had troubles – enough so that I was the last person to finish them and go out and play kickball !
No longer , I say !
Introducing a sure - fire way to find all the differences in “ spot the difference ” picture puzzles in a matter of seconds .
Only two requirements :
You must have that “ magic eye ” skill used with those goofy pictures from the 90’s ( involving crossing your eyes )
The “ spot the difference ” pictures should be side by side for this technique to work .
If they are below and above each other , just rotate the pictures / page so they are side by side .
If they are skewed , you can tilt your head a bit …although you ’d probably look a little funny .
Ok , once you have found a suitable picture …
Stare at the pictures , begin to cross your eyes .
You should see a third image appear between the two pictures .
Focus on the middle picture , adjusting the tilt of your head so both pictures line up exactly .
Once you ’ve focused on the image , all the differences should look “ luminescent ” .
* This picture from AllStarPuzzles ( click this link for the full size version )
The trick is to cross your eyes so that your left eye is looking at the right image , and your right eye is looking at the left image .
Once they both line up , you should be focused on a joined image ( a mesh of the two ) .
The differences will “ glow ” because one eye is seeing something different than the other .
The real trouble to this technique is to convince your eyes to lock on to the third image , but once you get the hang of it , it should take you no time at all .
Now go and impress your drunk friends !

The UN secretary general 's special envoy , Terje Roed - Larsen , and the EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , arrived in Beirut to meet the Lebanese prime minister , Fouad Siniora , in the hope of securing an agreement to curb the violence .
Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , warned of " far - reaching consequences " after eight civilian railway workers were killed and six seriously injured in a morning rocket strike in the city of Haifa , the deadliest strike in Israel since the conflict began last week .
Some analysts now say a major ground invasion of southern Lebanon is being considered .
Last night Hizbullah rockets hit a village outside Nazareth , home to Israel 's biggest Arab community , and the town of Afula .
At 33 miles from the Lebanese border , they are the southernmost targets to have been struck so far .
Israeli jets hit army bases in Tripoli , Lebanon 's second largest city , and Abdeh , killing at least nine Lebanese soldiers and injuring many more .
Earlier , at least 16 civilians were killed after a bomb flattened a building near the southern Lebanese town of Tyre .
Five members of one family were killed in a strike in Aitaroun .
All were visiting expatriate Lebanese who held Canadian citizenship .
Around 140 Lebanese civilians have been killed so far .
At least 12 Israeli civilians have died as well as 12 soldiers and sailors .
Two Israeli soldiers are still being held captive by Hizbullah .
As the pressure mounted , leaders of the G8 meeting in St Petersburg blamed Hizbullah for the upsurge in violence and said the onus was on the militant group to free the two Israeli soldiers it kidnapped on Wednesday .
They held back from demanding an immediate ceasefire by Israel but called on Israel to show the utmost restraint , seek to avoid civilian casualties and consider agreeing to a UN observer and security mission being set up on the Lebanese border .
" It is a strong message with a clear political content , " said the German chancellor , Angela Merkel .
The leaders , struggling all day to reach agreement , said conditions for a sustainable cessation of violence must include the return of captured Israeli soldiers , an end to shelling of Israeli territory and an end to Israeli military operations , as well as the early withdrawal of its forces .
In an attempt to reassure Israel that Hizbullah can be restrained on the Lebanese Israeli border , the G8 suggested the UN security council should consider " the possibility of an international security / monitoring presence " on the border .
Italy 's prime minister , Romano Prodi , emerged as a mediator yesterday when Lebanon said he had passed on Israeli conditions for a ceasefire .
" Prodi told me that Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert informed him of two demands for a ceasefire - handing over the two captive Israeli soldiers and a Hizbullah pullback to behind the Litani river , " a government statement quoted Mr Siniora as telling the cabinet .
The Litani is 12 miles north of the border with Israel .
Israeli jets were also in action in Gaza destroying the Palestinian foreign ministry building in northern Gaza .
The world 's financial markets are anxiously seeking news of a deal to end the conflict amid fears that it could send oil prices above $ 80 a barrel .
Last week the cost of crude hit a record high of more than $ 78 a barrel .
But in Israel there was no suggestion of a ceasefire .
Mr Olmert , who met his cabinet yesterday , said : " Nothing will deter us , whatever far - reaching ramifications regarding our relations on the northern border and in the region there may be . "
One senior Israeli general warned of an imminent escalation in attacks on southern Lebanon , where Hizbullah has its key rocket - launching sites .
Hassan Nasrallah , the Shia cleric who leads Hizbullah and whose apartment and offices have been bombed by the Israelis , appeared on television last night threatening yet more violence .
" Any advances will be good news for the mujahideen , " he said .
" It will bring us near to victory and we will humiliate them as in the past . "
From Tehran , which in effect set up Hizbullah in the early 1980s , came an insistence that the group would not disarm .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said : " The American president says Hizbullah should be disarmed .
It is obvious that you [ America ] want that , and it is obvious that the Zionists [ Israel ] want that too .
But it will not happen . "
It is believed the rocket that hit Haifa was an Iranian - made missile .
A missile that struck an Israeli warship on Friday night , killing four sailors , is now thought to have also been an Iranian - made radar - guided missile .
" You will probably see ground forces into southern Lebanon for a brief time , " Gerald Steinberg , of Israel 's Bar - Ilan University , told Reuters .
" With their [ Hizbullah 's ] weapons storehouses being hit , when will the cost to them become too great to continue ? "
Western countries stepped up plans to evacuate their citizens from Lebanon .
France hired a Greek cruise ship to sail its citizens out .
An advance US security team arrived in Beirut to plan for an evacuation of the 25,000 Lebanese - Americans still in the country .
Britain is sending the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and assault ship HMS Bulwark .
Given that it is April 15th ( even if that date does n’t hold it ’s normal significance this year ) , I figured I ’d pose a question to the readers here …
How much did you get back from the government this year ?
I did alright , getting about $ 2 K back from them .
Of course , that leads to a secondary question :
How much , in total , did you pay the government this year ?
What was it , enough to buy a small appliance ?
Small car ?
Small boat ?
Small airplane ?
Did you get your money ’s worth for that “ investment ” in Washington DC ?
Could you have made better use of that money ?
Seriously , if you do n’t know how much you paid , in gross terms , you ’re like most Americans .
Most do n’t bother to take the time to understand the actual cost of government .
And , when you add in all the different taxes ( sales tax , vehicle license fees , telecom taxes , etc ) , it ’s nearly impossible to actually know the true number , you ’re always just working with a good estimate .
Pull out those tax forms .
Pull out the W - 2 . Start adding up the numbers : you might be surprised .
Or , if you ’re like most people , you might be led into a fury of homicidal rage .
Ever wonder why tax day is about 6 months away from election day ?

Washington Democrats shelve plans to force Iraq pullout Lacking support for stronger bill , scale back goals WASHINGTON -- Congressional Democrats have dramatically scaled back their plans to shape the course of the Iraq war , bowing to pressure from Republicans and conservative Democrats to pursue only nonbinding measures , at least for now , as they push to bring the troops home .
In the House , Democratic leaders now concede that they do not have enough votes to use their control over federal spending to force President Bush to begin withdrawing troops .
Instead , lawmakers are drafting a far milder bill that would include guidelines for troop readiness -- requirements that the president could waive at his discretion .
In the Senate , efforts to repeal the original 2002 resolution authorizing force in Iraq have faltered as well , amid deep divisions among Democrats .
Instead , Senate leaders are scrambling to find a compromise that would mandate a limited mission for US troops , but even that probably would not pass , and may not force the president 's hand anyway .
With their thin majority in Congress , Democrats are now confronting the reality that finding a strong , legally binding antiwar measure that also keeps their party together may not be possible .
" It 's a very delicate thing to be able to achieve , and I 'm just not sure it can be achieved , " said Senator Ben Nelson , a conservative Democrat from Nebraska .
" It 's going to be tough .
Maybe not impossible , but it 's going to be tough . "
The delay has only heightened liberals ' calls for Democrats to force an end to the war , through steps such as blocking funding and mandating troop withdrawals by particular dates .
But conservative Democrats and virtually all Republicans balk at such measures , making compromise elusive , Nelson said .
Democrats rode to power in November in large part because of antiwar sentiment .
Party leaders vowed to quickly deliver on voters ' desire to end the war , and polls have suggested that the public is growing more frustrated as US involvement in Iraq grinds on .
Yet two months after taking control of Congress , the grand total of congressional action on the war consists of a single House resolution that states formal disapproval of the president 's decision to send more troops to Iraq .
Even that measure , which does not carry the force of law , stalled in the Senate when Democrats could not overcome Republicans ' procedural roadblocks .
The slow pace has frustrated liberal activists and their allies in Congress who want Democratic leaders to make bolder moves against the war .
Today , a group of liberal House members will unveil a bill that would require the president to withdraw all troops from Iraq by Christmas -- a step that House leaders have not endorsed .
" We 're at a point where war becomes more familiar than peace , " said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich , a liberal Ohio Democrat who is running for president .
" This is really a pivotal moment for the Democrats , and for this country .
. . .
It 's almost as if we 're sleepwalking through the graveyard of history . "
The Democrats ' hurdles highlight the politically perilous nature of foreign policy debates whenever US troops are serving abroad , said Alan Wolfe , a political science professor at Boston College .
Republicans , eager to portray Democrats as undermining troops in harm 's way , have been virtually daring the party to cut off war funding .
" I can understand why some Democrats would be reluctant to do something politically , " Wolfe said .
" But it 's just a shame .
Our election indicated that the people want a change in direction . "
Democratic leaders have been trying to tamp down intra party divisions about the war .
Pointing out an explosion of bad headlines for the Republican - led White House -- including the scandal over the medical care provided to troops and the felony conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby -- they are urging rank - and - file Democrats to be patient while the GOP reels .
Party leaders contend that they are making the best of a tricky political circumstance .
Senate Democrats are planning to vote as soon as next week on a measure to reduce the US combat presence in Iraq by redefining the mission " in a more limited way , " said Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Levin conceded that his party , which controls 51 Senate seats , probably cannot gather the 60 votes it needs to pass the legislation .
But he added that even symbolic steps carry messages .
" This serves a very important purpose in any event , " Levin said .
" Not just moving the president , hopefully , with an expression of Congress , but also moving the Iraqi leaders to a recognition that [ having US forces in Iraq ] is not an open - ended commitment . "
In the House , antiwar Democrats are threatening to vote against the war - funding bill unless they first get to vote on a measure that would force an end to the war .
But some moderate Democrats say their party should not force them to take such a politically dangerous vote .
Representative Michael E. Capuano , a Somerville Democrat who is among those pressing for a vote to end the war , said he realizes that there is no realistic chance such a bill will succeed .
But he said he and his colleagues believe that the public deserves to see a legislative vote on the war , regardless of the outcome .
" This is the most important issue of the day , " Capuano said .
" I want a vote that makes me comfortable , that says , ' Get out . ' "
He said he is frustrated by the pace but realizes that Democratic leaders need time to build consensus on such a vexing issue .
" It 'll come .
It 's not coming fast enough for me , but it 's not an easy issue , " Capuano said .

The small , white anemones ( newly describes species ) , and also other animals characteristic of whale falls , including the " bone - eating zombie worm " called Osedax ( frilly red plumes on bone ) and scavenging crabs .
A new species of sea anemone has been found in the carcass of a whale that sunk to the ocean floor off the coast of Monterey , California , marking the first discovery of one of these filter - feeding marine animals living in a so - called whale fall .
Whale falls , the resting place of a dead whale , provide temporary but important nutrition boosts and habitats for deep - sea life .
The flesh of the dead whale decomposes within weeks , but the bones can last anywhere from 60 to 100 years as bacteria break down the bones , releasing sulfur that aquatic creatures use to make energy .
The anemone , called Anthosactis pearseae , is small , white and roughly cube - shaped .
It 's about the size of a human molar and even looks like a tooth with small tentacles on one side .
The anemone was named after Vicki Pearse , the University of California , Santa Cruz , naturalist who found and collected the anemone during a Pacific cruise taken by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute 's research vessel , Western Flyer .
Ten anemone specimens , including the newly named one , that she gathered were sent for identification and closer study to biologist Meg Daly , an anemone specialist at Ohio State University .
" These creatures were so cool simply because we knew that no sea anemone had ever been found on a whale fall , " Daly said in a prepared statement .
The new anemone species is distinctive for the uniform length of its tentacles , a characteristic shared by the seven species of sea anemones in the genus Anthosactis .
The anemone was collected , like all deep - sea animals , via a tedious process that involves underwater video cameras attached to remotely operated vehicles ( ROVs ) .
ROVs have robotic arms and suction devices that are used to collect ocean species .
Whale falls might seem like strange places for marine life to dine and dwell , but once carcasses fall , they are excellent food and real estate for sea creatures .
" A whale dies where it dies , and its carcass lands wherever , " Daly said .
" But these are actually some of the most stable deep sea communities . "
Heaven 's Vault I was midway through my second playthrough when I realized that Heaven ’s Vault was an order of magnitude deeper than I thought it was .
If there ’s one thing I ’d like you to take away from this review , that ’s it : there is more to this game than meets the eye .
And there is much that meets the eye .
There are layers upon layers here , and you will not discover them the first time you play .
I was midway through my second playthrough when I realized that Heaven ’s Vault was an order of magnitude deeper than I thought it was .

Masala Chai Custard
For complicated reasons I have been making a lot of custards lately .
A friend asked for the recipe , so I ’m typing it up here .
Custards fall broadly into two categories : stirred custards , and baked custards .
Baked custards are in some sense easier and more reliable , taking less attention but more equipment and fuss .
Because I ’m very very lazy , I prefer to make stirred custards , which require more focus while making them but use fewer dishes and equipment in the kitchen .

The Game Detective : The ' Marcus Aurelius ' Version of Star Trek
In the very first year of this weblog - 2004 - I published an article with the ( I thought ) Calvino - like title of I Giochi Inesistenti that described the strangest of Star Trek text games : a game which , at seemingly semi-random points , would emit long , wandering quotes from Marcus Aurelius ’ Meditations .
It was such a strange , mismatched thing that I was n’t entirely sure it existed .
I ’ve looked for this game on and off since that time .

Battletech Editorial note :
This review contains minor spoilers for BattleTech .
Pete and I are both nerds of a certain age , and BattleTech is one of those giant robot franchises that was formative for both of us .
( Although apparently Pete had waaaayyyy more of the novelizations than I did . )
I ’m a fan of what Harebrained Schemes has been doing lately ( the Shadowrun CRPGs are some of my favorite recent turn based CRPGs , even if they do have some warts ) , and I ’d seen demos of the new BattleTech game at PAX and online , so I was pretty excited for this one .

Rock of Ages 2
The core mode of ACE Team ’s Rock of Ages 2 : Bigger & Boulder plays like a delirious mix of Super Monkey Ball and Rampart , all presented within an animated and unapologetically full - throated Terry Gilliam audiovisual pastiche .
Per its own subtitle , the same could be said about the game ’s 2011 predecessor ; this sequel serves primarily to amp up the absurd audiovisuals for current - generation game systems .
This sequel also gently astonishes me with its existence in the first place .

The R Word Those of us who play video or computer games need to confront racism and sexism every time they are expressed in our community .
I have been playing games since I could barely walk .
I ’m not going to let racists or sexists define “ gamer ” as an identity .
Why is this your problem , as a gamer ?
Because the standard you walk past is the standard you accept .
It ’s more than Pewdiepie ’s slur on YouTube .

Yakuza Kiwami Sega has had an epiphany .
They have realized that what people want out of their Yakuza games is “ more ” .
More fights , more Kamurocho , more mini-games , more deadpan naivete from their trademark Mobster With A Heart Of Gold , Kazuma Kiryu .
And also more Yakuza games , period .
Explaining the Yakuza games is difficult .
To borrow a phrase from the late Douglas Adams , the Yakuza games are almost , but not quite , entirely unlike Grand Theft Auto .

West of Loathing
This review may have some very minor spoilers for the game West of Loathing .
It was sometime in the late 1990 ’s that my friend Zarf introduced me to Kingdom of Loathing , a humorous stick - figure MMORPG that you could play in a web browser .
Possessed of both a ridiculous amount of whimsy ( classes in the game included Pastamancer , Sauceror , Disco Bandit , and Accordion Thieves , among others ) it also had a surprisingly deep number of game systems .

Madness and the Minotaur - A Mystery Solved
One of the true pleasures of this weblog is to see gaming mysteries , occasionally , solved .
Today , I ’m happy to announce one of the oldest mysteries on this site – in this space dating back to 2004 – has been resolved .
This is the answer to the question “ Who , exactly , wrote the classic TRS - 80 game Madness and the Minotaur ? ”
The game , as I ’ve detailed elsewhere , has mystified and fascinated many of us old gamers .

Mahjong For People Who Don't Want To Think About It Too Much
A couple of people have asked me about the Mahjong minigame in Yakuza .
“ What is this ?
What is happening ?
Will it ever end ?
I AM CONFUSED , ” they say .
Do not worry , for I am here for you .
A lot of people have only ever discovered the western “ solitaire ” variant of Mahjong .
Real Mahjong is a 4 - player gambling game similar to Gin Rummy .
I ’m going to explain it to you so that you , too , can be a marginally terrible player like me .

Yakuza 0 - A Review
It ’s late afternoon in Sotenbori 1988 and Goro Majima , nightclub manager , exiled Yakuza , and hyperintelligent thug is drafting Japanese tax policy .
Earlier in the substory , he rescued a nameless bureaucrat from angry Osaka businessmen through weaponized breakdancing and his GOD MODE baseball bat .
The grateful functionary plied him with booze and asked for his opinion as a small businessman on Japan ’s soon to be proposed national sales tax .
They talk , and true to his criminal roots , Goro outlines a plan to gradually squeeze the populace with a rate of 8 % or higher , terrifying the guy with his plan to make the populace accept it by gradually jacking up the rate over decades .

Brief Thoughts on No Man's Sky There ’s been some Gamer Drama about No Man ’s Sky lately .
This game came out last week , and I picked it up and have been playing it a bit , and I think it ’s an interesting game .
Let ’s talk about it for a while .
First , let ’s dispense with the drama , which is the typical entitled gamer whinging .
There are two main lines of complaint : “ The game is not worth $ 60 and I ’m sad that I paid that ” and “ The publishers lied about what features would be in the game .

Stellaris
The things we want are not always the same as the things that we need .
What we want , in this case , is Stellaris , a strategic space conquest game that is epic in scope .

If you are a person who likes this sort of game - and by this point in the review , you already know if you are !

Victory and Glory : Napoleon
The great countries of Europe were pacified .
From my throne in Paris , I sat atop the Empire by the middle of 1807 .
Victory and Glory : Napoleon is a Windows game that is the first product of a successful kickstarter , and it ’s a little gem of a game .
Published by Slitherine / Matrix ( and not to be confused with the also - just - released Wars of Napoleon ) , it ’s a great take on the era and one that I found hard to stop thinking about , even after I had stepped away from my computer .

Madness and the Minotaur Many years ago I wrote a paean to an obscure text adventure called Madness and the Minotaur .
It ’s a strange game , for several reasons : Hardly anyone has heard of it .
It was on a comparatively unpopular platform , the TRS - 80 Color Computer .
It was brutally difficult .
Although solved today , I do not believe that anyone actually solved it in the 1980s .
It has real - time and randomized elements , both rare traits in the text adventure genre in 1981 .

Stardew Valley Stardew Valley is a Windows game that is a labor of love .
Designed and implemented by a single developer ( with the disarming moniker “ ConcernedApe ” ) , the game bills itself as “ an open - ended country - life RPG ” .
What does that mean ?
In practice , it means many of the game mechanics of Harvest Moon , combined with story beats from Earthbound and friendship mechanics from Animal Crossing .
The game is presented in 1990s - style pixel art graphics and chiptune - style music - it would look and sound right at home on a Super Nintendo system .

X - Com 2 : The Dark Souls of Strategy Games
This weekend I dove into many engrossing and painful hours with X - Com 2 , the sequel to the reboot of the venerable turn - based strategy game .
This game does not pussyfoot around .
It is hard .
There ’s a lot that one could say about the game and how it differs from its predecessor , but I ’m going to stick to the big picture .
The tactical game is massively improved from the first outing , adding more options and complications for both your soldiers and the enemies .

First Impressions : Dragon 's Dogma
We live in a world where the Internet has become the primary medium for arguing about things , all sorts of things .
Certain topics , among nerds , have always been contentious .
Star Wars vs. Star Trek. Mac vs. PC . Nintendo vs. Sega .
And , among a certain set , “ Western - style computer role - playing games ” ( usually “ CRPG ” ) vs “ Japanese - style computer role - playing games ” ( usually “ JRPG ” ) .
Personally , I ’ve never had a dog in this hunt : I am omniludorous .
Let a thousand flowers bloom ; if your game involves simulated fantasy combat in a vividly realized yet oddly constrained world , the chances are good that I will play it .

TIS - 100 p
Due to our long hiatus , Tea Leaves has never written about any of the Zachtronics games .
Since Zachtronics made these games solely for me , under the direction of the network of orbital mind - control lasers I employ , this is a tragedy .
Let ’s fix that now , and give a small signal boost to their latest release , TIS - 100 p , an assembly langauge programming game for iPad .
Although they might chafe at my typecasting of them , I ’m comfortable waving my hands and saying that Zachtronics makes puzzle games disguised as programming games .

The Music
One special note here before we begin .
The first act of La Traviata has an absolutely astounding velocity , in both dramatic and musical terms .
I ’m not prepared to call it unique , but it ’s certainly unusual in its incredible density of memorable music .
You ’re going to be exposed to tons of strong emotion and at ( at least ) three lyrical , hummable , embed - in - your - head tunes in a mere 30 minutes .

The archbishop was pretty sure that my fourth daughter , Aelfflaed , was The Devil .
It ’s kind of a long story - have a seat .
The wine ’s poor , I apologize - and here in Leinster , it costs a bloody fortune to have it imported from France , the damned merchants are laughing at me as they sail away , thinking how much I paid for it .

Astro-Physics : Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying
About the Meridian I ’m about a year into using my astronomical video camera to view deep - sky objects from the city and capture small and simple pictures of what I see .
All things considered the experience has been tremendous , but there was an obvious weak link : the mount that I bought does not track well .
This is not to say that the mount did not perform up to my expectations .
In fact , given the relatively small amount of money that I paid the mount has been excellent .

There ’s a particular cry that goes out on gaming forums whenever any sort of sequel is released .
The cry can be reduced to the phrase “ They dumbed it down ! ”
Deconstructing this , what it really means is “ They changed some difficult or unforgiving aspect of the game such that more people will want to play it . ”
It ’s the gamer version of “ Oh , that band was really awesome until they sold out .

Dark Souls Ate My Brain Dark
Souls ate my brain .
I do n’t understand how it happened .
I started December a normal , older , jaded gamer who has not seen anything worth playing in most of a year .
I ended it about half way through this game and already planning a second run to see if “ tuning ” my character build would make things better .
But here is the worst part .
If you write down what people say about this video game it reads like a set of requirements for building a game that I will hate .

Better than Real Today a trailer for a documentary film about a band I have never heard of reminded me of something I ’ve been meaning to write down .
Since the thought was too long to fit into twitter .

Skyrim : " Blackreach "
For the past year or so I have been bitching to my friends about how the free Oblivion mod “ Nehrim ” was more expansive , more epic , and generally more impressive than any game Bethesda had ever made .
In playing Skyrim , it ’s been clear that Bethesda has played Nehrim , and shamelessly stole their good ideas , which is something they should be proud of , because it made their game better .
Then , today , I reached the section of Skyrim called “ Blackreach ” .

One key to enjoying the telescope hobby is to know how to set up and tear down your equipment quickly .
This is especially true around Pittsburgh where the weather can change only instantly from perfect to disastrous .
Over the past couple of months I have developed a reasonably systematic routine in the deployment of the telescope .
With it I can set up my full video rig with automatic pointing and tracking in about 20 minutes .

Astronomy is an endeavor that is full of catalogs .
And I do n’t mean the ones that are on the Internet that are designed to separate you from your hard earned cash .
For much of its history , astronomers did little else than catalog what was in the sky .
Before the telescope , this meant just what you could see with your eyeballs : the brighter stars , the planets , the moon , sun , and their various activities and relationships .

Blue Streak
The bike computer that came with the new blue bike in July is reading 385 miles .
For some perspective , in the last few years , I doubt I ’ve ever had a six month season go by where I rode much more than 400 miles .
The six months that I had the Surly , according to the computer on that bike , I rode the thing 322 miles .
It ’s possible that I have an extra ( say ) 50 or 60 on that bike because the computer could have been broken or not installed .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Several analysts agreed Monday that New Century Financial Corp. , one of the nation 's largest subprime mortgage lenders , likely faces liquidation or bankruptcy following revelations that it 's under criminal investigation and in violation of debt covenants with several lenders .
" New Century is more likely to enter the death spiral we had feared , as filing delays , financial difficulties , likely restricted liquidity and regulatory / criminal investigations could conspire to limit its options outside of bankruptcy , " Merrill Lynch analysts wrote early Monday .
As troubles continue to roil the market for subprime mortgages , New Century NEW , - 4.30 % disclosed late Friday that it 's technically in default with several lenders and that federal regulators have begun an investigation .
See full story .
New Century 's shares were down more than 69 % at $ 4.53 in afternoon trades Monday , after dropping in Friday 's session as well .
Subprime mortgages are offered to homebuyers who fail to meet the strictest lending standards .
Lenders specializing in such loans , like New Century , rely in part on big banks to finance their operations .
Known as warehouse lenders , these institutions require that subprime lenders meet certain minimum financial targets or they otherwise have the right to end the business relationship .
Analysts at Jefferies & Co. also said the company has moved into worst - case scenario territory with its Friday filing .
They cut their rating on the shares to underperform from hold .
New Century said it had received waivers for being out of compliance with debt covenants from six of 11 lenders , but deals with others remain uncertain .
" New Century 's situation is not unlike the ' Prisoners Dilemma . '
If the majority of lenders stand pat , they can mitigate losses .
However , if they believe that other lenders will pull their lines , those first to act will be best served , " Jefferies analysts told clients .
The analysts said that while it 's possible New Century would get more waivers , " it is impossible for us to reasonably predict the behavior of more than a dozen different financial institutions . "
Analysts agreed that the chances of bankruptcy have increased as the firm 's shares fell sharply and passed what might have been seen as a reasonable liquidation value .
Bear Stearns analysts noted this in their Monday research report , saying that they reduced their estimated liquidation value to $ 8 to $ 9 a share , down from $ 10 to $ 11 previously .
They " expect the stock to trade toward this level as the odds of bankruptcy appear to have increased . "
At the same time , analysts noted the possibility that New Century shares could see some upside in Monday trading as there is a large short position -- shares that were borrowed and then sold in the hopes they could be bought back cheaper later -- but said the bias remained strongly to the downside .
Indeed , Morgan Stanley advised caution for those investors tempted to buy on weakness to " take into account the full spectrum of potential outcomes . "
Also Monday , analysts at JMP Securities downgraded New Century 's shares to market underperform from market perform .
The downgrade reflects a belief " the company is under severe liquidity pressure and that worsening industry conditions add to the risk that New Century 's financial condition is deteriorating , " they said .
' Downward spiral ' seen for mortgage lenders
Analysts at Stifel Nicolaus cut their ratings on shares of several mortgage lenders Monday as more bad news hit the troubled market for subprime mortgages .
Aside from New Century 's woes , the downgrade came as Fremont General Corp .'s FMT , stock plunged after the company said it plans to sell its subprime lending business after it received a proposed cease - and - desist order from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
Meanwhile , HSBC Holdings HBC , +0.48 % announced a huge charge on bad loans in the subprime sector .
After meetings with mortgage lenders and " several recent negative developments in the sector , we are taking a significantly more bearish stance on the subprime mortgage industry , " Stifel Nicolaus analysts wrote in a Monday note .
They downgraded shares of Accredited Home Lenders LEND , +0.41 % , NovaStar Financial Inc. NFI , +1.80 % and New Century to sell from hold .
" Specifically , despite valuations that are well below book value , we see increasing evidence that this industry is now in a downward spiral whereby each negative development fuels additional deterioration in key fundamentals including origination volume , pricing , credit -- and most importantly -- funding , " Stifel Nicolaus said .
Investors are nervous about the potential fallout in credit markets now that the housing bubble has popped and mortgage lenders are tightening their standards .
" With housing prices now falling nationwide ... and almost daily evidence that the industry stressed underwriting too far , just how high delinquencies and losses go is very much unknown at this point , largely due to increased prospects for falling housing prices , " the analysts wrote .
" As credit deteriorates further , we expect underwriting to tighten even more and secondary market demand to remain volatile , " they added .
When asked Monday about the potential fallout from the troubled subprime mortgage market , luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc.'s TOL , - 4.51 % chief financial officer said it 's not a big part of the company 's market , but that subprime jitters have " a big psychological impact " on homebuyers .
During a Web cast from an investment conference sponsored by Raymond James , Toll CFO Joel Rassman said negative headlines on the subprime market " make customers nervous " and added the housing market could feel significant impact in the next month , such as foreclosures and more speculators quitting the market .
Throw this one in the What the # $ %*?
file , it seems that Michigan House Democrats have passed an earmark that would provide every school aged child with an iPod :
Facing a budget deficit that has passed the $ 1 billion mark , House Democrats Thursday offered a spending plan that would buy a MP3 player or iPod for every school child in Michigan .
No cost estimate was attached to their hare - brained idea to “ invest ” in education .
Details , we are promised , will follow .
“ Tell mommy and daddy to vote Democrat , Johnny .
We bought you an iPod . ”
NTU has more :
They want taxpayers to pay for an iPod for every school child in the state .
Did you hear a record - scratching noise when you read that ?
Did your jaw drop to the floor ?
Did you explode with vulgar swear words ?
If you did n’t , let me repeat that one more time , this time I ’ll yell it …
THEY WANT TAXPAYERS TO PAY FOR AN IPOD FOR EVERY SCHOOL CHILD IN THE STATE !!!
Michigan , a state that already spends more than $ 10,000 per pupil to educate its children , wants to fund the extravagance of an iPod as well .
Because , you know , it would improve their , uhh , education … or something .
Knowing government inefficiency , they ’d probably spend an average of $ 1,000 a piece and only half the kids would get them .
The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to take what advocates are calling a historic vote this week to close the largest U.S. military training ground for soldiers from Central and South America .
The vote comes on the initiative of Congressman Jim McGovern ( D - MA ) , who has offered an amendment to the Foreign Operations and Appropriations Bill that would prevent any U.S. tax dollars from funding the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation .
The institute is better known as the School of the Americas , which was its official name until the year 2000 .
 Human rights abuses by graduates of the school have been widespread ,  argued Joao da Silva , communications coordinator for School of the Americas Watch , a grassroots group that raises awareness about the schools checkered past .
 They have engaged in torture and targeted killings of their enemies , and in this case the enemies were mostly trade unionists and human rights workers ,  da Silva said .
The School of the Americas was founded in 1946 , primarily to prevent communism from spreading in Central and South America .
During the 1970s and 1980s many right - wing military dictatorships came to power throughout Latin America ; many of their leaders had attended the school .
Among the School of the Americas more than 60,000 alumni are notorious dictators Manuel Noriega and Omar Torrijos of Panama , Leopoldo Galtieri and Roberto Viola of Argentina , Juan Velasco Alvarado of Peru , Guillermo Rodriguez of Ecuador , and Hugo Banzar Suarez of Bolivia .
According to School of the Americas Watch , graduates were also responsible for the El Mozote massacre of 900 civilians in El Salvador ; the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero ; and the massacre of 14 - year - old Celina Ramos , her mother Elba Ramos , and six Jesuit priests in El Salvador ; among hundreds of other human rights abuses .
Representatives of the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation , also known as WHINSEC , did not return phone calls by deadline .
 The School of the Americas is not very well known in the United States , but its very well known in Latin America ,  said Christy Thornton , director of the New York - based North American Congress on Latin America , which publishes a leading journal on Central and South American Affairs .
 The School of the Americas is for many a symbol of U.S. imperialism .
Closing it would help restore credibility to the U.S. in the eyes of the rest of the world ,  she added .
Thornton said the rise of anti-American left wing leaders like Venezuelas Hugo Chavez is in part a reaction against past U.S. support for authoritarian governments in the region .
In recent years , four countries have decided to withdraw their soldiers from WHINSEC .
In 2004 , Chavez stopped sending Venezuelan soldiers to the school , and last year Argentina and Uruguay announced they would end co-operation as well .
Last month , they were joined by Costa Rica , which does not have a standing army but had sent police officers there for training .
The countrys president , Oscar Arias , won the Nobel Peace Prize 20 years ago and has dedicated himself to international arms control .
Costa Ricas public safety minister Fernando Berrocal told Agance France Press that Arias made the decision with regard to  the most sacred principles of the countrys history . 
 We must understand that this decision does not in any way contradict our alliance with the United States in the struggle against crime and neither does it impede cooperation in security programs to professionalize our police ,  he said .
Opponents of the school are optimistic that their measure to close it will pass this year .
School of the Americas Watchs da Silva said the Democratic tide at U.S. polls last November could prove decisive .
 Thirty - five representatives who opposed this last year lost their seats in the November midterms ,  he noted .
Last year , a similar measure to close the school failed by 15 votes in the House of Representatives .
To cut off money for the school , measures would have to pass both the House of Representatives and Senate this year .

( Recasts to add details from news conference , comments by staff association and member countries , and background )
WASHINGTON , April 15 ( Reuters ) - World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz on Sunday dug in his heels over the promotion he approved for his girlfriend and said he intends to stay in his job , even as bank member governments voiced “ great concern ” the institution might not be able to function properly .
“ I believe in the mission of this organization and I believe that I can carry it out , ” Wolfowitz told a news conference shortly after the World Bank development committee issued a strongly - worded statement conveying unease .
The committee of aid ministers from around the globe said it was crucial the bank ’s credibility not be tarnished by the controversy over the high - paying promotion Wolfowitz agreed for his girlfriend , bank employee Shaha Riza , before she was assigned to work at the State Department .
“ The current situation is of great concern to all of us , ” the ministers said in a communique after the committee met .
“ We have to ensure that the bank can effectively carry out its mandate and maintain its credibility and reputation as well as motivation of the staff , ” the ministers said .
In a news conference shortly after those tough words , Wolfowitz said a decision on the matter should be left to the bank ’s board of member countries .
“ We need to work our way through this , ” he said .
“ The board is looking into the matter and we ’ll let them complete their work . ”
The former Pentagon No. 2 cited his accomplishments since taking the helm of the poverty - fighting lender in mid-2005 , pointing at several projects in Africa , where he has found his strongest backing .
But the bank staff association renewed a call for Wolfowitz to quit .
“ We do not see how he can possibly regain the trust of the staff , ” association chair Alison Cave said .
“ We do n’t see how he can regain the credibility that has been lost . ”
“ I do n’t think he fully understands how much this has damaged the organization , ” she said .
European countries , including Britain and Germany , were the most vocal in making a case that the scandal threatened to cripple the bank .
In an interview with Reuters , Dutch Development Minister Bert Koenders said he believed the row had put the bank into a crisis situation that needed to be resolved quickly .
“ It has become clear to us ... that there is also a lack of trust at the moment in the leadership and in the management .
So , that is something that has to be resolved , ” Koenders said .
Sources monitoring the closed meeting said several European nations touched on the issue , but did not call outright for Wolfowitz to step down .
MORAL AUTHORITY QUESTIONED
Staff and development activists accuse Wolfowitz of breaking bank rules in helping to arrange Riza ’s promotion .
They argue the institution ’s moral authority is in tatters , especially its authority to make countries who receive aid accountable for the money , a priority for Wolfowitz , who has ruffled feathers with a strong - arm anti-corruption push .
However , his backers in the White House have come to his defense and , like other World Bank members , have cautioned against judging Wolfowitz until the examination by the bank ’s board wraps up .
Still , the scandal has stirred up lingering antagonism over Wolfowitz ’s appointment to the bank by the Bush administration and bitterness over the prominent role he played in the U.S. decision to invade Iraq .
“ It ’s time for the board to show Wolfowitz the door , ” said Eric Gutierrez , international policy coordinator for ActionAid .
“ It is absolutely hypocritical for the World Bank to stand against corruption in poor countries when its president is embroiled in a corruption scandal . ”
Earlier , Wolfowitz had appealed to rich nations to deliver on aid promises and to keep the bank ’s coffers stocked so it can keep lending to needy countries .
But his appeal was clouded by the concerns many of the bank ’s major donors have on his leadership , prompting worries inside the bank that some of those nations could pull the plug on funding for the bank ’s program for the poorest countries .

A magician or street performer walking barefooted across broken glass is a dramatic spectacle .
If you have a close - up view , you can see the person 's feet pressing against the jagged edges .
Sometimes , you can even hear glass breaking underfoot .
It 's clearly dangerous , and some performers claim that it requires the utmost concentration or even mystical intervention .
It 's possible to fake a glass walk or to boost your chances of completing it without injury .
Breakaway glass , also known as sugar or candy glass , is an easy - to - shatter substitute for real glass .
When you see an actor break a bottle over someone 's head , the bottle is usually made from candy glass .
Broken edges can still be sharp , but the pieces are n't usually strong enough to pierce the sole of the foot .
However , some types of candy glass can become sticky or powdery during the walk , ruining the illusion .

You can also protect your feet instead of using fake glass .
One option is to use an adhesive like spirit gum to hold a flexible sole to the bottom of your foot .
Another is to use over - the - counter skin - toughening products to make your feet a little sturdier and less sensitive .
However , none of this is really necessary for an experienced performer .
Although it 's possible to be badly cut , there are physical factors that make it possible to walk on broken glass unharmed :
Many glass walkers use broken wine or champagne bottles .
Unlike broken bottle necks or drinking glasses , these pieces have a relatively gentle curve .
You 're not very likely to find a piece of glass with multiple sharp edges sticking straight up .
The bed of glass is usually thick .
When you step down , the pieces shift against each other , moving the edges away from your foot .
Some people use a slightly padded surface under the glass , adding a little extra give .
Glass walkers typically take slow steps , repositioning their feet if they feel very sharp points .
This gives the glass lots of time to settle and adds an extra measure of protection against punctures .
Tiny pieces of glass that are likely to embed themselves into the skin naturally sift to the bottom of the pile .

­­­If you 've ever stepped on a single piece of broken glass and hurt yourself , this might not sound like much protection .
But the surface involved in a glass walk is not like your kitchen floor .
In a glass walk , the weight of your body is spread out over lots of pieces , which have the freedom to move .
When you step on a single sliver of glass , your weight is concentrated over that one sharp point .
In addition , if you accidentally cut yourself on a piece of glass , the culprit is usually the movement of your skin along the sharp edge .
Walking on glass , on the other hand , requires you to put your feet straight down onto the edges , not to slide them around on the surface .
Even though glass walking is possible , it 's still a dangerous activity .
Do n't try it at home .

US Antigua Decision Is Slight To WTO
by Jeremy Hetherington - Gore , Tax - News.com , London
08 May 2007
The United States decision last week to withdraw from one of its WTO commitments after it finally lost its battle with Antigua and Barbuda over on - line gaming has evoked a storm of outrage and concern .
" We did not intend and do not intend to have gambling as part of our services agreement , " said Deputy US Trade Representative John K. Veroneau .
" What we are doing is just clarifying our commitments . "
The WTO treaty allows a country to withdraw commitments to open its services market to foreign investors , but since the treaty was originally negotiated multilaterally ( as with all WTO treaties ) the US will now have to negotiate with any of the other 149 member countries that objects to the move and wants to renegotiate any of their own commitments in return .
To call this opening Pandora 's box must surely be an understatement .
Adjectives used by commentators over the weekend to describe the US action included ' absurd ' and ' disingenuous ' .
Said one anonymous spokesman : " This action is more surprising to me than had President Bush announced he was coming out of the closet today regarding his sexual preference . "
" I am disappointed to see our country lead a degradation of the system , " said James Jochum , a partner at the law firm of Mayer , Brown , Rowe & Maw LLP in Washington and former Bush administration official .
Jochum represents the Antigua Online Gaming Association .
" The implications are so serious because of the precedent it sets . "
Senior officials in Antigua and Barbuda were taken aback by the decision .
" While we had of course been aware of the possibility of the United States taking such an action , we frankly considered it extremely unlikely , " said Dr Errol Cort , Antigua 's Minister for Finance and the Economy .
" It is almost incomprehensible that the United States would take such an action in the face of an adverse dispute resolution ruling .
This is going to have very severe consequences for the global free trade movement . "
Mark Mendel , Antigua 's lead counsel in the WTO proceedings , said that the US was wrong to say that it did n't intend to include gaming in its services commitments : " There is simply no basis for such a statement .
When the schedules were drawn up over ten years ago , there was extensive debate , proposal and counterproposal from all WTO members in determining what commitments would be made .
More than a dozen countries were able to expressly exclude gambling from their commitments , and many dozens more excluded the commitment in other ways .
For the United States to say this was a mistake is just not true . "
Actually , for the US to take this action at such a crucial moment in the WTO Doha Round negotiations is nothing short of tragic .
What does the USTR think will now be in the minds of its negotiating partners among the dozens of economically weak developing countries who rely on the rule of law to hold their own in the trading ring against such Titans as the United States and China ?
Charlie McCreevy , European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services , said recently that the US rules against processing of international on - line gaming transactions were a prima facie case of protectionism and that the World Trade Organisation was a possible venue for tackling them .
But he said that while negotiations were continuing over the WTO 's Doha Round , he would not rush to file a complaint .
" It 's not something of major momentum , " McCreevy said .
He told the the European Parliament : " In order to protect , I 'd say , their own business , their industry there , they have de facto prevented foreigners from online betting into the United States .
In my view it is probably a restrictive practice and we might take it up in another forum . "
McCreevy said he had not discussed the issue in any depth with Peter Mandelson , the EU trade commissioner , who would front any EU attempt to challenge the US legislation .
In its recent ruling against the US over Antigua 's complaint that the US was unlawfully banning payments to offshore gaming web - sites , a World Trade Organization Dispute Resolution Panel noted that the 2006 legislation ( which post - dated both Antigua 's original complaint and the first WTO ruling in its favour ) confirmed the lack of conformity of US law with its obligations under the GATS .
In its minutely argued report , the Panel comprehensively dismissed all attempts by the US to wriggle out of the need to bring its laws into conformity with the GATS , either by banning equivalent domestic betting transactions , or by allowing parity for overseas transactions .
The US passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in 2006 , which while expanding domestic opportunities for legal gaming , effectively bans all international and inter- state online gaming , by making it illegal for banks and credit card firms to make payments to such internet operations .
" Spinach might not seem to have anything to do with military operations .
But there it is , in an emergency supplemental bill to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan : $ 25 million for California spinach growers .
The war bill illustrates the axiom that guides the nation 's agricultural policy : namely , that any principles of good government , common sense and fiscal sanity must always be abandoned in the cause of shoveling federal dollars at American farmers .
Its $ 4 billion for disaster relief , together with millions for peanut storage , sugar - beet production and the Milk Income Loss Contract Program , is n't unusual , except for the fact that it was used to buy votes for a pullout from Iraq .
For House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , apparently , all geopolitics is local , and some of her members are happy to lose a war if they can win a subsidy . "

In a move that will affect around a quarter of all 16 to 18 year olds , education secretary has announced that the Department for Education and Skill intends to be frog marching all of them into compulsory education by 2013 .
Each year the government churns out statistics on how the number of pupils staying in full time education continues to increase and they all pat each other on the back about how it ’s a testament to their wonderful education system .
So what better way to bump the numbers up further than just making it compulsory ?
It ’s not going to hurt their unemployment figures either and next thing you know they ’ll be creating loads of pointless public sector jobs just so that they can make them look even better …
Oh , hang on …
If you happen to be the managing director of a fast food establishment or supermarket and are having visions of your profits swirling down the plug hole as the Government steals away your source of cheap labour , then please take a deep breath and relax , this could actually work out quite well for you .
You see , the plan does n’t necessarily involve keeping teenagers in the classroom until the ripe old age of 18 , they just have to remain in some form of training , be it school or workplace .
This will be sure to raise some interesting questions .
How will qualifications be awarded uniformly across all industries ?
Will future employers have any idea what these awards mean when interviewing a potential employee ?
And how many McDonald ’s gold stars will be equivalent to an A - Level ?
It ’s only a matter of time before ASDA gets a government grant for graciously “ allowing ” 16 to 18 year old to “ be trained ” on their premises .
If you already scoff at qualifications in “ Leisure & Tourism ” ( looking through holiday brochures ) or “ Media Studies ” ( watching telly ) then just wait until they award the first NVQ in “ Point of Sale Product Distribution And Presentation ” .

It could not take an extra drum revolution .
The locations of the integer and the fraction entry points could not be changed , since they were hardcoded into calling programs .
The exit must happen at the original time , to avoid costing an extra drum revolution in the calling program .
The new routine must use only ( a subset of ) the drum locations used by the original , since calling programs were free to use the remaining locations for their own purposes .
The most exhaustively - tested program that I know of still had a serious bug when it was released .
But this story has a happy ending .
One night circa 1960 a group of Pacific Union College undergraduate students was playing the UCLA Executive Game in the Data Processing Laboratory , when a member of one of the teams spotted an anomaly on his team 's balance sheet .
The numbers did n't add up .
In particular , the bottom line was not exactly the sum of the numbers it was supposed to be the total of .
It was off by one . [ 1 ]
Off - by - one errors are not uncommon in programming , but they generally do not show up as errors in arithmetic , particularly in integer arithmetic .
Suspicion first fell on the hardware , but running the hardware diagnostics did not reveal any faults , and the error proved to be quite repeatable for those inputs .
Next , the Executive Game program was suspected , but the relevant section of code was a single block add of the numbers , and it was hard to see how that could be wrong .
So , finally , attention fell on the binary - to - decimal conversions .
It was n't necessary to convert all the numbers by hand ( remember , this was before pocket calculators ) , since inspection of the program 's memory revealed that one of the binary numbers was odd and its corresponding decimal printout was even .
This should not happen when converting integers !
There must be something wrong with the Bendix - supplied conversion routine , and , sure enough , it failed a stand - alone test with that number as input .
At this point , we felt we had " scored " against Bendix , since the routine was used in hundreds of G - 15 installations .
However , it would be even more satisfying to tell Bendix what the error was , and better still to provide the fix .
And of course it was natural to wonder whether other integers were incorrectly converted , and if so , how many .
One of the students took up the challenge .
He had a binary number that did n't convert correctly , and the source code for the conversion routine , which was only a few dozen instructions of straight - line code , so he could step through it and check the results after each instruction against a hand calculation .
He found that the final multiplication -- to obtain the least - significant decimal digit -- left a fractional part that was very close to , but not quite , one .
Had it been just a little larger , there would have been a carry into the integer part , and the final digit of the converted number would have been correct .
Working backwards , he found that the initial division was not programmed for the 58 word times required to produce a full 28 - bit quotient .
Presumably , the original programmer wanted to speed up the routine and had reasoned that all 28 bits were n't needed , since 10^7 is less than 2^24 .
However , there were a few unfortunate bit patterns in the truncated quotient that could lead to that loss of a final carry [ 2 ] .
The smallest integer resulting in such a bit pattern had five digits , which is probably why no one had noticed the problem before .
The " obvious solution " was simply to extend the division to 58 word times .
This was tried immediately , and generated a correct result for the problem case .
Although this was strong evidence that the problem had been correctly diagnosed , it was not an acceptable fix for the routine , because it would have cost an extra drum revolution per call .
( The longer division would not be complete before the next instruction came off the drum . )
So something more clever would be needed , satisfying some difficult constraints :
Being another programmer who believed he could improve any program [ 3 ] , he set himself the challenge of meeting all these constraints , but always generating a correct conversion .
And he produced a program that , by his analysis , surely did so .
Testing : Presumably the original programmer had also convinced himself that the original routine was correct .
What if there were some other " corner case " that caused the new routine to fail ?
Before submitting the new routine to Bendix , it seemed prudent to test it stringently .
He devised the following test methodology : Write a loop that counted from 0 to 9,999,999 , both in binary and in BCD [ 4 ] , converted the binary to BCD , and compared the results .
This would take weeks to run , but should surely provide incontrovertible evidence of the correctness of the routine .
He set it up so that it could be run in chunks , whenever the machine was not otherwise occupied [ 5 ] .
Whenever someone needed the machine , they 'd log how far the test had gotten , and when the machine was free again , it would be restarted at that point .
After weeks of testing , the loop finally reached 9,999,999 without having encountered a single conversion error , and we were all convinced that the new routine was ready for the big time .
Submission :
The routine was carefully prepared on DPL ( rather than Bendix ) coding sheets , and everything was carefully documented , in the hopes that Bendix would distribute it unmodified to all G - 15 installations , enhancing the fame of the DPL .
And sure enough , shortly after submission , we received a copy of the distribution that went to all sites , and it was on our coding sheets .
We were all elated .
OOPS : Soon after Bendix 's distribution , the programmer received an urgent telephone call : " Were you aware that your new routine drops the sign of negative numbers ? "
( He was n't , but it did . )
Moral :
The most exhaustive test I 've ever witnessed failed to uncover a significant flaw .
Furthermore , had the 10,000,000 test cases been supplemented by any one of the other 9,999,999 values in the domain of the routine , the error would have been caught instantly .
In the spirit of one of Alan Perlis 's aphorisms [ 6 ] :
If you have ten million test cases , you probably missed one .
Applying even more cleverness , the student was able to produce a program that met all the constraints , and correctly converted both positive and negative integers .
But he did not attempt another exhaustive test before submitting it .
Notes : [ 1 ]
By focusing on the least - significant digit , he was probably calling his executive qualifications into question .
[ 2 ]
" Few " is of course relative here .
As I recall , it was only a few thousand values out of ten million .
[ 3 ]
This was not me , although I was surely just as cocky .
[ 4 ]
Since the BCD counting was just test harness , it could be optimized for simplicity and clarity , rather than speed or space , making it unlikely that it would fail in a fashion that correlated in any way with the conversion routine . [ 5 ]
Sort of like SETI@home [ 6 ]
" If you have a procedure with ten parameters , you probably missed some . "
The popular Internet photo site Flickr said that its service is being blocked in China , although the Yahoo subsidiary did not directly blame the Beijing government , which aggressively censors the Internet of material it deems subversive .
The blocking , which began Thursday , is keeping Internet users across a large part of China from viewing photos on Flickr , home to millions of snapshots of everything from birthday parties to beach vacations to nudes .
The Web site also hosts a smattering of images that may be frowned upon by Chinese censors , including student protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989 , which includes the famous photo of a man blocking the progress of Chinese army tanks , and bodies of students who were killed in the streets as part of a government crackdown .
China 's tight control over the Internet has become a high - profile issue in recent years as the online world makes increasing inroads with its vast population .
Authorities routinely block access to online information about political opposition groups , Taiwanese independence and overseas Web sites such as BBC News , prompting outrage from human rights advocates .

Yahoo have faced intense criticism for their positions , which have included censoring search results and providing information about dissidents to police .
In postings on its Web site Thursday , Flickr said it was experiencing no technical problems and that its service was in fact being blocked , without saying by whom .
In an update Friday , co-founder Stewart Butterfield wrote that the Web site 's staff is checking on the issue periodically and that the blocking continues .
" We hope that this is a temporary issue , and we currently believe that it will be , " he said in the posting .
" In the meantime , we are investigating our alternatives . "
Telephone and e-mail messages left with Butterfield and a Yahoo spokesman were not returned .
Users from across China posted messages on Flickr describing difficulties accessing images on the Web site , voicing frustration and laying blame on the Chinese government .
Access to the Flickr home page and comments area is still apparently possible in China .
Jain Hua Li , a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington , said he had n't heard of Flickr until told about it in a conversation with a Chronicle reporter , and then suggested that the blocking may be because Chinese authorities are trying to protect children from racy images .
Lucie Morillon , the U.S. representative for Reporters Without Borders , a French group that promotes free expression , said that the Beijing government often censors
Web sites under the guise of protecting children or national security .
She called the blocking of Flickr " one more blow against the free flow of information online by Chinese authorities " and added that it is particularly lamentable in light of promises by China to loosen restrictions before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .
How Not to Counter Terrorism Editor 's Note : Former FBI Special Agent Coleen Rowley and other members of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS ) have compiled the following memo examining the question of whether Bush administration policies have made Americans safer from the threat of terrorism since 9/11 .
Rowley gained national attention on June 6 , 2002 , when she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about pre-9/11 missteps and how the FBI could do a better job detecting and disrupting terrorism .
Time magazine had acquired ( not from Rowley ) a long letter she had written to FBI Director Robert Mueller listing lapses before 9/11 that helped explain the failure to prevent the attacks .
Five years after her testimony , her VIPS colleagues asked Rowley to evaluate what has been done and what needs to be done .
They also have contributed their own expertise to the memo :
Given the effort that many of us have put into suggestions for reform , how satisfying it would be , were we able to report that appropriate correctives have been introduced to make us safer .
But the bottom line is that the PR bromide to the effect that we are “ safer ” is incorrect .
We are not safer .
What follows will help explain why .

Printer friendly Wrong - headed actions and ideas had already taken root before that Senate hearing on June 6 , 2002 .
Post 9/11 dragnet - detentions of innocents , official tolerance of torture ( including abuse of U.S. citizens like John Walker Lindh ) , and panic - boosting color codes , had already been spawned from the mother of all slogans —
“ The Global War on Terror ” — rhetorically useful , substantively inane .
GWOT was about to spawn much worse .
Within a few hours of the Senate hearing five years ago , President George W. Bush reversed himself and made a surprise public announcement saying he would , after all , create a new Department of Homeland Security .
The announcement seemed timed to relegate to the “ in - other - news ” category the disturbing things reported to the Senate earlier that day about the mistakes made during the weeks prior to 9/11 .
More important , the president ’s decision itself was one of the most egregious examples of the doing - something - for - the - sake - of - appearing - to - be - doing - something - against - terrorism syndrome .
As anyone who has worked in the federal bureaucracy could immediately recognize , the creation of DHS was clearly a gross misstep on a purely pragmatic level .
It created chaos by throwing together 22 agencies with 180,000 workers — many of them in jobs vital to our nation ’s security , both at home and abroad .
It also enabled functionaries like the two Michaels — Brown and Chertoff — to immobilize key agencies like the previously well - run Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , leading to its feckless response to Hurricane Katrina .
Radical , Reckless Departures
There were so many other missteps , so much playing fast and loose with the law , that it is hard to know where to begin in critiquing the results .
One transcendent error was the eagerness of senior political appointees to exploit the “ 9/11 - Changed - Everything ” chestnut to prime people into believing that effective detection and disruption of terrorism required radical departures from rules governing our criminal justice and intelligence collection systems .
Departures from established law and policies were introduced quickly .
Many of the worst of these came to light only later — extraordinary rendition , “ black - site ” imprisonment , torture , and eavesdropping without a warrant .
( We now know that senior Justice Department officials strongly objected to the eavesdropping program . )
The first protests came from those most concerned with human rights and constitutional law .
But , by and large , the fear - laden populace “ did n’t get it . ”
The prevailing attitude seemed to be , “ Who cares ?
I want to be safe . ”
Everyone wants security .
But all too few recognize that security and liberty are basically flip sides of the same coin .
Just as there can be no meaningful liberty in a situation devoid of security , there can be no real security in a situation devoid of liberty .
It took a bit longer for pragmatists to observe and explain how the draconian steps departing from established law and policy — not to mention the knee - jerk collection and storing of virtually all available information on everyone — are not , for the most part , helping to improve the country ’s security .
The parallel with the introduction of officially sanctioned torture is instructive .
TV programs aside , many if not most Americans instinctively know there is something basically wrong with torture — that it is immoral as well as illegal and a violation of human rights .
Pragmatists ( experienced intelligence and law enforcement professionals , in particular ) oppose torture because it does not work and often is counterproductive .
Nevertheless , the president grabbed the headlines when he argued on Sept. 6 , 2006 that “ an alternative set of procedures ” ( already outlawed by the U.S. Army ) for interrogation is required to extract information from terrorists .
He then went on to intimidate a supine Congress into approving such procedures .
Virtually omitted from media coverage were the same - day remarks of the pragmatist chief of Army intelligence , Lt. Gen . John Kimmons , who conceded past “ transgressions and mistakes ” and made the Army ’s view quite clear : “ No good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices .
I think history tells us that .
I think the empirical evidence of the last five years , hard years , tells us that . ”
Who should enjoy more credibility in this area , Bush or Kimmons ?
The War on [ fill in the blank ]
“ War !
Huh ...
What is it good for ?
Absolutely nothing ! ”
This 1969 song lyric turns out to be even more applicable to Bush ’s “ global war on terror ” than to the Vietnam War .
As for “ The War on Drugs , ” that one was readily recognized as little more than a catchy metaphor helpful in arguing for budget increases .
But the use of our armed forces for war in Iraq was guaranteed to be self - defeating and to increase the terrorist threat .
--
Military weapons are inherently rough , crude tools .
Our rhetoric makes bombs and missiles out to be capable of “ surgical strikes , ” but such weapons also injure and kill innocent men , women , and children , taking us down to the same low level inhabited by terrorists who rationalize the killing or injuring of civilians for their cause .
Civilian casualties also serve to radicalize people and swell the terrorist ranks to the point where it becomes impossible for us to kill more terrorists than U.S. policy and actions create .
( In one of his leaked memos , former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld asked about that ; he should have paused long enough to listen to the answer . )
This inherent “ squaring of the error ” problem in applying military force in this context has been a boon to terrorist recruitment , and has spurred activity to the point of having actually quadrupled significant terrorist incidents worldwide .
--
Declaring “ war ” on the tactic of terrorism elevates to statehood what actually may be scattered , disorganized individuals , sympathizers , and small groups .
It empowers the terrorists as they add to their numbers and provides the status of statehood to what often should be regarded and treated as a rag - tag group of criminals .
--
There is , of course , political advantage for a “ war president ” to rally Americans around the flag , but the negatives of the axioms “ truth is the first casualty of war ” and “ all ’s fair in love and war ” far outweigh any positives .
Ultimately , the recklessness and cover - up mid-wifed by the “ fog of war ” ( everything from the friendly fire that killed Pat Tillman to the torture at Abu Ghraib and other atrocities ) just magnify the “ squaring the error ” effect .
Judiciousness — and just plain smarts — tend to be sacrificed for quick action .
--
Perhaps the most insidious blowback from war is that it weakens freedom and the rule of law inside the country waging it .
James Madison was typically prescient in warning of this : “ No nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare ; ” and “ If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land , it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy . ”
Fire Hose to Niagara to Tsunami Administration pressure on intelligence collection agencies , together with an extraordinary lack of professionalism and courage in the senior ranks of such agencies , have resulted in not only over - reaching the law , but over - collecting information .
Those on the front lines striving to prevent future attacks face the kind of pressure a soccer goalie would feel trying to keep the other team from scoring when his own team ’s offense is off playing in an adjacent field — as when President George W. Bush sent our offense to invade Iraq , the wrong country with negligible ties to terrorism .
Facing that kind of pressure , and lacking strong professional coaching , the defense can feel hopelessly outmatched , leading to still further mishap .
Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld spoke of the difficulty of getting a sip from the fire hose of intelligence being collected and flowing through the system .
The stream of intelligence before 9/11 was also described by others as gushing from a fire hose , rendering it hard to find the dots , much less connect them — making it impossible , for example , to find , translate , and disseminate until 9/12 a key 9/11 - related intercept acquired shortly before the attacks .
Compounding the problem is the FBI ’s unenviable record in acquiring computer technology to facilitate its work — witness the junking of a computerized records system two years ago after wasting $ 170 million on defense contractors hired to create the system .
But the fire hose soon became Niagara Falls .
FBI Director Robert Mueller set the tone early on as he kept telling Congress , “ The greatest threat is from al - Qaeda cells in the U.S. that we have not yet identified . ” ( sic ) Blindly following Mueller ’s White House - induced fixation with the “ greatest ” ( though not yet “ identified ” ) threat , the FBI diverted about half its agents and other resources from areas like violent crime to work on terrorism .
Small wonder , then , that tons of additional data have been collected as a result , for example , of the “ No - Tip - Will - Go - Uncovered ” policy and the hundreds of thousands of National Security Letter requests .
And who is surprised that most of that tonnage will never be evaluated ?
There is no denying that the threat from Al Qaeda has grown over the past five years , and today probably better fits the earlier inflated warnings of multiple terrorist cells already in place in the U.S.
Hard questions must be asked , however , when it appears as though collectors are being paid by the ream , while the drowning analysts go down for the third time .
Extraneous , irrelevant data clutter the system , making it even harder for analysts to make meaningful future connections .
A needle is hard enough to find in the proverbial haystack , without adding still more hay .
And once the extra hay is piled onto the stack — by adding still more names to the 40,000 - plus already on the “ no - fly list , ” for example — there does n’t seem to be any way of reducing it .
Ask Northfield ( Minnesota ) Police Chief Gary Smith and other law enforcement officers whose very common names have gotten onto this seemingly indelible list and who get stopped every time they try to fly .
Ghost of Poindexter Just when it appears this insanity cannot get any worse , here come still more dots .
Recent news reports indicate that the FBI — presumably having hired different contractors this time around — is compiling a massive computer database that will hold 6 billion records by 2012 .
This equals 20 separate “ records ” for each man , woman and child in the United States .
“ The universe of subjects will expand exponentially ” is the proud spin being put on this recycled version of the Pentagon ’s discredited “ Total Information Awareness ” program , which was launched after 9/11 with the goal of compiling records from a wide array of electronic transactions .
( The Big Brother project , which was put under the direction of Iran - Contra figure John Poindexter , was shelved , but not entirely scrapped , after encountering strong congressional resistance . )
Data - mining experts are not convinced this new program is worth the effort .
Since there are so few known terrorist patterns of behavior , one specialist has written that this kind of search would not only needlessly infringe on privacy and civil liberties , but also waste taxpayer dollars and misdirect still more time and energy by “ flood[ing ] the national security system with false positives — suspects who are truly innocent . ”
If this were not enough , we learn that the terrorist watch list compiled by the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center is out of control , having apparently swelled to include more than half a million names .
So instead of trying to get a sip from a fire hose , or from Niagara Falls , the data - mining challenge is going to be more like sipping from a tsunami .
The good news is that this predicament is creating unusual consensus among people concerned with human rights and those dealing with pragmatic law enforcement .
As one specialist on civil liberties observed recently , “ There 's a reason the FBI has a ' Ten Most Wanted ' list , right ?
We need to focus the government 's efforts on the greatest threats .
When the watch list grows to this level , it 's useless as an anti-terror tool . "
Quantity cannot substitute for quality .
Higher quality data collection depends not only on better guidance with respect to relevance , but also on judiciousness applied from the beginning and throughout the collection process .
Unfortunately , case and statutory law has come to be regarded as some kind of nicety — or a barrier that needs to be overcome .
Not so .
That law sets standards of relevancy for collection that used to hold down data clutter .
One might view the process of investigation , intelligence collection , increased intrusiveness , and erosion of liberties as a pyramid with the least intrusive actions and methods on the bottom of the pyramid entailing little or no interference with one ’s civil liberties .
As a suspect proceeds up the pyramid from being the target of an investigation , to temporary detention , interview , search , arrest , and finally subject to criminal charges and long - term incarceration , each higher level of intrusiveness should correspond to a greater amount of evidence .
What the “ war on terrorism ” has done , however , to a large extent , is simply invert this pyramid on its head , allowing long - term incarceration with little or no corresponding evidence .
In the past , general awareness that collected data could either become publicly known through criminal processes ( criminal discovery ) , or through a plain Freedom of Information / Privacy
Act request , built an extra degree of judiciousness into data collection .
Classifying all information about international terrorism secret , perpetually secret , which is the current practice , removes this natural safeguard .
Former FBI agent Mike German , whose life depended on government secrecy when he was working undercover in domestic terrorism investigations , has an acute understanding of the need for operational secrecy in undercover work .
At the same time , German has pointed to the pitfalls of secrecy where it is not essential , and has emphasized the importance of transparency within the government , even when conducting sensitive operations :
“ While my activities were covert during the operational phase of my undercover work , I knew from day one that I would have to be able to defend in court my actions .
This gave me extra incentive to do everything by the book , so as to avoid the kind of mistakes or over - reaching that could prejudice efforts to bring domestic terrorists to justice .
Operations designed with the understanding that they can remain forever secret do not require this kind of diligence and this can easily lead to abuse . ”
What About Emergencies ?
J. Edgar Hoover ’s vision during the early part of his 48 - year control of the FBI not only led to creating the fingerprint identification system , but also brought in highly professional agents who could then be trained and trusted to conduct their own investigations and law enforcement actions without unnecessary interference from superiors .
The FBI became the role model for law enforcement due to its insistence on high educational standards and continuing legal and professional training .
Thus , before the “ Miranda Rule ” became law as the protocol for conducting interrogations , the FBI had already voluntarily adopted and implemented such a procedure as part of its professional approach to interrogation .
At the same time , the law of criminal procedure , including search and seizure , interrogation , and the right to an attorney , need not be a barrier to effective investigation ( or to the prevention of crime or terrorist acts ) , because “ emergency exceptions ” have already been carved into that law .
So , for example , if an FBI agent finds him / herself outside a home with probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime exists inside and is being destroyed , that agent can legally conduct a search pursuant to the “ exigent circumstances ” exception in the law , without having to wait for a court warrant .
Similar emergency exceptions exist under the statutes for monitoring of wire and / or electronic communications .
This is one reason why it was difficult for us to understand why President Bush decided simply to ignore the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) in ordering warrantless surveillance that included U.S. citizens .
There is in that law an explicit exception allowing emergency monitoring up to 72 hours if , for example , a cell phone of an al - Qaeda operative were suddenly discovered .
For some reason the media have not done a good job of informing the American people about this exception .
Those of us who are aware of it have difficulty avoiding the conclusion that the president ’s decision to violate FISA means the surveillance program is so intrusive and all - encompassing that it could not bear scrutiny .
The program has already been ruled both unconstitutional and illegal by U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor but , despite that , continues in operation .
The FISA emergency exception is not hard to obtain ; it simply requires that the Attorney General approve .
That approval is what my colleagues in the Minneapolis field office desperately sought in mid-August 2001 so that they could search the personal effects and computer of Zacarias Moussaoui , who was already in the custody of our immigration service .
The approval was denied for reasons that make little sense .
Suffice it to point out a supreme irony here : because FBI headquarters personnel were reluctant , for whatever reason , to seek this emergency case - specific authority from the Attorney General and because the attacks of 9/11 were not thwarted , the net result was a presidential decision to ignore FISA altogether and institute a surveillance program in clear violation of the Fourth Amendment as well as FISA , as Judge Taylor has ruled .
A similar exception covering life - and - death situations allows law enforcement officers to dispense with the protection ordinarily afforded by Miranda warnings .
The way the so - called “ ticking - bomb scenario ” has been disingenuously used to justify torture makes one reluctant to mention a scenario in which something like it might apply .
However , unlike TV - glorified “ ticking - bomb torture , ” there have in fact been cases in which a kidnap victim ’s life was in serious , time - sensitive jeopardy .
One such kidnap victim was buried alive with limited oxygen supply .
In such cases , the normally required Miranda warning - protection can legally give way to the need to protect the life or lives hanging in the balance .
What often gets blurred here , sometimes deliberately by advocates of torture , is the significant difference between the issue of truly involuntary confession — one produced by torture , for example , and thus with no guarantee of reliability — and the much larger area that is protected by the prophylactic Miranda Rule .
Delegate Down Judicious application of any emergency exception , of course , must obtain in order to prevent such exceptions from swallowing the rule .
In the past , individual law enforcement officers have been trained and trusted to behave in such a way as to prevent that .
Some of us VIPS were trained to use deadly force under narrow “ emergency ” circumstances when an imminent threat existed to our lives or to other innocent victims and there was no reasonable alternative to stopping the imminent threat .
This delegation - down , this investing of trust in junior officers to exercise the enormous power of using lethal force under limited circumstances and after sufficient training , is necessary in order to protect their own and others ’ lives .
So , too , it can be argued that investigators and intelligence gatherers should be trained to spot the type of life - and - death circumstances that might allow them to conduct an emergency search without a warrant or to dispense with Miranda protections .
The existence under current law of these “ emergency exceptions ” means there is no need to paint over civil liberties with a broad brush from on high , in order to effectively detect and disrupt terrorism .
Despite the intense political and PR pressures , it is extremely unwise to allow the pendulum to swing in the reckless way it did post 9/11 : -- From ranking terrorism as the Justice Department ’s lowest priority in August 2001 to establishing it as the FBI ’s only real priority now .
( Despite the word games , anything that consumes half of the FBI ’s resources is its only real priority ) .
--
From ignoring specific instances where emergency action under the law ( FISA , for example ) was warranted to now simply ignoring long - standing law . --
From the failure to follow up promptly on specific , well predicated tips pre-9/11 to the “ No - Tip - Will - Go - Uncovered ” tsunami post 9/11 .

From training interrogators on the finer points of the Miranda Rule to training on torture techniques .
The bottom - line result of this pronounced pendulum swing is not only that our own constitutional and legal protections are jeopardized as seldom before , but also that — far from bringing any real benefit — these practices impede efforts to find and stop actual terrorists , and they lengthen the waiting lines at al - Qaeda recruiting centers .

Reports are starting to pile up of unhappy encounters with a new copy - protection system that Sony is baking into commercial DVD release and which renders certain discs useless on older DVD players .
Suspect titles include regular ( not Blu-ray ) releases of " Casino Royale , ' " Stranger Than Fiction " and " The Holiday , " all of which render nothing more than a brief title screen on certain DVD players ( including some Sony models ) .
DRM snoops say it's the return of ARccOS , a somewhat discredited anti-copying system Sony toyed with a year ago .
The technology was quickly subverted by makers of DVD - copying software , but is robust enough to flummox some DVD players made by RCA , Toshiba , Philips and others .
One irked customer was told by Sony that it's up to the manufacturers of the DVD players to update their firmware to accommodate the new DRM .

Internet giant Google has drawn up plans to compile psychological profiles of millions of web users by covertly monitoring the way they play online games .
The company thinks it can glean information about an individual 's preferences and personality type by tracking their online behaviour , which could then be sold to advertisers .
Details such as whether a person is more likely to be aggressive , hostile or dishonest could be obtained and stored for future use , it says .
The move is intended to customise adverts shown to players of online video games by tailoring them to specific tastes and interests .
But it has worried privacy campaigners , who said the implications of compiling and storing such detailed information were " alarming " .
Sue Charman of online campaign Open Rights Group said : " I can understand why they are interested in this , but I would be deeply disturbed by a company holding a psychological profile .
" Whenever you have large amounts of information it becomes attractive to people - we 've already seen the American federal government going to court over data from companies including Google . "
The plans are detailed in a patent filed by Google in Europe and the US last month .
It says people playing online role playing games such as Second Life and World of Warcraft would be particularly good to target , because they interact with other players and make decisions that probably reflect their behaviour in real life .
The patent says : " User dialogue ( eg from role playing games , simulation games , etc ) may be used to characterise the user ( eg literate , profane , blunt or polite , quiet etc ) .
Also , user play may be used to characterise the user ( eg cautious , risk - taker , aggressive , non-confrontational , stealthy , honest , cooperative , uncooperative , etc ) . "
The information could be used to make adverts that appear inside the game more " relevant to the user " , Google says .
Players who spend a lot of time exploring " may be interested in vacations , so the system may show ads for vacations " .
And those who spend more time talking to other characters will see adverts for mobile phones .
The patent says Google could also monitor people playing on any game console that hooks up to the internet , including the Sony PlayStation , Nintendo Wii and Microsoft 's Xbox .
It says information could be retrieved from previous game details saved on memory cards : " Such saved information may be thought of state information , and offers a valuable source of information to the advertisers . "
Not all the inferences made by monitoring user activity rely on subtle psychological clues , however .
" In a car racing game , after a user crashes his Honda Civic , an announcer could be used to advertise by saying ' if he had a Hummer , he would have gotten the better of that altercation ' , etc , " the patent says .
And : " If the user has been playing for over two hours continuously , the system may display ads for Pizza Hut , Coke , coffee . "
Some web companies already scan online activity such as internet searches and email for keywords in order to display adverts based on basic attributes and behaviours .
But the extensive profiles proposed in the patent go some way beyond existing examples .
It would be relatively straightforward to combine information sources to put names and addresses to the anonymous profiles , experts said .
When contacted by the Guardian , Google said it did not have any plans to roll out the technology in the near future , and that it was just one of a large number of patents that it has filed in recent months .
A spokesman said : " Google registers different patents irrespective of whether we actually intend to use them . "
The company , which has built its success on delivering adverts over the internet , spent $ 23 m ( £ 11.5 m ) this year acquiring a game advertising company called AdScape .
The move was seen as part of a broad expansion of its business into other media , including television and radio .
Although using the proposed profiling techniques would require games publishers to actively incorporate Google 's technology , industry experts said that games publishers are increasingly looking for new ways to make money .
" Publishers are becoming more like media companies , " said Justin Townsend , the chief executive of IGA , an in - game advertising company .
" More games are being optimised for advertising . "
But he said that privacy concerns should be paramount .
" Both consumers , publishers and the advertising industry are very aware of privacy issues , " he said .
" You can not afford to be vague in these areas . "
Booming market
Experts estimate that around $ 500 m ( £ 250 m ) will be spent on advertising inside games this year , rising to $ 2bn by 2010 .
While more straightforward games such as online poker are already hugely profitable , it is predicted that virtual three - dimensional worlds and role - playing games will soon be among the biggest moneyspinners on the net .
One of the biggest titles is the Lord of the Rings - style fantasy game World of Warcraft , which has more than 8 million subscribers worldwide who each pay around £ 9 per month to take part in the action .
Second Life , an online virtual community which mimics the real world , has more than 5 million registered users and 1.2 million regular visitors .
It is famous for allowing its residents to buy and sell virtual goods , or rent " land " inside the game for up to $ 300 per month .
A recent report by analysts Screen Digest suggests that the market for virtual worlds in the west already surpasses $ 1bn per year .
I 'm not sure what 's more bizarre -- the fact that this scientist found a new type of bacteria living inside mitochondria ( the cellular energy factories that themselves arose from bacteria ) , or the fact that he named them after George Lucas ' second - worst - idea - ever .
Lo ... wrote to scientists across Europe , Russia , North Africa , and the Middle East , asking them to send ticks for him to screen .
Sure enough , he found his bugs , nestled into the [ mitochondria of the ] ovaries of 100 % of female ticks .
Soon ,
Lo and his colleagues began looking for a name for their new genus , which proved easier said than done .
The morphology of the organism did n't present any immediate clues , and there were n't any eminent tick bacterium researchers in whose honor it could be named .
So Lo started surfing the Web , looking for ideas and finding nothing until one link took him to a page on the Wikipedia Web site describing midichlorians .
He discovered that George Lucas had invented these creatures while dreaming up his Star Wars movies .
The mysterious intracellular organisms apparently reside within the cells of almost all living things and communicate with the Force .
Coin Stacking School Project
Hi , I 'm Mitch Fincher and these pages are from a talk I gave while a Civil Engineering student at Texas Tech University .
The following is the basic pattern for building cantilevered structures with Pennies .
Although it looks trivial , we can build amazing structures with these pillars .
All penny columns are ten pennies high , a " stack " .
Two side - by - side pennies held in place by a penny above them is called a " triad " .
Below is a stack with two triads resting on top .
Now , I 'll show you how to build a simple bridge .
Duplicate the above structure and slide them together .
Carefully filling the space between with pennies , we create a one penny - span bridge .
Repeating the process by putting an extra triad on top of each stack , we can create a two penny - span bridge .
Although it looks weak , it will actually hold quite a bit of weight .
Remember no glue or adhesive is used ; only the compression weight of the pennies hold the structures together .
We can move on to a three penny - span bridge .
And finally to six and seven penny - span bridges .
These are highly effective study - avoidance mechanisms .
Click " Next " to move on to " The Big Tower " .
Submit your amazing coin stacking pictures .
Note :
All stacks of coins were done without any glue .
Only the weight of the coins provides the support .
Enjoy the pictures .
Coin Stacking is a fun hobby for kids , college students and adults .

Introduction
My objective was to provide comprehensive , safe , dynamic and Lisp-y access to Java and Java libraries as if they were Lisp libraries , for use in Lisp programs , i.e. with an emphasis on working in Lisp rather than in Java .
The approach I took was to embed a JVM instance in the Lisp process using JNI .
I was able to do this using LispWorks ' own FLI and no C ( or Java ! *) code , which is a tribute to the LW FLI .
On top of the JNI layer ( essentially a wrapper around the entire JNI API ) , I built this user - level API using Java Reflection .
This first version was built with , and contains code specific to , LispWorks .
jfli ( " jay fly " ) provides :
Automatic function generation for constructors , fields and methods , either by named class , or entire package ( sub ) trees given a jar file .
Java ->
Lisp package and name mapping with an eye towards lack of surprise , lack of conflict , and useful editor completion .
setf - able setter generation for fields as well as for methods that follow the JavaBeans property protocol .
Java array creation and aref - like access to Java arrays .
A ' new ' macro that allows for keyword - style field and property initialization .
Typed references to Java objects with an inheritance hierarchy on the Lisp side mirroring that on the Java side - allowing for Lisp methods specialized on Java class and interface types .
Implementation of arbitrary Java interfaces in Lisp , and callbacks from Java to Lisp via those interfaces .
(* this required a single 5 - line dummy Java proxy stub , provided with jfli )
Automatic lifetime maintenance of Lisp - referenced Java objects , boxing / unboxing of primitive args / returns , string conversions , Java exception handling , overload resolution etc .
jfli was built using LWM and LWW ( using Apple 's and Sun's JVMs respectively ) , and it works fine on both .
More recently ( 2007 ) it 's been tested extensively on LWL .
It should be a trivial port to other LispWorks , and a possible port to any Common Lisp with a robust FLI .
It should also work with any JVM with a conformant JNI implementation .
Download
jfli is hosted on SourceForge .
Setup and Configuration
jfli comprises : a small system of three Lisp files ( and an accompanying defsys file ) , a system building utility ( build- java - classes.lisp ) , and an optional Java . jar file .
The first Lisp file , jni.lisp , defines a low - level API to the Java Native Interface , and is not documented here .
The second , jfli.lisp , depends upon jni.lisp , and provides the user API documented here .
Finally process.lisp provides recyclable processes .
To get started :
( load " defsys.lisp " ) ( compile - system ' jfli : load t ) ( use - package : jfli ) prior to creating the JVM you must tell the library how to find the Java JNI library by setting * jni - lib - path * .
If you wish to allow for callbacks from Java to Lisp , you must place jfli .jar in your classpath when creating the JVM .

API Reference
JVM Creation and Initialization
* jni-lib - path *
Set this to point to your jvm dll prior to calling create - jvm . ( setf * jni-lib - path * " C:/ Program Files / Java / jre1.6.0_05/bin/client/jvm.dll " )
Function ( create - jvm &rest option - strings ) -> unspecified Creates / starts the JVM .
You must call this prior to calling any other jfli function , and you cannot subsequently make a further call to either create - jvm or connect - jvm ( a Java limitation ) .
The option strings can be used to control the JVM , especially the classpath : ( create - jvm " - Djava.class.path=/Lisp/jfli.jar " )
See the JNI documentation for other initialization options .
Function ( connect - jvm class - paths &optional option - strings ) -> unspecified Alternative , simpler interface to creating / starting the JVM .
class - paths is a list of pathnames ( to which jfli . jar will be added , and then each path will each be merged with the jfli source location ) .
The option strings can be used to control other aspects of the JVM .
You must call this prior to calling any other jfli function , and you cannot subsequently make a further call to either create - jvm or connect - jvm ( a Java limitation ) .
( connect- jvm '( " / Lisp/jfli.jar " ) )
See the JNI documentation for other initialization options .
Function ( enable - java - proxies ) -> unspecified Sets up the Java -> Lisp callback support .
Must be called ( once ) before any calls to new - proxy , and requires jfli . jar be in the classpath .
Wrapper Generation
Macro ( def- java- class full - class-name ) -> unspecified
Given the package - qualified , case - correct name of a Java class as a string , will generate wrapper functions for its public constructors , fields and methods .
The core API for generation interfaces to Java is the def - java - class macro .
This macro will , at expansion time , use Java reflection to find all of the public constructors , fields and methods of the given class and generate functions to access them .
The Generated API When you e.g. ( def- java-class " java.lang. ClassName " ) you get several symbols / functions : A package named | java.lang| ( note case )
from which the following are exported : A class - symbol : classname .
( note the dot is part of the name )
which can usually be used where a typename is required .
It also serves as the name of the Lisp typed reference class .
Every non-interface class with a public constructor will get ; A constructor , ( classname.new &rest args ) -> typed - reference , which returns a typed reference to the newly created object A method defined on make - new , ultimately calling classname.new , specialized on ( the value of ) the class - symbol Note that if the constructor is overloaded , there is just one function generated , which handles overload resolution .
The function documentation string describes the constructor signature (s ) from the Java perspective .
The same argument conversions are performed as are for fields ( see below ) .
All public fields will get a getter function :
( classname.fieldname [ instance ] ) -> field value
and a setter :
( setf classname. fieldname [ instance ] )
Instance field wrappers take a first arg which is the instance .
Static fields get a symbol - macro * classname.fieldname *
If the type of the field is primitive , the field value will be converted to a native Lisp value .
If it is a Java String , it will be converted to a Lisp string .
Otherwise , a generic reference to the Java object is returned .
Similarly , when setting , Lisp values will be accepted for primitives , Lisp strings for Strings , or ( generic or typed ) references for reference types .
Every public method will get a wrapper function :
( classname.methodname &rest args ) -> return - value
As with constructors , if a method is overloaded a single wrapper is created that handles overload resolution .
If a method follows the JavaBeans property protocol ( i.e. it is called getSomething or isSomething and there is a corresponding setSomething ) , then a ( setf classname.methodname ) will be defined that calls the latter .
The same argument and return value conversions are performed as are for fields .
The function documentation string describes the method signature (s ) from the Java perspective .
A Lisp class with the class - symbol as its name .
It will have as its superclasses other Lisp classes corresponding to the Java superclass / superinterfaces , some of which may be forward - referenced - classes .
An instance of this class will be returned by classname .
new / make - new / new , at which point the entire hierarchy will consist of finalized standard - classes .
Note that , due to the need to reference other Java types during the definition of a class wrapper , symbols , classes , and packages relating to those other types may also be created .
In all cases they will be created with names and packages as described above .
When you e.g. you get several symbols / functions : Function ( get - jar - classnames jar - file - name &rest packages ) -> list - of - strings Returns a list of class name strings .
Packages should be strings of the form " java / lang " for recursive lookup and " java /util / " ( note trailing slash ) for non-recursive .
Function ( dump - wrapper - defs - to - file filename classnames ) -> unspecified Given a list of classnames ( say from get - jar - classnames ) , writes calls to def - java - class to a file : ( dump-wrapper-defs-to- file " /lisp/java-lang.lisp " ( get-jar- classnames " / j2sdk1.4.2_01/jre/lib/rt.jar " " java/lang / " ) ) ( compile - file " / lisp/ java - lang " ) ( load " / lisp/ java - lang " ) ( use - package " java.lang " )
; Wrappers for all of java.lang are now available
Function Function ( cl- user : build - java - classes output - file &optional class - paths option - strings ) -> unspecified Macroexpands def - java - class forms to sufficient extent that the results can be compiled and loaded into an image which has not yet been connected to the JVM .
The utility connects to the JVM , generates source code and writes this to output - file which for example could be one of the members of your application 's system .
You can subsequently build that system in a fresh lisp , save the image and only connect that lisp to the JVM when the image is restarted .
This function is defined in the utility file build - java - classes .
lisp which is not part of the JFLI defsystem .
To use it to generate forms and write them to output - file :
Place your def - java - class forms in the file whose name is that of output - file with " .src " tagged onto the end Start a fresh image and load build - java - classes.lisp ( interpreted )
Call cl- user : build - java - classes ; class - paths and option - strings will be passed to connect - jvm
The utility does string searches for " ( def - java - class " and then calls read - from - string ; the rest of the file - comments , in - package forms , etc - is output as - is .
If you call build - java - classes again ( and you may ) , class - paths and option - strings will be ignored .
Note that loading build - java - classes .lisp loads the JFLI system and then redefines parts of it ; the consequences of using this image for any JFLI use other than calls to build - java - classes are undefined .

Object Creation
Generic Function ( make - new class - symbol &rest args ) -> typed - reference
Allows for definition of before / after methods on constructors .
Calls classname.new .
The new macro expands into a call to this .
Macro ( new class - spec &rest args ) -> typed - reference
class - spec -> class - name | ( class - name this - name )
class - name -> " package.qualified.ClassName " | classname .
args -> [ actual - arg ] * [ init-arg- spec ] *
init - arg - spec -> init-arg | ( init-arg )
init-arg -> : settable - field - or - method [ params ] * value ( note keyword )
| .method - name [ args ] * ( note leading dot )
Creates a new instance of class - name , by expanding into a call to the make - new generic function , then initializes it by setting fields or accessors and / or calling member functions .
If this - name is supplied , it will be bound to the newly - allocated object and available to the init-args : ( new ( button . this ) shell * SWT .
CENTER * ; the actual args : gettext " Call Lisp " ; a javabean property ( .addlistener * swt.selection * ; a method call ( new - proxy ( listener .
( handleevent ( event ) ( declare ( ignore event ) ) ( setf ( button. gettext this ) ; this is bound to new instance ( format nil " ~A ~A " ( lisp - implementation - type ) ( lisp - implementation - version ) ) ) nil ) ) ) ) . setsize 200 100 ; can omit parens ( .setlocation 40 40 ) ) Expands into : ( LET * ((#: G598 ( MAKE - NEW BUTTON .
SHELL * SWT.CENTER * ) ) ( THIS #: G598 ) ) ( SETF ( BUTTON.
GETTEXT #: G598 ) " Call Lisp " ) ( BUTTON .
ADDLISTENER #:G598 * SWT .
SELECTION * ( NEW - PROXY ( LISTENER .
( HANDLEEVENT ( EVENT ) ( DECLARE ( IGNORE EVENT ) ) ( SETF ( BUTTON.GETTEXT THIS ) ( FORMAT NIL " ~A ~A " ( LISP -IMPLEMENTATION - TYPE ) ( LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION ) ) ) NIL ) ) ) ) ( BUTTON .SETSIZE #:G598 200 100 ) ( BUTTON .SETLOCATION #:G598 40 40 ) #: G598 )
Array Support
Generic Function ( make - new - array type &rest dimensions ) -> reference to new array Generic function with methods defined for all Java class designators : A " package.qualified .ClassName " string ( the value of ) A class - symbol - classname .
A primitive designator keyword - : boolean| : byte| : char| : double| : float| : int| : long| : short Creates a Java array of the requested type with the requested dimensions .
Function ( jlength array ) -> integer
Like length , for Java arrays
Function ( jref array &rest subscripts ) -> reference Like aref , for Java arrays of non-primitive ( reference ) types , settable .
Function ( jref - xxx array &rest subscripts ) -> value Where xxx = boolean|byte|char|double|float|int|long|short .
Like jref , for Java arrays of primitive types , settable .
Proxies - Java calling back to Lisp
Proxies allow the creation of Java objects that implement one or more interfaces in Lisp , and thus callbacks from Java to Lisp .
You must call enable - java - proxies before using this proxy API .
A significant limitation is that LispWorks appears to not support calls back into Lisp other than from threads initiated by Lisp , so you must ensure that the proxy will not be called from an arbitrary Java thread !
Macro ( new - proxy &rest interface - defs ) -> reference interface - def -> ( interface - name method - defs + )
interface - name -> " package.qualified.ClassName " | classname .
( must name a Java interface type )
method - def -> ( method - name arg - defs* body )
arg - def -> arg - name | ( arg - name arg - type ) arg - type -> " package.qualified .
ClassName " | classname .
| : primitive
method - name -> symbol | string ( matched case - insensitively )
Creates , registers and returns a Java object that implements the supplied interfaces
Function ( unregister - proxy proxy ) -> unspecified Stops handling for the proxy ( which must have been created by new - proxy ) and removes references from the Lisp side .
Make sure it is no longer referenced from Java first !
Utilities
Function ( jeq obj1 obj2 ) -> boolean
Are the 2 java objects the same object ?
Note that this is not the same as Object.equals ( )
Function ( find - java - class class - sym - or - string ) -> reference to Java Class object Given a Java class designator , returns the Java Class object .
Use this in preference to Class. forName ( ) when using jfli .
Function ( make - typed - ref java - ref ) -> typed - reference Given a generic Java reference , determines the full type of the object and returns an instance of a typed reference wrapper .
classname.new / make - new/new always return typed references , but since Java methods might return Object or some interface type , and we do n't want to always incur the cost of type determination , field and method wrapper functions return generic references .
Use this function to create a typed reference corresponding to the full actual type of the object when desired .
Function ( box - xxx value ) -> reference to Java primitive wrapper class Where xxx = boolean|byte|char|double|float|int|long|short|string .
Given a compatible Lisp value , creates an instance of the corresponding Java primitive wrapper class , e.g. Integer .
This should rarely be needed , but can be used to force overloading resolution .
Function ( unbox - xxx ref ) ->
Lisp value
Where xxx = boolean|byte|char|double|float|int|long|short|string .
Given an instance of a Java primitive wrapper class , creates an instance of the corresponding compatible Lisp value .
This should rarely be needed , but can be used to unbox values returned by Java Object - based APIs .
Threading
This is one area of jfli which needs more attention .
The JNI call DetachCurrentThread has proved most problematic ( SEGVs in foriegn code , random corruption in Java internals and heaven only knows what else ) and so we need another solution to prevent used threads from " leaking " .
The solution proposed , to recycle lisp threads rather than letting them go , is implemented in the file process .
lisp which can be used as a standalone facility indepenently of the jfli .
Function ( mp:cached - process - run- function name keywords function &rest args ) -> mp:process
As for mp : process - run- function except that when the process terminates it is cached for later reuse ( by a subsequent call to mp:cached - process - run- function ) rather than dropped .
It is recommended that all threads which are going to communicate with the JVM should be created using mp : cached - process - run-function .
This applies in particular if your application uses lots of short - lived threads to talk to Java .
Error Handling
Condition
Type java - exception
An instance of this subtype of error will be signalled if an exception occurs in the JVM .
Function ( java - exception - exception java - exception ) -> reference Reader returning the Java exception whose occurance signalled java - exception .
Generic Function ( describe - exception java - exception ) -> string
This function is called when the java - exception is signalled to generate a text description of the exception which is then stored in the exception and used by its print - object method ( if * print - escape * is off ) .
In other words , this is how the exception princ s. A default method is defined on java - exception ; you might want to define others .
Summary
I hope you find jfli useful .
It is my sincere intent that it enhance the utility and interoperability of Common Lisp , a language with which I am still becoming familiar , and grow to appreciate more every day .
I welcome comments and code contributions .

Once a small , profitable and highly regarded family business , Florsheim , owned for the past 50 years by outside investors , succumbed to loads of debt , lackadaisical vision and outdated styling .
Florsheim , 110 years old , is survived by a slew of much hipper brands .
But if the famous old shoemaker was once on the verge of being shoved six feet under , how has it come to pass that Thomas Florsheim Jr. , 49 , a great - grandson of the company ’s founder , is touting Florsheim ’s new fall selection ?
As Mr. Florsheim strolls around his Manhattan hotel room — refitted to resemble a shoe store — he is in full pitchman mode , parsing the nuances of soles , lasts and uppers .
He ’s also contrite about Florsheim ’s failures .
“ Look , we know what people think when they think of us : they think of wing tips , the capped toe , the really brogue shoes and that we had gotten to a point where we were very stodgy , ” he says , fingering racks filled with the company ’s new line — some 80 percent of which , he says , has been overhauled over the last three years .
“ But we ’re moving the needle in terms of style . ”
Five years ago , when Apollo Management , then the majority owner of Florsheim , put the shoemaker into bankruptcy , the company was in shambles : most of its 200 retail stores were losing money , licensing deals with designers like Joseph Abboud had proved a bust , many of its factories were operating at well below capacity and its product pipeline was outdated and shoddy .
That ’s when the Florsheims — the family , not the company — did a bit of , well , sole searching .
Everyday experience and psychology research both indicate that paying close attention to one thing can keep you from noticing something else .
However , a new study from the University of Wisconsin - Madison suggests that attention does not have a fixed capacity - and that it can be improved by directed mental training , such as meditation .
Seeing and mentally processing something takes time and effort , says psychology and psychiatry professor Richard Davidson of the UW - Madison School of Medicine and Public Health and the Waisman Center .
Because a person has a finite amount of brainpower , paying close attention to one thing may mean the tradeoff of missing something that follows shortly thereafter .
For example , when two visual signals are shown a half - second apart , people miss the second one much of the time .
" The attention momentarily goes off - line , " Davidson says .
" Your attention gets stuck on the first target , then you miss the second one . "
This effect is called " attentional blink , " as when you blink your eyes , you are briefly unaware of visual signals .
But , he adds , the ability to occasionally catch the second signal suggests that this limitation is not strictly physical , but that it may be subject to some type of mental control .
Led by postdoctoral fellow Heleen Slagter , Davidson 's research group in the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior recruited subjects interested in meditation to study whether conscious mental training can affect attention .
" Meditation is a family of methods designed to facilitate regulation of emotion and attention , " says Davidson .
The new study , which appears online May 8 in the journal PLoS Biology , examined the effects of three months of intensive training in Vipassana meditation , which focuses on reducing mental distraction and improving sensory awareness .
Volunteers were asked to look for target numbers that were mixed into a series of distracting letters and quickly flashed on a screen .
As subjects performed the task , their brain activity was recorded with electrodes placed on the scalp .
In some cases , two target numbers appeared in the series less than one - half second apart - close enough to fall within the typical attentional blink window .
The research group found that three months of rigorous training in Vipassana meditation improved people 's ability to detect a second target within the half - second time window .
In addition , though the ability to see the first target did not change , the mental training reduced the amount of brain activity associated with seeing the first target .
" The decrease [ of brain activity associated with the first target ] strongly predicted the accuracy of their ability to detect the second target , " Davidson says .
The results of the study show that devoting fewer neural resources to the first target leaves enough left over to attend to another target that follows shortly after it , he says .
Because the subjects were not meditating during the test , their improvement suggests that prior training can cause lasting changes in how people allocate their mental resources .
" Their previous practice of meditation is influencing their performance on this task , " Davidson says .
" The conventional view is that attentional resources are limited .
This shows that attention capabilities can be enhanced through learning . "
The finding that attention is a flexible skill opens up many possibilities , says Davidson .
For example , he suggests , " Attention training is worth examining for disorders with attentional components , like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . "
“ Every now and then when your life gets complicated and the weasels start closing in , the only cure is to load up on heinous chemicals and then drive like a bastard from Hollywood to Las Vegas ... with the music at top volume and at least a pint of ether . ”
It probably wo n't be the biggest thing since AJAX , but I hit upon the idea of generating images client - side .
The current ways to do this seem to involve using tables or absolute - positioning of very small DIVs .
( See , for example , http://www.walterzorn.com/jsgraphics/jsgraphics_e.htm )
My technique , which I call ( forand ) , generates a gif - format image on the client side .
One application for this that comes immediately to mind is client - side generation of sparklines - type images , possibly from an AJAX source .
To make an image WxH pixels big , first create a properly sized array : var pixels = new Array ( W* H ) ; .
Then , for each pixel X , Y that should be opaque , store a 1 at the proper location : pixels [ X+ Y * W ] = 1 ; .
Finally , create the image : var my_glif = make_glif ( W , H , pixels [ , red , green , blue ] ) ; .
If they are specified , red , green and blue should be byte values from 0 to 255 .
If they are not specified , the foreground of the image will be black .
" 0 " pixels are transparent .
Now , you can specify this image as the SRC attribute of an IMG tag : document.write ( " < IMG SRC=\ " " + my_glif + " \ " > " ) ;
glif.js is the javascript source , glif.html is a small demo which draws a sine wave in an image , and sparglif.html and sparglif2.html are sparkline - type demos .
As a practical matter , my Firefox complains about how long the javascript runs at above 64x64 pixels .
Limits on the size of URLs will also start to hit somewhere around here .
Also , the GIF files I generate appear to be damaged in some way , because GIMP and MSIE refuse to load them .
On the other hand , Firefox and the ' xv' image viewer for Unix both load them without complaint .
I have n't tested in other browsers .
The generated images are monochrome , with one foreground color and one transparent color .
The created GIF file is bloated , because it 's created using libungif - style noncompression .
( mostly for easier coding , since the patent on LZW encoding has expired )

The new season of 24 , that is to air this coming weekend , is to prepare the American people for the idea of concentration camps , detention centers and the rounding up of people in times of crisis .
The opener depicts an America besieged by mass terrorist attacks and public paranoia , with 11 cities , including New York , Atlanta , San Antonio and L.A. , having been attacked in the space of a few weeks .
Watch it :
A Fox news broadcast pumps out on street corners and at bus stops from TV screens as the terrified public are urged to report anyone they consider suspicious .
A brown skinned man is refused entry onto a bus as the people around him look at him as if he is some kind of space alien .
Cut to the Oval Office were there is an argument going on between the National Security Advisor and the President 's aides about the morality and constitutional implications of using concentration camps / detention centers in America .
The National Security Advisor , who the President 's aides are surprised to find is opposed to this , states " These places that you keep building , they are nothing more than concentration camps . "
Note how the Security Advisor states that camps are already built and keep being built .
She goes on to state that a " revised plan " on behalf of the White House " justifies locking up every American who prays towards Mecca . "
As she continues to argue against locking up innocent Americans , the high ranking official played by Peter MacNicol ( perhaps the head of Homeland Security , it is unclear from the clip ) abruptly stops her and yells " security has its price . "
The aides , including the Attorney General then attempt to persuade the dubious President that in a " time of war " it is legal to suspend Habeas Corpus .
The second clip features a private conversation between the Security Advisor and MacNicol 's character in which he tells her that he has " second guessed " the President by not rescinding an earlier secret order for the National Guard to prepare to set up detention facilities at sports arenas in L.A. , Detroit and Philadelphia .
Watch it :
The Security Advisor questions " what happens when innocent people get caught up in this net ? "
To which MacNicol 's character states " Like I said before , security has its price , just get used to it . "
Although 24 has routinely depicted scenes of detainee torture , this latest plot - line is the first time that it has broached the issue of the detention of American citizens in a time of crisis .
At a time when legislation such as The Military Commissions
Act is setting the precedent for the detention of American citizens , 24 serves as the perfect dose of fear - mongering propaganda to get the people to accept such attacks upon the fabric of freedom and to " just get used to it " .
Thus when real attacks are carried out some will not be alarmed to see detention camps being used because they have already witnessed the scenario played out before their very eyes .
Laura Ingraham has previously stated that the average American 's love of the show is a referendum for such tough tactics against anyone considered to be with " Al Qaeda " whether they be American citizens or not .
Watch it :
Following the news first given wide attention by this website , that Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown and Root had been awarded a $ 385 million dollar contract by Homeland Security to construct the very detention and processing facilities referred to in this episode of 24 , the Alternet website put together an alarming report that collated all the latest information on plans to initiate internment of political subversives and Muslims after the next major terror attack in the U.S .
Yesterday we reported one such detention camp in Taylor Texas that currently holds hundreds of rebuffed asylum seekers who legally entered the country , half of which are children swept up in midnight raids .
These things are all over the country and are prime locations for the enforced transfer of American citizens during a time of national emergency .
Furthermore , one of the last acts of Congress before Christmas was to send President Bush a bill that establishes a $ 38 million program of National Park Service grants to preserve Japanese POW internment camps in Hawaii , California , Arizona , Arkansas , Colorado , Wyoming , Utah and Idaho .
WASHINGTON -- Thousands of Iraqis are fleeing the war in their country daily .
In the past seven months , the U.S. has admitted just 69 of them , including only one last month .
That dichotomy has set off the latest round of battling between the Bush administration and Democrats in Congress over the war .
With large and growing numbers of Iraqi refugees in Syria , Jordan and other countries , Democrats are pushing legislation to drastically increase the number of them given haven in the U.S. , including thousands of interpreters , drivers and others whose service has put their lives in jeopardy .
But the administration has yet to decide on a method to screen potential Iraqi refugees for possible terrorism ties .
The U.S. also lacks any facilities in Iraq or its environs to process immigration requests from Iraqis who worked for the U.S. embassy , military or contractors .
Even if the U.S. gets the procedures in place , the administration likely can accept only a few thousand Iraqis by the end of the fiscal year in September .
" The number of visas issued so far is less than paltry , " says Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D. , N.Y. ) .
" We 're talking about people who have risked their lives for us , who now have targets on their backs . "
Nearly a tenth of Iraq 's prewar population is estimated to have fled the country since 2003 .
Most have left over the past year as ethnic clashes and mass killings uprooted large areas of the country .
Boycott major corporations from April 14 - 22 :
“ By holding back on our spending with discipline and resolve and in sympathy for the millions who live in misery because of this administration ’s policies , we not only show our concern for the pain of others , we also put a little fear in the hearts of those who have profited from this travesty . ”

1 ) PLEDGE
“ I can not do everything ,
but I can do something .
My effort , along with the efforts of others , brings about change .
I pledge to take action now . ”
2 ) Spread the Word
Most people have no idea of what they can personally do to achieve impeachment and peace .
This action can be effective , but we need most everyone who is opposed to this adminbistration to take part .
To do that we have to spread the word far and wide , not just on the internet .
So take some time each day to write letters to the editor about the boycott , hand out flyers to family and friends , print out some posters or stickers and generally spread the word however you can .
Remember that there are over 150,000,000 people who want this situatiion dealt with , that many people spitting on the sidewalk at the same time is a powerful statement , that many people moving even of $ 1,000 dollars out of the system for the week equals … well do the math .
3 ) Move your money now
The first step in economic resistance is to take control of your money .
Take it away from the top predatory banks , the ones who make their profits from things you really do n’t want to know about .
Put that checking and savings account to good use in a local bank , savings and loan or credit union .
Start now , this may be the single most important step you can take !
4 ) Get out of the Market
Ok , so you have a nice portfolio of investments in Fortune 500 companies .
You are counting on selling high , just like everyone else , or you have just been running your investments on autopilot waiting for retirement .
Those investments are contributing in a big way to the mess we are in .
Move your money .
Dump those stocks now and reinvest in ethical companies or just cash out into Euros .
Think about it , if we hit the kind of participation we need the market will dump that week anyhow .
Save yourself some cash and strike a blow for Democracy .
Change your position ….now .
5 ) Free your mind … .
Kill the TV
The television is the primary tool the corporations and this administration use to control our behavior .
We like Coke ( the drinking kind , not the Bush party favor kind ) because we are familiar with it .
In reality it ’s just sugar water but it is sugar water made by a company that has become so enormous that they can’t turn around without breaking some little third world country .
There is blood in that Coke and in fact there is pain and suffering involved in the manufacture and sale of most large corporations products .
One rule of thumb is that if you see their ads on TV , they are too big .
If they spoend that money trying to influence you to buy their stuff then they also spend their money trying to get bills killed and laws passed to make it harder and harder for you to avoid their products .
Kill the TV , kill their access to your mind .
Of course you can still rent the DVDs of “ Desperate Housewives ” , it ’s the commercials and fake news we have to avoid .
6 ) Plan to Reduce your Oil and Gas Use
Look , we all know that the oil and energy companies have been profiting at our expense ( and at the expense of over 700,000 human lives ) since this war began .
So why have n’t we all realized that every dime we give to Exxon and their cronies goes to encouraging this kind of behavior ?
Now some people are going to shut the power off to their houses , bike and bus wherever they need to go and picket and flyer gas stations during the boycott week .
Others are just going to stay home , ride the bus or carpool .
Do what you can , just minimize the use of energy as best you can

Six weeks ago , President Bush paid a surprise visit to Iraq ’s prime minister , Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , in Baghdad .
American forces had just killed the terrorist leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
Iraq ’s Parliament had just confirmed new ministers to run the army and the police , completing what was billed as a national unity cabinet .
Mr. Maliki seized the occasion to announce a major military operation meant to bring security to the people of Baghdad .
Mr. Bush took one of his patented looks into the prime minister ’s eyes and found a worthy partner .
This week , as Mr. Maliki returns the visit , things feel very different .
It seems possible , in fact , that the two men ’s brief encounter in Baghdad might turn out to have been the last good moment of the American experience in Iraq .
Despite the elimination of Mr. Zarqawi and the new security drive , the daily carnage is increasing , especially in Baghdad and especially against civilians .
Last month , for the first time , the nationwide civilian death toll exceeded 100 people per day .
Despite the increased presence of Sunni Arabs in the new cabinet , the political and physical gulf between Sunnis and Shiites is wider then ever ; the flight of frightened families from religiously mixed neighborhoods is further cleaving the country in two .
And despite Mr. Maliki ’s assurances that sectarian armies would be disarmed and their members integrated into the ranks of the national army and the police , Shiite militias like the Mahdi Army and the Badr Brigades continue to rule the streets and kill Sunnis with impunity .
Would you want to be seen using a safe that looks like a dirty pair of briefs ?

Rice Omelet Mouse
When is a computer mouse not just a mouse ?
When it looks like a rice omelet that ’s ready to eat .
A new dish to me — a rice omelet is simple a rice - filled omelette drenched in ketchup .
Turn that concept into a mouse cover and you have yourself one hell of a strange and creepy peripheral
Carnivorous sponges , blind creepy - crawlies adorned with hairy antennae and ribbed worms are just some of the new characters recently found to inhabit the dark abysses of the Southern Ocean , an alien abode once thought devoid of such life .
Recent expeditions have uncloaked this polar region , finding nearly 600 organisms never described before and challenging some assumptions that deep - sea biodiversity is depressed .
The findings also suggest that all of Earth 's marine life originated in Antarctic waters .
Scientists had assumed that the deep sea of the South Pole would follow similar trends in biodiversity documented for the Arctic .
“ There are less species in the Arctic than around the equator , ” said one of the study scientists , Brigitte Ebbe , a taxonomist at the German Center for Marine Biodiversity Research .
“ People assumed that it would be the same if you went from the equator south , but it did n’t prove to be true at all . ”
The findings , reported this week in the journal Nature , provide a more accurate picture of creatures in the southern deep sea and shed light on the evolution of biodiversity in the deep ocean , including ancient colonization dating back 65 million years .
" The Antarctic deep sea is potentially the cradle of life of the global marine species , ” said lead author Angelika Brandt of the Zoological Institute and Zoological Museum at the University of Hamburg .
Deep dwellers Between 2002 and 2005 , an international team of scientists completed three research expeditions to the Weddell Sea aboard the German vessel Polarstern .
Part of the Southern Ocean , the Weddell Sea is bounded by an Antarctic bulge called Coats Land and the Antarctic Peninsula .
Ernest Shackleton 's Endurance was trapped and crushed by ice in this sea in 1915 .
( Shackleton and his entire crew survived .
Shackleton died in 1922 of a heart attack on a different Antarctic expedition ) .
Part of the ANDEEP ( Antarctic benthic deep - sea biodiversity ) project , the team collected biological samples from regions between about 2,000 and 21,000 feet below the surface of the Weddell Sea and nearby areas .
In addition to cataloging biodiversity , the scientists aimed to determine how species intermingled within and between the deep and shallower waters and whether continental - shelf organisms colonized the deep ocean or vice versa .
The Weddell Sea is part of a vast ocean current and a critical source of deep water and possibly a mode of transport to the rest of the Southern Ocean .
Some of the scientists ' findings indicate species originating in a single water domain did migrate to the Southern Ocean , and some even trekked across the globe and now inhabit the Arctic waters .
Many of the organisms have relatives in both the nearby shallower waters and even in other ocean basins .
Species finds included 674 species of isopods , a group of crustaceans , 80 percent of which were new to science .
Some of the isopods and marine worms spotted on the continental shelf sported clues of their deep - water past .
“ On the shelf , the animals have eyes because they can see .
There ’s light in the water .
In the deep sea you do n’t really need them , so many animals get rid of their eyes , ” Ebbe told LiveScience .
“ There were some [ species ] that are very closely related to eyeless isopods , and they are now living on the shelf .
So that ’s an indication they have moved upward , ” Ebbe said .
Water travel
Many species living in the deep abyss of the Weddell Sea showed strong links with other oceans , particularly organisms like amoeba that can disperse their larvae over long distances .
Poor dispersers — including some isopods , nematode worms and seed shrimps — stayed close to home in the Southern Ocean .
One particularly cosmopolitan group included the foraminifera , or tiny single - celled organisms covered with relatively decorative shells .
Genetic analyses showed that three foraminifera species ( Epistominella exigua , Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi and Oridorsalis umbonatus ) found in both the Weddell Sea and the Arctic Ocean , were nearly identical .
“ They literally found some of [ the foraminifera ] from pole to pole , which is really amazing , ” Ebbe said .
Time to diversify
In terms of the soaring biodiversity , the scientists suggest organisms in the Antarctic have been around for a long time , giving them time to diversify .
“ The Southern Ocean has been like it is pretty much for the last 40 million years , and it has been isolated , ” Ebbe said .
“ So the communities have had a long , long time to evolve .
In the Arctic , it is much different . ”
In the geologic past Antarctica belonged to a giant land mass called Gondwana that straddled the equator .
The land mass , which also included Africa , Australia , India and the tip of South America , started breaking apart more than 100 million years ago .
About 60 million years ago , Antarctica had drifted close to the South Pole , and oceans filled the gaps between Antarctica and Africa and India .
By 40 million years ago , the continent had become completely encircled by water , now called the Southern Ocean .
" What was once thought to be a featureless abyss is in fact a dynamic , variable and biologically rich environment , ” said a study team member Katrin Linse , a marine biologist with the British Antarctic Survey .
“ Finding this extraordinary treasure trove of marine life is our first step to understanding the complex relationships between the deep ocean and distribution of marine life , " she said .

Strange New Creatures Found in Antarctica
After decades of contention , New Zealand researchers have provided the first direct evidence that Polynesians sailed across thousands of miles of the Pacific Ocean to reach South America long before the arrival of the Spanish around AD 1500 .
Their proof ?
Chicken bones .
Using genetic analysis and radiocarbon dating of chicken bones found in Chile , the researchers showed that the fowl originated in Polynesia , not Europe as was previously believed , the researchers said Monday .
“ The Polynesian contact probably did n’t change the course of prehistory , but I think maybe it makes us recognize the ethnocentrism in our long - standing views of the prehistory of the New World , ” said archeologist Terry L. Jones of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo , who was not involved in the research .

“ The basic premise has always been that there was only one civilization capable of crossing the ocean and discovering the New World , ” he said .
The new findings , reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , indicate that “ the prehistory of the New World was probably a little bit more complicated than we thought in the past . ”
The possibility of contact between Polynesia and the New World has been a subject of contention since Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl ’s famous 1947 voyage aboard his crude raft Kon-Tiki .
Heyerdahl believed that an ancient , fair - haired race originating high in the Andes around Lake Titicaca sailed to the Pacific islands .
He attempted to prove his ideas by setting off on a trip from the west coast of South America on a raft based on Inca designs .

The 4,300 - mile trip from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands took 101 days , but subsequent trips were much faster once researchers learned how to steer the boats .
Despite Heyerdahl ’s demonstration , the idea that Polynesians could have routinely -- or even occasionally -- navigated across the Pacific was considered farfetched , primarily because of the lack of proof .
“ Scientists have not been willing to fully accept the idea ” of prehistoric contact between Polynesia and South America , Jones said , “ but it is hard to understand why . ”
The most convincing previous evidence of cultural contact was the presence of sweet potatoes -- a native American plant -- at archeological sites throughout Polynesia .

Most notably , sweet potatoes dating from about AD 1000 have been found on the Cook Islands .
Equally important , Jones noted , the name of the potato used throughout Polynesia is the same name given it by South Americans .
Heyerdahl ’s trip and the discovery of the sweet potatoes showed South Americans could have taken the sweet potato to the islands but did not demonstrate that the islanders could have come to South America .
The new findings show that definitively , said the senior author of the new report , archeologist Elizabeth A. Matisoo - Smith of the University of Auckland .
The chicken bones were recovered from a site called El Arenal - 1 in south - central Chile , about a mile and a half inland on the southern side of the Arauco Peninsula .
Thermoluminescent dating of ceramics from the site indicates it was occupied from AD 700 to 1390 .

Analysis of the bones was conducted by graduate student Alice A. Story in Matisoo - Smith ’s lab .
Matisoo - Smith said she did n’t expect much from the study because finding evidence of Polynesian contact would be like “ finding a needle in a haystack . ”
But radiocarbon dating showed the bones were about 622 years old .
Even with potential errors , they dated from AD 1321 to 1407 -- before Spaniards first trod the New World .
Genetic analysis of the chickens showed that they were identical to genetic sequences of chicken from that same time period in American Samoa and Tonga , both more than 5,000 miles from Chile .

The sequences were very similar to those of chickens from Hawaii , also about 5,000 miles distant , and Easter Island , about 2,500 miles away .
“ I was pretty excited when the dates came back as clearly pre-European , ” Matisoo - Smith said .
“ There were no questions .
The Europeans did n’t pick them up in Polynesia and bring them back ” to South America , she said .
Sailing into the wind from the islands to South America “ requires significant sailing technology and navigational skills , ” she said .
“ But if you look at the winds , leaving from Easter Island , you would actually land [ in South America ] around the area where El Arenal - 1 is located .
You could then make the return voyage further north . ”
Jones of Cal Poly is particularly pleased because the find supports his theory that Polynesians also landed in the Northern Hemisphere .
He and linguist Kathryn A. Klar of UC Berkeley have argued that the Chumash Indians of Southern California learned to build their sewn - plank canoes from the Polynesians , in part because the names of the ships are very similar in the two unrelated languages .

Composite bone fishhooks used by the Indians also closely resembled those used in Polynesia .
If we know they landed in Chile , he said , “ then why is it so difficult to imagine they could n’t have made it to Southern California from Hawaii ? ”

KOUROU , French Guiana ( Reuters ) - A heavy - lift Ariane - 5 rocket blasted off from French Guiana on Friday putting into orbit two telecommunications satellites , space officials said .
In this file photo an Ariane 5 rocket launcher takes off from the Kourou space center in French Guiana August 12 , 2006 .
REUTERS /ESA /CNS / Handout
The rocket was launched from Europe ’s space base in Kourou , on the northeast coast of South America , at 7.29 p.m. ( 2229
GMT ) .
High altitude winds meant the first launch attempt was scrapped on Thursday .
Billed by the Arianespace company as a cost effective launcher for large satellites , the rocket is capable of launching payloads of up to 10 metric tons .
This adds more than three tons of capacity compared with the previous generation Ariane - 5 in service since the mid-1990s .
Arianespace is 28 percent owned by European aerospace giant
EADS .
Twenty - seven minutes after launch , the rocket released into a preliminary orbit Astra 1L , a 4.5 metric ton satellite designed to provide direct - to - home broadcasting throughout Europe .
Martin Halliwell , SES Astra ’s satellite mission director , said : “ This satellite ’s main job is to consolidate our fleet ... it ’s an extremely important position for us , it allows us to transmit direct - to - home television to over 107 million homes . ”
Astra 1L , owned by Luxembourg - based SES Astra a division of SES Global , was built in the United States by Lockheed Martin Space Systems .
Five minutes later Galaxy 17 , designed to provide telecommunications throughout the United States for Washington - based operator Intelsat separated from the rocket .
“ Galaxy 17 will be located in the most coveted orbital neighborhood over the United States , ” Intelsat Vice President Kenneth Lee said .
Galaxy 17 weighed 4.1 metric tons and was built by Thales Alenia Space a joint venture company owned by France ’s Alcatel - Lucent and Finmeccanica .
Arianespace President Jean - Yves Le Gall said Friday ’s launch placed the largest mass ever for an Ariane rocket .
“ Flight after flight we are able to place more and more kilos ( in orbit ) .
We can hope to increase it by several hundred more kilos , but we are approaching our maximum capacity , ” Le Gall said .
The first launch of the Ariane - 5 heavy - lift rocket in December 2002 ended in failure when it exploded in flight due to a problem in its main engine .
Since then nine of the rockets have been successfully put into orbit .

One of the differences between Michael Moore 's forthcoming " SiCKO " and his previous films , he writes in the publicity materials , is that " there 's not one character or company to hate in SiCKO , " which I caught at a screening yesterday .
And indeed , most of the politicians appear as anonymous figures in suits , with price - tags indicating their contributions from the drug industry .
Billy Tauzin , predictably , takes a bit of a beating .
And so , less predictably , does Hillary Clinton .
Moore 's brief political history of American healthcare policy at first seems to lavish praise on Clinton , if with a satirical , and gendered , edge .
( She 's introduced as " Sassy...smart ...sexy . " )
But his conclusion is that she sold out .
After her defeat in the first Clinton term , he says , she fell silent on the issue .
And " for her silence , Hillary was rewarded .
And she has been the second - largest recipient in the Senate of healthcare industry contributions . "
The movie , which like most of his movies , is powerfully made , will probably drive some debate on the issue when it 's released at the end of this month .
It 's basically a commercial for Western Europe , with an over - the - top ode to Cuba tacked onto the end .
And Moore is n't personally in sympathy with any of the Democrats .
" They do n't seem to want to grapple with the real issue .
It 's very sad , " he says of the presidential candidates in the publicity package distributed at the screening .
" Even the well - intentioned people like John Edwards -- his plan seems to be to take our tax dollars and put them into the pockets of the private insurance industry . "
Moore , needless to say , is for single - payer .
A domain specific language is a language - oriented tool designed to solve a specific set of programming tasks .
Common traits are very close to the problem domain within which the language is intended to work , and operating at a very high level of abstraction .
In his article about DSLs , Martin Fowler classifies DSLs as either external or internal ( see link ) .
An external DSL is a programming language that is either compiledor interpreted .
An internal DSL is built within a general - purpose programming language .
Effectively , an internal DSL is a very high - level API to a general - purpose programming language .
This article is a story about how implementing an internal DSL for Ruby contributed to a PLANET ARGON development project .
The Problem
The goal of one of my recent PLANET ARGON development projects was to build a one - off content management system with Ruby on Rails that supports 18 languages and manages roughly one thousand image files .
Many of these files are pieces of professional photography , each one weighing in at well over 1MB .
Others are small , detailed pieces of line art bearing various national flags .
The only thing these files had in common was that they were not ready to be used in production directly .
Our application has an Image model .
It uses a file upload plugin that we wrote in - house to persist image data .
We had begun managing the image transformations with after_save hooks that used the RMagick image manipulation API inside of our model .
This would have worked well , but our requirements were continuously being adjusted .
Some images required 4 variations to be produced .
Others required two .
Some of them had to be uploaded to a third party bandwidth provider .
Sometimes we got the dimensions wrong .
At one point , we had written a batch script to upload these source images so the after_save hooks could reprocess the images .
Soon enough , the edge cases came and our callbacks became engorged with stacks of conditional statements .
As you may have guessed , this got old fast .
We needed a tool that would help us meet our client ’s needs in a sustainable manner .
The Solution
Related Sponsored Content The DevOps Engineer 's Guide to Kubernetes Configurations Best Practices
One day , our client posted another reference image and a set of instructions for how they created the image in PhotoShop , to our Basecamp .
I had had enough .
Thinking about a more elegant solution to solve the problem , I remembered when Jason Watkins had told me about his experience with a class of tools , called asset compilers , when he worked in the video game industry .
An asset compiler is a build system which transforms a set of media files into the media files needed for the final build of a video game .
I had recently been automating a lot of repetitive tasks with Rake ( Rake is a build system implemented in pure Ruby ) , so creating an asset compiler with Rake was very attractive .
If the duty of creating the production images could be delegated to an external tool , our application would not have to change whenever our client ’s requirements changed .
To sweeten the deal , this tool would allow us to rebuild the production images with a single command when requirements changed .
I had begun by using Jim Weirich's ( the author of Rake ) RDoc task library which is distributed with Rake as a template .
One usage pattern which Jim has established for Rake is a class which you instantiate with the appropriate options to describe the set of Rake tasks needed to automate your build .
For example , here is an example of how to use the RDoc task library in your Rakefile to build documentation for a Rails application , the plugins it uses and the Rails framework itself .
Rake :: RDocTask.new ( 'my_docs ' ) do |rdoc|
# configuration
rdoc.rdoc_dir = ' doc/my_docs '
rdoc.main = " doc/README_FOR_APP
"
rdoc.title = ' Comprehensive Documentation '
# app documentation
rdoc.rdoc_files.include('doc/README_FOR_APP ')
rdoc.rdoc_files.include('app/**/*.rb')
rdoc.rdoc_files.include('lib/**/*.rb')
# plugins documentation
rdoc.rdoc_files.include('vendor/plugins/*/lib/**/*.rb')
# framework documentation
# ...snip ...
end
Instantiating a Rake :: RDocTask object within your Rakefile as per this example will create Rake tasks to build , delete and rebuild your documentation .
The rdoc block parameter yielded by Rake :: RDocTask.new is actually the Rake :: RDocTask object which is being instantiated , and the options which is being instantiated , and rdoc ’s attributes are defined in Rake : : RDocTask by attr_accessors .
I began by extracting the code to build the production images from our Image model into a Rake task library .
After creating a working task library which operated similarly to the RDoc task library , my code looked something like this :
ImageTask.new :bronze_thumbnail do |t|
t.src_files = image_src ' images/*.jpg '
t.build_path = build ' greyscale_thumbnail '
t.remote_dirs << REMOTE_DIR[:greyscale_thumbnail ]
t.transformation do |img|
# apply bronze image effect
img = img.quantize 256 , Magick :: GRAYColorspace
img = img.colorize 0.25 , 0.25 , 0.25 , '# 706000 '
# crop to thumbnail size
...snip ...
end
end
And that code defined the following Rake tasks , as described by running rake -T :
rake assets:bronze_thumbnail:build #
Build the bronze_thumbnail files
rake assets:bronze_thumbnail:clobber # Remove bronze_thumbnail files
rake assets:bronze_thumbnail:rebuild #
Force a rebuild of the bronze_thumbnail files
rake assets : build # Build all assets
rake assets : clobber # Clobber all assets
rake assets : rebuild # Rebuild all assets
I realized how flexible my tool would be if the code describing these image transformations closely resembled the PhotoShop instructions given to us by our client – an internal DSL that defines
Rake tasks for image transformations .
I created some unit tests for my task library to ensure tasks were being created properly and begun some test - driven refactoring .
Because I was creating an internal DSL , which in my case is a Ruby API , the creation of the DSL could be purely test driven .
I began by replacing the example code in my unit test which instantiates the task library ’s classes with example code for my unimplemented DSL and revised it several times until I was satisfied .
define_image_transformation ' thumbnailize ' do
crop_to ' 62x62 ' , : north
end
define_image_transformation ' bronze ' do
greyscale
lighten
# r g b tint
tint 0.25 , 0.25 , 0.25 , '# 706000 '
end
image_task ' bronze_thumbnail ' do
from images ' images/*.jpg '
to build ' greyscale_thumbnail '
remote_dirs << REMOTE_DIR[:greyscale_thumbnail ]
transformation do
bronze
thumbnailize
end
end
I ran my unit tests and watched a raft of error messages float by .
This was good .
I now knew what I wanted , and what steps were necessary to achieve my goal .
I then renamed a couple of methods ( src became from , for example ) and created some helper methods to help instantiate the task library class .
I also wrapped the lower - level RMagick code with a a library that used designer - friendly method names and created define_image_transformation which defines high - level application - specific image transformations by aggregating those RMagick wrappers .
By making the distinction between what a graphics program like PhotoShop can do and what our client wants to do , I was able to ensure my tool would be fit for extraction and reuse across future projects – the high - level image transformations lived in my app ’s lib / tasks directory , but the lower - level wrappers lived in vendor / asset_compiler alongside thetask library .
The Outcome
Currently , our lib / tasks / assets .rake file contains 12 calls to image_task , including the example shown above .
Although the language may not be suitable for lay programmers ( according to Fowler ’s article , lay programmers are not professional programmers , but they can make use of simple programming tools to automate business tasks ) , it is in sync with our client ’s language and neatly models their ideas and goals .
Because Ruby DSLs are Ruby code , I strongly recommend following the test - driven process which I described in this article : code an example of the Ruby internal DSL you wish to use , write test cases for the desired outcome of that example and code until all tests are passing .
Also consider the scope of your DSL in the beginning .
Because I emphasized a separation between the functionality of an image transformation tool and the needs of our application , building a powerful , reusable and extensible framework around our DSL became natural .
I feel that this was the right decision because I know I am going to use this library again for other projects very soon .
If your needs are more particular you may not need multiple layers of abstraction .
If you intend to reuse your internal DSL , ensure that no application - specific business logic sneaks in , but provide a mechanism for capturing that business logic .
Finally , there is no canonical text on how you should create an internal DSL with any language .
The consensus between all articles I have read on the topic is that you must learn by doing .
Pay attention to how clients and domain experts communicate their requirements and focus on capturing those requirements with executable code .
Even if you ca n’t transform your domain expert into a lay programmer , they should be able to see their requirements clearly during a code review or a pair - programming session , and your goal should be to capture their requirements as quickly as you receive them .

Facebook NEW YORK  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who became an independent last week , showed his non-partisan colors Wednesday by criticizing both political parties .
Bloomberg , who left the GOP and is asked almost daily about running for president , said Wednesday that neither the Republican nor Democratic Party " stands for anything . "
" There is n't any philosophy " for either party , he said after a speech on improving public schools .
Bloomberg has repeatedly expressed frustration with Congress , saying lawmakers favor partisanship over progress and have failed to deal with immigration , health care or education .
" Party discipline requires you to make decisions based on what 's good for the party rather than what the merits are of the piece of legislation before you , " he said .
He became a Republican in 2000 to run for mayor .
Though his positions on abortion rights and immigration ( he favors both ) are not in tune with the GOP's , switching parties allowed him to avoid a crowded Democratic primary .
Wednesday , he was asked where he disagrees with the Democrats .
" I do n't think I disagree with what any national party stands for , because I do n't think that either national party stands for anything , " he said .
Party platforms exist only " to give ( the media ) something to write about in the middle of a boring convention , " he said .
Bloomberg persuaded the GOP to hold its 2004 convention here but got no takers for 2008 .
Democrats offer " a real vision for the future , " Democratic National Committee spokesman Luis Miranda said .
Since Democrats gained control this year , Congress has passed an increase in the minimum wage and an energy bill and imposed new ethics rules , he said .
Republican Party spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt would not comment .
Bloomberg attributed interest in him as a presidential candidate to " people 's dissatisfaction with gridlock and the way this country is going . "
He has said he wo n't run .

Americans have grown more concerned about the gap between rich and poor .
Support for the social safety net has grown too , while our military appetite has shrunk , according to a recent Pew survey of public opinion .
More Americans agree with the assessment that “ today it ’s really true that the rich just get richer while the poor get poorer . ”
Today , 73 % feel that way , up from 65 % five years ago .
It follows that more of us believe the government should take care of people who ca n’t take care of themselves .
Fifty - four percent of Americans say the government should help more needy people , even if it adds to the national debt , compared to just 41 percent in 1994 .
Just five years ago , 43 percent of of us identified as Republicans , and same for Democrats .
Now 35 percent identify as Republicans , and half the country as Democrats .
Also , racism and homophobia are both down .
More than 83 percent agree that “ it ’s all right for blacks and whites to date , ” up six percentage points since 2003 and 13 points from 10 years ago .
The number of people who believe that school boards should have the right to fire gay teachers is at 28 percent , down from 51 percent in 1987 .
The MoJo summary of all of the above : Americans are getting in touch with reality .
But the sad part may be that “ the public is losing confidence in itself . ”
The percent agreeing that Americans “ can always find a way to solve our problems ” has dropped 16 points in five years .
Americans feel more and more estranged from their government .
Barely a third would agree that “ most elected officials care what people like me think , ” a 10 - point drop since 2002 .
Saddest of all , young people , who have the rosiest view of government , are the least interested in voting or other political participation .
After reviewing Bringing Down the House here at PokerMoments and then hearing a movie is in the works based on the book , we thought we ’d like to chat with the writer , Ben Mezrich .
Little did we know what a great sense of humor this Harvard - educated storyteller has .
Here ’s my conversation with him …
Sparky : Congratulations on your movie , 21 , which is in the works !
How did that come about ?
Ben : Basically , it all started with a phone call I received from Kevin Spacey , right out of the blue .
This was two weeks before Bringing Down The House came out ; I ’d done an article for Wired magazine about the book , and Spacey read it .
He flew me out to LA , and basically told me he wanted to produce the movie , and maybe star in it as well .
We then sold the project to MGM ( ironically enough ) which then became a part of Sony .
So now it ’s a Sony / MGM picture starring Kevin Spacey .
Sparky : I really liked your title “ Bringing Down the House ” – why was n’t that used ?
Ben : Sadly , Queen Latifah stole my title .
Since there was already a BDTH movie , we had to change the name to ‘ 21 ‘ .
I like ‘ 21 ‘ too , because it ’s got that Risky Business , coming - of - age feel , which captures the energy I tried to put into the book .
Sparky :
Will you be in the movie ?
Ben : I hope to do a cameo .
I will definitely be on set for most of the filming , and am involved in most aspects of the production .
Sparky :
How about having a contest for a PokerMoments reader to get to be an extra in the movie ?
Ben :
Not a bad idea , but you ’d have to ask Sony about that .
The writer ranks right below the caterer in the heirarchies of Hollywood .
Sparky :
Or , have you thought about the central character , Kevin , needing a psychiatrist to talk to about his misgivings , a la Tony Soprano ?
I just happen to be a psychiatrist as my day job .
Ben : Luckily for Kevin , unlike in the book , in the movie he gets laid ; that ’s even better than psychiatry .
Sparky :
Have you stayed in contact with the people your characters are based on ?
Ben :
Yes , I ’m very good friends with the real Kevin Lewis ( his name is Jeff Ma , by the way , he no longer uses the fake name ) and the real Andrew Tay .
Sparky :
What was it like doing the research for BDTH ?
Ben :
One of the best experiences of my writing life .
I spent every weekend in Vegas for almost a year .
Sparky : Did you learn how to count cards ?
Ben : Poorly .
I am horrible at math .
I know how to do it , but do n’t have the patience to do it well .
Sparky : BDTH describes some high living .
After all your success with writing , and now the movie , how do you like spending your millions ?
Ben : I have to say , there have been some perks .
I ’ve been to the Playboy Mansion many times , and have partied in some of the coolest placest in the world .
I love to travel : especially Tokyo , London , New York , and Vegas .
However , I recently got married .
So all my millions have since been spent at Bed Bath & Beyond and Home Depot .
Sparky : Both BDTH and Ugly Americans deal with quasi-legal activities , and plenty of indulgent activities – women , drinking and drugs .
As a psychiatrist , I ’m curious if these topics just make for good writing , or did your research for these books allow you to play out some fantasies ?
Ben : Basically , I choose my book topics by where the research will take me .
I definitely lived out my fantasies by following the characters from BDTH , Ugly Americans , and Busting Vegas around places like Vegas , Tokyo , Monte Carlo , etc .
The truth is , I ’m actually a very neurotic , hermit - like individual , scared of my own shadow ; but when I set off to write a book , I become someone else .
I live the double lives that I write about .
I have my own boundaries that I draw ; for me , it ’s more of a voyeuristic thing than anything else .
I do n’t want to skydive naked , but I ’m perfectly happy watching a naked girl jump out of a plane .
Sparky :
What are your own favorite card games ?
Do you play poker ?
Online poker ?
Ben : I play in a regular poker game with a bunch of MIT kids ( including a few members of the MIT blackjack team ) .
I get my ass kicked almost every week .
I used to play online poker , but I have n’t in a while .
In Vegas , I am addicted to video poker .
And of course I love blackjack .
Sparky : You hosted The World Series of Blackjack .
Any tips for our gambling readers that you learned from the experts ?
Ben : Truthfully , the key to blackjack is money management .
Most people sit down at the tabel with too small a bankroll .
If you sit down at a ten dollar table , you need at least five hundred bucks on you .
And you need to know perfect Basic Strategy .
Otherwise , stay away from slot machines and especially the ATMS .
Sparky :
Who are your role models for writing ?
Did you study literature at Harvard ?
Ben : I did not study literature .
However , I ’ve always wanted to be a writer .
I worship James Ellroy and Ernest Hemingway .
I think Michael Crichton is a genius .
Sebastian Junger is a brilliant writer and a great guy .
Michael Lewis is another favorite .
Sparky :
Of the books you ’ve written , which is your favorite ?
Do you prefer fiction or non-fiction ?
Ben : I think Bringing Down the House is a classic story , and I was very fortunate to know those characters and get their lives onto paper .
Ugly Americans , in my opinion , is a really cool book .
Japan blows my mind .
One of my fiction books ,
The Carrier , that I wrote under the pen name Holden Scott , was probably my best writing , but nobody read it , and it sold like 500 copies , so there you go .
Sparky :
Have you gotten more story - tip offers to reveal the hidden side of other secret , dark worlds ?
Ben : I get about ten a week .
Some are pretty good , most are scary .
Sparky :
You ’ve also written under the pseudonym Holden Scott .
Why the secrecy ?
Ben : Basically , I was under contract for two more books under my real name , so to publish a project I wanted to publish , I needed a fake name .
So I chose my fantasy WASP name , which was Holden .
Sparky :
One of the other writers for PokerMoments , Suber , is also Jewish , and has written about the connection between Jews and poker .
He notes that there are a disproportionate number of Jews who are quite good professional poker plays .
Any thoughts as to the connection ?
Ben :
Well , I think poker is a very social game , and Jews are social by nature .
I also thing telling stories is a Jewish hobby ; and each hand of poker is essentially a story you tell , in an attempt to get everyone else at the table to believe .
I also think there is n’t as much of a stigma against gambling in the Jewish and asian communities , which is why many Jews and asians end up playing cards .
Sparky :
Any last thoughts ?
Ben : I ca n’t wait for the movie ; I think it ’s really going to capture the excitement of the story , and it will be very true to the MIT kids ’ experiences .
The director , Robert Luketic ( Legally Blond ) is awesome , and he ’s got a really good feel for the project .
And Spacey is going to be fantastic as Micky , the professor who trains the team .
Anyway , thanks for reading my stuff , and I ’ll keep writing more !
( Although I ’ll have to ponder the psychiatry / sex competition , you do have to be impressed with someone who can use semicolons in casual conversation ; thanks for a great interview , Ben ! - Sparky )

Nope , you ’re looking at a completely alien world : Titan .

During the flyby , its radar instrument captured this image using its radar instrument .
Smooth surfaces , like liquid are seen as black , while the textured regions are land .
While other bodies of liquid such as lakes have been seen on Titan before , nothing has had these kinds of features : channels , islands , bays , and other terrain you ’d see on Earth .
But instead of water , this liquid is probably a mixture of ethane and methane .
Since there are no brighter regions in the liquid regions of the image , scientists are assuming the ocean exceeds tens of metres deep .
The image is about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) by 270 kilometers ( 170 miles ) across .

And really creepy sex at that .
One of the lead religious right groups , the American Family Association , in addition to promoting a known hate group on its Web site ( a group that is lumped together with neo -Nazis and the Klan in a report compiled by the Southern Poverty Law Center ) , is now publishing on its site a list of what it calls " sexual orientations . "
The list is filthy , it 's the kind of thing we would never publish on this blog under any circumstance .
It 's not child safe by any means , and the AFA 's Web site should be banned by every child safety filter in the country ( please report their site if you know how to do so ) .
Basically , the AFA is flipping out that others groups in society , like gays and women and people with disabilities , will be included in the already - existing federal hate crimes law - a law that ALREADY covers the religious right .
Yes , the religious " special " right does n't want to share their special status under US law .
So what is their latest tactic ?
To declare that the word " sexual orientation " in the proposed hate crime amendment will include sex with animals , feces and corpses ( the following link is NOT work - safe - you can see their bizarre sex list here ) .
These people call themselves Christians .
They 're sick .
Do check out the filth they published on their Web site .
The religious right Republicans are simply obsessed with sex , obsessed with gays , obsessed with filth .
They are simply obsessed .
How To Become A Millionaire In 10 Steps Flat
Want to know how to become a millionaire ?
This story of the world ’s first virtual millionaire may be able to tell us something !
There ’s this woman who made a million dollars by creating a female avatar ( or online character ) in a video game called Second Life .
By building a business empire within the video game ’s alternative universe through real estate and arbitrage of virtual land , items and currencies , she amassed a fortune in the game ’s currency which could be converted into real life dollars .
This female entrepreneur leveraged a premium membership of $ 9.95 in the video game and turned it into a million dollars .
How sweet is that !
Here are some images depicting her avatar as well as her true identity ( her real name is Ailin Graef ) :
Image Sources : Idea City
It goes to show you , anybody can become a millionaire by doing something well .
Even mastering a video game .
That is one unusual way to make it big .
How about the more conventional avenues ?
Well there ’s some great advice out there on how to become a millionaire , mostly telling you that you need to save , invest your money wisely and let it cook for a while .
At the end of a few decades , you ’ll be rich with a million bucks .
That ’s all absolutely true , but I thought to provide some additional thoughts on this subject with the following commandments .
How To Become A Millionaire : 10 Mandates To Get To A Million
# 1 Start saving and investing early .
The younger you are , the greater your chance of making a million if you start saving and investing early !
The power of compounding is on your side .
To start , you can open an online brokerage account — some good ones are Zecco and TradeKing .
Tip :
If you ’re ready to invest , here ’s a full list of the If you ’re ready to invest , here ’s a full list of the best online stock brokers that I would highly recommend .
# 2 Know that any type of work or business can make you rich if it has a market .
Any line of work can potentially make you a millionaire if you ’re successful at it , and especially if you ’re really good at it .
Your skills , if they answer a strong demand , could be your ticket to big things .
Many of the wealthy are people who excel at what they do — whether it be in sports , entertainment , sales , real estate , business , art , engineering , writing .
# 3 Make some money by doing something you like to do .
If you enjoy what you do , the chances of you becoming great at your chosen area of work will increase .
It bears repeating that if you are in a marketable line of work or calling , you have the opportunity to rise to the top and conceivably make very good money .
As an example , check out these people who make money blogging .
Many folks start out with a hobby that they eventually turn into a business .
# 4 Enter the field you want to be in and find out what ’s marketable about it .
Strategically work towards the goal of breaking into a marketable career .
For example , you can start out in food preparation .
But then build your experience and learn the business as best as you can so that one day you may start something on your own .
# 5 Help yourself succeed with the following traits : positive mindset , can - do attitude , willingness to learn , knowledgeability , persistence , determination , passion and being action - oriented .
# 6 Be willing to make sacrifices and to reset priorities .
Stop spending , watch your budget and set aside some money .
Try to find some inspiration to help you through the financial challenges .
Look into other people ’s success stories and take encouragement from their own experiences .
# 7 Do n’t buy into the belief that you can get rich overnight .
The only way you can do so is by being lucky .
You can have a windfall fall on your lap tomorrow , but that would be lady fortune smiling upon you — a chance event .
Lotteries and casinos are obvious crap shoots .
If someone offers you the formula to get rich tomorrow with very little work all for a “ small ” fee , run away .
It ’s a scam .
# 8 Learn all you can about finance .
Do n’t invest blindly .
Read up on it , learn how other successful people have made it and do the research via books , the web , workshops , classes or seminars .
# 9 Learn all you can about business , if you want to become an entrepreneur .
Do n’t get into business blindly .
Learn how to run , operate and manage a business before you take on that risk .
There are many people with specific talents who entered into business and failed .
That ’s because it ’s not enough to be able to cultivate an idea or a skill , you ’ll also need to know something about business before starting one .
Either you have the head for business , or get a partner who does .
# 10 Know the rest of the wealth formula , realizing that making money is just the first step to success .
Make money : this is obvious .
You have to start somewhere , after all .
Grow your money : Your money has to work for you as well .
So learn how to make it grow .
Preserve it , keep it , protect it : this is one element often overlooked in conventional financial advice because it ’s not as exciting as the “ making ” and “ growing ” steps .
But this is a whole realm of finance you ’ll want to keep abreast of to be able to grasp the big picture .
Some topics on this cover trusts , estate planning , asset protection , insurance and other wealth preservation strategies .
A Couple of Last Points
You do n’t have to do everything yourself .
You can always hire others — reputable experts (! ) — to implement your plan .
But I ’d advice that you do n’t hire a professional without knowing about these subjects yourself .
You do n’t want someone else , no matter how much you trust them , to be in control of your finances .
In the end , you are the one who cares the most about your money and who wants to be that millionaire ; hence , you ’ll need to be your own financial boss .

The government , dietitians and health experts remind us constantly – you simply ca n’t get sick and die if you do n’t take the appropriate steps !
That means logging plenty of hours on the sofa , eating your fill of fast food , and engaging in risky behaviors .
But finding the motivation and discipline to get sick and die is n’t easy .
You ’re not a celebrity with a posse of trainers , chefs and surgeons – you ’re one of the millions of Americans desperate to experience your worst , look flabby and feel terrible .
You ’ve seen the news : tens of millions of Americans are already well on their way to getting sick and dying , yet you ’re left out in the cold .
What ’s their secret ?
How are you supposed to wade through the avalanche of information to find the absolute worst , sickest , most disgusting lifestyle possible ?
With a tight budget and busy schedule , I know that ’s not always easy – but it can be !
You may not be aware , but thousands of restaurants , stores and companies already offer convenient , inexpensive products and services that can help you get sick and die .
Why have n’t you heard about this before , you ask ?
Search no more .
Here in this series , for the first time , you ’ll get the real information you need , all in easy , clear terms .
In fact , you may be surprised at how little you actually have to change in order to get sick and die .
It ’s really not so hard .
No sacrifice .
No uncomfortable physical activity , because that would be stressful .
No strange pills or healthy supplements – only drugs approved by our government .
And of course , no deprivation or starvation .
I ’ve employed a team of researchers to find the absolute bottom - of - the - barrel , guaranteed - to - sicken recipes , tips and techniques for minimum health results .
No guesswork .
In fact , no work , period .
Here are five clicks to get you started on your way to getting sick and dying in no time !
Now before you say , “ Gosh , Mark , you must really love me ; I too want to get sick and die ! ” do n’t go giving me all the credit .
I ’m just telling you facts about food , fitness and health that everybody already follows !
It ’s not just chain restaurants .
Even our FDA , federal government and health organizations like the American Diabetes Association support drug use , soda and refined sweets “ in moderation ” .
But what I like most is that these leaders support a sensible , healthy weight range of 30 pounds per inch ( Awesome metrics , BMI !
It ’s genius , is it not ? ) .
This is just no - brainer stuff that you will discover you may already know about .
Is n’t it a relief to know you can get sick and die with little change to the standard American lifestyle ?
Obviously we are doing everything right , or we would not be getting sick and dying faster than most other nations !
You can help make us # 1 !
1 . Get your omega -3’s !
Everyone knows avocados are healthy .
Duh .
Eat them this way , though , and that pesky health issue is no longer a problem .
2 . Why take vitamins ?
They ’ve killed a few people who were gonna die anyway .
We recommend prescription drugs instead , because they ’ve killed millions !
No comparison , homeys !
Most Americans take several drugs daily – you do n’t want to be left out , do you ?
How else will you get sick and die right away ?
3 . Eat fish .
Everyone knows fish is great , but only if it ’s cooked like this .
Do n’t forget the tartar sauce !
4 . Do n’t stress your body out by exercising .
Exercise will make you live longer , and who wants that kind of pressure ?
Like we need that stress !
5 . Avoid fat , because it will actually give you energy and make you live longer .
( Jimmy covers this issue . )
The low - carbers are part of a conspiracy with one goal in mind : making sure you lose weight and live longer – and maybe even cure those mood swings !
Be sure to get a lot of sugar in your diet – The Man supports a minimum 6 servings of grain carbs a day and says it ’s great for 3 of them to be refined .
That guy knows what he is talking about – this is a completely effective way to get sick and die !
Next week , be sure to check out Part 2 of How to Get Sick and Die , when I ’ll be highlighting wonderful recipes to help you get sick and die !
Did you know meals like burritos , pizza , nachos , burgers and pasta are a sure - fire way to get sick and die ?
Yeah , neither did we , but how cool is that ?
You can eat all the regular American foods you know and love and still get sick and die in no time !

Right now , my kitchen is suffused with that vivid fragrance familiar to suburban homeowners everywhere , and to any apartment dwellers who have ever played inadvertent hosts to rodents — the smell of an animal corpse busily decomposing somewhere out of reach .
Judging by the strength and approximate location of the odor , I would say the deceased is under the porch and smaller than the neighbor ’s cat that once decided to expire there .
But I can also attest that I will not be the one to narrow matters of taxonomy and position any further .
Besides , when I step outdoors , I almost choke on the similarly sickly sweet aroma of weekend gardeners slathering their backyard plots with what seems like enough fertilizer for Nebraska , Iowa and the San Joaquin Valley combined .
It ’s everywhere in the air , all right , including as the metaphoric whiff of an ongoing global scandal , the spiking of pet food , and our food , with particles of a potentially toxic industrial chemical called melamine .
I spent the last several weeks experimenting , instrumenting my code , profiling performance , and optimizing .
By way of summary , here is a sequence of timing and Shark profiles at various stages examining animated graphs of two implicit equations which represent different balances between numeric calculations and rendering complexity .
Last night I wired up a Debug menu into GC4 to make comparisons easier .
Test Cases
ImplicitAnimation.gcf animates x2 + y2 + z2 + sin( nx ) + sin( ny ) + sin( nz ) = 1 .
ConcentricSpheresTest.gcf animates cos(n* sqrt ( x2 + y2 + z 2)=0 .
Baseline : Software Rendering .
Single Compute Thread ( 8.4s , 19s )
For a baseline , timing each animation using Graphing Calculator 's software renderer using a single CPU core , gives 8.4s and 19s , respectively .
The Shark profile looks like this , with most of the time spent calculating the equation , and more time rendering ConcentricSpheresTest .
OpenGL Hardware Rendering .
Single Compute Thread ( 7.7s , 25s )
Switching to ( single - threaded ) OpenGL rendering , the timings become 7.7s and 25s .
ConcentricSpheresTest actually slows down .
The profiles show that two cores are now active in parallel as OpenGL renders the scene in the main thread while the WorkQueueConsumer prepares the next frame .
Zooming into those pictures shows the main thread spending all of its time in OurSubmitTriangles / glDrawElements .
In the second case , the overhead of submitting a huge number of tiny triangles to the GPU , ( most of them occluded anyway ) , makes the animation slower despite the hardware accelerated rendering .
However , this is already faster than GC 3.5 , in which all computations were done in the main thread along with all rendering , cooperatively multi-tasked .
Using even a single preemptive thread for calculations allows them to run independently in parallel with drawing and processing user UI events , as seen above .
Single - threaded OpenGL. Multiple Compute Threads ( 2.2s , 12s )
After breaking the numeric part of the work into jobs which can be run in parallel , the timings become 2.2s and 12s .
The profiles now show a pronounced difference in character .
The rendering time dominates the second case .
The first case looks like the compute and rendering loads are similar .
( Important note : the scale on each profile image is different .
Comparisons are meaningful only within a single image .
Shark , unfortunately , does not provide a time " Scale Bar " on these views .
Is anyone on the Shark team reading ? )
In both cases , still , drawing serializes the work .
While one CPU core executing the main thread draws , all the other cores go idle waiting for the next thing to start .
Vertex Buffer Objects ( 2.1s , 12s )
Using vertex buffer objects changes the animation timing to 2.1s and 12s .
With VBOs enabled in Graphing Calculator , rendering is a two - step process where first , the arrays of vertex and normal vectors , triangles , and colors are submitted with a hint to cache them in VRAM .
The command to draw then needs submit only a reference to these buffers .
When spinning a static model , this is can be an enormous win , as all the data can stay in VRAM to which the GPU has fast access , and only a new rotation matrix need be sent each frame over the relatively slow connection between GPU and CPU .
In these tests , however , we are animating a still model which changes the vertex data each frame .
Multi-threaded OpenGL ( 1.9s , 11s )
Unfortunately , the implementation of glDeleteBuffers ( and all other glDelete * ) still blocks in all cases right now .
Your best workaround is to not delete the buffer object , but instead call glBufferData( size=0 ) to free the storage .
You 'll also need keep track of the used / free buffer object names yourself ( I assume you 're already doing this to avoid paying the same cost when calling glGen * ) .
Textures can be handled in the same way ( width=0 , height=0 , depth=0 ) .
Enabling multi- threaded OpenGL is easy , but that is just the first step .
Any glGet calls drain the MTGL pipeline and synchronize execution , eliminating the benefits of parallelism .
Communication between parallel threads of execution is very difficult to get right .
What it means for one thread to ask another thread about the ( changing ) OpenGL state when the relative order of operations between threads can vary is tricky , so the simplest approach to ensure correctness is to make all the communication one - way .
After avoiding calls to glGetError , glGenBuffer , and other state queries , Shark still showed the GC main thread stalling at gle FinishCommandBuffer waiting for MTGL to drain in numerous circumstances .
glDeleteBuffer was a spike in the profile .
On mac - opengl , Richard Schreyer advised :
These profiles now show a new thread , gleCmdProcessor .
Graphing Calculator makes all of its OpenGL calls from the main thread .
With single - threaded OpenGL , all the CPU work done by the OpenGL driver also occurs in the application main thread .
With multi- threaded OpenGL , GC's OpenGL calls made in main are queued into a command buffer which the gleCmdProcessor thread works through talking to the GPU .
In the first case above , gleCmdProcessor has relatively little work to do .
In the second case , it dominates the profile , and still blocks the WorkQueueConsumer threads from continuing on to the next step .
The problem is still that although GC can submit jobs to distribute the numeric work across all CPU cores , GC tries to render the last frame before submitting the jobs for the next frame .
This serializes the work leaving cores idle while one is working alone on the rendering .
Although MTGL can work in parallel , GC still must call glBufferData from the main thread to submit the model data , and that takes time .
Double Buffered Model Data ( 1.8s , 6.7s )
When GC finishes the numeric computation for one step , it saves those results away to prepare for starting the next step .
Only after the slider has been advanced and the next calculations begun does the main thread then submit those saved results to OpenGL to render .
The animation times are now 1.8s and 6.7s .
Now , the work done in main and gleCmdProcessor overlap the numeric work done on jobs in the WorkQueue .
The remaining areas in the first profile where the Work Queue threads are starved is due to the uneven complexity of the jobs the way GC chooses its data decomposition to parallelize the calculation .
While creating more , smaller jobs would even out the work load , that also increases overhead and duplication of effort .
In the second profile , the stall occurs because we only double - buffer the model data .
The numeric computation gets one frame ahead , then waits while the main thread uses glMapBuffer to submit the last frame 's model before it can save the newly computed model so that it can begin the next frame 's calculation .
We could use a circular buffer to get several frames ahead , but as we shall see in a moment , that ultimately wo n't help .
With this last step the GC user interface becomes unresponsive as MTGL can have commands for several seconds worth of frames buffered , and there is no way to kill them , or even to measure how many commands are buffered .
This behavior occurs in the second case where the workload is dominated by rendering , but not in the first which is compute - bound evaluating functions .
When moving a graph with the mouse , or even stopping an animation , one first sees up to several seconds of backlogged frames rendered before the 3D graph registers any feedback .
To make GC responsive , glFlush is inserted into the draw loop each frame to intentionally block and drain the MTGL command buffer so it does n't get more than a frame ahead .
After this , the final timings for today are 1.8s and 8.9s .
Threads !
This profile shows GC running with three windows open , one of which has two OpenGL contexts ( to illustrate a coordinate transformation with side by side views ) .
Each context gets its very own gleCmdProcessor thread in multi- threaded OpenGL .
However , as I have only one video card , they all must take turns talking to the same GPU to drain their command buffers .
We also see here , that regardless of how many windows or equations GC is drawing , it creates ( on this machine ) 8 WorkQueueConsumer threads to process the jobs constructed by all windows .
While one can create as many threads in software as one likes , the threads run on physical CPU cores .
When there are more threads running that cores to run them , the scheduler must swap threads in and out to give them all time , increasing overhead .
GC uses threads for two categories of work : to parallelize expensive operations across multiple CPU cores , and to improve user interface response time by avoiding any potentially lengthy tasks in the main thread which processes all user events .
Multi - threaded OpenGL aids enormously in the latter respect , keeping the main UI thread responsive , even in cases where MTGL does not otherwise speed up the actual rendering time .

A few years ago , I was helping a team transition to agile .
They were in pretty sad shape .
When I got there , they could n’t build their software .
Millions of lines of C++ code and every time we tried to build it , it failed .
I sat with two or three other developers and worked diligently on the build .
The team had about twenty people , and sure , they could ’ve worked on some other tasks , but really the build is the heartbeat of a project .
If you do n’t have that fundamental feedback mechanism in place , there ’s very little else that you can do that ’s productive .
In fact , most of things that you can do without the feedback of a build are counterproductive .
A friend of mine , who was coaching the customer team noticed that I was pretty much ignoring the rest of the developers and he asked what they should be doing .
I said “ send them home . ”
“ You ca n’t send fifteen people home ! ” he said .. and I knew what he was talking about .
The team was under pressure , and politically , it would ’ve been a nightmare .
At various levels of the organization the only reality that could be heard was “ these twenty developers are doing everything that they can to get past the build problem . ”
It took three days and three people to get the build going .
When we did , the rest of the developers started taking on tasks , and making progress , but I still regret the fact that the other developers had to appear busy during the process .
It would 've been better for all concerned if they went home .
Things like this fascinate me .
There are some ideas that you can communicate effectively in organizations and others that you can't .
In this case , there was clearly a manager who knew that twenty people could n't work on the build at once , and that there was nothing productive the other people could do .
But , the fact that he knew it did n't help .
I think that the real issue is the reporting hierarchy .
Do people at each level have the trust of the people they report to ?
If they do , the person closest to a problem can make a call and not be worried about people above second - guessing it based upon incomplete information .
It 's a tough thing to coordinate .
The further a person is from a problem , the more apt they are to think that they see a better solution than the people who are closer .
In many cases , it 's an illusion based on lack of information .
This is part of something that I sometimes call social signal loss ; it 's pervasive in human systems and I suspect that it implies that sometimes you can have too much transparency .

An online petition is calling for the BBC to offer Mr Goma a job
Watch the interview
Guy Goma was at the BBC for a job interview but a mix - up meant he was taken to a studio and asked on - air about the Apple vs Apple court case .
He was not offered the role as a data support cleanser but his TV appearance gained him worldwide attention .
He said equally " amazing things " could happen to the next owner of the shirt .
" This is the shirt I wore which nearly got me a job on the BBC , " he wrote on the 15 Minutes auction website , where it is being sold .
" I did n't get the job but I did become an overnight celebrity .
I 'm auctioning this shirt off so that someone else can be as lucky as I was .
" PS :
The shirt has been worn a couple of times ( to interviews ) , " he added .
The proceeds from the auction will be donated to Oxfam .
Online petition
Mr Goma , a graduate from the Congo , was interviewed on BBC News 24 in place of Guy Kewney , editor of Newswireless.net .
Mr Kewney had watched in horror in the reception area of BBC Television Centre as Mr Goma was introduced .
Mr Goma described his TV interview at the time as " very stressful " but said he would be prepared to return to the airwaves .
He said he was " happy to speak about any situation " but would insist upon " preparing myself " next time .
An online petition has been launched on Mr Goma 's official website to secure him a position at the BBC .
" We urge the BBC to give Guy the job he applied for , or a better one , " it reads .
By 1700 BST on Tuesday , more than 1,600 people had signed the petition .
The BBC promised to review its procedures when securing guests for its programmes to ensure the " genuine misunderstanding " did not occur again .

An Australian man pleaded guilty to breaking into eBay and a local bank to steal AU$ 42,000 ( about $ 34,000 ) , in a case that demonstrates the problem of account takeovers on the auction site .
Dov Tenenboim , 21 , of the Sydney suburb of North Bondi , stood accused of breaking into at least 90 different eBay seller accounts last year , mostly by guessing passwords .
Tenenboim frequently figured out the credentials by matching usernames to passwords , prosecutors said .
Other times he hacked into email accounts .
Following a familiar route , Tenenboim targeted users with highly favorable feedback ratings from their eBay peers .
Posting under the guise of a trusted user with an established account makes it easier to dupe buyers .
After hacking the accounts , Tenenboim used them to advertise non-existent iPods , according to the Sydney Morning Herald .
He also hacked into the Commonwealth Bank .
He pleaded guilty to two counts of making a false statement to obtain money , two counts of obtaining money by deception and four counts of committing an unauthorized computer function .
Tenenboim faces a maximum of 11 years in jail and fines of $ 9,900 .
Account takeovers have been a persistent problem on eBay .
Over the past several weeks , we 've observed hundreds of fraudulent auctions being offered by users with unblemished records .
Such hijackings are on the rise , according to a small but vocal group of eBay users , who also claim the breaches are the result of an unpatched security hole in the company 's defenses .
e Bay strongly denies such a hole and says the takeovers are the result of users having their log - in credentials snatched through lax passwords and phishing attacks .
Tenenboim 's methods appear consistent with such statements .
But eBay can't be let off the hook completely .
The company employs lax password requirements that , for instance , allow a user ID of james34231 and a password of james 34 .
( To be fair , Google Mail allowed the same combination , though the site warned it was only " fair . " )
What 's more , eBay , like the vast majority of online services , has no mechanism in place to allow account holders to log in using security keys that generate random numbers every minute or so .
Such devices would render most current password attack methods ineffective .
e Bay has said it is in the early stages of testing such a system for its PayPal users , and a spokeswoman says the key will also work on eBay . ®
There are several possibilities how to use ferret in RoR .
This post will show the easy way – using the acts_as_ferret plugin .
To show the syntax and code , I will use the same data objects as in the Full text search in ruby on rails 2 – MySQL
Installation
Ferret installation is easy
gem install ferret
will do the job .
In addition , it is necessary to install the acts_as_ferret plugin .
script / plugin install svn://projects.jkraemer.net/acts_as_ferret/tags/stable/acts_as_ferret
Setup
The most simple setup is
class Article > ActiveRecord :: Base acts_as_ferret end
This is enough to make the full text engine working .
Now you can test it in the Rails console
Article . find_by_contents ( " sybase " )
If you have a lot of data to be indexed , be patient with the first run .
It is slow , because the index needs to be built .
The acts_as_ferret with no argument indexes automatically all fields of the Article , including arrays of child objects .
This behaviour could be overwritten .
You can narrow the field set
# Index only id and body , not title acts_as_ferret : fields => [ ' id ' , ' body ' ]
Or you can widen the field set .
acts_as_ferret : fields => [ ' id ' , ' body ' , ' title ' , ' long_article ' ]
# Compute the article length def long_article self .
body .
length > 40 end
Note 1 : see usage of long_article in Query syntax below
Note 2 : once you change the structure of the index , you need to rebuild it .
The easiest way is to stop your application and delete the index / ~environment ~ / ~Indexed object~ folder .
It will be created automatically with the next search request .
Query syntax
Since ferret is a port of the lucene engine , it uses the same query syntax .
I will show only a few queries that you can use .
For details see Lucene documentation
# Search for pages with " sybase " keyword Article .
find_by_contents ( " sybase " ) # " sybase " and " replication " keywords Article .
find_by_contents ( " sybase replication " ) # " sybase " or " replication " Article .
find_by_contents ( " sybase OR replication " ) # short articles about sybase Article .
find_by_contents ( " long_article : ( false ) *: sybase " ) # articles containing similar words like " increase " # will return e.g. increasing Article .
find_by_contents ( " increase~ " )
Pagination
Ferret is fast , ferret is flexible , but … it is not an active record object , so you cannot use the pre-defined pagination .
You have to implement it on your own .
Here is how we did it in our project www.tamtami.com.
1. Create full text search function in the model
def self .
full_text_search ( q , options = { } ) return nil if q. nil ? or q== " " default_options = { : limit => 10 , : page => 1 } options = default_options .
merge options options [ : offset ] = options [ : limit ] * ( options [ : page ] . to_i - 1 ) results_ids = [ ] num = self .
ferret_index .
search_each ( " *:( #{q} ) " , { :num_docs => options [ : limit ] , : first_doc => options [ : offset ] } ) { |doc , score| results_ids << self .
ferret_index [ doc ] [ " id " ] } results = Article . find ( results_ids ) return [ num , results ] end
or more elegant , as proposed by Jens Kraemer
def self .
full_text_search ( q , options = { } ) return nil if q. nil ? or q== " " default_options = { : limit => 10 , : page => 1 } options = default_options .
merge options options [ : offset ] = options [ : limit ] * ( options .
delete ( : page ) . to_i - 1 ) results = Article . find_by_contents ( q , options ) return [ results .
total_hits , results ]
end
2. Create method that creates paginator in application.rb
def pages_for ( size , options = { } ) default_options = { : per_page => 10 } options = default_options .
merge options pages = Paginator .
new self , size , options [ : per_page ] , ( params [ : page ] || 1 ) pages end
3 . Perform the search in the controller
def search @query =params [ : query ] @total , @articles = Article . full_text_search ( @query , : page => ( params [ : page ] || 1 ) ) @pages = pages_for ( @total )
end
4 . Use it in the article view
... <%= pagination_links ( @pages , : params => { :query=>@query } ) %> ...
Final word
The ferret fulltext engine is fast , flexible , but needs more programming than MySQL full text index .
Boston , MA – There were more tense moments today after Boston Police were forced to blow up a suspicious looking man near a lamp post .
An alert city worker called in the man after noticing that he had been leaning against the lamp post for more than ten minutes .
Officer Charlie O'Hara of the bomb squad said , " We got a report of a man loitering in a high - traffic area with a bulky coat and a backpack .
We cleared the area , snuck up behind him , attached the explosives and detonated him . "
Police later learned the man , Evan Johnson , was waiting for his girlfriend , Cindy Collins , who was getting a cappuccino at a nearby Starbucks .
His backpack contained books and all that was under his coat was a " Wish you were beer " T - shirt .
Collins explained why Johnson was by the lamp post .
" There was a long line at Starbucks , and Evan wanted to smoke so he waited outside for me .
Next thing I know , I look up and I see police blowing him up .
I always told him that his down jacket made him look puffy . "

… some right - wing , right - to - life , so - called Christians can be ?
Have I mentioned that I have been a nurse for nearly 23 years ?
And that I worked 14 of those in a high - risk perinatal setting .
In a hospital with a Level 3 designation , providing high - tech , high - quality obstetric care .
Here is the entire text of the brief piece , which CNN got from the AP .
And I ’m sure they paid the royalties to them , too .
MINNEAPOLIS , Minnesota ( AP ) —
Half of the sextuplets born prematurely to a Minnesota couple have now died , while the others remained in critical condition , hospital officials said Saturday .
A third boy , Lincoln Sean Morrison , died Friday .
Two of his brothers , Tryg and Bennet , died earlier in the week .
The four boys and two girls were born last Sunday about 4 ½ months early at a Minneapolis hospital .
Doctors had advised the couple to selectively reduce the number of viable fetuses to two , but they declined .
Parents Ryan and Brianna Morrison released a statement saying it has been “ a difficult week ” for them , and they thanked everyone for their prayers and support .
“ We continue to trust in the Lord and are hopeful for a good outcome for Cadence , Lucia and Sylas , ” the statement said .
Hospital officials said no further information would be released .
Can I tell you how frustrating this is for an OB nurse ?
When I worked in my last life , I worked with two women with fertility problems .
Actually , I worked with quite a few with fertility problems but these two stand out in my mind particularly at the moment .
Linda was in her thirties , happily married and Christian .
I ca n’t remember all the specifics but Linda underwent fertility treatments including drugs like Pergonal and Clomid , the use of which frequently gives rise to conception of serious multiples ( quads or greater ) .
Mary was in her twenties , married , Catholic and Italian .
I have no idea of her fertility treatment but she conceived quads .
Linda was initially pregnant with four babies , selectively aborted one and carried three babies to over 35 weeks gestation before delivering them , all in the vicinity of five pounds .
None of them needed assistance with breathing .
They all fed .
They may have had a few bumps but , pretty much , were as near a term pregnancy as any triplets are likely to get .
Mary , being from a staunch Catholic upbringing , opted not to selectively terminate and tried to bring her quads to term .
I believe they delivered in the vicinity of 33 to 34 weeks , considerably earlier and lighter than Linda ’s triplets .
Mary required much intervention during her pregnancy , developing preterm labor necessitating medications .
Some of those PTL meds are not the kindest or best things for even a relatively healthy , childbearing age woman .
I do n’t think any of Mary ’s babies was able to leave the hospital with her .
If I remember correctly , they all required feeding tubes .
Some of them may have had assisted ventilation ( probably with nasal C - pap . )
I think at least two of Linda ’s three went home with Mom …it might have been all three .
I had the pleasure of taking care of Linda in the last few weeks of her pregnancy , when she was confined to the hospital .
I also took care of her afterward and helped her to learn to breastfeed .
Those are some of the fondest memories I have of my years as an OB nurse .
I never had to deal with Mary when she was hospitalized , thankfully .
She was one of those nurses who claimed a moral and religious objection to caring for women during elective terminations .
Frankly , I always thought she was just lazy and not really so morally offended , more of a selective Catholic , but that ’s an even snarkier post for a really snarky day .
If the Minnesota couple had chosen to reduce the number of fetuses in the pregnancy to three , they might all have left with Mom .
Had they reduced the number of babies to four , they would all probably still be alive .
As it stands , they delivered six babies at roughly 22 weeks .
A 22 - week singleton stands , at best , a 50 - 50 shot , in my estimation .
And that ’s a 22 - weeker that did n’t have to spend those weeks sharing his environment with five siblings .
As it is , the six babies have required a tremendous amount of health care resources .
I ’m sure not one was able to breathe on his or her own at birth meaning 6 full teams of neonatal nurses , doctors and respiratory therapists needed to be present .
Every effort is made to save any neonate , regardless of gestational age , after the point of potential viability ( around 22 weeks when I left OB in 2001 ) .
The three boys who ’ve died were each treated by a team of those professionals along with all the ancillary departments necessary for a very sick infant .
The three surviving babies , I ’m sure , remain in a neonatal intensive care unit , fully ventilated , unable to eat , unable to see yet .
Totally unprepared for survival in the environment into which they ’ve been thrust .
I do n’t begrudge them the medical care , which will run into millions of dollars if many more survive .
God bless them that they were able to provide care for their children .
I begrudge their parents ’ complete lack of foresight via blind devotion to a religious ideology .
It is my opinion their ideology is flawed , is too literal and basic and lacks any sense of nuance .
I ’m of the opinion that four of those babies might be alive today had two of them been selectively terminated early in the pregnancy .
Imagine that …abortion might have saved the life of a child that is now dead .
Theirs is a black and white world .
Too bad most of the world comes at us in lovely and varied shades of grey .
What a waste .
Oh , I ’ll link it up later … I ’ve got a bath waiting …
Brazen Wood Theft Thieves Steal German Forest
A German forest owner who wanted to check up on his fir trees was shocked to find a wasteland of bark and twigs .
Police are hunting the thieves who carted off an entire 2,500 square meter forest .
BECK : There 's two things that really bother me .
Science has become religion on this .
You 're called a Nazi or a fascist or whatever if you -- if you do n't agree with it .
That 's Glenn Beck , yesterday on his CNN show .
But , as Media Matters demonstrates , Beck will call you Hitler if you do agree with the science :
Now , here 's a book that outsold the Bible in World War II .
Did they know ?
They clearly did .
Why this book , The Years of Extermination , is more frightening is the whole world knew .
And when you see what was in the papers at the time -- I kept reading it going , " Oh , my gosh .
Oh , my gosh .
I have read these things in some places about the Jews , in some places about what 's coming in other places on global warming .
I have seen these things happening right now . "
And I understand World War II much , much better because we 're here again , gang .
We are here again .
And I read this one part on global warming about how they got -- what was the first thing they did to get people to exterminate the Jews .
Now , I 'm not saying that anybody 's going to -- you know Al Gore 's not going to be rounding up Jews and exterminating them .
It is the same tactic , however .
The goal is different .
The goal is globalization .
The goal is global carbon tax .
The goal is the United Nations running the world .
That is the goal .
Back in the 1930s , the goal was get rid of all of the Jews and have one global government .
You got to have an enemy to fight .
And when you have an enemy to fight , then you can unite the entire world behind you , and you seize power .
That was Hitler 's plan .
His enemy : the Jew .
Al Gore 's enemy , the U.N. 's enemy : global warming .
Ok , so this was on Glenn Beck 's radio program yesterday morning .
Between his radio show in the morning in which the Jews are to global warming as Hitler is to Al Gore , and the CNN show in the evening , Beck apparently forgot who is allowed to call who a Nazi and for what in his world .
He compared Gore to Hitler that very day .
Lest you think this is a one time occurrence by Beck , here he is last year on An Inconvenient Truth :
" When you take a little bit of truth and then you mix it with untruth , or your theory , that 's where you get people to believe .
...
It 's like Hitler .
Hitler said a little bit of truth , and then he mixed in ' and it 's the Jews ' fault . ' "
My question is not for serial moron Glenn Beck .
My question is for CNN .
How can you continue to have this man on your network ?
And Keith Olbermann , I love you man , but Beck should n't be today 's worst person in the world .
It 's the person who gave him that air time .
Oh , and by the way , what do you suppose Lieberman , who complained yesterday about civility in our discourse , would have to say about that ?
Is he going to go on Beck 's show again and talk about whether Al Gore is like Hitler ?
We know how much he loves Beck :
LIEBERMAN : Thank you , Glenn .
We are proud of you , friend .
Keep on going .
Hey , Joe , perhaps you should take you civility concerns to Beck 's show ?
What about the vituperation toxicity of equating your former running mate to Hitler ?
Moscow Gay Rights Protest Russian Nationalists Attack Gays , Right Said Fred , and a German Politician
Russian skinheads , ultra nationalists and fundamentalist Orthodox church members make good on their pledge to " clean " Moscow streets of gays .
Pop groups like Tatu and Right Said Fred were part of the scattered gay - rights protest , and so was a German politician .
Natalie Portman is best known for her roles in Hollywood movies like Star Wars , Cold Mountain and V for Vendetta .
What is less known is that she was co-author of a scientific paper on the neuroscience of child development .
This is about her research .
Portman , whose real name is Natalie Hershlag , left acting to pursue a psychology degree at Harvard during 2000 .
While there she was employed as a research assistant in Prof Stephen Kosslyn ’s neuropsychology lab where she got involved in a study investigating the link between frontal lobe development and visual knowledge in infants .
The study investigated object permanence – the ability to understand that objects do not disappear from the world when they are out of sight , something that typically develops in the first year of life .
Researchers have argued that the frontal lobes are particularly important for this skill , but the trouble is , you ca n’t put babies in conventional brain scanners to easily test the idea .
They just wriggle about too much .
Portman ’s study , led by neuroscientist Dr Abigail Baird , used a relatively new method for measuring brain function called near - infrared spectroscopy .
This technology relies on the fact that near - infrared light can penetrate the skull , and that blood carrying oxygen , and blood that has given up its oxygen , absorbs the light differently .
The idea is that the device beams light into the frontal lobes , and you can work out how hard this area is working from how much oxygen - rich blood there is .
The advantage is that this technology is safe for children , and can be worn as a sort of high - tech hat , meaning there ’s less of a problem if the child being tested moves about .
During the study , infants were shown a toy , which was then hidden under a cloth .
Children who have object permanence – who know that it has n’t disappeared – look for it under the cloth .
Children without this skill just ignore the cloth and look for something else to do , because the memory of the toy is gone .
The study tested 20 infants , every four weeks , from the ages of 5 - 12 months .
To see what changed in the brain as the ability emerged , the researchers compared infrared light absorption from a time when the kids first looked for the toy , to an earlier time , when they just forgot that it existed when it was out of sight .
The team discovered that the frontal lobes suddenly kicked in when children develop the knowledge that hidden objects still exist , providing an understanding of which brain areas are involved in this important mental function .
The study also demonstrated that near - infrared spectroscopy could be used successfully to study the brain development of very young children .
The paper was eventually published in the journal Neuroimage , under Natalie ’s real name , with the title ‘ Frontal lobe activation during object permanence : data from near - infrared spectroscopy ’ .
It has since been cited by at least 20 different studies that have built on its findings .
And if you want to read the study in full , it is available as a pdf file at the link below .

New Hampshire
Dem leader is . . .
Al Gore
Boston – A New Hampshire presidential poll by WHDH -TV and Suffolk University shows that local Democrats prefer Al Gore to any of the current contenders .
Hillary Clinton has a solid lead over the rest of the current Democratic field .
The poll , released this afternoon , shows 37 percent of likely Democratic voters backing Clinton or leaning towards her .
Barack Obama was at 19 percent , with both John Edwards and Bill Richardson at 9 percent .

Al Gore , however , could enter the race as the leader .
When his name is added , Clinton loses more than a quarter of her support , while Gore is backed by 32 percent .
Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani lead the GOP field .
The former Massachusetts governor is supported by 26 percent of likely GOP voters , with Giuliani slipping to 22 percent .
John McCain and Fred Thompson are both at 13 percent , a major move backwards for McCain .
Romney 's support , which relies heavily on younger voters , is up 7 percent from a comparable poll in March , when he trailed Giuliani ( 37 percent ) and McCain ( 27 percent ) .
The poll , which has a 4.4 percent margin of error , surveyed 500 likely voters from June 20 to 24 .
Langton Ants in PyGame
Many moons ago I implemented Langton Ants on a ZX Spectrum 48 K , and I have been fascinated by it ever since .
I thought it would be fun to implement it in PyGame .
Langton ants are simple creatures .
They live in a grid of squares that can be one of two colors , and follow these two simple rules .
Am I on color 1 ?
Flip the square , turn 90 degrees right , move forward 1 square .
Am I on color 2 ?
Flip the square , turn 90 degrees left , move forward 1 square .
That is all they do .
They do n't ponder the meaning of life or current affairs , they just check the color of the square they are on and then turn and move .
You would think that something this simple would quickly get in to a cyclical pattern , but it turns out that Langton ants like to make crazy complex patterns and do n't repeat themselves .
Humor me , while I write a Python script to test it .
First thing we need to do is define a few constants for use in the script , as follows .
GRID_SIZE = ( 160 , 120 ) GRID_SQUARE_SIZE = ( 4 , 4 ) ITERATIONS = 1 ant_image_filename = " ant.png "
The grid will be 160x120 squares , with squares that are 4x4 pixels ( so that it fits inside a 640x480 pixel screen ) .
The value of ITERATIONS is the number of moves an ant does each frame , increase it if you want the ants to move faster .
Finally we have the filename of an image to represent the ant .
I will be using this image : .
Next we import PyGame in the usual manner .
import pygame from pygame.locals import *
We will represent the grid with a class that contains a two dimensional list ( actually a list of lists ) of bools , one for each square , where False is color 1 , and True is color 2 .
The AntGrid class is also responsible for clearing the grid , getting the square color at a coordinate , flipping a square color and drawing itself to a PyGame surface .
I chose white for color 1 and dark green for color 2 , but feel free to change it if you want something different .
class AntGrid ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , width , height ) : self .
width = width self .
height = height self .
clear ( ) def clear ( self ) : self . rows = [ ] for col_no in xrange ( self .
height ) : new_row = [ ] self .
rows .
append ( new_row ) for row_no in xrange ( self .
width ) : new_row .
append ( False ) def swap ( self , x , y ) : self .
rows [ y ] [ x ] = not self .
rows [ y ] [ x ] def get ( self , x , y ) : return self .
rows [ y ] [ x ] def render ( self , surface , colors , square_size ) : w , h = square_size surface .
fill ( colors [ 0 ] ) for y , row in enumerate ( self .
rows ) : rect_y = y * h for x , state in enumerate ( row ) : if state : surface .
fill ( colors [ 1 ] , ( x * w , rect_y , w , h ) )
Now that we have a grid , we can create a class for the ants .
The move function in the Ant class implements the two rules , and the render function draws a sprite at the ants location so we can see where it is .
class
Ant ( object ) : directions = ( ( 0 , - 1 ) , ( + 1 , 0 ) , ( 0 , + 1 ) , ( - 1 , 0 ) ) def __init__ ( self , grid , x , y , image , direction = 1 ) : self .
grid = grid self .
x = x self .
y = y self .
image = image self .
direction = direction def move ( self ) : self .
grid .
swap ( self .
x , self .
y ) self .
x = ( self . x +
Ant .
directions [ self .
direction ] [ 0 ] ) % self .
grid .
width self .
y = ( self .
y +
Ant .
directions [ self .
direction ] [ 1 ] ) % self .
grid .
height if self .
grid .
get ( self .
x , self . y ) : self .
direction = ( self .
direction - 1 ) % 4 else : self .
direction = ( self .
direction + 1 ) % 4 def render ( self , surface , grid_size ) : grid_w , grid_h = grid_size ant_w , ant_h = self .
image .
get_size ( ) render_x = self .
x * grid_w - ant_w / 2 render_y = self .
y * grid_h - ant_h / 2 surface .
blit ( self .
image , ( render_x , render_y ) )
Finally in the script , the run function handles the guts of the simulation .
It sets up the screen , creates the the grid object then enters the main loop .
Inside the main loop there are event handlers so that you can drop ants with the left mouse button , clear the grid with the C key and start the simulation with the SPACE key .
The remaining portion of the run function moves all the ants and renders the screen .
def run ( ) : pygame . init ( ) w = GRID_SIZE [ 0 ] * GRID_SQUARE_SIZE [ 0 ] h = GRID_SIZE [ 1 ] * GRID_SQUARE_SIZE [ 1 ] screen = pygame .
display .
set_mode ( ( w , h ) , 0 , 32 ) ant_image = pygame .
image .
load ( ant_image_filename ) . convert_alpha ( ) default_font = pygame .
font .
get_default_font ( ) font = pygame .
font .
SysFont ( default_font , 22 ) ants = [ ] grid = AntGrid ( * GRID_SIZE ) running =
False total_iterations = 0 while True : for event in pygame .
event . get ( ) : if event .
type == QUIT : return if event .
type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN : x , y = event .
pos x /= GRID_SQUARE_SIZE [ 0 ] y /= GRID_SQUARE_SIZE [ 1 ] ant =
Ant ( grid , int ( x ) , int ( y ) , ant_image ) ants .
append ( ant ) if event .
type == KEYDOWN : if event .
key == K_SPACE : running = not running if event .
key == K_c : grid . clear ( ) total_iterations = 0 del ants [ :] grid .
render ( screen , (( 255 , 255 , 255 ) , ( 0 , 128 , 0 ) ) , GRID_SQUARE_SIZE ) if running : for iteration_no in xrange ( ITERATIONS ) : for ant in ants : ant . move ( ) total_iterations += ITERATIONS txt = " %i iterations " % total_iterations txt_surface = font .
render ( txt , True , ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) ) screen .
blit ( txt_surface , ( 0 , 0 ) ) for ant in ants : ant .
render ( screen , GRID_SQUARE_SIZE ) pygame .
display . update ( ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : run ()
And thats our finished Langton Ant simulation .
Have a play with it , then come back and explain to me how two simple rules can create such a complex pattern .
Update : Here 's a screenshot !
“ I AM continually shocked and appalled at the details people voluntarily post online about themselves . ”
So says Jon Callas , chief security officer at PGP , a Silicon Valley - based maker of encryption software .
He is far from alone in noticing that fast - growing social networking websites such as MySpace and Friendster are a snoop ’s dream .
New Scientist has discovered that Pentagon ’s National Security Agency , which specialises in eavesdropping and code - breaking , is funding research into the mass harvesting of the information that people post about themselves on social networks .
And it could harness advances in internet technology – specifically the forthcoming “ semantic web ” championed by the web standards organisation …
When announcing a reduction in force , companies typically frame it as a measure to reorganize or cut costs .
In some instances , that 's actually true .
However , often , it 's a way of cleaning house -- getting rid of " deadwood " or " difficult " employees without incurring liability .
In her book ' Corporate Confidential : 50 Secrets Your Company Does n't Want You to Know , ' former human resources executive Cynthia Shapiro says that she has seen organizations initiate a restructuring just to get rid of one or two people .
Stuart Watson , an independent human resources consultant , says he 's witnessed the same .
" Periodic restructurings allow managers to purge employees they do n't like in a way that averts lawsuits and saves face for everyone involved , " he says .
" Whether formal or informal , nearly every company or manager has a blacklist of employees they 'd just as soon not have to deal with .
The trick to surviving a layoff is to not be on that list !
"
Here are 10 common ways one can get blacklisted : 1. Embarrass , insult or argue relentlessly with your manager .
Your boss holds the key to your future with this company .
Offending him or her is career suicide .
2 . Say negative things about your employer or its mission every chance you get .
Companies want employees who will support their initiatives -- not sabotage them .3 .
Be at the top of your pay range without providing added value .
From a business perspective , the ideal employee is one who is competent , shows potential for growth and is near the middle or bottom of the pay range .
If your pay falls high in the range , you best be sure you 're giving your employer its money 's worth !
4 .
Take the work - life balance credo too far .
You should n't routinely leave early to watch soccer practice or spend more than 15 minutes a day conducting personal business on company time .
Even the most family - friendly of companies wants a worker who puts in the hours and is focused on the job !
5 .
Complain to HR about your boss or co-workers without first trying to work it out directly .
Failure to handle your own problems can signal immaturity , a possible lack of people skills and can get you labeled as " difficult .
" 6 . Use HR as a confessional for personal or professional problems .
As nice as they may seem , remember , HR reps are there to serve the company 's best interests , not yours ; they likely will report any conversations they 've had with you to your manager .
7 .
Make a highly visible mistake .
To publicly atone for its sins or set an example for other employees , corporations will often offer up a scapegoat .
8 .
Use your boss or co-worker as a therapist .
No matter how sympathetic they may appear , your colleagues have their own problems and lives to get home to .9 .
Tell your colleagues that you 're planning on taking maternity or family leave -- or filing for workers compensation -- before telling your boss .
If your boss or a superior hears about your plans from someone other than you , they could lay you off to save the company money and hassle and claim they had no idea of your personal situation .
10 .
Do n't bother to bond with your new boss or colleagues .
You 'll come off as distrustful , standoffish or socially ill - adept .
Besides , it 's much easier to fire someone with whom you do n't have a relationship .
" Bottom line , it pays to be a little paranoid , " Watson advises .
" Examine your image and actions from the company 's perspective to make sure you 're viewed as adding value .
You want to be seen as someone who is competent , professional , supportive of the company and easy to work with . "
WHY ONLY LIBBY ?….
On Monday the defense in the Scooter Libby trial called a string of reporters to the stand and asked them if Libby had ever told them about Valerie Plame ’s identity .
They all said no .
Over at National Review , Byron York ( or , rather , Byron York ’s headline writer ) , asks a question :
If There Was a Conspiracy to Out Plame , How Come Libby Did n’t Tell Woodward ?
Or Novak ?
Or Pincus , Or… ?
Answer :
Who cares ?
Libby ’s not on trial for outing Plame ’s identity .
So here ’s a more pointed question .
As near as I can tell , everyone else that prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald talked to during the course of his investigation told him the truth .
That includes Richard Armitage , who originally leaked Plame ’s name to Robert Novak .
It also appears to include Karl Rove ( though only barely ) , Bob Woodward , Ari Fleischer , Novak himself , and dozens of others .
So here ’s my question :
If everyone else told the truth , why did Libby lie ?
Repeatedly .
Under oath .
What was different about the vice president ’s office that out of the entire mountain of people Fitzgerald interviewed , Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff was the only one who felt he had to lie ?
Here you go — the pride of the nutroots , politely declining to tell a 9/11 conspiracy theorist to go to hell .
How can he ?
His base is filthy with them .
Chilling takeaway : the applause at the end .

NEW YORK --
The US divorce rate has dropped to its lowest since 1970 , as people wed later in life , live together without marrying , and secure prenuptial agreements , particularly among the affluent .
The rate , which measures the number of divorces against the total population , peaked at 5.3 per 1,000 people in 1981 and settled at 3.6 in the 12 months prior to September 2006 , the most recent data available , according to a May 4 report by US health officials .
The marriage rate also dropped to 7.3 in 2005 from 7.6 the year earlier and 7.7 in 2004 , the report said .
People are taking longer to decide who they 'll marry and more are considering financial security , whether to have children , and which religion to belong to before tying the knot , according to lawyers who specialize in matrimonial law and sociologists .
" People are just more savvy going in about the likelihood of divorce , " said Marina Tucker , a matrimonial attorney at Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell LLP in Washington , in a telephone interview .
Once married , they 're " more willing to seek marriage counseling as a way to mediate issues , " she said .
Tucker said she " definitely " sees fewer divorces in marriages that have hammered out prenuptial legal agreements .
Lawyers tell their clients ahead of time " all the terrible things that might happen in the future , " she said .
" It makes them think everything through . "
The divorce and marriage data was prepared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's National Center for Health Statistics .
Of the states reporting , Florida had the most divorces with 66,712 from January to September 2006 .
Texas was second with 60,195 and New York was third at 38,422 .
There is no divorce data from several states that declined to supply their information , including California .
That state did supply data on marriages , leading the country with 167,173 nuptials during the same period , followed by Florida with 121,479 and Texas with 132,394 .
Andrew J. Cherlin , a professor of public policy in the sociology department at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , said the divorce rate has been falling off strongly among the college - educated in America , even as it continues to creep up for the least schooled .
A number of studies have shown that more highly educated people tend to marry at an older age , and more of them live together without marrying .
" In a funny way , the postponing of marriage is lowering the divorce rate -- young couples live together without marrying , and when they break up the split does n't count as a divorce , " Cherlin said in a telephone interview .
Additionally , he said college - educated couples " have been the winners in our globalized economy -- they 've gotten the better jobs , and their incomes are going up , so there 's less strain on their marriages , " Cherlin said .
Steven P. Martin , an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Maryland in College Park , Md. , said that other factors may also be involved .
For instance , he said there has been an increase in the proportion of marriages where there is a permanent breakup and no divorce , so there is no divorce certificate to count .
Also , recent research has shown that " fewer men and women are getting remarried if they separate , " he said .
" Thirty years ago , remarriage happened quickly . "

Reasons You Should Care About Politics and Government
Everything is political ; the choice of not having a political opinion is itself a political act .
Anything or any social dynamic with an existing power structure is political .
All of us , as members of the human race , are involved in the political system somehow or the other , we cannot deny our existence in the political sphere of the world .
Although some might say that they do not have any political opinions or aspirations , but that is untrue .
Each individual is a part of a more extensive political system , benefiting or being at a disadvantage from the laws , policies and the bureaucracy .
The government and the political system are entirely different mechanisms of a State .
Politics can exist without a government , but a government thrives on the existence of a political structure .
The State is just an abstract ethical idea which hosts a demarcated territory and a population within it .
The government is a social , political and economic structure which supports the state by validating its existence and proving to be a controlling device which helps the people choose a leader for themselves and create laws as per their society and prevalent culture .
The role of the media
It is evident that the media has become subservient to the men in power .
Most of the failing world governments have white , upper - class men as leaders of their countries .
The marginalized is being oppressed , and the media does nothing to report it , there is a severe lack of correspondence in the rural and agrarian sector .
Media is one of the essential pillars of a democratic setup .
Yet , they do nothing to inform the people about the actions of their representatives and the repercussions it might have on the society as a whole .
Media is no more journalism , and it is media because it runs on business models and focuses on earning profits rather than providing unbiased news .
As a citizen , it becomes tough to analyse the actions of a government when the media is just speaking in it a favour , political parties buy these media houses and regulate the news both in telecasts and news .
America , China , India , Philippines and some other governments are famous for controlling the media to their own benefit and attacking the opposition .
In a nutshell
Voting is a constitutional right for all citizens , every election , and we rush to the polling booths just to cast our vote for a popular leader .
We never question the political system or the electoral dynamics , and we choose a leader because he is popular , which is one of the primary reasons why the country does n’t develop .
These leaders work to help the friends who funded the party and the election campaign so that they will be funded again , the political system is stuck in a loop of this funding and benefiting the rich .
The ethics of the constitution are lost , and the founding principles of liberty are just a mere sham , the leaders use these items like buzzwords during elections and forget about them until the next one .
We ’re accepting applications for summer internships ( 2006 ) at Fog Creek .
The deadline is February 2006 .
Microsoft Jet
I ’m glad Microsoft is upgrading the Jet engine once again .
Even though they tried to tell application developers that we needed to move to MSDE / Sql Server Express , we know that our customers want their data in a single file and do n’t want to have to install and administer SQL Server just to get to that file .
In the minus column , Erik Rucker seems to be saying that the new Jet engine wo n’t be redistributable .
“ Developers can still program against the Access engine , but since it is n’t part of the system any more , application users will need Access on their machines . ”
Great .
That makes it nearly useless to typical ISVs developing Windows apps , so I guess we ’re stuck with the creaky old Jet 4.0 .
I have n’t heard the whole story yet , but Erik also says that the main big new Jet feature is this clever way of doing many - to - many relations between tables that was done solely to benefit SharePoint .
That ’s nice , hon ’ , but it does n’t seem like such a big deal .
I ’m hoping Erik has a Jobsian “ just one more thing ” up his sleeve .
What I ’d much rather see is real , authentic , fast full - text search .
Access ( Jet ) 4.0 just does n’t have full - text search at all , and it will be pretty darn disappointing if Access 12 does n’t have a good , instant full - text search feature that ’s native and built in to the engine at the deepest levels .
When we work on FogBugz , whether with Access ( Jet ) , SQL Server , or MySQL as the backend , we spend way too much time trying to get full - text search to work even moderately well .
SQL Server 2000 , even though it technically has a full - text search feature , actually has a very - badly grafted - on full - text engine that is poorly integrated , slow , unreliable , and assumes that programmers have nothing better to do than think about when the indexes are built and where they are stored .
In production , the full text engine grafted onto SQL Server 2000 falls down all the time .
In particular , if you use a lot of databases and frequently detach and re-attach them ( what we were told we have to do in order to use SQL Server as a “ file oriented ” database like Jet ) , the full text search indexes get all screwed up .
They rely on insanely complex chunks of registry data to associate indices , stored in files , with databases .
It is almost monumentally difficult to backup and restore full text indexes .
The fact that it ’s 2005 and I ca n’t buy a relational database from Microsoft that has full text search integrated natively and completely , and that works just as well as “ LIKE ” clauses , is really kind of depressing .
A very senior Microsoft developer who moved to Google told me that Google works and thinks at a higher level of abstraction than Microsoft .
“ Google uses Bayesian filtering the way Microsoft uses the if statement , ” he said .
That ’s true .
Google also uses full - text - search - of - the - entire - Internet the way Microsoft uses little tables that list what error IDs correspond to which help text .
Look at how Google does spell checking : it ’s not based on dictionaries ; it ’s based on word usage statistics of the entire Internet , which is why Google knows how to correct my name , misspelled , and Microsoft Word does n’t .
If Microsoft does n’t shed this habit of “ thinking in if statements ” they ’re only going to fall further behind .

Villarreal , standing at his post behind the customs officers at the border crossing station , knew he was being watched .
A slim teenage boy wearing a green T - shirt was furtively peering at him from behind a pillar on the Mexican side .
“ I know who it is before he even comes in , ” Villarreal said , ducking into an alcove .
Minutes later , perhaps thinking Villarreal had left , the boy and another teen breezed through customs .
Villarreal sprang out of hiding and called the teens by name .
“ If you hide like that , ” he said , “ you ’re just going to make things worse . ”
Villarreal is not a border agent .
He is a school attendance officer whose assignment is to catch students who live in Mexico but attend public school in the U.S .
Children who are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants but live in Mexico cross every morning to get a better education for free in Arizona , breaking the law that requires them to live within the boundaries of the district .
To many of their parents , who have ties in both countries , not living in the district is the educational equivalent of jaywalking .

“ I pay taxes .
I work over here , ” said a 31 - year - old corrections officer who would not give his name as he walked his son from Mexico to elementary school in San Luis .
“ What ’s the difference ? ”
There are no hard statistics on the number of children who break the residency requirement , but some people opposed to U.S. immigration policy have seized on the issue as another example of how they say migrants exploit the U.S.
They contend that most school districts do not enforce the law because they risk losing state funding , which is based on the number of enrolled students .
“ The whole thing ’s outrageous .
We ’re not the school district for northern Mexico , ” said state Rep. Russell K. Pearce .
Two years ago , the state superintendent , fed up with the practice , hired a private investigator to videotape schoolchildren coming from Mexico .
At an Arizona border town with a population of 65 , a school bus regularly picked up 85 students at the crossing .
Advertisement
Amid the resulting publicity , that school district stopped the pickups , but it ’s unclear whether any other districts changed their policies .
In nearby Calexico , Calif. , taxpayers ’ complaints about building schools within walking distance of Mexico led the local district last year to hire someone to watch border crossings and check student addresses .
But in Arizona , no district appears to have taken as aggressive a stance as Yuma Union High School District , which serves San Luis .
In the early 1990s , it hired a full - time attendance officer to verify residency for students at its six schools .
Part truant officer , part detective , Villarreal spends his mornings noting names of high school students arriving from Mexico and listening to explanations for why they crossed :
They were visiting a sick relative .
They were staying with a friend .
Their parents divorced and one lives in Mexico , the other in the U.S .
Advertisement
He lets the children , including the teens he spotted hiding from him , continue to school , then checks their stories .
A soft - spoken man with a full face and the hint of a mustache , Villarreal , 37 , is a San Luis native and the son of Mexican immigrant farmworkers .
But he has little sympathy for parents who avoid paying the property taxes that support the district by living in Mexico , where the cost of living is lower and houses sell for about $ 30,000 , compared with the median price of $ 179,000 in San Luis .
“ They want the American services , ” he said , “ but they do n’t want to be part of the American system . ”
SAN Luis , 20 miles south of Yuma , lies in Arizona ’s far southwestern corner , bordered by Mexico to the south and west .
For decades it was a sleepy agricultural town where workers in the surrounding lettuce and broccoli fields entered from Mexico and occasionally settled down in mobile homes or modest stucco houses .

Cesar Chavez was born in this region and sometimes returned to San Luis to support strikes by local agricultural workers .
He died in a crumbling apartment complex here with a dirt courtyard a stone ’s throw from the border .
In the 1990s , the population began to boom , as migrants from other parts of the U.S. were lured by cheap real estate and persistent sunshine .
Illegal immigrants from Mexico began dashing across the border , bringing an influx of border patrol and National Guard posts to town .
Now , with 15,000 people and growing , the town is spilling into the desert .
New subdivisions abut farmland that exudes the bracing odor of fresh cabbage .
Villarreal keeps a rolled - up map of the town in the trunk of his district -
issued white Ford Escort .
After scanning it one recent evening , he cut through a subdivision onto a modest residential street .
Advertisement
“ OK , ” Villarreal said , “ we ’re looking for Manuel and Blanca Carranza . ”
An hour earlier , Villarreal had spotted their 16 - year - old son walking after school on Main Street , past the bargain clothing stores and toward the crossing .
Where are you going ?
Villarreal asked .
Home , the student answered .
Months earlier the family had been added to Villarreal ’s list after he spotted the son walking across the border .
Villarreal had been unable to find the parents ’ home on prior visits to the U.S. address the school had on file .
The boy ’s offhand remark on his way to Mexico was n’t enough to take official action -- Villarreal had to find his parents .
He drove to a rundown , single - story , white clapboard house .
Children ’s clothes dangled from a clothesline stretched along the rutted driveway , and cardboard covered a cracked front window .
He knocked on the door three times before a male voice answered .
Advertisement
Villarreal asked for the Carranzas .
They ’re not in , the voice said .
When are they coming back ?
“ Later . ” After 8 p.m.? “ Later . ”
Shaking his head , Villarreal returned to his car .
“ This is the same person I ’ve talked to before and the same answer , ” he said .
( The district later sent a letter to expel the teenager ; families have the right to appeal . )
San Luis is a small town , and Villarreal has run into uncomfortable situations .
Once , an elected official -- whom Villarreal would n’t identify -- covered for a parent from behind a closed door .
Other times , employees at nearby school districts were involved in deceptions .
Villarreal tries to keep a low profile because , between early - morning patrols and evening door - knocks , he ’s a teacher ’s assistant at a middle school in another local district .
Mindful of how some in town may view his work , he asks his family not to discuss his attendance officer job with anyone .

The Yuma Union High School District was forced to confront the residency issue after a bond measure to build a high school in San Luis was rejected in 1992 .
Voters believed the school would serve mostly students who lived in Mexico .
The district decided it needed to prove to voters that its students were attending legally , and created the position of attendance officer .
Villarreal is the second person to hold the job .
When he started eight years ago , he intercepted hundreds of high school students entering every day from Mexico .
Parents were accustomed to sending their children to U.S. schools without a hassle .
Now word is out that the six Yuma Union high schools check residency , and the numbers crossing have dropped significantly .
In contrast , about 100 younger children were seen one recent day coming from Mexico to attend elementary and middle schools .
Villarreal does not check on these students .
Some were going to Catholic schools that can educate students from any locale , but dozens were headed to the eight elementary and middle schools run by the Gadsden Elementary School District .
That district does not patrol the border .
Instead , it requests utility bills to prove residency and sends staffers to check if a student ’s parents do n’t return calls on routine school issues such as repeated absences , said spokeswoman Rosy Ballesteros .
Villarreal prides himself on knowing the names and histories of the high school students who cross ; most attend the high school in San Luis .

“ This kid is OK ; his legal guardian lives here , ” Villarreal said as one boy trudged past him .
“ That girl ’s up for withdrawal , ” he said , nodding at one who passed a moment later .
He stopped another girl , who showed her U.S. passport and said she ’d spent the night with an aunt in Mexico while her father , who lives in San Luis , worked late .
Villarreal made a note and let her pass .
He ’d already seen the father at a house in San Luis but would check again .
“ You never know , ” he said .
VILLARREAL usually gathers several dozen cases after a few days of patrolling .
He typically finds about 150 students each year who should be withdrawn , out of a district of 10,000 .
He and his boss , Assistant Supt .
Gerrick Monroe , advise those students ’ parents to either move across the border or make a U.S. resident the legal guardian for the child .
Most make the adjustment .
The district allows parents who live outside its boundaries to pay $ 5,300 annually for their children to stay in school , but only eight families do so .
Advertisement
Villarreal ’s investigation of the two teens who tried to dodge him at the
border forced one of them to pay tuition to continue in school ; the other withdrew .
By enforcing the law , Monroe said , the district loses money -- it receives $ 5,000 in state funds for every pupil enrolled .
He said he understood why parents thought they could send their children to U.S. schools .
“ To people who live along the international border , it ’s similar to a county line , ” he said .
“ People do n’t think much about [ crossing ] it . ”
Certainly not Carla Molina , who walked her two children , 11 and 8 ,
Advertisement
to school in San Luis one recent morning .
“ We ’re planning to move back here anyway , ” Molina said .
She lived in San Luis years ago , and her children , born in Yuma , are U.S. citizens .
She wants them to learn English .
“ It ’s important they learn it when they ’re young , ” Molina said .
Villarreal said it was also important to follow the law .
The people who pay U.S. rents and taxes , he said , are the ones who deserve the benefits of the school system .
A couple of nights earlier , he had knocked on the door of the address one student crossing from Mexico had given him .
The child ’s mother , Marta Andrade , answered , confirmed her residency and told Villarreal she was glad he had checked .
Advertisement
“ I like that you do this , ” she told him .
Andrade , 47 , described how she rose at 3 a .m. to take the two - hour trip to a remote field , where she worked all day to pay rent and ensure a legal education for her 16 - year - old daughter .
It would have been easier to stay in Mexico ,
work less and cheat , but Andrade
only has contempt for people who do that .

“ Coming here is a sacrifice , ” she said .
“ They should have to do what I do . ”

Dec. 15 , 2006  -- President Bush has spent the last few weeks engaged in complex briefings with senior military officers , State Department officials and outside experts as he tries to come up with a new plan to achieve victory in Iraq .
But a young captain serving in Iraq 's violent Al Anbar Province has offered a simple explanation of what the problem was in Iraq and how to solve it .
Among his observations is the importance of having a moustache in Iraq .
In a military known for its sleep - inducing , graphically dizzying PowerPoint presentations , the young captain 's presentation , which has been unofficially circulating through the ranks , stands out .
Using stick figures and simple language , it articulates the same goal as the president 's in Iraq .
The creator of this PowerPoint presentation , " How to Win in Al Anbar , " was Capt .
Travis Patriquin .
But Patriquin will not see victory in Iraq .
He was killed by the same improvised explosive device that killed Maj.
Megan McClung of the Marine Corps last Wednesday .
Patriquin had fought in Afghanistan and Iraq .
A gifted officer , he spoke numerous languages , including Arabic .
" How to Win in Al Anbar " may not make it to the desk of the president , but maybe it should .
O'Reilly fears end of ' white Christian power structure '
RAW STORY
Published : Friday June 1 , 2007 Print This Email This On Wednesday , Senator John McCain appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and was asked by Fox News host Bill O'Reilly whether immigration could " change -- pardon the pun -- the whole complexion of America . "
McCain responded , " You 're right . "
O'Reilly then asked McCain , " Do you understand what the New York Times wants , and the far left want ?
They want to break down the white Christian male power structure of which you are part , and so am I . "
O'Reilly went on to insist , " You 've got to cap [ the number of immigrants . ] "
" We do , we do .
I agree with you " said McCain .
Although McCain did not directly endorse O'Reilly 's more extreme statements , as a blog posting at The Largest Majority , points out , " McCain doesnt correct OReilly and state that maintaining white power is not a valid concern with which to base US policy on , but instead goes on to say he understands this ' legitimate fear ' . "
The following video is from Fox 's O'Reilly Factor .
Transcript : O'REILLY : Now on the left .
The objection is there 's not enough illegal aliens in here .
The New York Times wants open borders .
They want all the 12 million legal people who will be legalized to bring in their extended families .
Not just wives and children , but moms and dads , brothers and sisters .
This would lead to in my calculation 40 and 50 foreign nationals being absorbed into the United States in the next 12 , 13 years .
That would sink the Republican Party , I believe , because we'd have a one - party system .
And change , pardon the pun , the whole complexion of America .
Am I wrong ?
MCCAIN : No , you 're right .
The second thing that are on the left they 're against is the temporary worker , as you know .
We say two years go back for a year , two years , go back for a year .
They do n't want that .
They do n't want them to have to go back .
O'REILLY : But the strategy is MCCAIN : People can come and work .
O'REILLY : Do you understand  and I 'm not saying this in a condescending way , you 're smarter than I am .
MCCAIN : Sure .
O'REILLY : But do you understand MCCAIN : No. O'REILLY : what The New York Times wants and the far - left want ?
They want to breakdown the white Christian male power structure of which you are a part , and so am I .
And they want to bring in millions of foreign nationals to basically breakdown the structure that we have .
In that regard , Pat Buchanan is right .
So I say that you 've got to cap it with a number .
MCCAIN : In America today , we have a very strong economy , low unemployment .
So we need additional farm workers , including by the way , agriculture .
But there may come a time where we have an economic downturn and we do n't need so many .
O'REILLY : OK , but in this .
MCCAIN : So I think it has to vary .
O'REILLY : In this bill , you guys got to cap it .
MCCAIN : Yes .
O'REILLY : Because you 're estimated there 's 12 million .
There may be 20 .
MCCAIN : Yes .
O'REILLY : You do n't know .
I do n't know .
You got to cap it .
MCCAIN : We do .
I agree with you .
But I also would remind you , again , that they have to get behind everybody else who tried to apply legally .
They have to pay the fines .
They have to go back to the country of origin .
O'REILLY : I got all of that .
MCCAIN : They have to take a minimum of 13 years , as you know .
So to call that amnesty , in my view , is a stretch .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Eastman Kodak Co. EK.N said on Thursday it has developed digital camera technology that nearly eliminates the need for flash photography , part of the company 's effort to make money from its deep patent portfolio .
A Kodak employee holds up a Next Generation Color Filter in an image released by the company on June 14 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Handout
The world ’s biggest maker of photographic film says its proprietary sensor technology significantly increases sensitivity to light .
Image sensors act as a digital camera ’s eyes by converting light into an electric charge to begin the capture process .
Kodak , which is in the last year of a lengthy and expensive transformation into a digital photography company as its film business shrinks , intends to lean on its wealth of intellectual property to boost its bottom line , expecting up to $ 250 million this year alone in royalties and related revenues .
For example , Chief Executive Antonio Perez has previously said its new inkjet printer strategy grew out of the discovery of existing , unused patents for printer ink .
“ Our strategy is to get it out of the lab and onto the street , ” said Chris McNiffe , general manager , Kodak Image Sensor Solutions .
Analysts have looked at that outlook skeptically , since Kodak has given few details about the types of patents it intends to exploit .
Moreover they say licensing contracts are incremental and hard to bank on in the long term .
“ They have been guarded about their portfolio , with certain degrees of success , ” said analyst Christopher Chute of research firm IDC .
“ But at the end of the day you need to have invented something or have some kind of intellectual property in order to maintain a market position . ”
STOCK RISES
Kodak shares rose to $ 29.00 -- their highest level in more than a year -- on the news , and traded at $ 28.47 , up 5.3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange early Thursday afternoon .
But while the development points to progress in Kodak ’s plan it does not remove some of the company ’s more pressing concerns .
“ The monetization of Kodak ’s IP licensing is a positive to the Kodak story , ” said independent analyst Shannon Cross , of Cross Research .
“ However , ... the company still faces challenges from losses associated with its inkjet initiative , pressures from the migration to digital cinema and margin challenges in its digital camera business . ”
Kodak said the new technology advances an existing Kodak standard in digital imaging .
Today , the design of almost all color image sensors is based on the “ Bayer Pattern , ” an arrangement of red , green and blue pixels first developed by Kodak scientist Bryce Bayer in 1976 .
In this design , half of the pixels on the sensor are used to collect green light , with the remaining pixels split evenly between sensitivity to red and blue light .
After exposure , software reconstructs a full color signal for each pixel in the final image .
Kodak ’s new proprietary technology adds “ clear ” pixels to the red , green and blue elements that form the image sensor array , collecting a higher proportion of the light striking the sensor .
Manufacturing customers interested in the design will likely get a chance to sample it in early 2008 , but Kodak ’s McNiffe was unsure when devices using the technology would be in stores .
The technology could be used at first in consumer gadgets such as cell phones and eventually products made for industrial and scientific imaging .
IDC ’s Chute said Kodak would probably use the technology for its own cameras , hoping to gain a competitive edge .
“ The potential ( for its success ) is always there , but it ’s a wait - and - see thing , ” he said .

Three local Baath Party officials — Abdullah Kadhim Ruweid , his son Mizher Abdullah Ruweid and Ali Dayeh Ali — were sentenced to 15 years of prison for willful murder and seven years for torture , although the sentences will run concurrently .
Another defendant and minor Baath party official , Mohammed Azawi Ali , was acquitted for insufficient evidence .
Prosecutors had argued for lesser sentences for those officials .
Several of the defendants , including Mr. Hussein , were found not guilty for lack of evidence on counts of enforced disappearances .
Like the verdicts and sentence against Mr. Hussein , the verdicts and sentences against Mr. Tikriti , Mr. Bandar and Mr. Ramadan will all come under review by the nine - judge appellate chamber of the trial court .
There is no time limit for the appeal court ’s review , but Iraqi and American officials who work with the court said that the earliest realistic date for Mr. Hussein ’s execution , assuming it stood up to review , would be next spring .
The court has been under growing political pressure from Mr. Maliki and other Shiite officials , who believe an execution sooner rather than later would help to suppress elements of the insurgency that have held out for a return of Mr. Hussein to power .
Mr. Hussein , along with six other defendants , is also being tried in a separate case in which they face charges of killing at least 50,000 people in the so - called Anfal military campaign in 1987 and 1988 in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq .
Prosecutors are preparing numerous other cases against Mr. Hussein , and the tribunal may decide to try him on some or all of the additional charges if it wants to create a full record of the former leader ’s crimes .
But Jaafar al - Mousawi , chief prosecutor in the Dujail case , noted at a briefing after today ’s verdict that nothing in Iraqi law prevents the execution of a defendant in an ongoing trial .
He said that if Mr. Hussein was executed before the end of the Anfal trial , which is expected next summer , it would be a simple procedural matter to strike his name from the list of defendants .
Today ’s court session unfolded in about 50 minutes , with the defendants brought into the courtroom one at a time to listen to their verdicts .
A couple of weeks ago I picked up Chris Double ’s server - side javascript implementation , which uses the Mozilla Project ’s Rhino Javascript environment Jetty to provide a Javascript - controlled Java Servlet webserver .
The code ’s available both for browsing and for darcs download :
darcs get https://www.lshift.net/~tonyg/javascript-server/
After adding support for Jetty ’s SessionHandler class to Chris ’s example.js , I downloaded the prototype.js Javascript utility library and got it running in a server - side environment1 .
The next step was using Rhino ’s continuation support to implement the equivalent of PLT Scheme ‘s send / suspend / dispatch ( also seen in Seaside , under - the - covers as part of the HTML - rendering and workflow aspects of the system , and in SISCWeb , which is at the core of our Icing library ) .
Here ’s a little workflow , roughly equivalent to Seaside ’s Counter application :
sv.addEntryPoint ( " / count " , // [ 1 ] function ( servlet , bindings ) { var finalC = servlet.withState ( 10 , // [ 2 ] function ( c ) { // [ 3 ] while ( // [ 4 ] servlet.sendAndDispatch ( function ( embedUrl ) { // [ 5 ] servlet.replyHtml ( doc ( " Counter " , <> < p>{c.value}</p> < p > < a href={embedUrl(function ( ) { c.value ++ ; return true} ) } > More </a > ; < a href={embedUrl(function ( ) { c.value --; return true} ) } > Less </a > ; < a href={embedUrl(function ( ) { return false} ) } > Stop </a > ; </ p> </> ) ) ; } ) ) { //
Nothing to do in the body of the loop .
} return c.value ; // [ 6 ] } ) ; servlet.replyHtml(doc ( " Bye ! " , < p> Bye ! { finalC}</ p > ) ) ; // [ 7 ] } ) ;
Points of interest :
* [ 1 ] is where we specify the URL path to this workflow .
* [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] are about preserving state across use of the back button , about which more below .
* [ 4 ] is the point at which control will resume when the user clicks on any of the links produced by the embedUrl argument to the 00function given to sendAndDispatch .
* [ 5 ] is the function for producing a document for the user containing links ( generated by embed Url ) that cause the workflow to resume at [ 4 ] .
* [ 6 ] is the point at which one of the embedded link - handlers in [ 5 ] has returned false to [ 4 ] , causing the while - loop to 0terminate .
At this point the state held in c is extracted and the stateful part of the workflow is over .
* [ 7 ] is where the workflow finally ends , because the final document sent to the user was n’t sent from within sendAndDispatch and did n’t contain any embedded links to a continuation .
Javascript is a little like Scheme – but not enough like Scheme to avoid the pitfalls of using ordinary local variables in a web workflow .
The problem is that there are two ways you might want local variables to behave as the user back - and - forwards around your workflow , both perfectly reasonable and appropriate at different times :
* the contents of variables could be unshared across stages of the workflow , so that backing up and proceeding again from an earlier point can run without being affected by any of the decisions the user has used the back button to , in effect , undo ; and
* the contents could be shared across stages of the workflow , so that the user feels like he or she is affecting some real state in the server , and so that the different pages in the workflow appear to all be affecting this separate real object .
The first option seems to me more functional in style , and the second more object - oriented .
To produce the second , object - oriented effect using these Javascript servlets , simply declare variables as Javascript locals and assign to them .
The first is trickier : all variables are mutable , and there ’s no pleasant syntax for functional - style rebinding of variables , so I ’ve resorted to the withState method seen in the example above .
The basic idea is that we should reify functional variables ( since they ’re the exception rather than the rule in Javascript ; in Scheme , we ’d probably reify the mutable ones ! ) and use a system very much like Scheme ’s dynamic - wind to make sure the correct values are visible at each stage in the workflow .
Here ’s a more focussed example of withState usage :
var finalResult = servlet.withState( initialValue , function ( stateCell ) { // ... code using stateCell ... return finalValue ; } ) ;
The initialValue gets placed into a fresh managed cell , which is bound to stateCell for the duration of the function .
The code in the function should access and modify stateCell.value , and the values will be tracked automatically across the forward and back buttons .
The final result of the function is used as the final result of the whole withState call .
Once withState returns , stateCell is no longer automatically tracked – it has gone out of scope , in a way .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes
In a leaked letter , the IAEA said a congressional report contained serious distortions of the agency 's own findings on Iran 's nuclear activity .
The IAEA also took " strong exception " to claims made over the removal of a senior safeguards inspector .
There was no immediate comment from Washington over the letter .
But Rep Rush Holt , a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee , which released the report , said it had never been meant for release to the public .
" This report was not ready for prime time and it was not prepared in a way that we can rely on .
It relied heavily on unclassified testimony , " he told the BBC's PM programme .
' Deja vu '
Signed by a senior director at the International Atomic Energy Agency , Vilmos Cserveny , the letter raises objections over the committee 's report released on 23 August .
It says the report was wrong to say that Iran had enriched uranium to weapons - grade level when the IAEA had only found small quantities of enrichment at far lower levels .
The letter took " strong exception to the incorrect and misleading assertion " that the IAEA removed senior safeguards inspector Chris Charlier for " allegedly raising concerns about Iranian deception " over its programme .
It said Mr Charlier had been removed at the request of Tehran , which has the right to make such an objection under agreed rules between the agency and all states .
He remains head of a section investigating Iran , the IAEA says .
The letter went on to brand " outrageous and dishonest " a suggestion in the report that he was removed for not adhering " to an unstated IAEA policy barring IAEA officials from telling the whole truth " about Iran .
The letter , sent to Peter Hoekstra , head of the House of Representatives ' Select Committee on Intelligence , was aimed at setting " the record straight on the facts " , the IAEA said .
" This is a matter of the integrity of the IAEA and its inspectors , " spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in a statement .

The Dow Jones industrial average ( down 211.57 to 12,420.69 , Charts ) tumbled 200 points , or about 1.6 percent , with roughly two hours left in the session .
The broader S&P 500 ( down 31.04 to 1,418.33 , Charts ) index fell 1.9 percent .
Both blue - chip averages have fallen for the last four sessions .
The Nasdaq ( down 70.26 to 2,434.26 , Charts ) composite slumped 2.5 percent after having slid for the last two sessions .
The Russell 2000 ( down 23.11 to 800.58 , Charts ) small - cap index lost 2.5 percent .
Putting a limit on the declines , the New York Stock Exchange said it imposed trading curbs meant to limit the market selloff , CNN has confirmed .
Treasury bonds rallied as investors sought a safe place to park their money while the dollar fell .
Chinese stocks slumped 9 percent Tuesday - the worst one - day selloff in a decade - on concerns that the government would interfere to cool the speculation that drove the Shanghai market up nearly 130 percent last year .
( Full story ) .
Other Asian markets slumped in tandem .
European shares also tumbled .
" The selloff certainly demonstrates somewhat starkly the inter - connectedness of stock markets around the world , " said Hugh Johnson , chief strategist at ThomasLloyd Global Asset Management .
" Markets can decline in one seemingly isolated part of the world and that decline can be transmitted to other parts of the world through the psychology , " he said .
The slump in world markets exacerbated concerns that Wall Street is due for a selloff after a nearly eight - month rally that has sent the Dow industrials to record highs and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to more than 6 - year highs .
Market veterans have been looking for a stock selloff for some months now due to the combination of slowing economic and earnings growth expected this year , said Harry Clark , CEO at Clark Capital Management .
Although some analysts have been calling for a pullback of about 10 percent for the market , Clark said a smaller drop is more likely .
" We 'll probably see a decline of about 4 or 5 percent and then it will be done , " he said , noting that a lot of the selling will be washed out within the next week or so as the shock wears off .

The very significant NY Times article that says Bush ’s escalation of the Iraq war is n’t quite working .
Well , that ’s what commanders on the ground are saying .
Pro-Bush war Joe Lieberman claims he saw progress in Iraq last week , though .
The recklessness among the war supporters is pervasive .
The only thing — the only thing —
Bush has been right about is that more U.S. soldiers would die .
He was wrong about the timing , telling us Iraq would get bloody in August .
It ’s horribly bloody now :
The U.S. military on Sunday announced the deaths of 14 soldiers in the last three days , a heavy toll that underscored the increased exposure of American forces as reinforcements push deeper into war - torn neighborhoods of Baghdad and outlying areas in a bid to flush out militants .
This bloodshed is only going to reinforce the opinion of the American people that this endless war has to end .
Bush wo n’t let that happen .
And , the Republicans who have enabled Bush ’s endless war are going to be held accountable .
I ’ve Stopped Reading
post # 240 — November 15 , 2006 — a Careers , General post
A while ago , I was asked which books I was currently reading , and I realized it had been a long time since I really sat down to read a book that I wasnâ€™t absolutely required to read for work .
Even then , I found I skimmed a lot , looking for the punchlines , rather than settling in to absorb the logical or narrative flow that the author wanted to present .
Truth be told , I donâ€™t really have the patience for magazines either anymore , and I rarely read the newspaper nowadays — certainly not as regularly and thoroughly as I did .
Even the glorious ritual of settling in to absorb the Sunday paper has gone .
If it werenâ€™t for airplane rides , I probably wouldnâ€™t keep up with any reading at all .
Itâ€™s not just that I am busy with my own career as well as helping to launch my wifeâ€™s new business .
Whatâ€™s happened is that I have ( slowly or rapidly , Iâ€™m not sure ) been losing the ability to read .
Ever since I started really participating in the Interent — particularly the blogosphere – my mental metabolic rate has been re-set .
I find that I can no longer slow my mental processes down long enough to give attention to a well - reasoned , expansive think - piece .
A 250 - page book is now a mountain , and a 400 - page biography an impossibility .
Yet I used to consume these with relish .
And , if what I hear from other people is true , many of you are suffering from the same problem .
â€ œGive me the punchlineâ€ 
Iâ€™m told .
â€ œGet to the point.â€ 
Clients ask me â€ œWhatâ€™s the one article I can read on this : donâ€™t give me a book !â€ 
The blogosphere is filled with top ten lists .
We want the action points , not logic or narrative flow .
Venture capitalists tell us that if we havenâ€™t grabbed them in the first few sentences or pages of the proposal , theyâ€™re not going to read on .
Thereâ€™s something very important being lost here .
At the personal level , I grieve not only for the loss of my ( deeply satisfying ) leisure reading , which has almost disappeared .
It ’s happening in my business reading which is increasingly rushed or not done at all .
By reading less ( and reading less well ) some very adverse things happen :
a ) I learn less .
b) Iâ€™m missing nuance and logic in what I am reading .
c ) That forces me to rushed conclusions ( accept / reject ) about what Iâ€™m skimming .
d ) My critical faculties are declining from lack of use .
Iâ€™m not reflecting enough to ask questions like â€ œWhat would it mean if this were true ? â€ â€ œUnder what circumstances would this apply ? â€ â€œ
In what other contexts might this be applicable ?â€ 
e ) The failure to ask those questions is making me less creative in my thinking .
f ) Obviously , by reading less ( and less in depth ) I am becoming less informed — about the world , my clientsâ€™ world , my own specialty
Here are some questions for you :
( i) Whatâ€™s your experience ?
Do YOU find yourself reading less ( and less well ) nowadays ?
( ii ) What other negative consequences do you think it has ?
( iii ) What approaches have you tried to solve the problem ?
The combined cost of building the two wind farms will be about £ 2bn
The government said the schemes would produce enough renewable electricity to power about one million households .
The larger London Array project covers 90 sq miles ( 232 sq km ) between Margate in Kent and Clacton , Essex .
The second wind farm , called the Thanet scheme , will cover 13.5 sq miles ( 35 sq km ) off the north Kent coast .
The £ 1.5 bn London Array scheme will have 341 turbines rising from the sea about 12 miles ( 20 km ) off the Kent and Essex coasts , as well as five offshore substations and four meteorological masts .
The consortium behind it is made up of Shell WindEnergy Ltd , E.ON UK Renewables and Core Ltd .
Climate change
The smaller £ 450 m
Thanet project will be located seven miles ( 11 km ) out from North Foreland , Kent , and will have 100 turbines .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We should be building more windfarms .
We need to reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels

Send us your comments
The government said both schemes would make " a significant contribution to the aim of a five - fold increase in the UK's renewable energy resource by 2020 " .
Friends of the Earth said about 1 % of electricity used in the UK would come from the London Array turbines .
Spokesman Martin Williams said : " It really is a big wind farm , but when you look at the scale of the challenge of climate change , we 're going to need to do an awful lot more than just this one offshore wind farm . "
And the RSPB backed the London Array scheme after plans were amended to prevent harm to red - throated divers - a bird rarely seen in UK waters .
The charity said 7,000 of the birds were found off north east Kent between 2002 and 2005 , a larger population than thought , and so developers reduced the number of first phase turbines .
Dr Mark Avery , conservation director at the RSPB , said : " We are very pleased that this wind farm is to be built .
Renewable energy generation is crucial to tackling climate change . "
New jobs
London Array
Ltd also wants to build an onshore electricity substation at Cleve Hill , Graveney , but planning permission was refused by Swale Borough Council .
The consortium is appealing , saying it has changed its plans following residents ' concerns over construction traffic , and a planning inspector is due to make a ruling in early March .
The Thanet scheme will provide major economic benefits for the town of Ramsgate .
Thanet District Council said 800 new jobs were expected during the three - year construction period , with another 100 when Ramsgate becomes the maintenance base for the wind farm .
It will be plain that Dennett 's approach to religion is contrived to evade religion 's substance .
He thinks that an inquiry into belief is made superfluous by an inquiry into the belief in belief .
This is a very revealing mistake .
You can not disprove a belief unless you disprove its content .
If you believe that you can disprove it any other way , by describing its origins or by describing its consequences , then you do not believe in reason .
In this profound sense , Dennett does not believe in reason .
He will be outraged to hear this , since he regards himself as a giant of rationalism .
But the reason he imputes to the human creatures depicted in his book is merely a creaturely reason .
Dennett 's natural history does not deny reason , it animalizes reason .
It portrays reason in service to natural selection , and as a product of natural selection .
But if reason is a product of natural selection , then how much confidence can we have in a rational argument for natural selection ?
The power of reason is owed to the independence of reason , and to nothing else .
( In this respect , rationalism is closer to mysticism than it is to materialism . )
Evolutionary biology cannot invoke the power of reason even as it destroys it .
Like many biological reductionists , Dennett is sure that he is not a biological reductionist .
But the charge is proved as early as the fourth page of his book .
Watch closely .
" Like other animals , " the confused passage begins , " we have built - in desires to reproduce and to do pretty much whatever it takes to achieve this goal . "
No confusion there , and no offense .
It is incontrovertible that we are animals .
The sentence continues : " But we also have creeds , and the ability to transcend our genetic imperatives . "
A sterling observation , and the beginning of humanism .
And then more , in the same fine antideterministic vein : " This fact does make us different . "
Then suddenly there is this : " But it is itself a biological fact , visible to natural science , and something that requires an explanation from natural science . "
As the ancient rabbis used to say , have your ears heard what your mouth has spoken ?
Dennett does not see that he has taken his humanism back .
Why is our independence from biology a fact of biology ?
And if it is a fact of biology , then we are not independent of biology .
If our creeds are an expression of our animality , if they require an explanation from natural science , then we have not transcended our genetic imperatives .
The human difference , in Dennett 's telling , is a difference in degree , not a difference in kind -- a doctrine that may quite plausibly be called biological reductionism .
Dennett is unable to imagine a fact about us that is not a biological fact .
His book is riddled with translations of emotions and ideas into evo-psychobabble .
" It is in the genetic interests of parents . . . to inform -- not misinform -- their young , so it is efficient ( and relatively safe ) to trust one 's parents . "
Grief for the death of a loved one is " a major task of cognitive updating : revising all our habits of thought to fit a world with one less familiar intentional system in it . "
" Marriage rituals and taboos against adultery , clothing and hairstyles , breath fresheners and pornography and condoms and H.I.V. and all the rest " have their " ancient but ongoing source " in the organism 's need to thwart parasites .
" The phenomenon of romantic love " may be adequately understood by reference to " the unruly marketplace of human mate - finding . "
And finally , the general rule : " Everything we value -- from sugar and sex and money to music and love and religion -- we value for reasons .
Lying behind , and distinct from , our reasons are evolutionary reasons , free - floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection . "
Never mind the merits of materialism as an analysis of the world .
As an attitude to life , it represents a collapse of wisdom .
So steer clear of " we materialists " in your dark hours .
They cannot fortify you , say , after the funeral of a familiar intentional system .
BEFORE there were naturalist superstitions , there were supernaturalist superstitions .
The crudities of religious myth are plentiful , and a sickening amount of savagery has been perpetrated in their name .
Yet the excesses of naturalism cannot hide behind the excesses of supernaturalism .
Or more to the point , the excesses of naturalism cannot live without the excesses of supernaturalism .
Dennett actually prefers folk religion to intellectual religion , because it is nearer to the instinctual mire that enchants him .
The move " away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts , " or the increasing philosophical sophistication of religion over the centuries , he views only as " strategic belief - maintenance . "
He can not conceive of a thoughtful believer .
He writes often , and with great indignation , of religion 's strictures against doubts and criticisms , when in fact the religious traditions are replete with doubts and criticisms .
Dennett is unacquainted with the distinction between fideism and faith .
Like many of the fundamentalists whom he despises , he is a literalist in matters of religion .
But why must we read literally in the realm of religion , when in so many other realms of human expression we read metaphorically , allegorically , symbolically , figuratively , analogically ?
We see kernels and husks everywhere .
There are concepts in many of the fables of faith , philosophical propositions about the nature of the universe .
They may be right or they may be wrong , but they are there .
Dennett recognizes the uses of faith , but not its reasons .
In the end , his repudiation of religion is a repudiation of philosophy , which is also an affair of belief in belief .
What this shallow and self - congratulatory book establishes most conclusively is that there are many spells that need to be broken .
' Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon , ' by Daniel C. Dennett Leon Wieseltier is the literary editor of The New Republic .
The leak was intended , the court papers suggested , as a rebuttal to the Op - Ed article published in the New York Times on July 6 , by Joseph C. Wilson , IV , a former ambassador and the husband of Ms. Plame .
Mr. Wilson wrote that he had traveled to Africa in 2002 after Mr. Cheney had raised questions about possible nuclear purchases .
Mr. Wilson wrote that he concluded it was " highly doubtful " Iraq had sought to nuclear fuel from Niger .
At Mr. Cheney 's office , the Op - Ed article was viewed " as a direct attack on credibility of the Vice President ( and the President ) on a matter of signal importance : the rationale for the war in Iraq , " according to the court papers .
The presidential authorization was provided , the court papers said , in advance of a meeting on July 8 , 2003 between Mr. Libby and Judith Miller , then a reporter for the New York Times .
Mr. Libby brought a brief abstract of the N.I.E.'s key judgments to the meeting with Ms. Miller in the lobby of the St. Regis Hotel about two blocks from the White House .
Mr. Libby testified , the prosecutors said , that he was " specifically authorized in advance of the meeting to disclose the key judgments of the classified N.I.E. to Miller on that occasion because it was thought that the N.I.E. was " pretty definitive " against what Ambassador Wilson had said and that the Vice President thought that it was " very important " for the key judgments of the N.I.E. to come out . "
The court filing said that Mr. Libby said " he understood that he was to tell Miller , among other things , that a key judgment of the N.I.E. held that Iraq was ' vigorously trying to procure ' uranium . "
Mr. Libby , the prosecutors , said , testified that the meeting with Ms. Miller was the " only time he recalled in his government experience when he disclosed a document to a reporter that was effectively declassified by virtue of the president 's authorization that it be disclosed . "
Ms. Miller never published anything about the contents of the intelligence estimate .
Mr. Libby testified that he first told Mr. Cheney that he could not conduct such a conversation with Ms. Miller because the intelligence estimate on Iraq was classified .
Mr. Libby testified that Mr. Cheney later told him that Mr. Bush had authorized the release of " relevant portions . "
In addition , Mr. Libby told the grand jury that he also spoke with David Addington , then a lawyer for Mr. Cheney , whom Mr. Libby regarded as an expert on national security law .
" Mr. Addington opined that Presidential authorization to publicly disclose a document amounted to declassification of the document , " the court filing said .
Beckham is set to join LA Galaxy in the US in August
Gordana Jankulovska told the BBC there was no confirmation that the BMW X5 car had belonged to the football star .
The car was impounded by the Macedonian police after being shipped from Greece .
Beckham 's car disappeared last year in Madrid .
Macedonian press reports linked it to the minister , although Beckham 's had a different colour .
" This car changed a number of owners before and some of the numbers were changed in an illegal way .
It is impossible to have a final confirmation that this is the car " , Ms Jankulovska told the BBC's Europe Today programme on Wednesday .
Ms Jankulovska says it is quite legal for her to use the car
" If no owner claims the property , the car can be auctioned or kept for state use " , Ms Jankulovska explained .
She told B92 radio in Belgrade that she was a fan of Beckham and would like to meet him if it turned out that the car belonged to him .
Here is the transcript of the March 7th hearing in SCO v IBM , the last of the summary judgment hearings transcripts .
Thanks yet again to Chris Brown for arranging to obtain the transcripts .
On this day , Kimball was quite busy .
He heard several motions , all the ones left over from the first two hearings on March 1 and March 5 : IBM 's Motion for Summary Judgment on its Claim for Declaratory Judgment of Non-Infringement ( Tenth Counterclaim ) ( PDF ) -- asking for a judgment that the Linux kernel does not infringe copyrights owned by SCO
IBM 's Motion for Summary Judgment on its Claim of Copyright Infringment ( Eighth Counterclaim ) -- IBM 's counterclaim regarding SCO 's violation of the GPL and consequent copyright infringment -- ( PDF )
SCO 's cross motion in which it tries to say it never violated the GPL ( if you spin the wording their way ) ( PDF ) and
SCO 's motion for Summary Judgment on IBM's Second , Third , Fourth , and Fifth Counterclaims ( PDF ) -- SCO 's motion trying to get SCO off the hook for all the trash talk in the media .
On this day , we learn from IBM 's attorney , David Marriott that the " mountain of code " SCO 's CEO Darl McBride told the world about from 2003 onward ends up being a measly 326 lines of noncopyrightable code that IBM did n't put in Linux anyway .
On the other hand , SCO has infringed all 700,000 lines of IBM 's GPL 'd code in the Linux kernel .
SCO 's GPL defense is of the lip - curling variety and quite funny .
( You can find a few of the copyrighted Caldera and SCO contributions to Linux here and here , by the way , to help you to understand David Marriott 's argument regarding SCO 's switching - the - names game . )
And it's also quite amusing to watch SCO try to wriggle out of responsibility for all the trash talk its executives treated us to in its PR campaign .
First Motion Heard -- Is This All There Is ?
In the first motion , we learn a bit more about those 326 lines of code .
Of those 326 lines , most are comments , not code .
Allegedly , those lines of code infringe 320 lines of Unix code .
But they are n't copyrightable , IBM says , because they are dictated by externalities , they are unoriginal and they are merger material .
Even if they were protected by copyright , those 320 lines do n't result in substantial similarity between Linux and Unix .
More details :
As for the 326 lines , 11 of 12 files are header files , which are n't copyrightable .
Header files do n't do anything , IBM 's attorney David Marriott explains .
You can't run a header file or execute a header file .
Header files are just descriptive of how information is shared among the components of an operating system .
Now , the header files themselves are of three types , # define statements , structure declaration , and function prototypes .
The first specifies abbreviations .
121 of the 326 lines are #define headers .
A #define statement is comparable to abbreviating the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals as 10th Cir .
Cir stands for the name and 10 being the number given that particular court .
In #define , you have something like #define EPERM .
All that stands for is Lack of Permission , Marriott continues , so if a user tries to do something in Linux that the user lacks permission to do , the system will throw up that error .
The E stands for error , PERM for permission , and 1 or whatever would be the number associated with that .
That 's what a # define statement is : like 10th Cir .
How exactly does EPERM infringe on any rights of SCO , Marriott asks ?
SCO lists it , but without explaining how it 's infringing .
Is it the error message ?
Is it that there is a number associated with the error ?
Is it the name EPERM ?
Is it the name and number put together that infringes ?
SCO has never explained with any specificity , although the court ordered it to do so multiple times .
As for structure declarations , they just identify something .
For example , it could provide identification of the type of computer system running , what the machine is , what version , release , type of machine .
Function prototypes specify what operations may be performed , using what inputs and producing what outputs .
A find function , for example , does exactly what you 'd imagine it would do .
Same with a message send function .
Of the 326 lines , 12 are function prototypes .
SCO 's expert , Mr. Cargill , stated that choosing to list names in alphabetical order and to assign numbers in sequential order evidences creativity sufficient to satisfy him as to whether the code is original within the meaning of copyright law , Marriott argues , but that 's wrong according to the US Supreme Court 's decision in Feist .
Looking at this code , where is there any cognizable originality ?
EPERM for permission error ?
That 's no more " original " than saying 10th Cir. for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals .
What else would you call it ?
And how many ways are there to say that a computer system is Linux , version such and so , release such and so ?
That 's all structure declarations do .
And we 're not even talking about lines of executable code , Marriott explains .
These lines at issue are scattered about .
Header files are n't executable anyway .
The files are not copyrightable .
Worse , SCO claims control over code copyrighted by IBM , such as JFS , and others .
SCO 's own experts said SCO has no copyright infringement claim over those .
At the end of the day , after putting IBM to the expense of all that massive discovery , that 's all there is .
SCO can't prove it even has any copyrights to be infringed , nor has it provided any specifics on exactly how its rights have been infringed , even if it had the copyrights , and even if it had n't transferred all its copyrights to UnitedLinux , which it did , Marriott concludes .
This is all there is .
SCO Linux 4 powered by UnitedLinux included all the 326 lines that are at issue .
IBM has a right to use all 326 lines .
It has multiple licenses ( 5 , to be exact ) , Marriott tells the court , the GPL for one .
There was also a business agreement between Caldera and IBM that also gives IBM a license to use this code and to prepare and have prepared derivative works and to distribute and sublicense and to grant others rights with regard to all 326 lines .
It was Caldera that approached IBM to enter into that business agreement , and significantly it was after Caldera knew about the results of the 1999 study by Santa Cruz that showed some similarities between Unix and Linux , similarities SCO found were understandable and acceptable , that Caldera asked IBM to enter into this agreement .
That means Caldera , now SCO Group , is estopped from now pursuing any infringement action .
That estoppel is on top of IBM obtaining a license by the agreement .
Not only that , but the same agreement provided IBM a warranty ; SCO represented that the code does not infringe any intellectual property rights of any third party .
The GPL , of course , grants IBM legal permission to copy , distribute and modify the software .
Finally , SCO was a Linux company that distributed this code for years and encouraged the world and its dog to copy , modify , distribute , sublicense , whatever , this code , so they are estopped from suing IBM for doing what the GPL license SCO distributed under said IBM could freely do .
Further , SCO sponsored the standardization of Linux , making Linux compliant with various standards , such as the POSIX.1 specification .
The code it now wants to sue over is in Linux because of that standardization , the LSB .
SCO was in fact the only notable supporter of the STREAMS material it now wants to sue IBM over .
STREAMS is n't even in the kernel , but SCO wanted it included to support its Netware for Linux products , Marriott says .
The Linux community did n't want STREAMS in the kernel , so SCO collaborated with others to make it available for download from a web site .
Now it wants to sue people for infringing the very code it put there .
What about ELF ?
There was a 1997 meeting of a group called the 86 Open group , and at that meeting Linus Torvalds proposed creating a new format for the existing ELF format in Linux .
Santa Cruz opposed his proposal and insisted on a Linux ELF so programs could more easily run on SCO UNIX .
So the ELF standard was adopted , at least in part because of SCO 's effort .
Now it wants to sue over ELF .
SCO Replies
What is SCO 's reply ?
I read it all , and I do n't see any of IBM 's points directly responded to , except for saying in passing that the business agreement and the GPL do n't give IBM the rights it says they do and a broad assertion that estoppel is n't appropriate , for this reason and that , but estoppel is n't at all necessary for IBM to prevail .
It 's the cherry on top .
The business agreement does n't let IBM open source Unix " intellectual property " , SCO says .
I guess it wants the judge to just leap to the assumption that the 326 lines are Unix IP .
Of course , the GPL * does * give IBM and the world the right to open source code .
SCO 's answer is that they never authorized that code to be under the GPL , because there 's no copyright notice from them .
Maybe because , as IBM showed already , SCO owns no copyrights on this code ?
You think ?
Actually , IBM 's answer is better .
It points out that SCO is just renaming Linux code and calling it Unix .
But it is the same code , and the Linux code was indisputably released under the GPL .
According to SCO itself , it 's identical code .
IBM disputes that , but that is SCO 's whole claim , so that exact code , according to SCO 's allegations , was , in fact , released under the GPL , with certain representations and promises attached , code Caldera shipped and made money from .
Now it wishes to pretend , IBM says , that those representations and promises are of no consequence .
It should all go to a jury , SCO says , and it talks about " non-literal copying , " which IBM later points out after SCO finishes talking would be in the bucket of allegations the court already told SCO it can't argue .
And SCO claims Linux can't run without STREAMS , but as IBM already explained to the judge , it is n't in there now , unless you want it to be , and Linux was running just fine when Caldera tried to persuade the Linux kernel maintainers to include STREAMS in the kernel , and failed to persuade them .
Caldera put up that website , with others , to make STREAMS available , and now it wants to claim STREAMS is protectable and that you can't run Linux without it .
So that is the level of SCO 's answer .
Instead SCO raises other issues , mainly in the context that IBM 's issues require a jury , not that SCO will win the points , but that they have raised enough questions to require a jury , and it argues various points of law , such as whether IBM can seek a judgment that Linux does n't infringe for others or only for itself and who bears the burden of proof in the motion .
SCO smears some folks , as usual , and then the attorney sits down .
Oh , one more thing .
As for the licenses , SCO asks why IBM did n't present those licenses years ago , if they are so powerful .
Here 's IBM 's answer , in part : Your Honor , the explanation for that is we spent the last four years horsing around trying to figure out exactly what it was that supposedly IBM did .
The court itself told the parties not to bring substantive motions until after discovery was finished , Marriott reminds the judge , so how can SCO argue that " delay " in bringing a motion mentioning estoppel means IBM 's motion should be denied ?
Finally , SCO tries to argue that it was n't the one who released certain code .
Santa Cruz did it .
But IBM just points out that SCO Group claims that Santa Cruz is a predecessor in interest , so it 's bound by what it did : And Mr. Singer suggests , Your Honor , that somehow SCO should not be held responsible for the acts of its predecessors because they did n't own the copyrights at the time or they did n't know what was going on .
Well , Your Honor , the law is clear that a company is bound by the conduct of its predecessors .
The law could not be more clear in that regard .
And I point you to Page 38 of IBM 's reply brief , Judge .
Estoppel is a doctrine of equity .
And this Court has ample authority under which it exercises its equity to preclude a party that for nearly a decade distributed code under the promise it can be used with all the rights that they had from turning around a decade later under new management from disregarding the representations and warranties made from strategic business agreement , from disregarding the principles set out in the GPL , from disregarding the licenses given under the SBA , from disregarding the licenses given under the UnitedLinux , and pretending as if it 's such a surprise to find out that there 's a theory in which they think now maybe they can get somebody to maybe pay them some money .
Respectfully , Your Honor , if there ever were a case for estoppel , this is the case .
As for whether SCO 's claim that things like EPERM are copyrightable , IBM 's David Marriott ends his final statement like this , with a baseball analogy , where " the pitcher is number 1 and the catcher is Number 2 , the first base is 3 and second 4 and 5 is third and 6 is the short , left is 7 , 8 is center field and 9 is right field " :
What SCO contends , Your Honor , let 's talk about those .
Your Honor , in effect what they have claimed is that the pitcher , player pitcher is 1 , player catcher is 2 , player first base is 3 and so on .
That 's what those # defines represent , associating a number and a shorthand for a position and claiming that somehow it renders Linux so substantially similar to UNIX that they enact and claim rights .
And I respectfully submit , Your Honor , that the law is clear that short names of that sort and associating integers randomly with phrases like PP1 or EPERM - 1 simply is not protectable under the doctrines laid out in our papers by Professors Kernagen and Davis in their expert reports .
And in no case can it result when it 's 320 lines of non-contiguous essentially random numbers with essentially shorthand phrases represents substantial similarity .
Now , Your Honor with respect to misuse , briefly again , the facts here are simple .
They claimed rights to more than a million lines of code in Linux .
At the end of the day , there 's 326 lines of code in which they have rights , and they have sought to exert the supposed monopoly they have and copyrights they claim to have over technology plainly owned by others .
For the five reasons I set out , Your Honor , summary judgment respectfully should be entered in favor of IBM .
Thank you .
And with that the arguments on the first motion come to an end .
Motions Regarding the GPL / Copyright Infringement Now , on the IBM motion and SCO cross motion regarding IBM 's copyright claims , the GPL matters , in contrast to SCO 's alleged 326 lines of infringed code , IBM owns about 700,000 lines of code that SCO has infringed , Marriott states .
IBM says it is entitled to summary judgment for the following reasons : First , IBM owns the copyrights at issue .
Second is that SCO copied and distributed the copyrighted works .
And the third is that SCO had no permission to copy and distribute those works .
Why does SCO have no permission ?
Because it breached the GPL and thus lost the license it had .
How did it breach ?
Here 's one way : SCO breached the GPL , Your Honor , by restricting redistribution rights .
Section 6 of the GPL says -- this is at tab 18 of your book -- that each time you redistribute the program ; that is , a program licensed under the GPL , or any work based on it , the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy , distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions and that you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient 's exercise of the rights granted herein .
And yet , Your Honor , subsequent to the commencement of this case , SCO attempted to do exactly that with respect to users of Linux , including IBM .
For example , if you turn to tab 19 of the book , you will find an excerpt from SCO 's web site in which it describes the license that it represented to the world was required if one wished to use Linux after it asserted that there was , in Linux , infringing UNIX code .
The license is described in SCO 's words , Your Honor , as SCO intellectual property license for Linux .
SCO stated that the license was created because , in their words : Quote .
Many customers are concerned about using Linux .
The license , Your Honor , applies to the commercial use , by its terms , of a Linux operating system that contains the 2.4 or later version of the Linux kernel .
And notably , for this purpose , and for Section 6 of the GPL , SCO said on this web site describing its Linux license that the license did not grant any distribution rights , despite the fact that the GPL expressly required that SCO was required to provide distribution rights as to any material received by it under the GPL and distributed by it under the GPL .
Now , there is n't just , Your Honor , a web site describing a licensing program .
In fact , SCO entered licenses in the marketplace with a variety of companies including , for example , Everyone 's Internet .
...
That , Your Honor , represents an impermissible imposition of obligations under the terms of the GPL and in so doing so exceeded its rights under the GPL , and when they did that , Your Honor , they automatically , by the plain language of the GPL in Section 4 lost the right to continue to distribute the code that IBM gave them the right to distribute , but only on the terms of the GPL .
Additionally , IBM points out , SCO 's license breached the GPL by restricting rights to source code , its license saying it granted the right to use SCO IP in Linux in binary format only .
SCO 's turn
What can SCO possibly say in its defense ?
Once again , poor Edward Normand gets the worst assignment , or so it seems to me .
It seems whenever SCO needs a lawyer to say or do something silly , they use him .
The arguments on the GPL are , frankly , laughable , but he gives it his all .
Here are the arguments : 1 . That Linux is a derivative of Unix ( which I must say has n't been proven by a long shot ) and so IBM can't enforce its copyrights in its copyrighted material in the " derivative work " .
It cites the following on that point : Section 103 ( a ) of the Copyright Act states : Protection for a work employing preexisting material of which the copyright subsists , does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully .
Now , what does that mean ?
The Court 's have told us .
As one Federal Court has explained : The case law interpreting 103 ( a ) supports the conclusion that generally no part of an infringing derivative work should be granted copyright protection .
That is particularly true under the case law , Your Honor , where the preexisting material in the derivative work tends to pervade the entire derivative work .
We believe we have made that factual showing with respect to the UNIX System V material in Linux .
The precedent makes clear that the relevant question is not , as IBM suggests in its brief , whether its copyrighted material is derived from UNIX System V .
That 's not the relevant question .
The question is whether the IBM material is part of a derivative work of SCO 's copyrighted technology in which SCO 's UNIX technology tends to pervade , and it does .
Aside from not having proven any of that , and according to IBM in the first motion of the day not being able to , and quite aside from IBM holding copyrights on the code and being therefore presumed to have them appropriately , the case is now about SCO 's Unix " tending to pervade Linux " ?
Leaving out of the discussion for the moment the fact that the court already threw out all claims that were n't specified by file , line , version , which obviously a claim of " tending to pervade " would be affected by , where has SCO ever demonstrated or even alleged this ?
Which code ?
All of it ?
All of Linux tends to be a bit like Unix ?
That 's the beef ?
Are they kidding ?
Or bluffing ?
They can't seriously have sued over this , can they ?
2 . IBM comes to court with " unclean hands " so it can't enforce its copyrights with respect to damages , which IBM is n't moving for summary judgment on anyway .
What do they mean ?
That IBM " hacked " SCO 's website .
I think we can safely leave that in the Puh - lease folder .
3 . That SCO has n't breached or violated the GPL .
The UNIX materials in Linux were never licensed under the GPL by SCO .
The same blah blah that Marriott answered already in the first motion .
Marriott , more patient than I am , answers in detail again : Now , Mr. Normand suggests , Your Honor , and I think ultimately this motion depends upon the idea that SCO did n't breach the GPL as to the code that is at issue because it did not take a registration -- excuse me -- it did not take a slug like this and put it in the GPL on the exact code and say :
This is UNIX code , and we 're SCO , and we 're giving you rights to do with it under the GPL .
Your Honor , that is nothing more than a name game , than a labeling game .
If Your Honor would look at the chart over here , what SCO is essentially doing , Your Honor , is saying that this code , which we 'll assume to be in Linux , this code is not subject to the GPL even though it shows up in Linux , even though there is a copyright designation on it , even though it says it 's distributed under the GPL just because it does n't say :
This is SCO code , and it 's UNIX code in Linux .
The code in question , Your Honor , which they claim is not under the GPL is , they say , not under the GPL just because they have n't , they say , put on it a label that says : We 're SCO .
We are giving up this UNIX code .
The fact of the matter is , Your Honor , the code we 're talking about is there .
It bears a GPL notice .
It was offered to Linux by the writer and creator of that code pursuant to the terms of the GPL .
And whether or not -- I respectfully submit that SCO has , in fact , licensed that code , despite what Mr. Normand suggests .
But the fact of the matter is :
Whether or not it was licensed as a licensor , whether or not SCO was a licensor , they were a licensee .
They got it just like they got the IBM code , the 700,000 lines of it , that bore the representation and notice that they were under the GPL , and only to be used under the GPL .
And now Mr. Normand says : Yeah , but that does n't matter , Judge , because all of Linux is a derivative work of UNIX System V , and nothing there , under their argument , Your Honor , is at all under the GPL because they purport to own it all .
Its all a derivative work .
And no one put it in -- there is , to my knowledge , at least , no notice in the GPL that says -- in Linux , rather , that says :
This is all SCO code , and we are giving it up under the GPL .
And that 's essentially their argument , Your Honor .
There is not a notice that says that .
What there is in fact is the code with the GPL notice by the person who wrote it saying that it is offered under those terms .
And all they are really saying , Your Honor , is because they claim there is infringement in that code , they say it 's really UNIX code and so the appropriate notice had to be one that said this is actually UNIX code .
And since they did n't do that , the GPL has no absolutely no application .
But if they were right , Judge , if they were right in that argument , then all anybody would ever have to do is to say :
You know , what , I think Linux infringes and so it's an impermissible derivative work , and I am therefore no longer subject to the terms of the GPL , and I 'll go off and sue you , and then I will continue to distribute it under the terms of the GPL , putting the notice on there and make my profits from it and pretend as if it applies to me selectively .
We 're talking about the same code , Your Honor .
It 's a labeling game of calling it UNIX and saying it was n't GPL because it does n't say SCO UNIX .
It 's there .
It has the label of the GPL on it .
It 's therefore distributed under the terms of it .
That 's the way they got it from IBM , Your Honor , when they got the 700,000 lines of code from IBM .
And it was only on the terms and conditions of the IBM GPL license , the designation that we put there on our code , that they had permission to use it .
Now , as to that code , they have undertaken the position to assert rights as to that , that other people can't copy it , they can't distribute it , they can't use it , though it 's our code with our copyright notice issued duly from the Copyright Office because they say it infringes .
And that , Your Honor , respectfully , turns the GPL on it 's head .
And if it were read and construed in that way , it would be effectively a meaningless document .
Not that SCO would n't love that exact result , but courts tend not to reward such doings as this .
SCO seems unaware of it , but I think it admits to a GPL breach in its defense , claiming that it never put the GPL notice in SCO 's Linux Server 4.0 : IBM specifies this program is free software .
You can redistribute it and / or modify it under the terms of the general public license , and it includes at the bottom a copy of the general public license .
But section zero required IBM to do this if they wanted to open source the product .
There is no such language in the SCO Server 4.0 product that IBM refers to .
In fact , SCO did n't even place that notice in the product .
And that 's undisputed from Mr. Nagel 's testimony at SCO Exhibit 233 .
Now , I want to be clear , Your Honor , about why IBM is wrong in claiming that SCO had licensed the UNIX material in Linux under the GPL when it distributed verbatim copies of Linux as part of SCO 's Linux Server 4.0
And we explained this point at pages 8 to 10 of our brief .
The point is that the GPL licensee does not , by distributing a verbatim copy of the GPL software , claim to have made any material in that software licensed under the GPL .
If I 've understood what he 's saying , that alone would be a violation of the GPL , I think , to redistribute GPL code without the GPL .
SCO also has a convoluted theory as to why it is n't in breach by attaching restrictions on top of GPL code , something about merely distributing verbatim code giving them an out .
IBM responds :
The suggestion has been made that SCO never modified in any way the kernel , and that simply is not true .
It is n't supported by the evidence that is set out in our papers .
They took the kernel , Judge , of Linux , and they created , based on that kernel , their own product , SCO Linux 4 , which was a modification and a derivative work , something new from the kernel .
Now suddenly the concept of derivative work takes on a new meaning .
When we are not arguing about IBM 's contract motion , derivative work is suddenly a very narrow construct , and it 's very hard to become a derivative work .
By SCO 's own definition and by the definition under the law , Your Honor , there is no question that what they distributed as SCO Linux 4 was a modification subjecting them to the terms of Section 2 - B of the GPL , which , contrary to what Mr. Normand suggests , makes perfectly clear that you can't charge fees of the kind they charged for this software .
And , moreover , Judge , the Sections of the GPL that are at issue , the ones I cited , Section 6 , Section 1 , those do n't turn on having a particular modification .
Those turn on not giving people who gave you code under the GPL , not giving others who received the code under the GPL , the rights to which they are guaranteed under the GPL .
SCO was a licensor and SCO was a licensee and had obligations if it was going to continue to distribute this code .
No one made them distribute our code .
No one made them sell it for a profit .
They undertook that on their own , and when they did , they undertook it subject to the terms and the conditions of the general public license .
Then SCO presents some contract law arguments , but the GPL is a copyright permission license , so the argument that you can't repudiate unless you give notice is plainly not what the terms of the GPL say , and the GPL says if you redistribute , which SCO admits to , then you have accepted the terms of the GPL .
There is no right under the GPL to rewrite the terms , which is what SCO tries here to do .
On the GPL motions , you really should read IBM's Redacted Reply Memorandum in Further Support of its Motion for SJ on its Claim for Copyright Infringement ( 10th Counterclaim ) [ PDF ] , particularly beginning on page 11 , where IBM answers SCO 's nonsensical GPL misunderstandings .
I am giving them the benefit of every doubt when I say misunderstandings .
I do n't actuallly believe 100 % that any competent lawyer could get it so wrong and not realize it .
Final Motion - What He Said Finally , SCO would like Mr. McBride and SCO to escape from responsibility for all the trash talk they spread from coast to coast and around the world .
SCO says they have the right to say truthful things about what their case was about under the privilege and qualified privilege doctrines .
Of course , their argument suffers from Darl 's " mountain of code " hyperbole , which resulted in 4 telephone book sized scrapbooks of collected clippings from just one month of SCO PR , as IBM attorney Amy Sorenson points out :
But SCO 's cases concerning this qualified privilege are summarized at tab 13 of our binder , and they make the point nicely that no Court has anticipated , much less held , that a qualified privilege to summarize one 's claim to the media should be extended to provide immunity to a litigant that embarks on a nationwide negative publicity campaign about a competitor and its products and services , which has been waged for years , and which continues to the present day .
Instead , each of SCO 's cases concern a single press release or a single press conference , and as a result , they offer SCO no support in its attempts to avoid liability for the wide - ranging misconduct that is at issue here .
For example , IBM Exhibit 147 is a letter written by Mr. McBride to Congress claiming that Open Source software and Linux are nothing short of a threat to our nation 's economy and to our nation 's national security .
These are the kinds of statements that have nothing to do with the litigation .
They far exceed any scope of any qualified privilege because they are in no way a mere summary , at one point in time , of its allegations that are at issue in the case .
In addition , IBM has provided numerous cases -- this is at tab 15 of our binder -- holding that this kind of conduct , where a litigant actively stimulates press coverage and wide publicity of a Complaint is beyond the pale of judicial privilege protection .
Far from distinguishing them , SCO ignores them in its reply , and it has ignored them today .
This is , in effect , an argument about excessive publication , and if there has ever been a case for excessive publication , I would submit it is here , where SCO has made numerous , repeated statements to the media about IBM 's products and services and its rights to own , control and profit from AIX and Dynix and sell and profit from Linux - related services .
As this Court has stated in a previous decision in the SCO vs .
Novell case , the issue of whether there has been excessive publication is a question of fact and therefore not appropriate for resolution on summary judgment .
Perhaps the exhibit that makes the point best about the volume of SCO 's public statements here and the extent of its excessive publication , over publication and the fact that it has exceeded any qualified privilege and certainly any litigation privilege , is made at tab 14 .
This excerpt is a Fortune Magazine article from May 17 , 2004 , only just one year into the litigation , and that article opens with the observation that in the ascetic waiting room of the SCO Group 's Lindon , Utah headquarters , the only reading matter is a stack of beige telephone - book sized binders .
They are volumes 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 of the company 's press clippings for the previous month .
There is a difference , in other words , between a single press release announcing litigation and the reasons for it and a multi- year PR campaign such as SCO undertook .
Here , IBM is arguing against SCO 's summary judgment motion ; IBM very much wants the jury to hear this part .

For plaintiff , Mr. Brent Hatch , Mr. Ted Normand , Mr. Stuart Singer .
For defendant , Mr. David Marriott , Ms. Amy Sorenson , Mr. Peter Donaldson , Mr. Todd Shaughnessy , Mr. Joseph Kriesh and Mr. Jefferson Bell .
All right .
We have IBM 's motion for summary judgment on its claim for declaratory judgment of non-infringement .
Is that the one you want to do first ?
MR .
MARRIOTT : It is , Your Honor .
THE COURT : And are you arguing ?
MR .
MARRIOTT : I am .
THE COURT : And Mr. Singer ?
MR. SINGER : I 'll be arguing .
THE COURT : How long is this one supposed to take ?
MR .
MARRIOTT : I believe 45 minutes a side , Your Honor .
MR .
SINGER : That 's correct .
THE COURT : All right .
Go ahead , Mr. Marriott .
MR .
MARRIOTT : Thank you .
Your Honor , we have , as always , a book .
If I may approach .
3 THE COURT : Yes .
MR .
MARRIOTT : After promoting Linux for nearly a decade , Your Honor , SCO changed management and undertook a series of legal attacks against it .
And despite the fact that it contributed Linux and it induced thousands to use it , it threatened users of Linux with infringement including IBM .
And to put an end to the fear , the uncertainty and the doubt generated by those allegations , IBM filed a claim asking this Court to declare that the kernel of Linux does not infringe the copyrights purportedly owned by SCO .
Now , when IBM last moved for summary judgment on this issue , Your Honor , which motion Your Honor denied as premature , you observed that SCO had produced no competent evidence in support of its allegations of infringement .
And now four years after the commencement of this suit , nothing has changed .
There 's no competent evidence to support the conclusion of infringement .
And as illustrated , Your Honor , at Tab 1 of our book , SCO 's allegations and infringement failed for five independent reasons , any one of which is a basis for summary judgment .
Now , before I come to those , Your Honor , if I may , by way of background , let me say this .
As you know , for years SCO pronounced that there were more than a million lines of code controlled by it in the Linux kernel , as we illustrated 4 in Tab 2 .
At the end of the day , however , when all is said and done , there are 326 lines of code in the Linux kernel which supposedly infringed SCO 's alleged copyrights .
That 's it .
326 lines of code in the Linux kernel .
The allegedly infringing code is trivial in size , Your Honor , less than one 5,000th of a percent of the kernel .
And as we illustrated at Tab 3 of the book , it is equivalent of one spectator in 20,000 in an arena the size of the former Delta Center .
The actual code , Judge , appears at Tab 4 , Tabs 4 and 5 of the book and here on the easel to my left and Your Honor 's right .
And so that it 's perfectly clear , Your Honor , IBM did not contribute a single one of these 326 lines of code to Linux .
Most of it was there long before IBM had anything to do with Linux .
And as I will show Your Honor , much of it is there because of SCO and its support for Linux .
Now , portions , Your Honor , of the lines of these 326 lines of codes are not actually coded , although they are comments .
And if you look either in your binder or on the chart , you will see that that which is in yellow represents comments not code .
Now , as for the actual code , Judge , 11 out of the 12 files that are at issue here consists of what is called header file code .
And , in fact , it 's not executable file , executable code at all .
It does essentially nothing in terms 5 of being executed .
It is interface information , Your Honor .
It describes how information is shared among the components of an operating system .
And as we show at Tabs 6 through 8 of the book , Your Honor , this header file code consists of header file information of three types .
And just so that it 's clear exactly what we 're talking about , let me describe briefly what each of these three types is .
First type , Your Honor , are so - called # define statements .
The second are structure declaration , and the third are function prototypes .
Let me just say a word briefly about each those .
A #define , Your Honor , specifies a shorthand or abbreviations .
It put it differently , it simply names and numbers associated with anything you might want .
Anything that could happen in connection with a computer an error might have associated with it a name and a number .
Of the 326 lines that are at issue , 121 of those lines are #define statements .
And to give Your Honor an example of what a # define statement is , consider , if you would , the abbreviation for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals .
10th Cir. The Cir , Your Honor , is the name that would be assigned , and the 10 is the number that is assigned .
If you want to take an actual example of the code , if you would look under the first file , the first line says , # define EPERM , Your Honor .
And what that 6 says is that if there is a user that attempts to access a file to which that user does n't have permission , the system will indicate there is an error , an error for lack of permission .
So the E for error , the PERM for permission and the number 1 is associated with that .
That is what a # define statement is , Your Honor , much like Circuit 10th .
If you take a look at the next type of information in these files , structure declarations .
They specify , Judge , how information is to be stored and how it is to be displayed .
To put it differently , a structure declaration is a collection of related data values .
And of the 326 items that are at issue in this case , 164 lines of them are structure declarations .
There 's somewhere south of 20 or so structure definitions within those lines .
And to continue the case citation analogy , Your Honor , structure declaration is like the format for a case .
If you had a case , its format would be name of case , reporter , court and date .
That is in effect a structure declaration .
And if you want to take an actual example from this code , Your Honor , if you look at file Number 10 there , it provides that , one of the structure declarations there provides that when specifically identifying a computer system , you should say what the machine is , what version it is , what release it is and the type of machine on which it runs .
Those 7 are examples of things that come in structure declarations .
It 's the operating system saying , what kind of machine am I writing on ?
Well , it 's this kind of machine .
It 's that version .
It 's that release .
That 's what a structure declaration does , Your Honor .
It allows users to understand how components of the operating system interrelate .
Finally , Judge , function prototypes .
It specifies what operations may be performed , using what inputs and producing what outputs .
And of the 326 lines of codes that are at issue , there are 12 function prototypes .
So if you were to go to a cite , Your Honor , like Westlaw and you were to try to use the find function , the find function which has you put in certain parameters in a case would allow you to find that case .
And that is in effect what a function prototype is .
So if you look at the chart , the second blue line , Your Honor , Line 67 of file number 5 , you 'll see a function prototype called message send .
And that says that if you provide the message recipient ID and the message and the length of the message , any extra information , like if you wanted it to be sent high priority , that will tell you whether the message was properly sent .
And if it does n't go through , an error will register .
And you might get that like an EPERM number 1 .
Now , finally , Your Honor , before coming to the five 8 bases of summary judgment , let me just underscore , that though this is IBM 's motion , it is SCO as the party asserting infringement that bears the burden to establish that IBM's Linux activities have infringed the alleged copyrights .
And at Tab 9 in the book we lay that out for the Court .
Point number one , Your Honor .
Summary judgment should be entered in favor of IBM because SCO cannot establish unauthorized copying by IBM of copyrights owned by SCO .
And there are three separate reasons why that 's the case , and with Your Honor 's permission I want to deal with just two of them today .
The first reason is , Your Honor , despite this Court 's order that SCO tell IBM exactly what it is that IBM has supposedly done to infringe on these 326 lines of code , no information has been provided in SCO 's final disclosures .
And a second reason is , Your Honor , the copyrights at issue on this record we submit are owned by Novell , not by SCO .
And third , Your Honor , SCO transferred any rights it had in the code that is at issue to UnitedLinux for reasons we discussed at the last hearing , and I 'll reiterate here .
I 'd like to , Your Honor , if I may take the first and third of those and to defer the second to another day .
To the question whether Novell or SCO owned these copyrights will be addressed in the Novell litigation .
It 's briefed here , and I 'm happy to answer any questions Your Honor has about it , but 9 I think in the interest of time I 'll focus on 1 and 3 .
That brings me to 1 , Your Honor .
As we will see at Tab 11 of the book , SCO has repeatedly by this Court and Magistrate Judge Wells been ordered to identify with specificity its allegations of infringement to tell IBM how it is supposedly IBM has infringed this code .
And that is n't in the final disclosures or any of SCO 's interrogatories responses provide that information .
And if Your Honor looks at Tab 12 in the book , you will see in IBM's , its support of IBM 's motion for summary judgment , we laid out the fact that SCO failed to provide this information .
And what we got in response , Your Honor , is in effect , not a demonstration of where the information supposedly was provided , but yet another statement that SCO was not obligated to provide the information provided .
As shown at Tab 13 , again , Your Honor , this Court and Magistrate Judge Wells have been clear .
If it was n't described with specificity in the final disclosures , it 's out of the case .
And respectfully , no information has been provided to describe the allegations of infringement .
And for that reason alone , Your Honor , summary judgment should be entered in favor of IBM .
Now we come to the third reason , I 'm skipping the second , third reason why SCO cannot prove that IBM has infringed copyright owned by SCO , is that SCO transferred any 10 interest , any ownership interest it had in the allegedly infringed code to the UnitedLinux , LLC .
Let me walk Your Honor through that .
As you 'll recall from the last year in May of 2002 , SCO partnered with other Linux distributors to form a joint venture called UnitedLinux .
And it was formed to streamline , in effect standardize Linux distributions .
Each member of that UnitedLinux effort signed an agreement under which they assigned their intellectual property rights in the joint development product to the UnitedLinux , LLC .
And as we discussed in previous arguments , Your Honor , SCO 's SCO Linux 4 was the joint development product of UnitedLinux of SCO .
And as illustrated at Tab 19 , Your Honor , of the book you 'll see that the joint development contract defines the UnitedLinux software to be , quote :
At any implementation of the UNIX operating system developed and integrated under any conditions of the JDC .
Both of the appendices of the JDC explain that to mean an implementation based on a modified version of the Linux kernel .
And as we illustrate at Tab 20 of the book , Your Honor , SCO has admitted that its SCO Linux 4 was a product developed pursuant to the JDC .
And in a press release of 19 November 2002 , SCO stated , quote : SCO Linux 4.0 is based upon UnitedLinux 1.0 , 11 the core standard base Linux operating system , development in an industry initiative to streamline Linux development , and so on .
As we show at Tab 21 , Your Honor : SCO Linux 4 powered by UnitedLinux included the 326 lines that are at issue .
It follows , Your Honor , that the 326 lines at issue were in the software development pursuant to the JDC .
And so unless the 326 lines of code were excepted from assignment , SCO has no interest or right in those and cannot pursue against IBM or any other claim for copyright infringement .
SCO had pursuant to these agreements , Your Honor , its list of excluded technologies , a specific list .
And as is demonstrated at Tab 22 , Your Honor , how their list , the successor of the SCO , did not include the 326 lines of code that are at issue here .
And as a result , that code is not owned by SCO , and it may not pursue a claim against IBM again or any other for infringement .
Point 2 , Judge .
IBM has a license .
In fact , it has multiple licenses to the 326 lines of code at issue , as we illustrate at Tab 25 of our book .
Now , time wo n't allow discussion of each of the five licenses that we 've briefed , and so with Your Honor 's permission what I 'd like to do is focus on the two of the licenses that have the broadest coverage , the two licenses that cover every single one of the 326 lines of codes that are at issue .
And that 's , one , the 12 IBM strategic business agreement between Caldera and IBM ; and second , the GNU general public license of GPL .
And again , I reiterate , all 326 lines of codes were included by SCO in Linux products as distributed under these licenses .
So with that predicate , let me take each of these licenses in turn , Your Honor .
First , the strategic business agreement .
As shown at Tab 26 , that was an agreement between IBM and Caldera , and it included a license that provided as follows : Quote -- well , almost quote .
It provided that Caldera would grant IBM a , quote : Worldwide , perpetual , irrevocable , fully paid - up license to prepare and have prepared derivative works of free existing materials and to use , have used , execute , reproduce , transmit , perform , transfer , distribute and sublicense preexisting materials for their derivative works and to grant others rights under this subsection .
So what are preexisting materials , Your Honor , and their derivatives ?
If you turn to Tab 27 , we follow the chain from one definition to the next that demonstrates that these 326 lines of code were in what was licensed to IBM .
As you 'll see , Your Honor , preexisting materials are defined in relevant part as items contained within a deliverable .
A deliverable is defined as , expressly 13 identified as a deliverable in the statement of work .
The statement of work in term provides the deliverables include license works which are defined to include packaged license works , and packaged license works are further defined in Exhibit A , Your Honor , which describes the packaged license work as the OpenLinux products of SCO including eDesktop , eServer products .
The SCO OpenLinux product line was later named , Your Honor , SCO Linux 4 with release of that product .
But was in any event a derivative of SCO OpenLinux products as we show at Tab 28 .
So SCO granted to IBM , Your Honor , a license to the 326 lines of codes at issue under the strategic business agreements between IBM and SCO .
And again , every one of the lines of code at issue is in there .
Let me drop a footnote , if I may , and I 'll come back to this .
This same agreement , Your Honor , provided IBM a warranty with respect to these 326 lines of codes .
It says : SCO represented that they do not infringe any intellectual property rights of any third party .
They do not infringe any intellectual property rights of any third party .
And at the time , Your Honor , by SCO 's reasoning it was Santa Cruz -- again , we disagree with that -- but it was Santa Cruz that owned the copyrights that SCO now claims it can assert against IBM .
14 That brings me to the GPL .
In addition to granting IBM a license under the SBA , Your Honor , IBM also has a license from SCO to these 326 lines under the GPL .
The GPL in its preamble and elsewhere provides that if you distribute copies of a program licensed under the GPL , that you , quote , must give your recipients all the rights that you have .
It further provides in its preamble that a license gives you the legal permission as a recipient of code distributed under it to copy , distribute and modify the software .
And again , in Section One and Section Two in Section Three , a license is given to the code distributed under the GPL to do exactly that , which purportedly SCO accuses IBM of doing , as I say precisely what IBM was supposed to have done has never been disclosed , Your Honor .
There is no dispute , I respectfully submit , that SCO 's Linux products were distributed under the GPL .
And if you take a look at Tab 32 , you will see in SCO 's own words the following statement :
All of SCO 's Linux distributions prior to and after May 2003 were made under the GPL .
Therefore , IBM , Your Honor , has not one license , but two licenses to the material issue without regard to the three licenses that I 'll leave to the briefing .
Third point , Your Honor .
SCO is estopped from pursuing against IBM a claim for copyright infringement .
SCO 15 has a long history , Your Honor , as a supporter of Linux , and it is that history that precludes precisely the conduct which indicates here , to sue for infringement relating to Linux .
SCO was not only founded as a Linux company , Your Honor , it distributed and it profited from Linux including those lines of code for a very long time .
And as we demonstrate at Tab 43 , SCO 's various Linux products again included exactly this code , and SCO employees have testified to that effect .
Ralf Flaxa , for example , who was head of SCO 's development in Europe , testified , quote :
While employed at Caldera , I was aware that the allegedly infringing material was present in Linux .
I know so because of my familiarity with Linux and also because Caldera is incorporated in its Linux products .
Now as I said , Your Honor , the code was distributed under the GPL .
In addition to that fact that that grants IBM a license , it also has an affect with respect to estoppel , because again , the license provides that that which one gives to others under the GPL , one gives that person 's rights in that material to those other persons .
So SCO was n't just family in the Linux company .
They did n't just distribute it under the GPL .
They produced what they described as an award winning set of Linux products 16 that made it , in their words , a leader in the movement toward the adoption of Linux .
And again , based on the exact code that is at issue .
So if you take a look at Tab 46 of the book , you will see a list of some of the awards that Caldera won for its promotion and sponsorship of Linux .
Linux Show 's Best Distribution of the Millennium .
Linux Journal 's Product of the Year award and CNET Editor 's Choice Award .
THE COURT : Where does this illustration come from in 46 ?
This cup with all this money ?
MR .
MARRIOTT : Someone on our team made that up , Your Honor .
As a leader in the Linux community , SCO played an important role in the standardization of UNIX .
And putting aside UnitedLinux , which I 'll come back to , SCO was the first signatory of a document proposing the so - called Linux standards base .
Santa Cruz also , SCO 's purported successor , was in support of that .
And the Linux standards base was an attempt to define the common core of components that represent the Linux operating system .
And the LSB at issue here , Your Honor , required inclusion in Linux of the code that we 're talking about .
SCO sponsored the standard .
The standard required the code .
And as SCO former CEO , Your Honor , Ransom Love , has testified , quote :
To facilitate the porting of Linux to 17 application written primarily for UNIX - based operating systems , Caldera , Inc. , worked to make Linux products compliant with various UNIX standards , including the X / Open brand for UNIX 95 , and the POSIX.1 specification .
So again the allegedly infringing is there in part because of the SCO sponsored the standardization of Linux .
Now , in fact , Your Honor , SCO was the only notable support of one of the items as to which they accused IBM of infringing .
STREAMS material , which , in fact , is n't even in the kernel .
But SCO required the use of this material as support for its Netware for Linux products .
The Linux community opposed the inclusion of this material in the kernel .
But despite that opposition , SCO collaborated with others to have it included , made it available for download from its website .
And now that very same material that it accuses IBM and others of infringing is there because in effect SCO put it there , Your Honor .
Santa Cruz , SCO 's purported predecessor , hosted and Caldera participated in a 1997 meeting to perform a group called 86 Open , which we show at Tab 51 .
Mr. Torvalds proposed then creating a new application format to replace the existing ELF format that was implemented in Linux .
Santa Cruz opposed the proposal , however , and insisted instead on a Linux ELF so the programs could more 18 easily run on the SCO UNIX .
The ELF standard was adopted at least in part because of SCO 's effort .
And it is that precise standard which SCO now contends represents an act of infringement in the Linux kernel .
In 1999 , Santa Cruz commissioned a study to compare Linux to UNIX .
And according to the chief SCO engineer , that study found certain similarities between UNIX and Linux .
But it found that the similarities were understandable and acceptable .
Management of the current SCO , however , has publicly taken the position that that memo showed there was something wrong with Linux .
And despite their view , however , that something was wrong with Linux as indicated by that memo , both Santa Cruz , Your Honor , and SCO continued over the course of the following number of years supporting and promoting Linux despite the supposed concern convinced by this memorandum .
As SCO 's former CEO put it in 2001 when Caldera acquired certain UNIX assets , quote :
We did not care whether UNIX source code had been included in Linux improperly , and we did not at any point disclose that there might be any problem with Linux .
At the very same time , Your Honor , that Santa Cruz was conducting this analysis with Mr. Swartz , Caldera was approaching IBM about entering into this strategic business agreement that I discussed with Your Honor a few moment ago .
19 And that courtship resulted in , culminated in the execution of that strategic business plan .
I explained previously how that agreement resulted in a license for IBM .
But independent of the license , Your Honor , and you 'll recall I said I 'd come back to this , there was a warranty and a representation made in that strategic business agreement that there was no infringing code of any third party in the Linux kernel .
That representation was made by Caldera , by SCO 's predecessor .
It promised IBM , Your Honor , that there was no supposed infringement in there , and it also promised to hold IBM harmless and indemnify it against any third party intellectual property claims .
Now , rather than make a public issue of this , Your Honor , raises concerns , commence litigation , SCO undertook , instead , following that effort to initiate and to participate in and to champion the UnitedLinux effort .
And Caldera and SCO were not simply participants in the UnitedLinux effort , Your Honor , they were champions of it .
Ransom Love , the former CEO , has been described as the champion of the project , And Ralf Flaxa , a former Caldera employee , was described as coordinating the creation of this united standardized version of Linux .
And again , everyone in aligned code is in their UnitedLinux product .
Courts , Your Honor , have estopped parties from asserting claims of discriminate based on showings far less 20 than that which is here .
And respectfully , Your Honor , we would submit that the Court should exercise its powers to enter summary judgment in favor of IBM on grounds of estoppel .
That brings me to my next point , which is that SCO cannot establish , Your Honor , that there is substantial similarity between Linux and UNIX .
There are two reasons here why summary judgment should be entered in favor of IBM .
The first is that none of the supposedly infringed material , Your Honor , there were 320 lines of UNIX code supposedly infringed by these 326 , and none of those 320 lines are protective by copyright .
The second point , Your Honor , is even if they were , SCO could n't just demonstrate that those lines of code result in substantial similarity as between Linux and UNIX .
Now let me briefly just take each of those points , Your Honor .
As to protectability , in IBM 's papers we laid out a variety of reasons as to why these 320 lines are not protected .
And the law is pretty clear that the material is not protectable by copyright if it 's dictated by externalities , if it 's unoriginal or if it 's mere merger material .
As we laid out in our papers , Your Honor , those 320 lines of code are dictated by externalities , they are unoriginal and they are merger material .
And the notable point to make here , Your Honor , with respect to externalities , IBM put forward evidence that five separate externalities dictate that 320 lines of code .
21 SCO 's experts failed to respond , Your Honor , in any meaningful way to two of them .
And we respectfully submit that for that reason alone , those two externalities should be deemed admitted as against SCO .
That 's programming practice and industry standard .
As to originality , we likewise offer evidence that the code at issue lacks the requisite originality .
And SCO disagrees with that , Your Honor , and has offered testimony of their expert Mr. Cargill .
But the methodology on which Mr. Cargill relied to conclude that the material at issue is original is , we respectfully believe , wrong as a matter of law .
For example , Mr. Cargill stated , Your Honor , that the choices used to list names in alphabetical order and to assign numbers in a sequential order , evidences reference to the creativity to satisfy his standard to determine whether that matter is original within the meaning of the copyright law .
And that is wrong for the reasons set out in our papers and the reasons set out in the Supreme Court decision in Feist and in 10th Circuit decision in Mitel .
And looking , Your Honor , at the code issue here , I would submit that there is no cognizable originality in this .
Calling in error occurs when a person seeks to access a file for which they have no permission , EPERM , evinces no originality , anymore than saying that the 10th Circuit Court 22 of Appeals should be referred to at 10 Cir reflects any originality .
Finally , Your Honor , as to protectability , IBM put forward evidence that the material at issue is merger material .
SCO failings to offer any meaningful response to that , Your Honor .
And again even if it had , even if that which is offered by SCO 's expert Mr. Cargill were sufficient to create a fact question , and we do not believe it is , but even if it were , Your Honor , that information is not information that was properly disclosed by SCO as it was required to be disclosed pursuant to Court 's order .
And again , just looking at the material issue , Your Honor , there are only so many ways to say that a computer system is Linux , and it's this version , and it's that release .
And that 's what some of the structured declarations do here , Your Honor .
There 's only so many ways to put it , just like there are only so many ways to organize the information in a case name .
Case , reporter , court and date .
Now , the second part of this , Your Honor , is that even if this material was protectable , and we submit it 's not , SCO could n't and we submit has not shown substantial similarity .
Substantial similarity is not all about quantity to be sure .
But quantity is an important nevertheless part of that as reflected by the 11th Circuit 's decision in the Mitel case .
And 320 lines , Your Honor , of the millions of lines of 23 code at issue here are not of significance .
And in any event , when you look to the qualitative aspect of this code , there is no more significance to the codes than there is when you look at it from a quantitative perspective .
We are not talking , Your Honor , about 320 contiguous lines of executable code .
We are talking about a scattered collection of code .
None of the header files are executable , Your Honor .
They are simply interface that provide information like if there 's an error , let 's call it EPERM and assign a number 1 do it .
And that we respectfully submit is not protectable by copyright .
Finally , Your Honor , with respect to misuse , SCO has misused the copyrights at issue , and as a result of that misuse may not enforce them .
SCO does n't dispute that a copyright may not be enforced , Your Honor , if it has been misused .
We think the facts here establish that .
SCO claims control of more than a million lines of code supposedly dumped into Linux kernel .
By contrast , there 's 326 lines properly described in its final disclosures .
And among the lines of code claimed by SCO as infringing , Your Honor , are files plainly and indisputably owned by IBM , like JFS , files plainly and indisputably owned by BSD and information which SCO 's own experts concede they have no claims of copyright infringement .
For those reasons , Your Honor , respectfully summary judgment should be entered in favor of IBM .
Thank you .
24 THE COURT : Thank you , Mr. Marriott .
Mr. Singer ?
MR .
SINGER : Your Honor if I might approach with some materials for the Court .
THE COURT : Sure .
MR .
SINGER : And for counsel , as well .
Your Honor , if it may please the Court , this is a claim by one of the world 's biggest enforcers of intellectual properties rights , IBM , which publicly boasts of annually earning over a billion dollars from enforcing its intellectual property portfolio to seek to extend its fight with SCO by seeking a judicial declaration that SCO conversely has no rights .
Now , as we listen to IBM 's position and read their papers , it seems to be this .
It seeks through its counterclaim to enforce and determine first that SCO has no copyrights , even though Mr. Marriott did n't want to argue that point .
Yet , that the copyrights it does not own were assigned to a joint venture .
IBM seeks a declaration that UNIX copyrights do n't cover any protectable expression and that they 're basically worthless with respect to the issues as they relate to Linux .
While at the same time , they are so important that they led to a series of no fewer than four licenses which were negotiated and apparently IBM claims reliance on the use of this 25 material .
And finally , IBM says that despite having obtained licenses , it could properly ignore the language and the limitations in those agreements and just rely instead on the fact that Caldera was involved in Linux activities , and so therefore anything IBM wanted to do was okay .
We submit just to state that contradictory refusing sets of arguments points out the fact that this is not appropriate for summary judgment .
Well , let 's take a look at what IBM's Tenth Counterclaim really seeks .
And I would ask Your Honor to turn to the small book , which are a set of our exhibits to Tab 1 .
And we ask , what does IBM's Tenth Counterclaim really seek ?
And I think that leads to a comparison of what IBM said when they filed their Tenth counterclaim back in 2004 and how they characterize it now .
If you look at that Tenth Counterclaim , Paragraph 171 particular , IBM said that it did not believe that its activities relating to Linux , not talking specifically about the Linux kernel , but it 's activities relating to Linux including any use , reproduction and improvement of Linux do not infringe , induce infringement or continue to infringement .
Now today IBM says , we 're just seeking a declaration from this Court that the Linux kernel , the core of 26 the operating system , does not infringe copyrights owned by SCO .
Why the difference ?
The difference is so that IBM can stand up and seek to argue to the Court that only 326 lines of code are at issue .
By defining the Linux kernel so narrowly , by relying on solution of items from our December disclosures , from assuming that everything in our expert reports concerning non-literal copying will be struck and upheld by this Court , by assuming that technologies that involve interaction between that kernel and the user space around it , such as STREAMS , such as ELF are out of case , they define it as 326 lines .
THE COURT : Let me ask you a question about that .
Hypothetically , assume I do n't reconsider my November 29th order and hypothetically assume that I uphold Judge Wells '
November 30 order that was written on December 21st , what affect does that have on this motion ?
MR .
SINGER : Your Honor , everything in this book is still indicates -- THE COURT : This one .
MR .
SINGER : The big book -- is still indicates assuming both of those orders were sustained .
The code which is in this big book shows precisely with copying in red and lines tied to the items still in the case indisputably not struck by Judge Wells , the copy that occurred between Linux and our protected expression .
They are in red .
There are lines going from the left - hand to the right - hand side of the 27 page .
They are divided into four categories , and there are thousands and thousands of lines .
We have put them in parallel in various places in the book , smaller book , but this shows why IBM is seeking to narrow the declaration it seeks from the Linux activities in general and its support of Linux and its copying of Linux because these things go along with Linux .
Linux does n't work without STREAMS .
It does n't work without ELF .
It wo n't work without these header files .
By seeking to redefine their request for declaratory relief they 're able to say only 326 lines are at issue , when in reality everything in this book , even assuming every order by Judge Wells is upheld , everything in this book is still in the case and it is still subject to this claim .
And we would submit it is meaningless , and I do n't know why IBM would seek a declaration only on 326 lines when it does n't eliminate the fear and uncertainty and doubt they talk about with respect to all the things around the kernel that is protected copyright and expression .
Your Honor , with respect to the burden of proof , this is IBM 's action for declaratory judgment .
And under 10th Circuit law , IBM has the burden of proof .
If one turns to Tab 2 , you see the Wuv 's case , which is a District of Colorado district court decision , citing 10th Circuit case in Steiner Sales making it plain in this circuit , the plaintiff 28 in declaratory action carries the burden of proving its claims .
And you 'll notice in the book which you received from IBM , they cite cases in the District of Maryland , the Northern District of California and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania , none , of course , which is in the 10th Circuit .
Now , I 'd like to turn to the issue that Mr. Marriott did not address .
I wo n't spend a lot of time on it , but they put a lot of time in their briefs on it , you 've heard it about every opportunity , and it 's a central issue in this case , and that 's the issue of who owns the UNIX copyrights .
It is our contention , Your Honor , that the documents make clear that those were transferred as part of the sales of UNIX business from Novell to Santa Cruz in what we know as the asset purchase agreement .
The agreement as Your Honor has heard clearly indicated the intent was to transfer that entire business .
There was an assets schedule of assets to be transferred , which specifically said that all rights and ownership of UNIX and UnixWare including all versions , all technical installation , the source code , the documentation , all of sellers ' rights under software development contracts , all those contracts , all of that is transferred .
The only reason we submit there could be any 29 question at all was because of the way in which an item in the excluded assets schedule was originally worded .
It was worded in Item 5A of that schedule as excluding the copyrights , all copyrights and trademarks .
That was in error .
It did n't make any sense that you transfer the entire business of UNIX , you exclude the copyrights .
And that was clarified in Amendment Number 2 , which made clear that what Novell retained were copyrights and trademarks except for the copyrights and trademarks owned by Novell as of the date of the agreement required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
And I submit , Your Honor , it cannot be any real question you need the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights to run a UNIX and UnixWare business , the right to extend intellectual property to others , to enforce those intellectual property rights against infringements .
This amendment clarified what was transferred as of the time of the closing because then with this amendment there 's no confusion as to what is covered on the schedule of transferred assets .
It 's all right , title and interest .
Now , we do n't even think it 's necessary to look to extrinsic evidence , and , of course , Mr. Marriott does n't want to argue any of this .
And I have to say I probably would n't want to argue a motion where witnesses on both sides agree that it was the intent to transfer the copyrights to 30 Santa Cruz .
And this is set forth in our book .
It is included in summary form at Tab 11 , and behind that , more lengthier quotes from each of these witness who have testified under oath both from Novell , the lead Novell negotiator , the senior business executive , the senior engineer as well as Santa Cruz that the copyrights were intended to be transferred .
Now , there are other extrinsic evidence of conduct set forth in our book that support that .
There is simply no question we think here that there was a valid transfer , and those rights are owned by SCO .
And , of course , it is the Novell trial the Court has set that will determine the ownership of those copyrights to the extent that Novell continues to assert that they did not transfer them despite the expressed intent of parties on both sides of that transaction .
Now , IBM contends that these copyrights that we did not own we nevertheless managed to assign to a joint venture called UnitedLinux .
And before turning to the merits of that contention , I 'd like to say a few words about the unusual strategic posture of it .
Novell , as the Court will recall , moved last year to stay parts of the case involving Novell because their wholly - owned subsidiary SuSe Linux had initiated an arbitration in Europe against SCO where this issue is precisely what is to be determined under the arbitration .
31 What were the rights under the UnitedLinux agreement ?
Now IBM with whom Novell has a joint offense agreement concerning these two cases comes in here and says , Judge , you should decide those issues as a matter of summary judgment in this case .
We do n't think that is appropriate .
And we think that if this is an issue which is going to be decided and the Court is going to look to it , decide it in a forum where parties directly involved are going to resolve these differences , as Novell urged this Court last year , and the Court agreed upon .
Now , it is clear that this is not a matter of summary judgment , and we think it is equally clear that the UnitedLinux agreement did not give up our intellectual property rights .
Your Honor , if you turn to Tab 15 we see that the key assignment of intellectual property rights was the intellectual property to be development pursuant to the JDC .
You form a joint venture , and you say that we assign the rights which are going to come out of the work done by the joint venture .
There was not an intention by participating in that to give up rights either to UNIX or to anything that might be sitting around in Linux as it went into that joint venture .
The term software is defined as implementation of 32 the Linux system to be developed through the joint venture .
There is evidence in the record that the copyright in UNIX material was not developed pursuant to the joint venture .
And , in fact , as a factual matter , during the joint venture , SCO was asked to contribute UNIX technology , and SCO refused .
And that 's Mr. Nagle 's declaration , which is SCO 's Exhibit 233 .
Now , the preexisting material which Mr. Marriott refers to , which is listed on Exhibit C , and we have a copy of that behind our arguments slide at Tab 16 , that is the only material which UnitedLinux of existing material from Caldera was authorized to use .
And it did not include the System V UNIX code .
Mr. Nagle says that in his declaration .
Even Mr. Love , who is a witness for IBM , agrees with that .
And therefore , it is not part of what either expressly in Exhibit C UnitedLinux had a right to use , nor is the issue here over material that was created in a joint venture .
Now , Your Honor , this is not the exact sequence in which Mr. Marriott dealt with these points , but I 'd like to turn to the next issue , which is the question of whether we have put forth enough evidence to defeat summary judgment on the issue of infringement , that IBM by distributing and copying and inducing others to distribute and copy Linux have infringed our copyrights .
The very first argument that IBM makes in Tab 18 of 33 our binder relates to this , is that we cannot prove unauthorized copying .
We did n't have a line , I suppose , in the December disclosures that says , IBM infringes our copyrights by copying and reproducing Linux .
Now , that 's what they say in their brief , and that 's what they say in their papers .
But listen to what IBM 's counsel said to Your Honor two years ago , more than two years ago in September of 2004 when they were resisting discovery to the issue of their Linux activities .
They said , quote :
It is not disputed that we copied Linux and we encouraged others to copy Linux .
That 's not in dispute .
We admit that we copied .
No discovery with respect to IBM's Linux activities is required .
And , of course , the record has Mr. Frye from IBM admitting the same thing .
That constitutes infringement .
And as the cases we set forth on the very next page at Tab 18 indicate , if Linux infringes UNIX , their activity in copying Linux is infringement .
If Linux infringes our UNIX copyrights , their encouragement of third party copying and reproduction also infringement .
So there 's no issue here .
Now , the question is whether Linux is copied from UNIX in a way that violates our protectable rights .
And that is inherently a factual matter for fact evidence and expert testimony .
The 10th Circuit recognized that .
We reproduced 34 this at Tab 19 when they said :
Whether the defendant copied portions of the plaintiff 's program is a factual matter .
And it 's the Gates Rubber case .
There are a lot of facts that indicate this .
I mean , if one goes just to IBM 's own documentary admissions , a couple of which we 've put on this blow - up of Exhibit 276 where IBM internally says , Linux is derived from UNIX .
UNIX was a pre-write of Linux .
It is proved by this book , Your Honor , that these thousands of similarities did not occur by coincidence .
This was copying and certainly at a minimum is a factual matter .
We have put in both in that book and here in four areas , system calls , ELF - related materials , STREAMS - related material and memory allocation material where there is no question , even under Judge Wells ' order that those are indicates and we have appropriate claims .
Now , we do not agree with Judge Wells ' order which limited our copyright case in that matter .
At Tab 26 , we point out the fact that in addition to copying literal code , code in that book , there was a copying of the non-literal protectable elements .
The structure , the algorithms of UNIX .
That did n't mean we contend to be in the December disclosures as specific material misused .
If we had said they copied the Linux structure , IBM would move to strike it on the grounds 35 that we did n't cite line , version and code .
It is indisputably within the May 2005 expert report set forth which IBM ignores in its motion and IBM 's motion is predicated on us not having any rights to talk about non-literal copying .
Non-literal copying is recognized by the 10th Circuit in Gates and by every other case as a relevant inquiry where experts have to go through an abstraction process and determine what are the protectable elements , go through that and filter it of unprotectable material and then compare it .
IBM experts in IBM 's motion have done none of that with respect to the non-literal issues .
Just this chart which we produced shows the structure of a system calls between Linux 2.4 and UNIX System V Release 4 their similarity .
That structure we contend is protected .
We contend that the structure just as the STREAMS module , which is put forth at Tab 26 , as well , is protected .
Those should be issues in this case , Your Honor .
Those are the issues we contend in this case .
Your Honor , I would like to say a few words about whether this is protectable expression .
The Gates Rubber case was applied by our expert Tom Cargill .
At Tab 28 , we have an excerpt of Mr. Cargill 's report , which recites the applicable 10th Circuit law , explains how he applied it going through these three steps .
He specifically looked at whether or not 36 the expression being used was dictated by external standards which includes the filtration issue that Mr. Marriott talks about .
It was his opinion that there was infringement .
You know , IBM knew we were going to rely on Mr. Cargill .
They wait until their reply brief on this motion to take shots at Mr. Cargill saying he 's not admissible , that he is n't using the right legal standard , and et cetera .
If they continue to make that argument seriously and the way to do it and the time to do it we submit is a motion in limine or Daubert motion later in the case .
If it is not on grounds coming out of a reply brief to all of a sudden saying to the Court without even giving any response to IBM should determine that Professor Cargill did not apply the right standard , and that when he says this is protectable expression , he somehow applied that test wrongly .
I 'm not going to go through each of the tabs where we deal with the issue of whether this is Scenes a Faire material , whether or not there was enough originality in the expression to be protectable and whether it merged with abstract ideas .
On each of those points , Mr. Cargill gives examples , and he indicates his opinion .
It is clear that you have a strong amount of protectable expression in software code , and we include , in fact , in these papers excerpts from an amicus brief that IBM filed in the Gates Rubber case saying as much , which we think 37 was consistent with Gates Rubber .
It said that source code is generally protectable .
If one turns to Tab 33 , Dr. Cargill 's report is quoted there where he gives an example .
First he says generally there are numerous ways to express the ideas embodied in the copied material .
This is second page of Tab 33 .
And numerous ways to write code that performs the same task of copied material .
He gives an example of a fork being a system call , which could refer to a diverging path .
It relays a certain creativity on behalf of the programmers .
The system called nice is another example .
If you turn to the next page you see IBM 's amicus brief being quoted as well as Gates Rubber decision .
In that brief , IBM said it is not appropriate to conclude that a program 's function -- which is really what Mr. Marriott spent a lot of time talking to you about , the function of a program .
It is not appropriate to conclude that a program 's function and its expression of that function are the same .
At bottom , Your Honor , these issues will have to be decided at trial including the issue of substantial similarity .
You know , it 's interesting that even if only 326 lines of code were at issue , it would still be a factual issue requiring trial on it .
If Your Honor turns to Tab 35 .
38 We have at that tab the Dun & Bradstreet case from the Third Circuit , 27 lines copied out of 525,000 were held they could be substantial .
The US Supreme Court on the next page in the Harper & Row case said that 300 to 400 words cannot be deemed insubstantial .
And they reversed the Second Circuit in that case for so holding .
The Dun and Bradstreet case on the next page is cited to point out that the real importance is determined qualitatively , not quantitatively .
And that the information , while it was only a few lines far less than what we 're talking about in this book , was highly critical .
And there 's no dispute on this record that if you took out of Linux the lines at issue , even just those 326 lines , let alone ELF and STREAMS and everything else that is at issue here Linux simply would not work .
At bottom , as the 10th Circuit said in Gates , the issue of substantial similarity is a classic jury question .
It 's not appropriate for summary judgment .
Your Honor , I would next like to turn to the issue of a license .
And I 'd like to begin by observing the interesting posture in which the issue of a license comes before the Court , because IBM 's position today is that this case could be resolved simply by looking at the SBA , which IBM obviously was aware of as a party to it in 2003 , or the GPL 39 public license , which Caldera they claim gave up its rights in .
And if that is true , Your Honor , where has IBM been with that argument since March of 2003 when this case was filed ?
If this case could have been resolved with respect to these issues simply by coming in here with a copy of the general public license or the SBA , why did n't they do that back in 2003 ?
If that is true , why did n't they do it in 2004 when they made a summary judgment motion to you on this precise counterclaim and never raised either of those issues ?
We submit the reason is because these licenses do not give IBM the rights that today they are asking you to find as a matter of law .
Now , I 'd like to say a few words about the SBA license , the first that Mr. Marriott relies upon .
Tab 37 in our binder and a couple tabs after that we discuss this agreement .
This is an agreement when the Court reviews it is clear it is an agreement to allow distribution of certain products that are then specified in an Exhibit A to a standard of work .
And that standard of work makes it clear that IBM is simply a conduit to end users for the distribution of certain Caldera products and is not being given any intellectual property rights to UNIX software , let alone to give away that UNIX software to others .
If one turns to the next page behind Tab 37 , we 40 quote Section 8.3 .
Your Honor has been directed to part of Section 8.3 when IBM spoke .
It was their Tab 26 .
You could compare Tab 26 which reproduces in part Section 8.3 as opposed to the entire section which in red it includes the material they do not quote .
And that material makes clear that :
The providing party , which was the Caldera , Inc. , will not include any preexisting materials in any deliverable unless they are listed in the relevant standard of work .
And when you turn to the standard of work here , nothing is listed here which gives them the right to distribute , to modify UNIX intellectual property or gives them rights to open source that through Linux or anything else .
That document which , is IBM 467 says : IBM and its authorized agents shall be a conduit through which Caldera sells , offers to sell packaged license work and preload license work .
And the only thing they 're authorized to do is to preload , install and reproduce the preload license work on two particular platforms which are identified in this scope of work , and the master copies are to be used solely for purposes consistent with this standard of work .
That is Section 3.0 .
So at bottom , what this means is if SCO was coming in here and suing IBM for distributing Caldera products that were distributed under this standard of work , they would have 41 an offense .
They could distribute that .
But what this is not in any form of intellectual property license , any release of our rights , anything which gives them or anyone else the right to take UNIX intellectual property and distribute it to the world .
Your Honor , the other license , the GPL license , also fully known from 2003 , never raised then , never raised in 2004 .
Today they suggest that all of IBM's Linux activity is insulated under the GPL .
The GPL , we submit , requires a copyright holder to make a knowing , voluntary express surrender of its copyright rights to its software and then to effectuate that decision with a particular notice spelled out in the general public license , which did not happen here .
We have that at Tab 38 .
Section 0 . And Mr. Normand in the argument that deals with the GPL which Your Honor will hear right after this will have more to say about this , but I 'd like to say a few things about the GPL .
Section 0 says that :
The GPL only applies to work if it bears a notice placed by the copyright holder saying that it may be distributed under the terms of the GPL .
SCO has never placed any language on either UnitedLinux product or SCO Linux Server 4.0 indicating that it was granting any license or rights under GPL or any open source license .
42 That 's both in the record factually through Mr. Nagle .
And while IBM makes generalized assertions that we distributed under the GPL , what , in fact , the record shows is you have products from three divisions .
Two of them were Linux from UnitedLinux that were just passed off .
Whatever license they came with came from them .
And then there was a disk of proprietary material .
There was no SCO license under the GPL Section 0 that was required .
And , in fact , you will see during Mr. Normand 's argument that IBM knows how that license looks for their material that they decided in knowingly and willingly to distribute under open source , you have that copyright authorization notice required under 0 .
It 's set forth in the GPL how to do it .
We reproduced those directions under Tab 38 .
And we 've also put in IBM 's copy of that .
Now , in addition , there is no question , and we put this forth at Tab 39 , that Linux has no copyright attribution to SCO or to Santa Cruz in the materials distributed under the GPL .
That in itself takes it outside that protection .
And I would note in connection with this that even Ransom Love admits that UNIX was not an open source by Caldera .
Now , Mr. Love is someone who IBM submitted a declaration from and we submitted a declaration from .
We disagree strongly with a lot of things Mr. Love said in that declaration .
We also pointed out to the Court what Mr. Love 43 did not disclose , and that is he 's a paid IBM consultant .
But even Mr. Love in his declaration , and I have this excerpted at the last page on Tab 39 , even Mr. Love acknowledged that while Caldera thought about open sourcing UNIX assets , it never did know .
And it certainly did n't do so under the GPL .
And I submit this is why for the last three years of this litigation IBM has n't run into court and say , GPL resolved these issues .
Your Honor , I would also not go into the details of the Spec 1170 license that they argue in their brief , other than to say it was not established it even covers the material here and was only in the material that create -- of license that created specification , not a license to use that in a commercial product that would compete with UNIX .
In addition , there is the TIS issue which is raised in their briefs which Mr. Marriott left to the briefs .
I just want to point out that with respect to that which relates to the ELF , even Mr. Harold , who is an IBM employee , recognized and did not have the authority to that ELF code on the basis of that license .
And that appears at Tab 43 where Mr. Harold in 1999 indicated that SCO was the only source supplier , that they wanted to deal with it for Linux , but they could n't because of SCO 's copyrights .
And , in fact , in addition , Mr. Cargill , and this is excerpted at Tab 44 , shows that the Linux programmers went 44 beyond using what was ever in this specification .
They went so far as to copy the actual code from the System V Release 4 , and that was n't authorized no matter how long it looks at the TIS license .
Your Honor , next I 'd like to turn to the equitable defenses which IBM asserts are a basis for summary judgment and declaratory relief .
I submit to you that IBM is probably the last party rather than the first party that should come into this Court and seek a determination of equitable estoppel which depends on the concealment of true facts from their knowledge and their blind reliance on false facts that SCO or Caldera or others are supposedly making or implying to them by their actions as to which they have no awareness of the truths .
Perhaps equitable estoppel is an argument that a user out on the street might make , but to suggest that IBM of all parties does n't have an awareness of this truth .
And the premise of this argument has to be we own the copyrights , that there is protectable expression in those copyrights that has been copied in the Linux , that they are infringing , that they do n't have an express license , but nonetheless , they should have been allowed to do whatever they would and be immune from liability because they were watching Caldera and SCO distribute Linux .
And we submit that that totally perverts the idea of equitable estoppel and does n't come close to the standard 45 required by law .
And I note that IBM did not even mention equitable estoppel in its Tenth counterclaim .
You can read that Tenth counterclaim .
Did n't talk about it .
It also was n't raised in a motion for summary judgment that was raised before Your Honor back in May of 2004 .
And I submit that the reasons are why equitable estoppel is seldom appropriate .
At Tab 45 , the Court is aware I think that equitable estoppel presents issues of facts and is one only a fact finder can draw .
We believe that that 's clear from those authorities , as well as the Deseret case .
Under New
York law , we turn to the last tab there , estoppel , we think this is true , generally under the common law requires concealment of material facts , the lack of knowledge by the party claiming estoppel , none of which IBM has come close to establish .
Moreover , and this is a point in our briefs , and it 's the last point we have at Tab 45 , equitable estoppel can't justify a broad declaration that our rights are unenforceable or that what other people have done is okay .
It is a personal defense .
And I think there 's probably maybe one or two exceptions in patent cases where courts have rendered declaratory judgments based on equitable estoppel .
But essentially that 's an offense to be viewed in light of actions alleged of infringement at the time .
Now , that 's the law .
The facts here are such that 46 IBM is just jumbling together in their submission actions taken by Caldera , actions taken by SCO and leaving out an important issue , which is who owned the copyrights in question at what time ?
This is a chart -- Your Honor will recall this chart from last week , because it is the same equitable estoppel argument .
The copyrights are owned by Santa Cruz all during this period of time .
Santa Cruz is not in the Linux business .
They argue , well , there is a few people who attended an X / OPEN conference .
Those people did so as individuals .
Each of those sets forth in their submission of facts is disputed in our response .
Santa Cruz which owned the copyrights was not in the Linux business during the time of 2001 when IBM decided to embrace Linux , to form the Linux technology center , to encourage others to use Linux , to copy Linux , to contribute technology to Linux , that could not possibly then be based on reliance of any action by the copyright owner .
What Caldera , a company that did own the copyrights during this time , was doing with respect to Linux cannot be any more of a basis for IBM to suggest that the copyright owner does n't care .
But if I distributed Linux or you distributed Linux and IBM said they saw us distributing Linux so it must have been okay , With respect to actions taken after the copyrights 47 that were transferred in 2001 to SCO , the evidence is clear that at that time several things happened .
First of all , the business of SCO because of Linux being out there changed dramatically .
The UNIX products went south , and you saw that chart back in the contract argument last week .
At Tab 49 , we point out case law to indicate that even if you had nothing more here a plaintiff 's decision not to sue until infringement action become a competitive threat cannot give rise to an equitable estoppel defense .
Suit was brought in 2003 .
IBM points to the facts that , well , you still had code on the servers that might have been downloaded after we filed suit .
But how could anyone rely on the fact that you could download code from a SCO server ?
They tried to discontinue their business without jeopardizing the customer relationships .
But the relevant point for estoppel is IBM can't rely on any action after we actually sued them to suggest we 're not enforcing our rights .
Now , if this was all there was , it would be enough for a factual issue with respect to estoppel .
But there 's a lot more .
In addition to these facts is what IBM was doing .
Santa Cruz saw IBM engaging in some Linux activities here during the time they were engaged in the joint venture called Project Monterey Your Honor heard all about on Monday .
And they were concerned about this , and they asked IBM .
And what did IBM say ?
That 's at Tab 47 .
48 Mr. Michels , who is the Santa Cruz CEO , said that he and others at Santa Cruz informed IBM that they were concerned about IBM 's announced support for Linux and how that might impact Project Monterey .
And IBM 's response was to emphasize that Linux was not being supported by IBM as a commercially hardened operating system and would not encroach on Santa Cruz ' core markets or the markets targeted by Monterey , and that we need not worry about it .
This alone creates a sufficient factual issue where a jury can determine whether SCO and Santa Cruz and then later SCO had a right to rely on what IBM expressly told them when they raised the issue with IBM .
Of course it turns out that IBM was working as fast as it could to bolster Linux ' activity and ability to target the markets in which SCO contended .
Furthermore , estoppel requires reasonable reliance by the people at IBM making these decisions , and they have not said that they relied on SCO .
And you will see no document in any of the files that is contemporaneous with the events in question where someone at IBM wrote and said , I think we can go ahead because Caldera is distributing Linux or because someone from Santa Cruz attends a conference and we are okay .
You wo n't see that .
We asked Mr. Frye who is the head of the Linux technology center at his deposition about these issues , and his answers appear at Tab 48 .
He says he recalls no 49 conversations about SCO or any conversations about the rights that SCO and its predecessors held regarding Linux .
There were no discussions within IBM about whether IBM 's technical contributions would violate any third party rights .
No conversations with Wladawsky - Berger , who was a person even on top of Mr. Frye .
So there 's not any decision here either in documents or otherwise which says , we 've looked at these sales and we know what we can do because of that .
That is simply a position in this litigation .
In fact , Mr. Harold 's statement also is inconsistent with that .
They refer during argument to Mr. Love saying that we were prepared to give up rights .
If you turn to the last slide in Tab 48 , we point out first of all that what Mr. Love is being relied upon by IBM is actually disputed by Mr. Love 's declaration for SCO .
And remember , this is an IBM paid consultant .
And he later said that Caldera team did not investigate the issue of whether intellectual property rights existed or it had been disclosures that violated those rights .
There are five other members of the Caldera board and senior management who dispute that the company ever made a decision that it did n't care about enforcing its intellectual property rights .
If IBM wants to raise that type of estoppel issue at trial , they can do so , but there is certainly a serious factual issue concerning that .
50 Now , the last point which was raised by Mr. Marriott was copyright misuse , which in essence is dependant upon a lot of other arguments .
We submit that like other equitable offenses is inherently factual nature and depends on the resolution of those issues .
SCO -- I 'll just mention the one example Mr. Marriott mentioned .
He said that it proves misuse by us invoking JFS as an example of material viewer asserting protection .
As the Court knows from last week , there is a serious factual issue about JFS .
Our experts contend that JFS was deprived from System V . In any event , it was part of the derivative system AIX on which there were proprietary rights .
There is no basis , certainly not as a summary judgment on a declaratory judgment to say that we are guilty of copyright misuse .
What we 're guilty of , Your Honor , is trying to enforce our intellectual property .
THE COURT : Thank you , Mr. Singer . Mr. Marriott ?
MR. MARRIOTT : Thank you , Your Honor .
THE COURT : Mr. Singer disagrees with you about the burden of proof .
MR .
MARRIOTT : He does , Your Honor .
Let me address that , if I may , briefly .
If you would look , please , at Tab 9 of our book .
You 'll see there laid out cases which make clear who bears the 51 burden of proof .
And Mr. Singer refers the Court to the Steiner case from the 10th Circuit , which is a decision from 1938 , and the Wuv's International case from the District of Colorado , which is a decision from 1980 .
And if you look carefully at both of those cases , Your Honor , you 'll see what the plaintiff was seeking in those cases was an affirmative declaration , not a declaration of non-infringement .
And if you look at the more recent cases and the cases that address the precise question here , which is who bears the burden in an action seeking declaration of non-infringement , you will see that the overwhelming authority supports IBM 's position in that regard .
Now , Your Honor , Mr. Singer said a number of things .
Let me take some of his preparatory remarks first and then come to his arguments about our specific arguments .
He said , Your Honor , at the outset that there was , suggested at least , that there was some sort of gainsmenship here that IBM had brought its claim seeking a declaration of infringement , seeking a claim as to anything and everything related to Linux , and then suddenly now years later has figured out that that was n't such a good idea , and we should narrow the claim .
THE COURT : Narrow it to the kernel .
MR .
MARRIOTT : Narrow it to the kernel .
As if the kernel , Your Honor , is n't as Mr. Singer well knows what people 52 refer to when they talk generally about Linux .
And I will refer Your Honor , if I may , to IBM 's reply papers .
In its motion for summary judgment more than two years ago just after we filed with the Court 's permission in our motion -- our claim seeking declaration of non-infrin

Synfig
Synfig is open source 2D animation and graphics program , Synfig allows easy creation of animation on Linux platform .
It is still in early stages of development but still feature set it provides now is very impressive .
Text taken from Synfig website : -
2D Animation has traditionally been very expensive because every frame must be drawn by hand .
Even with today 's digital inking and painting software , the process still relies on individuals hand - drawing each frame .
This laborious task is called “ tweening ” .
Our animation technology eliminates the task of manual tweening , producing smooth , fluid motion without the animator having to draw out each frame individually .
This allows you to produce 2D animation with fewer people while producing a product of a higher quality .

sudo apt - get install synfig and
sudo apt - get install synfigstudio

Anti-terrorist officers and MI6 are now investigating a wider British - based plot allegedly to supply Iran with material for use in a nuclear weapons programme .
One person has already been charged with attempting to proliferate ' weapons of mass destruction ' .
During the 20 - month investigation , which also involved MI5 and Customs and Excise , a group of Britons was tracked as they obtained weapons - grade uranium from the black market in Russia .
Investigators believe it was intended for export to Sudan and on to Iran .
A number of Britons , who are understood to have links with Islamic terrorists abroad , remain under surveillance .
Investigators believe they have uncovered the first proof that al - Qaeda supporters have been actively engaged in developing an atomic capability .
The British company , whose identity is known to The Observer but cannot be disclosed for legal reasons , has been wound up .
A Customs and Excise spokesman said : ' We continue to investigate allegations related to the supply of components for nuclear programmes including related activities of British nationals . '
It is not clear whether all of those involved in the alleged nuclear conspiracy were aware of the uranium 's ultimate destination or of any intended use .
British agents believe Russian black - market uranium was destined for Sudan , described as a ' trans - shipment ' point .
The alleged plot , however , was disrupted in early 2006 , before the nuclear material reached its final destination .
Roger Berry , chairman of Parliament 's Quadripartite Committee , which monitors arms exports , said : ' With the collapse of the Soviet Union there was always the question over not just uranium but where other WMD components were going and how this could be controlled .
Real credit must go to the enforcement authorities that they have disrupted this .
The really worrying aspect is that if one company is involved , are there others out there ? '
Politically , the allegations hold potentially huge ramifications for diplomatic relations between the West and Tehran .
Already , tensions are running high between Iran , the US and the European Union over the true extent of Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Iran refuses to suspend its nuclear programme in the face of mounting pressure , arguing its intent is entirely peaceful and solely aimed at producing power for civilian use .
Investigators are understood to have evidence that Iran was to receive the uranium to help develop a nuclear weapons capability .
' They may argue that the material is for civilian use but it does seem an extremely odd way to procure uranium , ' said Berry .
Alleged evidence of Sudan 's role will concern British security services .
The East African state has long been suspected of offering a haven for Islamist terrorists and has been accused of harbouring figures including Osama bin Laden who , during the mid-Nineties , set up a number of al - Qaeda training camps in the country .
Details of the plot arrive against a backdrop of increasing co-operation between Sudan and Iran on defence issues , although the level of involvement , if any , of the governments in Khartoum and Tehran in the alleged nuclear plot is unclear .
However , circumstantial evidence suggesting that elements within both countries might be colluding on military matters has been mounting in recent months .
A Sudanese delegation visited Iran 's uranium conversion facility in February , while the East African country reportedly recently signed a mutual defence co-operation pact with Iran , allowing Tehran to deploy ballistic missiles in Sudan .
Why does a small , but devoted group , of intelligence officials continue to follow the UFO community long after the government disavowed any secret evidence of little green men ?
I have no idea , I just presumed they 're looking for UFOs .
But a few weeks ago , a writer named Gus Russo called me , telling me he was writing about this particular group of spooks .
I told him I do n't do UFOs ( no really , I do n't ) , but suggested a few people who may know more .
Anyhow , his final conclusion is that , in fact , these crafty guys are monitoring the UFO community in an attempt to keep tabs on foreign intelligence who may have already infiltrated this group :
* Tom ’s motivation , it now appears certain , can be summed up in two words : national security .
In a recent interview , a senior intelligence official who is familiar with spooks in cyberspace explained , “ Tom is interested in the subject because , one , he is concerned that DIA officers parading as CIA officers – a felony – are leaking classified material to the UFO groups .
He also knows that in years past the KGB used parapsychology and paranormal groups to get to military people with classified information .
He is concerned that any enemy group could easily use these forums to search out national security secrets . ”
Joel Brenner , the United States national counterintelligence chief recently said that the number of Russian agents operating in the country had reached “ Cold War levels , ” according to the Russian News & Information Agency . *
Russo cites as further evidence : " In 2004 the CIA released under a FOIA request the Stargate Archive files , which reveal that the CIA was indeed concerned about monitoring UFO authors who might be privy to classified material . "
So , if I get this right : these spooks do n't really believe in UFOs , but they 're worried that foreign intelligence agents have infiltrated UFO groups that have military members with classified info .
And what sort of classified information do these supposed foreign intelligence types think they 're gonna get from the UFO group ( other than UFO information ) ?
Anyhow , too much to contemplate for one day , but an enjoyable read , if you can follow the cast of characters .

The distinctive karyotype of an aneuploid breast cancer cell , however , ( right ) includes duplicates of entire chromosomes , missing chromosomes , and chromosome stubs .
The chromosome pattern also includes marker chromosomes seen in all the cancer ’s cells , indicating changes that originated in the cell that gave rise to the cancer .
Numbers under each marker chromosome indicate the chromosome from which the fragment came ; while plus and minus signs identify those that are larger or smaller than usual .
( Peter Duesberg / UC Berkeley )
Thirty - six years into the war on cancer , scientists have not only failed to come up with a cure , but most of the newer drugs suffer from the same problems as those available in the pre-war days : serious toxicity , limited effectiveness and eventual resistance .
This is no surprise to University of California , Berkeley , genetics researcher Peter Duesberg , professor of molecular and cell biology .
According to his novel yet controversial " chromosomal " theory of cancer , which is receiving increased attention among cancer researchers , each cancer is unique , and there is no magic bullet .
" The mutation theory of cancer says that a limited number of genes causes cancer , so cancers should all be more or less the same , " Duesberg said .
The chromosomal theory , which he laid out in an article in the May 2007 issue of Scientific American , implies instead that , " even if cancers are from the same tissue , and are generated with the same carcinogen , they are never the same .
There is always a cytogenetic and a biochemical individuality in every cancer . "
The most that can be expected from a drug , he said , is that it is less toxic to normal cells than cancer cells , and that as a result a cancer detected early can be knocked back by chemotherapy .
His chromosomal theory offers hope of early detection , however , since it ascribes cancer to chromosomal disruption , called aneuploidy , that can be seen easily through a microscope .
" By screening for aneuploidy , you could detect the cancer early and also see what possible drugs to use and whether drugs would even help , " Duesberg noted .
" Then , you would n't have to give a cocktail of drugs that includes all the best poisons , but you could leave out those you could tell would n't work .
If you could cut chemotherapy drug toxicity in half or two - thirds , and direct it better at cancer , that is some progress .
But it is not a cure . "
Duesberg and colleagues discuss the major problem of drug resistance in cancer and how it supports the chromosomal theory of cancer in a paper appearing in the current issue of the journal Drug Resistance Updates ( Vol. 10 , issue 2 ) .
Duesberg proposed in 2000 that the assumption underlying most cancer research today is wrong .
That assumption , that cancer results from a handful of genetic mutations that drive a cell into uncontrolled growth , has failed to explain many aspects of cancer , he said , and has led researchers down the wrong path .
His alternative theory is that cancer results from aneuploidy - that is , duplication or sometimes loss of one or more of our 46 chromosomes , which throws thousands of genes out of whack .
This condition , generated by a defect in the mechanism that duplicates chromosomes during cell growth , leads to more and more chromosomal disorder as the cells divide and proliferate , disrupting even more genes and providing ample opportunity for the development of resistance to drugs being used to control the cancer .
" In this new study and in one published in 2005 , we have proved that only chromosomal rearrangements , rather than mutations , can explain the high rates and wide ranges of drug resistance in cancer cells , " he said .
Duesberg even argues that the anti-leukemia drug imatinib ( Gleevec® ) , the poster child for rational drug design once hailed as a therapy that would make drug resistance a thing of the past , has been rendered less useful because the aneuploid nature of leukemia has led to resistance .
In fact , he said , this resistance suggests that imatinib is not a highly targeted drug , as advertised , but just another cell " poison " that happens to kill more leukemia cells than normal cells .
Development of drug resistance in cancer is one of the strongest arguments for the aneuploidy , or chromosomal , theory of cancer , Duesberg said , and is one aspect of cancer that can be studied experimentally .
Normal cancers typically take decades to develop , making it hard to link cause and effect and to prove or disprove either the mutation or chromosomal theories .
Drug resistance , however , often occurs quickly .
Many cancer patients are initially heartened when their cancer starts to respond to a drug , only to find the cancer suddenly stop responding and begin to grow again .
In a paper responding to Duesberg 's in the same issue of Drug Resistance Updates , Tito Fojo of the National Cancer Institute argues that there are many ways in which the mutation theory of cancer can explain drug resistance .
A gene mutation , deletion , translocation or amplification could disrupt many cell functions , leading to resistance , or could inactivate or damage the doors through which a drug enters a cell .
Duesberg counters that aneuploidy is simpler and can explain the common development of resistance to many unrelated drugs within the same cancer .
He has shown in experiments that aneuploidy causes many gene disruptions such as breakage or translocation each time a cancer cell divides , providing an opportunity for it to develop resistance to many drugs .
Gene mutation rates in cancer cells , however , are no different from mutation rates in normal cells , making it difficult to understand how several simultaneous mutations can occur in cancer to make them resistant to more than one drug .
" The fundamental problem these conventional theories do n't address is why it ( drug resistance ) does n't happen in normal cells , " he said .
" Why are n't we all getting resistant to any toxic drug we are exposed to ?
Why does it happen only in cancer cells ?
Why do cancer cells become resistant and the patients do n't ? "
In his experiments , Duesberg and his colleagues focus on the chromosomal fingerprint of a cell , its karyotype .
For decades , physicians have known that cells of a particular cancer have the same set of marker chromosomes , a rogues gallery of normal chromosomes and stumps of chromosomes .
Duesberg and UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow Ruhong Li showed that the karyotype of drug - resistant cancer cells differs significantly from the karyotype of drug - sensitive cells from which they grew .
Clinicians have found , for example , that the gene expression profile of a breast cancer cell can tell them which treatments work best .
This indicates , Duesberg said , that chromosomal disruption , which affects the expression of thousands of genes , is a better explanation for the cause of breast cancer than is the mutation theory .
" They see now , more and more , that aneuploidy can not be ignored .
It is a big elephant compared to their little mutations , " he said .
Also , the more often a cancer changes karyotypes as it grows , he said , the more drugs it becomes resistant to .
" The inherent instability of aneuploidy thus explains the enormous adaptability of cancers against cytotoxic drugs and dims hopes for gene - specific therapies , " Duesberg , Li and their co-authors wrote .
While this is bad news for cancer patients , Duesberg pointed out that the aneuploidy theory of cancer also provides a means for earlier detection of cancer .
He and colleague David Rasnick have developed a cell scanner to search for aneuploid cells , such as from a Pap smear for cervical cancer or from biopsies for breast cancer .
Rasnick formed a company to market the device , which recently was acquired by Modern Technology Corp .
Aneuploid scanning is already employed in some European countries to screen for cancer .

Orrin Hatch is a conversative and I ’m a libertarian , so it ’s not surprising that I ’d disagree with some of his position .
Even though I frequently do n’t agree with him , though , he ’s always struck me as someone who has respect for the Constitution .
Until now that is .
WASHINGTON — Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch said Tuesday he ’s supporting legislation to create new House seats for his home state of Utah and the District of Columbia , boosting chances that after two centuries residents of the nation ’s capital will get a vote in Congress .
Hatch joined Sen. Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , in sponsoring the Senate version of a bill , passed by the House last month , that would permanently add two seats to the 435 - seat House , giving one to the Democratic district and another , provisionally , to Republican - leaning Utah .
Given the fact that Hatch ’s home state would benefit from this bill , I can only chock this up to pure political expediency , which is unfortunately all too common in Washington .
It ’s even more distressing here given that Hatch seems to recognize the Constitutional problems with the bill :
Hatch said he was mindful of the argument that the Constitution only allows states to have voting members of Congress .
The White House issued a statement saying senior advisers would recommend that President Bush veto it if it clears Congress .
But Hatch said Davis and Norton had made persuasive arguments that Congress treats the district as a state in applying laws and the paying of federal taxes .
“ These arguments lead me to believe it is only fair that we proceed with this legislation and , if it becomes necessary , let the courts decide . ”
Just for the record , this is the oath that Senator Hatch took when he was elected to the Senate :
“ I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ; that I take this obligation freely , without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion ; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter :
So help me God . ”
Just where in there does it say that Senators should ignore serious Constitutional issues about legislation before them , and even knowingly vote in favor of something they know to be unconstitutional ?
Yea , I do n’t see it either .
Originally posted at Below The Beltway , where I ’ve been covering the effort to give the District of Columbia a vote in detail .
CRANSTON , R.I. —
Behind the barbed wire and thick walls of the state mental hospital here are two patients who have not been allowed to live in the outside world for 20 years .
Both were found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity .
Still , they have voted in elections nearly every two years , casting ballots by mail .
Now , however , election officials are taking steps that could ban them from voting , arguing that state law denies the vote to people with such serious psychiatric impairments .
“ I just think if you are declared insane you should not be allowed to vote , period , ” said Joseph DeLorenzo , chairman of the Cranston Board of Canvassers .
“ Some people are taking these two clowns and calling them disabled persons .
Is insanity a disability ?
I have an answer to that : no .
You ’re insane ; you ’re nuts . ”
Rhode Island is among a growing number of states grappling with the question of who is too mentally impaired to vote .
The issue is drawing attention for two major reasons : increasing efforts by the mentally ill and their advocates to secure voting rights , and mounting concern by psychiatrists and others who work with the elderly about the rights and risks of voting by people with conditions like Alzheimer ’s disease and dementia .

The few devoted fans of new series like Vanished and Kidnapped might grumble as these shows get yanked , but they should take solace :
It could have been worse .
Kidnapped could have become a Lost - size hit and been extended indefinitely .
That ’s the real irony this season : not that these convoluted , Lost - alike shows are n’t succeeding , but that the model they aspire to does n’t work at all .
Sure ,
Lost drew massive audiences in its first two years , but in its third season , it ’s losing both viewers ( down a third from last year ) and narrative steam ( who ’s in the hatch with the Others and the numbers and the — oh , forget it ) .
And for anyone who did n’t sign on from the beginning , there ’s little incentive to catch up now .
Why invest hours wading through past DVDs when your co-workers are grousing that the mysteries still have n’t paid off ?
There is , however , a simple solution : Change the format , or at least reimagine it .
When it so - called arc shows , we need something between a mini-series and an open - ended run .
We need the TV equivalent of a novella : the limited - run show .
Series driven by a central mystery ( Twin Peaks , The X - Files ) peter out precisely because they have indefinite life spans .
The writers are forced to serve up red herrings until the shows choke on their own plot twists .
( Whereas 24 works because it ’s more cliff - hanger than puzzle — though Jack Bauer is surely the unluckiest man alive . )
Now let ’s imagine an alternate reality in which , say , Lost was designed to run for only two seasons .
Rather than getting an increasingly tedious shaggy - dog story , we ’d get 48 episodes of tightly plotted , expertly interwoven suspense .
Viewers would be both more willing to sign on at the beginning ( knowing their investment will pay off ) and more inclined to buy DVDs later ( either as catch - up for newbies or as a satisfying boxed set ) .
Sure , the show wo n’t syndicate well , but shows like Lost do n’t syndicate well anyway .
And the series finale would be huge — the kind of event TV network executives drool over .
Obviously , this approach is n’t right for every show .
Stand - alone dramas ( CSI ) and cyclical sitcoms ( Two and a Half Men ) can still run open - ended .
And , granted , no network will be eager to pull a massive hit after its allotted two - year run .
But which would you rather tune in to next fall : a brand - new mystery from the creators of Lost , that entirely satisfying and thrilling limited - run series you loved ?
Or yet another season of Lost , that show that started out so well but is now meandering all over the damn place ?
Puzzles are meant to be solved , not prolonged .
You can only tease viewers so long before they feel like they ’re being mocked .

It seems like Charlton was beginning his investigation into Renzi , and the Justice Department had some knowledge of it .
And this is curious .
In October , Justice Department officials confirmed that Renzi was the subject of an inquiry into a land swap that would benefit a friend and business associate .
Renzi has denied any wrongdoing .
He could not be reached Tuesday .
Renzi is a Bush loyalist .
When Renzi was locked in a battle for his congressional seat last year , the president came to Arizona to campaign for him .
When the first list of U.S. attorneys targeted for ouster was drafted , Charlton 's name was not on it .
But his name was on a subsequent list , drafted in September .
Although the Renzi inquiry was not yet public , it is likely the Justice Department was aware of the investigation , said a former U.S. attorney who is familiar with the protocol when a sitting lawmaker is involved .
" If we had anything of a major investigative nature , I would notify the Justice Department , " said Melvin McDonald , who was Arizona 's U.S. attorney in the Reagan administration .
" Typically , that 's what happens . "
So DoJ confirmed an investigation in October .
Charlton 's name hit the target list in September .
And surely , he began the investigation well before DoJ confirmed it .
So let 's recap :
• David Iglesias , US Attorney for New Mexico , gets phone calls from Pete Domenici and Heather Wilson pressuring him to indict local Democrats , and when he resists their pressure , he 's fired .
• Carol Lam , US Attorney in San Diego , emails the Justice Department about obtaining warrants to search the house of Dusty Foggo , # 3 at the CIA , and the next day Kyle Sampson is writing people about " the real problem we have right now with Carol Lam .
• John McKay , US Attorney in Washington State , resists calls to investigate non-existent and baseless accusations of voter fraud , and winds up on a target list , eventually getting fired .
• Daniel Bogden , US Attorney in Nevada , was in the midst of investigations targeting current or former Republican members of Congress ( Jim Gibbons ? ) when he was fired .
• And let 's not forget Debra Wong Yang , US Attorney for Los Angeles , who , months after opening an investigation into Rep. Jerry Lewis , was hired away for $ 1.5 million dollars by the same law firm representing Lewis , which Josh Marshall says is part of " an odd pattern of pivotal investigators and prosecutors getting fortuitous promotions or offers of employment in the private sector at key moments . "
Yeah , I think I see a pattern here .
Democrats in Arizona are being pretty aggressive about the Charlton case .
" Obviously , there needs to be an investigation , " said Rep. Harry Mitchell , D - Ariz .
" You need to find out the facts .
It should n't be partisan at all . "
On Tuesday , the Arizona Democratic Party wrote to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee , asking that it look into a connection between Charlton 's removal and the Renzi investigation .
The letter , signed by state party Chairman David Waid , said the investigation appears to have stalled since Charlton was forced out .
The newest e-mails , memos and other records raise fresh questions about whether there were political motivations for Charlton 's ouster , as the documents indicate that Justice Department officials were still - after the fact - trying to settle on a complete explanation for why Charlton was called on Dec. 7 and told to resign .
DoJ is so busted .
UPDATE : Carpetbagger points me to this Max Blumenthal article that adds some context to the Charlton firing .
He was put on the list for targeting at pretty much the same time that he opened the Renzi investigation .
Prior to that , he was winning awards for running a model office .
And the DoJ alibi for firing him is a ... doozy :
The Justice Department and the White House offered a scattershot of alibis for firing Charlton .
The Bush Administration 's case against Charlton rested ultimately on the account of a little - known Justice Department official named Brent Ward , who claimed in a September 20 , 2006 e-mail that Charlton was " unwilling to take good cases . "
What accounts for this bizarre e-mail ?
And who is Brent Ward ?
Ward first came to prominence in Utah , where as US Attorney during the Reagan era he cast himself as a crusader against pornography .
His battles made him one of the most fervent and earnest witnesses before Attorney General Edwin Meese 's Commission on Pornography ; he urged " testing the endurance " of pornographers by relentless prosecutions .
Meese was so impressed that he named Ward a leader of a group of US Attorneys engaged in a federal anti-pornography campaign , which soon disappeared into the back rooms of adult bookshops to ferret out evildoers .
Ward returned to government last year as the chief of the Justice Department 's newly created Obscenity Prosecution Task Force , where his main achievement has been the prosecution of the producer of the Girls Gone Wild film series [...]
According to the source , Ward 's accusation against Charlton stems from a case he filed in June 2006 .
That month , Ward ordered Charlton to prosecute Five Star Video , an adult video store that registered on Ward 's radar when it mailed copies of the DVD 's Gag Factor 18 , Filthy Things 6 , Gag Factor 15 , and American Bukkake 13 to customers across state lines .
Charlton agreed to take the case , but as the source told me , Ward implored him to attach an additional US Attorney to it .
Concerned about wasting the already limited resources at his disposal on a case of dubious value , Charlton hesitated .
Despite his misgivings , he assigned the additional prosecutor -- a key fact missing from the White House e-mails .
So , you have a maniac in the DoJ forcing frivolous porno investigations that Charlton FOLLOWS THROUGH ON because it's his job - and then when he 's fired , the same maniac is used to claim that he does n't take " good cases . "
Like the " American Bukkake 13 " ring that has ripped this country asunder .
I 'm at a loss ...
From / dev / coffee to modeling transaction processing based on Starbucks shops , the world of coffee has often inspired programmers .
Here is a not so bright example from the world of coffee , giving us a hint how problems should not be solved .
We recently bought a new coffee machine , and after a glance at the user manual , I was amazed to find out that our new Gaggia was affected with a common flaw of enterprise software : ignoring “ stupid ” problems .
On page ten of the user manual , a bordered paragraph stands out and simply draws attention .
Running the pump without water in the tank will seriously damage the machine , and that misuse is not covered by the warranty .
This got me thinking : why on earth would someone ruin this machine ( which is not at all cheap ) and void the warranty by making coffee from thin air ?
Although it sounds insane , it must have happened relatively often , or else it would not be in the user manual .
The fact that this case is excluded from the warranty tells me that consequences are dire , probably rendering the machine useless .
I can think of quite a few situations parallel to that in the software world , and I am sure that most people in the industry have gone through a similar situation at least a few times in their career .
The users do something incredibly “ stupid ” , and it is beyond anyone ’s imagination why they did it .
Maybe they started a database upgrade while people were still working on live data , or maybe they skipped a version and installed incompatible applications .
A few years ago , I had a case of time - travelling : a trader executed transit optimisations for past contracts , causing havoc because past transactions no longer matched stored contract data .
After a problem like this , programmers often play the blame game .
“ How could someone be so stupid to run the settlement on past transactions ? ” .
If the problem appears a few more times , it gets added to the user manual , like that is going to solve anything .
I guess that is how the warning and the warranty disclaimer found their way into the Gaggia manual .
Are the customers to blame because they recalculated past transactions , or are programmers to blame because the operation was not reversible ?
Adding a warning to the documentation ( and maybe modifying terms of service ) puts all the blame on to the customers .
Especially if the problem is “ obvious ” .
That is really comforting from the programmer ’s perspective , but leaves customers with a real problem .
Documenting a problem does not solve it
Going back to the coffee machine , I can imagine designers pulling their hair out and wondering how anyone could be so stupid to turn on the pump without any water in the tank .
After all , that does sound completely insane .
However , looking at it from a customer perspective , I can also understand why this might happen .
The machine has a slick design , with a dark plastic water tank tucked in under a big metal head .
If the machine is on a table , it is fairly hard to spot the water level from a standing height .
The metal head is blocking the view , and the dark plastic is not really showing a lot under the typical kitchen light .
So , it ’s hard to spot the water line even when it ’s there .
And finally , because the lower third of the water tank is blocked by the coffee cup holder , it is impossible to know if there is any water left in the tank without dismantling half of the machine .
I am not in the business of designing coffee machines , but checking the water level seems relatively easy .
Instead of just blaming the customers for doing something “ stupid ” , the machine could check for water in the tank and refuse to turn on the pump if necessary .
Flashing a light to signal the problem would be even better , but the fact that I do n’t hear the pump would be enough to tell me that something is wrong .
Going back to software examples , issues like these are often very easy to solve .
If database upgrade would corrupt active transactions , we can check for activity and prevent the upgrade .
If version 15 cannot be installed unless version 14 was previously deployed , we can check that before the installation .
If recalculating past transits would break the system , we can skip contracts which were already settled .
Spotting the problem requires an open mind
Part of the problem , of course , is that these issues cannot always be foreseen .
Programmers typically know their system much better than the customers and from a programmers perspective such operations simply do not make sense .
But all that intrinsic knowledge blinds us to obvious problems .
I have learned the value of inviting people who were not involved in development to test - drive the applications before a big release .
Customers and experienced testers still manage to surprise me from time to time .
Taking the Poka - Yoke approach to design helps a lot to prevent such problems from blowing up the system .
There is a whole new field of interaction design emerging , aiming to reduce the friction in user interfaces , so including interaction designers on the team can help produce software which is less easily misused .
But , even with all that we cannot anticipate everything , and these problems are going to pop up occasionally – that is simply part of our job .
A much bigger issue is that our mind is often closed to the real problem .
Declaring someone stupid or insane and adding an obvious warning to the user manual is an easy way out and does not solve anything .
Yet if people are repeatedly doing something “ obviously stupid ” , the cause might be a bigger design flaw .
To spot that , we have to keep an open mind .
Solving those bigger problems will surely pay off , as it would make our products better and easier to use .
And , of course , it will save enormous effort on support and make customers happier , which is always nice .
What can we do about it ?
Putting a warning in the manual , especially if it is something obvious , definitely will not help .
Check the user manual , release notes and installation instructions for such warnings .
Next time a customer does something “ obviously stupid ” , try to understand what they wanted to achieve in the first place and why the system allowed them to be so wrong .
Think hard about whether something can be done to prevent the problem in the first place , be it a warning , blocking the operation , or changing the design of the system to support the offending operation gracefully .
Parliament panel lists reasons for farmer suicides
R Prema in New Delhi | March 22 , 2007 20:36 IST
A parliamentary panel has said that frequent incidents of suicides by farmers all over country were a matter of concern and attributed it to distress sales of their produce and continuous crop failure .
The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture , which tabled its report , said they have counted 11,782 suicides by farmers during the past five years .
The panel has asked the government to abrogate a law that provides for arrest of defaulting farmers .
" The committee is shocked to learn that in some states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar , there is a law to arrest farmers who default in repayment of loans , " said MPs said .
They further said that they were shocked to notice that in these states , not only the farmers were put behind the bars , but the expenditure incurred on their food , transport and other things in jail were also recovered from them .
The Committee , headed by Samajwadi Party 's Ram Gopal Yadav , observed that the agriculture minister in a letter to the chief ministers of Bihar , Jharkhand , Kerala , Orissa , Punjab and UP in April 2006 had taken up the matter of review of state laws to remove the provision for arrest and detention of farmers .
" The last letter ( to states ) for amending the relevant state laws was issued on August 12 , 2005 , and it seems that the government has no will to act but is only performing the duty of a postman in a way , that based on the recommendations of the committee , a letter is written to the states to do the needful , " it said .
Stating that the farmers have not got their full dues , the committee said they have to sell their produce at very low rates and are not able to repay their debts due to drought and continuous crop failures .
" Under the circumstances , the only escape route for them is to commit suicide .
Thus , in the last five years , as per the records of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation , about 11,782 farmers have ended their lives out of frustration and humiliation " , the report added .
Andrew Sullivan on Rudy Giuliani ’s invocation of New Hampshire ’s state motto :
I love the motto too .
But is n’t it exactly the opposite of what today ’s GOP stands for ?
The entire premise of Giuliani ’s positions is that , after 9/11 , we should not live free in case we die .
Last night , he spoke of two risible plots by total losers with no capability of doing serious damage as grave threats to America ’s survival .
The Fort Dix goons and the JFK plotters are among the most pathetic , puny enemies this country has ever known .
But Giuliani speaks of them as if they were the approach of global catastrophe – and he demands that Americans surrender their most precious liberties in order to remain safe from them .
Live free or die ?
Giuliani ’s motto is : Live Under My Protection Or Die .
Or to be more precise , Live Under My Protection Or You Will Die .
But the point is clear .
Giuliani may pay lip service to the ideas of individual liberty , but , when push comes to shove , he does n’t really believe in them .
But , as Sullivan points out , that true of a large segment of the GOP these days :
The logic of today ’s GOP in the war on terror , moreover , is the inverse of New Hampshire ’s .
In every choice of liberty versus security , the GOP now prefers security , without even publicly acknowledging the costs .
And yet Mark Steyn sees no irony here .
Do they really not see that their rhetoric on liberty is utterly hollow ?
Or have they just persuaded themselves that because they ’re the ones taking our freedoms away , we have nothing to be concerned about ?
I think the answer to the last question is yes .
If the tables were reversed and a Democrat was in office who had proposed the PATRIOT Act , warrantless wiretaps , and secret military tribunals , the GOP would be speaking of dictatorship .
Heck , when Clinton was in office he was n’t even doing half those things and the far - right had the idea that he and Janet Reno were on the verge ofÂ throwing out the Constitution and turning the country over to U.N. troops who would arrive on black helicopters .
Now that it ’s one of their own in power , though , they do n’t even seem to notice what ’s gone wrong .
And that is precisely the problem .
Experts spent 1,000 hours testing different bacon variations
Experts at Leeds University discovered the secret to the ideal sandwich lay in how crispy and crunchy rashers were .
They found that two or three back bacon rashers should be cooked under a preheated oven grill for seven minutes at about 240C ( 475 F ) .
The bacon should then be placed between two slices of farmhouse bread , 1 cm to 2 cm thick .
Cooking times
Four researchers at the Department of Food Science spent more than 1,000 hours testing 700 variations on the traditional bacon sandwich .
They tried different types and cuts of bacon , cooking techniques , types of oil and a range of cooking times at different temperatures .
A shortlist was then tested with computers to measure the texture of each sandwich .
Fifty volunteers also judged each sandwich according to its taste , texture and flavour .
' Turn - off '
Dr Graham Clayton , who led the research , said : " We often think it 's the taste and smell of bacon that consumers find most attractive .
" But our research proves that texture and the crunching sound is just - if not more - important .
" While there was much debate within our taste panels on the smoked or unsmoked decision , everyone agreed that tough or chewy bacon is a turn - off . "
The formula is : N = C + {fb ( cm ) . fb ( tc ) } + fb ( Ts ) + fc . ta , where N=force in Newtons required to break the cooked bacon , fb=function of the bacon type , fc=function of the condiment / filling effect , Ts=serving temperature , tc=cooking time , ta=time or duration of application of condiment / filling , cm=cooking method , C=Newtons required to break uncooked bacon .
My husband , Charles , is more of a helicopter mom than I am , so I was surprised when he began insisting that our toddler watch TV .
I would have imagined he would include television in his list of no -nos , along with ice cream , chocolate , and polyester clothing .
But when D turned 9 months , Charles discovered Teletubbies .
He would put it on while we ate breakfast , and she would watch , transfixed , as the tubbies danced their moronic dance and giggled their annoying giggles .
She loved it so much that whenever she got fussy , he would take her to his computer and play a YouTube video of the end of the show , with that bizarre baby - faced sun , and she would calm immediately .
A few months after we found Teletubbies , someone on my local message board , ParkSlopeParents , mentioned a Slate article that cited a Cornell University study showing a correlation between autism rates and the presence of cable television in the home .
I was spooked — even though Teletubbies was on PBS .
The next day at the Harmony Playground sandbox , everyone was talking about the study , and most were skeptical .
My friend Douglas Rushkoff , who is a guru on consumer culture , admitted that even he let his toddler watch the cable network Noggin , whose motto is , “ It ’s like preschool on TV . ”
If Doug Rushkoff lets his daughter watch TV , I told myself , there ca n’t be anything wrong with it .
And I continued to go along with Teletubbies in the morning .
Soon we found Noggin , and D started watching those shows , too , for up to an hour a day : Dora the Explorer , Pinky Dinky Doo , and Oobi .
Yet it made me uncomfortable .
Part of the problem was that I did n’t like the shows .
Dora was a know - it - all yeller , Oobi was speech - impaired , and Pinky was an Upper East Side brat .
The only show I could tolerate was the Saturday - morning Upside Down Show because I had developed an intricate sexual fantasy involving the two Australian hosts and myself in the Outback .
A few months later , we got addicted to Baby Einstein .
I had bought Baby MacDonald without thinking , when D was 4 months , and because she seemed to enjoy it , I checked out some more DVDs from the library ( it ca n’t be bad if you get it at the library ) .
One day , when she was almost 1 , I pointed out some flowers to her on the street and she looked up at me and signed flower , which she had learned from Baby Wordsworth .
I was so floored I called Charles to kvell .
Sometime around her 1st birthday last July , Charles began putting an Einstein DVD in each night while she ate dinner .
“ It calms her , ” he said , “ and she eats better . ”
“ But she ’s 99th percentile for weight , ” I said .
“ She could eat a little less .
I do n’t know if all this TV is good for her . ”
“ She likes it , ” he said .
“ Besides , it ’s not TV .
It ’s a video . ”
Even when I told him that Einstein creator Julie Aigner - Clark and her husband were Republican donors , it did n’t faze him .
“ We get most of them from the library anyway , ” he said .
And so she watched an hour of Noggin in the morning and up to an hour of Einstein discs or The Simpsons at night ( Charles said The Simpsons was the most intelligent show on TV and that any kid who watched it would grow up smart ) .
I hated staring at her blank face as she ate , her mouth hanging open to take in food , all her attention on the screen .
I wanted her to be watching us — watching us eat , preferably , so she could model our behavior and eat more varied foods — but Charles liked to feed her at 6 p.m. and us at 8:30 , and since I could n’t really cook , I was on his cuisine schedule , not mine .
I was n’t sure exactly how it had happened , but suddenly I was raising a toddler who ate fried food glassy - eyed in front of the TV every night .
This spring , when D was 20 months old , I came across an advance copy of Buy Buy Baby : How Consumer Culture Manipulates Parents and Harms Young Minds , by Susan Gregory Thomas .
I read it cover to cover the night I got it : in the living room as I fed D in front of The Simpsons , in the bathroom as she flipped through her waterproof Elmo storybook , in my bedroom after I read her one of her twenty Maisy board books .
And I got scared .
Thomas argues that marketers are aggressively pursuing zero - to - 3 - year - olds with TV shows that claim to be educational but are really about creating character recognition and selling toys .
In a chapter called “ Elmo ’s World , ” about the licensing of TV characters , she detailed the money that Nickelodeon has made from Dora :
In 2005 , it raked in $ 250 million from her video sales alone .
And 12 percent of Nickelodeon ’s total profit came from licensing revenues ( other networks average about 2 percent ) .
I began to wonder whether Dora the Explorer was just teaching D to love Dora .
Even more disturbing was an interview Thomas did with an educational consultant named Iris Sroka .
Sroka ’s company , the Hypothesis Group , advises networks on the educational value of kids ’ shows , and as part of its research on a Playhouse Disney show , she and her colleagues observed a videotape of preschoolers in Jackson Heights watching the program .
It was designed to get kids moving , but the children just sat there .
The consultants reviewed the tape of the kids and became concerned that they could not say the show improved motor skills .
Then one consultant saw that a child was moving two fingers in a kicking pattern , mimicking the kicking onscreen .
The company gave the show credit for “ developing coordination and control of movement . ”
The scariest finding in Thomas ’s book is that “ educational ” TV shows might hamper a child ’s development .
A 2004 study of babies from 6 to 30 months found that watching Sesame Street was negatively related to expressive language use ( frequency of single - and multiple - word utterances ) and watching Teletubbies was negatively related to both vocabulary size and expressive language use .
Even background TV ( shows adults watch when the kids are in the room ) seemed to harm kids ; one study found its presence diminished both the length of children ’s play episodes and their degree of focused attention during play .
Thomas cited Jean Piaget , who said that young children have to understand what an object is before they can see it represented in another format , like TV .
All these programs , if watched too young , had the potential to mess with the natural learning process .
I was still reading Buy Buy Baby after I had put D to sleep and when Charles and I were eating dinner in front of Cops , a show he says helps him wind down .
“ You ’ve got to read this , ” I said .
He gave me the same look he gave when he saw me reading How to Improve Your Marriage Without Talking About It .
“ No , I do n’t , ” he said , as a 60 - year - old female crack addict insisted that the pipe was n’t hers .
“ It says that TV ’s bad for babies . ”
“ TV ’s not bad !
I grew up on it .
Look how I turned out . ”
Then he turned back to the TV and said , “ Take that , bitch ! ” as the cop arrested the grannie crackhead .
“ I think we should limit her usage , ” I said .
“ It ’ll be better for her , and it ’ll improve our marriage because I ’ll be happier . ”
“ You know what would improve our marriage ?
If you stop reading crap like that . ”
Thus began the battle over the remote .
Each morning , I would go into D ’s room , get her out of bed , and give her some milk and a banana .
When I was finished making breakfast , I would find her rocking on her rocking chair or removing the contents of my wallet or jumping off the coffee table , but she never got hurt and she never asked for TV .
After half an hour , Charles would come in , find me reading the paper — a.k.a. ignoring our child — while D ate , and flip on Sesame Street on PBS .
“ But she ’s happy ! ” I ’d say , shutting it off .
“ Elmo ! ” D would shout pleadingly , and he ’d turn it back on .
One evening , I came home at 5:30 to find Charles cooking dinner while D watched Maurice Sendak ’s Little Bear , the last show on Noggin before it becomes “ the N ” and plays teen - interest shows .
I flipped it off .
“ If you ’re gonna turn it off , ” he said , “ then you need to wrangle . ”
“ Of course I will , ” I said , and then I left D in the living room and went into my bedroom to send some e-mails .
A few minutes later , I heard a crash and a cry and I came in to find him kissing a boo - boo she ’d gotten falling off her booster seat .
“ I thought you were watching her ! ” he said .
“ She does n’t need to be watched every second .
It ’s all right for her to be bored .
To have a high signal - to - noise ratio . ”
“ Is that from that goddamned book ?
TV makes her happy .
Why do you have to have such an agenda ? ”
“ Because I think TV is harmful .
She ’s already very hyperactive .
In Studio Creative Play , she barely sits down for the activities .
She just runs around the room .
I think she might be ADHD . ”
“ She ’s not ADHD !
She ’s an iconoclast !
There ’s a difference . ”
That night in bed , I realized that Charles and I have completely different relationships with television .
He was a child of divorce and had watched a lot of TV as a kid .
As a result , he found it comforting .
He saw it as benign .
I had grown up listening to NPR and watching maybe four hours of TV a week , mostly when the entire family would gather for programs like The Cosby Show and Family Ties .
We did n’t have cable , and I only rarely watched when I did n’t know what was on .
To me , TV was a loud , blaring , potentially harmful nuisance I was n’t even sure I wanted to own .
To Charles , it was a co-parent .
He felt it helped him take care of D .
It gave him a sense that she was being stimulated at times when he was not free to play with her .
I did n’t think she needed to be stimulated — even on those rare nights when I watched her alone .
Instead , I gave her some bowls and spoons and let her bang them while I made dinner .
When she was a few weeks old and we were vacationing in Wellfleet , D got a blocked tear duct and we took her to the doctor .
After the appointment , just as we were about to leave , I turned and asked the pediatrician , “ What are we supposed to do with her ?
I mean , what games do we play to stimulate her ? ”
The doctor , a blonde mother of three , just blinked and said , “ You do n’t have to do anything .
At this age , everything is stimulation . ”
I have never forgotten that .
I believe that what she said holds true at least for the first three years .
Development is not something you make happen .
It just happens .
TV would n’t help , and it might hurt .
So why watch ?
But if I wanted my way as far as D’s TV watching was concerned , I would have to “ wrangle ” when Charles asked me to .
This has been our compromise :
Some mornings he puts the TV on and I let him , although I try to limit her to half an hour of Sesame Street .
I rationalize that I watched Sesame and turned out all right .
( Of course , Thomas points out that most Gen - X parents with fond memories of watching Sesame Street probably watched it at 4 , not 2 . )
Other mornings , as he reaches for the remote , I shake my head no .
On those days , I give up on reading the paper and entertain D as he reads quietly .
The extra effort is a small price to pay for a temporarily TV - free apartment .
I never thought I would be this zealous about any aspect of parenthood .
But as I learned long ago on Sesame Street , everyone makes mistakes .

Justifying Marital Violence A German Judge Cites Koran in Divorce Case
He beat her and threatened her with murder .
But because husband and wife were both from Morocco , a German divorce court judge saw no cause for alarm .
It 's a religion thing , she argued .
Genuine friendships within the highest tier of corporate America are rare , because of the demands of the jobs as well as the myriad forces that can turn shared interests into embarrassing conflicts .
But the bond between Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates , the two richest people in the United States and arguably the two most influential in American business in recent years , has lasted more than 15 years .
It has been sustained , according to people who know them , in large part by a very high level of intelligence and a conviction that their vast wealth has given them a larger responsibility to society .
" When you are as smart as Warren or Bill , I think it 's hard to find people to talk to , " said Donald E. Graham , the publisher of The Washington Post , who has spent time together with the two men .
He called Mr. Buffett 's gift " the most creative thing that anyone has done and the way he has done it underscores how much admiration he has for Bill . "
What was most surprising about Mr. Buffett 's decision was not so much that he was giving his wealth away but that he was asking someone else to pursue philanthropy on his behalf .
Image
Like Mr. Buffett , corporate titans like Sanford I. Weill , the former chief executive of Citigroup , and Henry M. Paulson Jr. , the chief executive of Goldman Sachs who has been nominated to be Treasury secretary , have promised to dispense with their own wealth .
But they , like most of those with huge fortunes , are expected to set up their own charitable foundations to carry out their wishes .
For Mr. Buffett , a hallmark of his skill as an investor has been his self - denying quality .
He has often described his task running Berkshire Hathaway , the insurance holding company that serves as his investment vehicle , as finding the best corporate managers , investing heavily in them and getting out of the way — an approach that he now plans to follow with Mr. and Ms. Gates .
AUDIO / TRANSCRIPT : Diebold Whistleblower Stephen Heller Interviewed by Brad Friedman , 3/25/07
The following is the audio and text transcript from the first live broadcast interview with " Diebold Whistleblower " Stephen Heller and his wife Michelle Gregory .
It was conducted by Brad Friedman of The BRAD BLOG on Action Point with Cynthia Black on March 25 , 2007 , and aired live on KPHX 1480 am , Phoenix ' Air America affiliate , and the flagship station for Nova M Radio .
Brad was Guest Hosting for Black that week .
Heller is the Los Angeles actor who stole incriminating documents while working as a temp at Diebold 's powerful law firm Jones Day and turned them over to Bev Harris of BlackBoxVoting.org who , in turn , gave them to Ian Hoffman at the Oakland Tribune where many of them were published .
The documents showed that Diebold had illegally installed uncertified hardware and software in California during the 2004 primary , which led to the decertification of their touch - screen DRE voting systems in the state .
Incredibly , Heller was many years later --- notably , long after the 2004 Election --- charged with three felony counts .
He eventually pled guilty in a deal to one of the charges , as he discussed during our interview , to protect his family .
As well , he was given the assurance that he'd serve no jail time and the charges would likely be removed entirely from his record after a year or so .
Many more stories on BRAD BLOG concerning ( and even by ) Heller can be read here .
One we 'd recommend in particular , with background on the entire story , is available here in PDF format .

Opening audio bumper :
Audio clip from March 2007 hearing on Global Warming SENATOR INHOFE : I 'm sure you read the [ inaudible ] article that quoted the scientists , I mentioned this in my opening statement , about they are criticizing you for some of your , uh , of being too alarmist and hurting your own cause .
Now , I 'll ask you to respond in writing for that one , because that would be a very long response I 'm afraid .
Now it seems that [ Al Gore begins to talk ] everybody , global warming and the media , joined the course [ Senator Boxer begins to talk ] last summer ...
AL GORE : Well I would like to respond , may , may I respond ?
May ... [ said in background to Senator Inhofe ] >
SENATOR BOXER : Excuse me , Senator Inhofe , we 'll freeze ...
SENATOR INHOFE : I 'm asking ...
SENATOR BOXER : We 'll freeze the time for a minute ...
SENATOR INHOFE : Oh yes , yes .
SENATOR BOXER : I 'm just trying to make ...
SENATOR INHOFE : Take your time , we 're freezing the time .
SENATOR BOXER : No , no , we 're freezing the time just for a minute .
I want to , I want to talk to you a minute , please .
[ Audience laughter ]
Would you , would you agree , would you agree to let the Vice President answer your questions ?
And then , if you want an extra few minutes at the end , I 'm happy to give it to you , but we 're not going to get anywhere ...
SENATOR INHOFE :
Why do n't we do this ...
SENATOR BOXER : You 're asking two questions ...
SENATOR INHOFE :
Why do n't we do this .
At the end , you can have as much time as you want to answer all the questions ...
SENATOR BOXER : No , that is n't the rule , you 're not making the rules .
You used to when you did this - you do n't do this anymore .
Audience laughter Elections have consequences .
[ Audience claps with Senator Inhofe laughing ]

Bon Jovi's " Livin ' on a Prayer " comes on .
Oh , we 're halfway there
Oh , oh , livin ' on a prayer
Take my hand , we 'll make it I swear
Oh , oh , livin ' on a prayer ...
BRAD FRIEDMAN
Halfway there , livin ' on a prayer indeed .
You 're listening to Action Point on 1480 , KPHX , in lovely Phoenix .
I'm Brad Friedman , of BradBlog.com , your friendly citizen , uh , journalist / blogger , sittin ' down here in Los Angeles .
Man , that was Senator Inhofe , talking to Al Gore , during his testimony on global warming , and Boxer spanking him good .
" Elections have consequences , " she reminded us , and indeed they do .
Which leads me to my next guest .
You know I had meant to ask Jodie Evans [ previous guest , from CODEPINK ] how many times she had been arrested .
I suspect if she has been arrested , she was n't arrested like YOU were , Stephen Heller .
Stephen 's with us for his first live broadcast interview .
He 's a Los Angeles actor , who while working as a temp employee at the law firm of voting machine company , Diebold , their powerful law firm Jones Day , he exposed , Stephen exposed internal documents which revealed that Diebold had illegally installed uncertified hardware and software in California , up in Alameda County I believe , just prior to the 2004 primary out here in this state .
The company 's touch screen voting machines , uh , which were already terrible , were at least de-certified for use in the state shortly thereafter .
And Heller was much later charged with 3 felony counts .
STEPHEN HELLER :
That 's right .
BRAD : To which you eventually pled guilty to ...
STEPHEN : To one .
BRAD : To one of them , in a deal .
We 're going to talk about that and I understand your attorneys now , have said you can't really talk about what those documents were that you - absconded with , printed out , right ?
STEPHEN : No , that 's true , Brad .
Those documents were Attorney - Client privileged information and that 's why I got arrested in the first place .
And even now , if I were to talk about the content , I could be at risk of getting myself in trouble again .
BRAD : Alright , can I talk about the content ?
STEPHEN : You can say anything you want .
BRAD : I will .
STEPHEN : Alright .
BRAD : Five - hundred pages , I understand , were printed out showing all manor of things that essentially , they were , Jones Day was instructing Diebold that " yeah , you did break the law in Alameda and if you want to get out of trouble - here 's what you do , here 's what you say , here 's how you lie about it , and here 's what we 're going to charge you " , about $ 500,000 a month , I think is what is was on average .
And one of the interesting points in
that document , that I noticed was , they were telling Diebold that they were going to " monitor websites for key intelligence . "
Wonder who they were talking about ?
In any case .
Uh , so , first off , what possessed you back in 2004 , when you saw these documents , what the hell were you thinking ?
What , why did you take them ?
STEPHEN : Ultimately I took them because dishonorable people at Diebold were trying to turn our Democracy into a facade .
They were trying to turn our elections into a mockery , into a lie .
Lies must be challenged .
BRAD : And did you realize at the time the kind of trouble you might be in for exposing these documents ?
STEPHEN : Well , I thought of the possibilities of trouble , but I was very naive .
I thought the information in the documents was so important , that the information would essentially protect me .
That I would n't get in any serious trouble , because the people involved would want it to go away as quickly and as quietly as possible , and like I said , I was very naive .
BRAD : This was early 2004 , right ?
STEPHEN : Yes , January and February of 2004 .
BRAD : So you were --- and this was really before even I was paying attention to this issue --- were you a political activist ?
What drew your eye to what was going on with Diebold and these touch screen systems and so forth ?
STEPHEN : I 'm not a political activist , but I 'm a news junkie and after the 2000 election , there was a snowstorm of stories about the hanging chads .
But in America , in the American press , there was nothing about electronic voting machines .
It was in the foreign press in late 2000 and early 2001 , that I began to read a lot of information from the foreign press , from all over the world about the web of personal , political and financial connections between Diebold and the other voting machine companies and the Republican Party .
This , naturally , concerned me a great deal .
BRAD : When you saw this , were you , did you immediately think oh , I have to release these ?
Or did you ponder this a few days and think what do I do here ?
STEPHEN : I spent a few days thinking about it , but I believe in my heart , even though I had n't quite admitted it to myself , as soon as I saw them , those documents , I think I knew I was going to eventually release them .
But I did worry about it and sweat about it for a couple of days before I began to steal them .
BRAD : Did you know that , uh , did you know what you were going to do with them ?
Did you know you were going to give them to the media ?
To ... you eventually gave them to Blackboxvoting .org - and to Ian Hoffman , I believe , up at the Oakland Tribune ?
STEPHEN : Well actually I decided during those two days of worrying and sweating about it , that I was going to give them to Bev Harris .
Now you have to understand , I grew up during Vietnam and Watergate .
And my first thought was - I got to get these to the press , cause the press is the Fourth Estate , the Great Watchdog .
But then I realized , like I said a moment ago , no one in America in the press was covering this issue .
They were covering all about hanging chads , or had been about hanging chads , but at this point there was still very little , or no coverage in America about electronic voting .
So I thought if I send all these documents to some reporter who does n't know anything about the issue , they 're likely to end up in the trash can .
Why take the risk if nothing good is going to come of it .
I knew I had to get them to somebody who had the press connections and the Government connections to do something with these documents .
And that , obviously , was Bev Harris of Black Box Voting .
BRAD : BlackBoxVoting.org .
She had been on this case , was one of the first , and you know I 've been called " the Paul Revere of this movement " - she was really the Paul Revere of this movement , making noise before anyone was paying attention .
Well how did you get to Ian Hoffman , because he , at the Oakland Tribune , actually did a pretty damn good job of covering this story when a lot of the media , I suspect as you suggest , would n't care .
But he seemed to get it .
STEPHEN : Absolutely , he did a great job .
I gave the documents to Bev Harris and she got them both to Ian Hoffman at the Tribune , the Oakland Tribune , and to the [ California ] Secretary of State , and people in his office .
And yes , Ian Hoffman is a fantastic journalist and did a fantastic job covering this whole story .
Not just my case , but the whole issue of electronic voting .
BRAD : Now , Diebold went to court to try to stop - was it Diebold , or Jones Day , who went to court to try to stop the publication of those documents ?
STEPHEN : I believe it was their law firm that tried to stop the paper from publishing them , but the judge very wisely ruled that once it 's been published , it 's out there and he's not going to force them to withdraw the publication .
BRAD : And so they had already , oh that 's right , they went after it had already been released in the paper ...
STEPHEN : That 's right .
BRAD : Then they tried to withdraw them .
STPHEN : They tried to - well they sued the Oakland Tribune , saying you have to remove all copies from your website and do everything you can to take back all copies that have been published .
And the judge , as I said , ruled no , it 's out there - it 's public information now .
They can't publish more information , but what they 've already published is clear .
BRAD : It 's remarkable , you know how we see this all the time , where these papers try to make things disappear , as if they can't get out .
There was a story in Kansas a couple of weeks ago , that a judge said you have to take it off your site ...
STEPHEN : Right , I read that on your - from BradBlog .
BRAD : I ran it .
It was there in the Google cache , I ran it .
Information wants to get out , seems to me .
STEPHEN : Absolutely , and I was pleased to see the Appeals Court struck down the judges order [ in the Kansas case ] .
BRAD : The Appeals Court agreed with me ...
STEPHEN : ... With Brad Friedman .
BRAD : Thank you for noticing that .
STEPHEN : That 's right .
BRAD : Now tell us about , you , then there was a raid at your house , 7 a.m. in the morning , sometime after the release of this information , woke you and your wife , Michele - how long after you had released the documents did that happen ?
STEPHEN : Well I stole the documents in late January and early February of 2004 , and the police showed up at my house on Friday the 13th , ironically enough , just after dawn in August of 2004 .
So about five months later .
BRAD : About five months later .
But they did n't arrest you .
STEPHEN : No , they had a felony search warrant .
They searched the house thoroughly and they confiscated our computers , my wife 's and my computers , our cell phones , my address book , other various papers , our scanner - they took a lot of stuff , but they did n't charge me at that time .
BRAD : Did they really take Michele 's high heel shoes that she wrote about ?
STEPHEN : Well , I 'll let her talk about that .
BRAD : Okay .
She 's here , we 're going to try to bring her on - and by the way , we 'd love to try to fit in your calls , 800-989-1480 .
Locally in Phoenix , 602-258-8800 .
Moving the clock forward then .
They 've done this raid , the election of 2004 moves forward , everything worked out very well in that election I understand , in reading the paper .
STEPHEN : Yeeaahh .
BRAD : No problems whatsoever ...
STEPHEN : If you 're a catastrophe , it worked out well for you .
BRAD : That 's right , and then we get to what , 2005 ?
When were you then finally arrested and charged with these felony , 3 felony counts ?
STEPHEN : Well , you have to go a little farther than 2005 - no , I can't remember , I 'm losing track of my years .
When was I , I was charged in February of 2006 .
Yeah .
BRAD : It was 2006 ?
STEPHEN : Yeah , that 's right .
BRAD : Okay .
Why 'd they wait so long ?
STEPHEN : Well , you know , you 'd have to ask them that , but I believe they waited so long for a number of reasons .
First of all , they did n't want to move on this before the Presidential election of 2004 , because they were afraid more attention paid to Diebold 's shoddy machines would hurt Diebold , and Diebold pressed the DA to hold off for a little while .
And then I think when the election was well and truly clear , and Diebold had been re-certified in the state by the , uh , the Secretary of State who replaced Kevin Shelley .
Then I think they were ready to try to punish me for exposing their dirty deeds .
BRAD : Were they trying to punish you ?
Or are they trying to send a message to other whisleblowers out there , other folks like you - do n't do this , we 'll take you , cause this was not Federal charges , this was Los Angeles County , right ?
STEPHEN : That 's correct .
The law firm went to the Feds and the Feds said we 're not going to do this and then he went to the , the law firm went to the Secretary of State at the time , and the - I 'm sorry , not the Secretary of State , the Attorney General , State Attorney General , Bill Locklear , at the time - and he said I 'm not going to charge this guy with anything .
So they brought a lot of pressure to bare on the local DA , the L.A. Country DA .
And when - I believe , it 's my opinion , but I believe the DA was acting as an arm of the law firm , Jones Day .
BRAD : The National Whistleblower Center 's General Council , Michael Cohen , said Heller 's case was , " the only one , of which I 'm aware , in which a whistleblower has been charged with a felony . "
We 're going to talk about the idea of whether you are a whistleblower , or are not .
You said you stole those documents ...
STEPHEN : Sure did .
BRAD : We 're going to talk about that when we come back .
We 're going to take your calls , I know Larry is waiting in Phoenix , we 're going to try to get to him - and much more .
You 're listening to Action Point , the first broadcast , live broadcast interview with Stephen Heller , troublemaker , and felon here on Action Point .
We 'll be back in a minute .

Election reform , gotta look to the blogs ...
BRAD : There we go , look to the blogs indeed .
I'm Brad Friedman from BradBlog.com , your friendly investigative citizen journalist , sitting in for Cynthia Black , on Action Point , our last segment here with uh ... a noted felon , and if I say so , patriot , Stephen Heller , who absconded with Diebold documents that eventually - well , preceded , we do n't know if it lead to , but preceded the de-certification of Diebold out here in California .
STEPHEN : Well we do know that the Secretary of State 's committee questioned one of the Jones Day lawyers about the documents and I believe it was an important part of their decision to de-certify Diebold .
BRAD : Do you think it was a part of - Kevin Shelley , the Secretary of State at the time , after he de-certified Diebold , he was then sort of pushed out in a political scandal .
Do you think those two events were related ?
STEPHEN : I do n't know about that , uh , I guess there was some fund raising questionable activities .
I do n't think Kevin Shelley actually did anything wrong , I think some of his staff screwed up and got him in a situation that looked bad .
But I do n't know , I 'm just speculating .
BRAD : I want to let folks know , there was a lot of news on the election reform front this week .
Some incredible stories out in Ohio , where the new Secretary of State , Jennifer Brunner , I mean this is accountability .
The year of accountability , Stephen .
STEPHEN : Go Jen !
BRAD : Yeah , and she 's demanded some resignations out there .
A new criminal investigation has begun , cause it turns out , guess what ?
In Cuyahoga County , looks like they printed out election results of early balloting , prior to election day !
The same thing that happened in Arizona , in Pima County .
There 's a lawsuit down there that broke a few weeks ago , when I was out - actually when I was out in Arizona , guest hosting Malloy 's show at the time .
Alright , in California , Secretary of State Bowen has come up with very strict new draft criteria [ to test e-voting systems ] .
I suspect Diebold touch screen systems in this state are n't here for long .
STEPHEN : Bye - bye Diebold .
BRAD : [ chuckles ]
And some more trouble for folks following the Busby / Bilbray election mess down in San Diego .
Mikel Haas , one of the worst Registrars in the country has been promoted - welcome to Bush World ... uh , and then finally we 've got some breaking news at BradBlog about the Christine Jennings race down there , the Jennings / Buchanan race .
A letter that we 've got posted now on BradBlog showing that in fact , the voting machine company , ES&S , was instructing the state of Florida on how to do the test , the audit , the investigation , after that disastrous election down there in Florida 's District 13 , that 's still being challenged .
And this brings me to my point .
You 've got ES&S telling the state of Florida how to do their job .
This is what comes of private companies running our public elections .
I know you 've had some thoughts on that , you 've actually guest blogged now at BradBlog about it and you said , " in my view Diebold has shown they can not be trusted to run elections in America . "
What is , is n't that at the heart of this , this privatization of our public election system ?
STEPHEN : I think so , and I think it 's a horrible idea .
I just can't understand why anyone would think that in the United States , it 's a good idea to let a private corporation run our elections for us , in secret , using secret machines and secret software .
That 's insanity .
We should never allow that .
All votes must be on a paper ballot and there must be complete transparency in all machines used to process or tabulate those votes .
BRAD : Did you understand this issue in this sort of depth , when you , back in January of 2004 when you saw these documents and thought you had to get them out ?
STEPHEN : No , not to the degree I understand it now .
I knew that Bev Harris would understand it , and that 's one of the reasons I chose her to send the documents to , because I knew that she had the background and the factual knowledge to understand what these documents meant and to put them in context .
BRAD : And , after you have not been able to really speak about this for so many years while you were under indictment for these felonies , it must have been driving you crazy to not be able to come out and unload .
STEPHEN : It was .
It was frustrating as I saw elections come and go and I had to keep my mouth shut and I knew what these election machine companies , Diebold and ES&S and Sequoia were doing , and at least I knew for a fact what Diebold had been doing and I was assuming the others were doing the same , or similar .
It was very frustrating , but I had to protect myself .
BRAD : Were you pleased with the coverage of your story ?
Your story actually got a fair amount of coverage , surprisingly .
STEPHEN : It did .
It got good coverage and overall I think the press was - they did a very good job of presenting a balanced report and I think a balanced report kind of slanted in my favor because I think that 's the facts of the issue .
BRAD : Let 's take a quick call , Larry in Phoenix , welcome to Action Point .
Do you have a question or comment for Stephen Heller ?
LARRY : I 'll be real quick .
I just want to tell Stephen I think the whole country owes him a great debt of gratitude and I thank you for coming forward and I thank you for having the show to bring this out .
I did n't see any news this week , so I missed it all and without you I would n't have caught anything .
I 'm anxious to see what was published that you were talking about , because I had not seen that .
BRAD : Oh man ...
LARRY : I wanted to ask Stephen and you , the election down in Mexico , is it possible the same people were helping with that election down there that some of Bush 's guys and Diebold 's people , and maybe they have an illegitimate President just like we have here now ?
BRAD : Thanks for the call Larry and the kind words .
STEPHEN : Thanks Larry , I appreciate those words .
BRAD : What do you think ?
Mexico ?
Do you see anything familiar down there ?
STEPHEN : Well , you know , it 's hard to tell .
I think anywhere that Diebold 's running an election , you have to be very suspicious of what they 're doing and what their machines are doing .
In terms of the President being illegitimate , or well , being the President on an illegitimate basis - I 'm sure his parents were married - but in terms of him being the illegitimate President , yes , absolutely .
I believe the man who is now serving his second term in the White House has yet to be elected .
BRAD : Do you believe you 're a whistleblower ?
Now there was some controversy about this because normally whistleblowers , for example , I refer to you sort of off - handedly as " the Diebold Whistleblower " , which would imply that you were working at Diebold and you 're really a Jones Day whistleblower , I suppose , in a certain sense .
But how do you consider yourself ?
STEPHEN : I think I am a whistleblower .
I also think I 'm a thief .
I stole attorney - client privileged documents .
That 's a serious crime .
I pled guilty to the crime and I 'm taking responsibility for it .
But what is a crime is not necessarily wrong .
And in fact , I believe that I exposed something that all Americans needed to know about .
So I do think I 'm a whistleblower .
BRAD : Do you , as a felon now , do you get to vote in the state of California ?
STEPHEN : You know , I 'm not really sure about that , because the law is vague .
There 's some types of felonies you 're automatically disenfranchised , other types of felonies you 're not , and at this point , I 'm really not sure .
I do know that I got called to jury duty and when I said that I 'm a convicted felon , I did n't have to serve .
[ Brad laughs ]
So that 's one thing .
But you know , my wife ...
BRAD : Man , that 's a really hard way to get out of jury duty , Stephen .
STEPHEN : Well , it worked for me !
And my wife also recently had to do jury duty and I had to tease her , that yeah , you can't get out of it honey , cause you 're not a felon .
BRAD : [ laughs ]
Speaking of --- well , the night 's young , we 'll see what happens --- speaking of your wife , Michele Gregory , she 's here .
She 's had to - Michele , thanks for coming in and frankly , thanks for all you 've done because you did a hell of a job while he could n't talk , keeping people informed over at --- I want to give it --- Hellerlegaldefensefund.com , and helping me to understand this story as I was doing my best to cover what was going on , and I know you could n't talk that much either .
MICHELE GREGORY : No , I could n't talk .
So , I wrote .
You know and I wrote a lot of things that I could n't publish or put out there at the time , but I just wrote to get it all out .
And I do want to clarify that the DA did not take my shoes .
BRAD : Did not take your shoes ?
MICHELE : They did not .
That was a joke .
BRAD : You were kidding when you wrote that .
MICHELE : Yes .
Humor was a great resource for us .
BRAD : I can imagine .
MICHELE : You know , it was just so absurd .
The things that happened , it was , you know , it was scary and surrealistic and absurd and you just had to laugh .
BRAD : I guess that 's all you could do , at that point .
I mean , what did you think , this guy could have gone up , up the river for what was the maximum , 25 years or something like that ?
10 ?
STEPHEN : I think there were 3 counts and each count carried a potential for 4 years , so it was a potential of up to 12 years in the state prison .
BRAD : Twelve years .
MICHELE : And at one point , Jones Day was threatening to come after us if we did n't settle for , in a civil suit , for millions of dollars and garnish our wages for the rest of our lives .
BRAD : Why did you eventually settle ?
Well , not settle , but plead guilty .
STEPHEN : I have to be real careful of what I say , but part of the deal was that Jones Day signed a release that they would not sue me in any kind of capacity related to the case .
And that was a very important thing to protect me and my wife .
BRAD : But you 're an L.A. actor , you 've got plenty of money , you could have fought this all ...
STEPHEN : Oh yeah , I 'm rolling in dough .
BRAD : Listen , before we have to get out here , Michele you talked about your writing .
I understand you 've been working on a book on all of this .
MICHELE : Yes , because everybody 's asked me so many questions and said you should write a book .
So I 'm writing a book and I 've even got the title .
BRAD : What 's the title ?
MICHELE : " This Blows - The Life of a Wife of a Whistleblower . "
BRAD : [ laughs ]
That 's nice .
I like it .
Have you got a publisher yet ?
MICHELE : No , no , we 're still looking .
BRAD : Looking for one ?
MICHELE : Yep .
BRAD : Alright .
STEPHEN : Give us a call .
BRAD : Have you got someone to write the Foreword for it yet ?
MICHELE : Would you be interested , Brad ?
BRAD : No .
[ everyone laughs ]
BRAD : Alright , listen guys , I wish we had more time .
We need more time .
Cynthia
Black needs more time so we can have you back for longer next time she lets me sit in .
The good news is , starting next week on KPHX , Cynthia Black will be back with Action Point for 2 full hours !
She 's getting an extra hour !
Yeah , we did such a good job over the last couple of weeks , they gave her an extra hour !
STEPHEN : Nice .
BRAD : Go figure .
Uh , I wish we had time to get into so much more , but I want to thank you Stephen and Michele , both , for what you 've done for this country , having the courage to do what you did .
I do n't know that I would have had the courage to do that .
So ...
STEPHEN : Brad , I 've got to tell you , you are the finest citizen journalist working in America today , and I have a tremendous amount of respect for you and everything that you 've covered .
Not just my story , but everything .
You are an outstanding and vitally important American .
BRAD : You 're very kind to say that .
Read more about his story --- the man with his own category at BradBlog --- Stephen Heller , you can read his stories , look for the categories , click Stephen Heller , you 'll read all the coverage of him .
Thanks guys , I 've got to get out here .
I want to thank Rita Pardue down here , engineering beautifully , along with Desi Doyen , producing .
Let me get everybody in , Sean Ryan doing engineering up in Phoenix , thanks Cynthia for letting me sit in today .
Thanks Executive Producer , John Ridgeway , and of course Jodie Evans , Stephen Heller , Michele Gregory ... did I do it ?
Until next week guys , when Cynthia 's back , take this information - do something with it - go to BradBlog , learn what 's going on .
Most importantly , this Democracy is not going to save itself .
We need all of you to get out there and take action .
I 'm Brad Friedman , thanks for listening .
Deep Critical Exploration of the Peace Through Pork Agenda
" Peace Through Pork " is an evolving practice that is based on interpersonal contact and dialogue .
The core element of " Peace Through Pork " is the offering of delicious , fried , cured , pig flesh to passers by .
This is done in front of a banner proclaiming the event in english , arabic and hebrew .
The desired result of this situation is to provoke individuals to approach a representative and inquire about either the theory of " Peace Through Pork " or express an interest in eating some bacon .
The one on one dialogue that ensues is critical to the process .
A primary function of " Peace Through Pork " is to explore the importance of a live oral dialogue vs a dead written text .
It is through this dialogue that explorations into the superstitions and fears that are generated by " dead text " religions and belief systems are possible .
The dialogue can take many directions , as it should since it is based on a unique instance in time and space , but generally it is an exploration into the superstitious belief systems that promote actions by invoking fear .
There are many factors that might lead one to decide to avoid the consumption of pork .
If I were to ask you if you eat bacon and you said " no , " there may be many reasons .
Perhaps the high fat content makes you ill , or you might be watching your cholesterol , or perhaps the thought of eating animals makes you uncomfortable .
Heck , I even met one woman who had a pet pig when she was young and her parents served it for dinner .
There are many reasons to avoid bacon , thoughtful , rational reasons .
Avoiding pork products is not , in of itself , what is being critiqued here .
Some religions ban the consumption of pork .
This is not a critique of those religions , it is an exploration of how individuals interact with superstition and fear .
Often , in my discussions , the people I meet will make statements such as " well , Muslims are ( fill in the blank ) " or " Christians have their own issues . "
These modes of thinking are dead ends .
The spectrum of individuals that makes up any group allows for examples to be made to substantiate any position .
Some muslims are more moderate than some christians , and vice versa .
Generalization about groups of individuals is a dangerous precedent that ties into superstition and fear .
If you were to respond to my question with " God told me not to eat bacon " then we have the stage set for discussion of superstition and fear motivating ones actions .
Even if you do eat bacon , the thought process behind " Peace Through Pork " drives straight at the heart of our preconceptions and fears .
One can approach things in ones life through a rational , thoughtful exploration of ideas .
Taking a religious text as the basis for anything without examining the surrounding evidence and exploring your own personal beliefs is a dangerous precedent .
When a thought ( or delicious pork product ) is repressed , it finds an outlet somewhere .
By cutting off the exploration of an idea ( or a tasty food ) from rational exploration and dialogue , we are repressing it .
When we push a thought or an idea down into the dark corners of our minds and our memories , it will bubble to the surface of our consciousness in unexpected and unpredictable ways .
Could it be that all of this violence stems from the repression of bacon ?
Maybe not , but bacon tastes really good and you certainly should n't deny yourself that joy just because of fear .
If we can't talk about bacon in a rational and thoughtful manner , then how can we ever hope to talk about any other issue that we allow to infect our lives with fear and superstition .
Bacon is so simple and so tasty , how could it ever be a flashpoint ?
If it can not be addressed , how can we address real issues ; our distrust of each other , our misunderstanding of each others customs , our lack of respect for each others humanity .
Can we allow bacon to be that first step towards a broader conversation ?
Is bacon not the metaphor for all of our fears and desires ?

It is one of the most
pondered questions of all time -
can money buy happiness ?
The answer , according to a
study , is yes - but so can
friendships and successful
relationships .
Researchers have been trying to
calculate what effect our finances
and lifestyle have on our emotions .
Their main source was a survey of
10,000 Britons , who were asked to
rate their level of happiness and
answer questions on their wealth ,
health and social relations .
The team , from the University of
London , then placed all these
people on a " life satisfaction scale " of
one ( utterly miserable ) to seven ( euphoric ) .
Scroll down for more ...
Using the information they had
collated , they could calculate how
much extra money the average
person would have to earn every
year to move up from one point on
the scale to another .
They also
worked out how far life events and
changing social relationships on
their own could move someone up
the satisfaction scale .
By comparing these two types of
information , they were able to put
a " price " on social and lifestyle
factors .
So , for example , they found
that having excellent health was
worth the equivalent of a £ 304,000 - a- year pay rise in how happy it
made you feel .
Marriage increases happiness
levels by the same amount as earning
an extra £ 54,000 a year , although ,
surprisingly , living together was
worth more , at an extra £ 82,500 .
Meanwhile , chatting to your
neighbours on a regular basis would
make you as happy as getting a
£ 40,000 - a - year pay boost .
The scale also works in reverse ,
however , so that the grief of
becoming widowed decreases your satisfaction - with life by the same
amount as your salary dropping
£ 200,000 a year .
Dr Nattavudh Powdthavee , one
of the main researchers , said : " One
of the things we wanted to find out
was the answer to the age - old
question - can money buy the
greatest amount of happiness
for us ? "
What they found , he explained ,
was that the results showed the
importance of social relationships .
" One potential explanation is that
social activities tend to require our
attention while they are being
experienced , so that the joy
derived from them lasts longer in
our memory , " he said .
" Income , on the other hand , is
mostly in the background .
" We do n’t normally have to pay so
much attention to the fact that
we ’ll be getting a pay packet at the
end of the week or month , so the
joy derived from income does n’t
last as long . "
I have been thinking lately about the Christian symbol of the crucifix .
It is almost always seen in settings that attempt to create a mood of peace , calm and serenity : on the walls of churches , in the patients ’ rooms in Catholic - run hospitals , in funeral parlors and cemeteries , to name a few .
The ubiquity and familiarity of this icon , I think , often blinds people to what a brutal thing it is .
What the cross merely suggests , the crucifix makes explicit .
Look at one , or imagine it , and see clearly what it represents : a living man writhing in agony , nailed to beams of rough wood by sharp iron spikes pounded through his hands and feet , left to hang and die a slow and painful death from blood loss , suffocation , and exposure .
Crucifixion was intended to be the most agonizing and horrible manner of death imaginable , to serve as a frightening warning to those who would rebel against its inventors .
And yet we commemorate this emblem of torture and gory death , with depictions of it in every church , and consider it a source of solace to the suffering and the bereaved .
More so , we are told that this horrific act is the linchpin of God ’s plan for human salvation , as if supreme love and forgiveness had no choice but to work through a vehicle of almost unimaginable brutality .
This strange intermingling of loving words and peaceful wishes with imagery of horrendous violence is not confined to funerals and other services where the crucifix figures prominently .
On the contrary , it is a pervasive theme in religion in general , and Judeo - Christian religion specifically .
In “ A Book of Blood “ , I wrote that because most believers have never read the Bible in its entirety , they are unaware that the familiar passages of love and peace which are so often quoted are not representative of the whole book .
On the contrary , these verses are merely islands in a sea of bloodshed , cruelty and hatred in the name of God .
Consider one of the most famous excerpts from the Bible , the 23rd Psalm .
The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want .
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters .
He restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name ’s sake .
Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff , they comfort me .
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over .
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life : and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever .
The gentle and peaceful pastoral imagery of this verse has given comfort to millions of mourners throughout the history of Judaism and Christianity , and there is indeed much beauty in these simple words .
But now see some of the other words which the Psalmist spoke and which are recorded in the same book :
Ask of me , and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession .
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter ’s vessel .
— Psalms 2:8-9
Now consider this , ye that forget God , lest I tear you in pieces , and there be none to deliver .
— Psalms 50:22
Break their teeth , O God , in their mouth … let them be as cut in pieces .
As a snail which melteth , let every one of them pass away : like the untimely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun… .
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance : he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked .
— Psalms 58:6-10
( Note : Is this a wish that the psalmist ’s enemies had been miscarried ? )
He shall judge among the heathen , he shall fill the places with the dead bodies ; he shall wound the heads over many countries .
— Psalms 110:6
O daughter of Babylon , who art to be destroyed ; happy shall he be , that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us .
Happy shall he be , that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones .
— Psalms 137:8-9
These wishes of hate and violence – smashing the heathens with an iron rod , tearing and cutting them into pieces , breaking their teeth in their mouths , crushing their children against stones , filling the world with their dead bodies , while all the while the righteous celebrate and rejoice over the bloodshed – are a world away from the peaceful images of the 23rd Psalm .
Yet the two are found together in the same book , and according to some theists , are the product of the same writer .
Another frequently quoted passage can be found in 1 Corinthians 13 ( RSV translation ) :
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels , but have not love , I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal .
And if I have prophetic powers , and understand all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing .
If I give away all I have , and if I deliver my body to be burned , but have not love , I gain nothing .
… Love never ends ; as for prophecies , they will pass away ; as for tongues , they will cease ; as for knowledge , it will pass away ….
faith , hope , love abide , these three ; but the greatest of these is love .
Again , these are beautiful and moving words .
But now consider another passage attributed to the same writer from the same book :
Let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law .
And if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
— 1 Corinthians 14:34-35
These ugly words of prejudice , so sharply at odds with the above advice on love , have been used to justify two thousand years of systematic oppression and mistreatment of women in the Christian tradition .
Even today , women are barred from roles of leadership and authority in many of the world ’s major Christian denominations because of this passage .
Other epistles attributed to Paul of Tarsus contain verses possibly even more vicious and hateful .
Consider this passage from the second epistle to the Thessalonians , in which he expresses the bloodcurdling wish that all non-Christians be consigned to an eternity of torment in hellfire :
And to you who are troubled rest with us , when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels , in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ : who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power .
— 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9
And then there is this passage in which Paul instructs slaves to obey their owners .
Advice such as this was used by generations of preachers to defend one of humanity ’s most evil inventions ever by claiming that it was a just and proper institution ordained by God .
Servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ .
— Ephesians 6:5
The popular impression that the Bible is a good and moral book is is a highly misleading one , produced by selectively emphasizing the few uplifting parts and neglecting or glossing over the more numerous horrifying ones .
A more balanced and accurate view , however , would see the Bible for what it is : an anachronistic holdover , a relic of a far more superstitious and savage time that has survived until today .
Though it contains the seeds of some good moral ideas , they are thoroughly mixed in with violent and abhorrent ones , and it has taken centuries of moral progress to sift the good ideas from the bad .
I do not mean to suggest that ordinary lay believers are to blame for creating this misleading impression .
After all , most of them have never even read the Bible .
If there is anyone who bears responsibility , it is the clergy and the theologians who are aware of the Bible ’s ugly side and try to downplay or excuse it .
But in any case , believers everywhere should be informed exactly what it is that they are believing in .
We atheists should make it clear that , contrary to popular belief , the Bible is not a book of love .
There are now a total of 10 Bagus Gran Cyber Cafes
The pods are small cubicles that can be rented out and contain DVDs , computer games , internet , manga comics , and food and drink .
Richard Kimber from BBC World Service 's Culture Shock programme tried one out at Bagus Gran Cyber Cafe in Tokyo .
I take my shoes off and slip in to my very own media pod in one of Tokyo's newest cybercafe complexes .
The small , makeshift booth is only about two square metres , but it feels like I 've got enough technology in here to run a small country .
In front of me is a huge plasma screen , on which I can surf the internet at breakneck speed .
If I pick up the TV remote I can watch channels from around the world , or choose from a huge selection of DVDs or computer games .
I can also listen to music on a huge pair of headphones .
Or if that does n't appeal , I can lounge out on the black , padded leather floor and read from a huge selection of Japanese comics and magazines .
There 's enough food and drink to keep you going for hours .
" Perfect place "
My booth , number C4 , is one of about 100 squeezed into the complex .
Apart from the odd cough or opening of a door , it 's a very tranquil environment - which is a key attraction to some of the clients here .
" I usually spend around three hours here - it kills time between work and going home , " says one customer .
I 'm not really looking forward to going back outside into the real world
Another says that while she already has things like a DVD player and CD player at home , she likes the pods because " you can do anything you want " .
" You can read manga , surf the internet - you can even take a nap in the afternoon , " she adds .
And users of the booths point out that while the fashionable thing to do remains karaoke , the booths cost around the same and they find it to be a better experience .
" It 's quiet and dark , and none of the staff will complain about you sleeping or staying the night , " says one .
" The cafes are useful for people who live at home with their family , because if you go home , you 're forced to spend time with them .
But if you just want to use the internet and be alone , then this is the perfect place to come . "
In my own media pod , my intentions to stay for only one hour have turned into three - and I 'm not really looking forward to going back outside into the real world .
But since the cafe never closes - and with two more entire walls of DVDs and manga comics to get through - it 's tempting to stay all night .
Today 's collaboration with Cellar Image of the Day brings us this amazing story of Qian Hongyan :
The Chinese youngster 's family was too poor to afford the sophisticated medical assistance that could have helped her to walk again when she lost her legs in a horrific accident in 2000 when she was just three years old .
But in an inspired move Qian 's parents came up with the idea of sitting her on a basketball , which , with the aid of a couple of brushes that double as low - level crutches , enabled her to move herself by bouncing around .
She became highly mobile on her unconventional transporter and was able to travel independently between her home and the local school .
After years propelling herself along the ground , the youngster has been given the chance to walk again after she was taken under the wing of doctors who have fitted her with prosthetic legs .

" The interview will be my first in a nationwide setting , since the 20/20 piece aired on May 4th . "
" I hope to discuss my displeasure with the ABC broadcast and why I believe the network held back names at the last moment , " she added .
" I hope to announce my decision to distribute the phone records ( all years 1993 to 2006 ) to as many responsible media , press and bloggers as possible , once the current injunction prohibiting me from releasing the invoices is lifted -- and my reasons for doing so .
Furthermore , it is Mr. Sibley and my hope we will be able talk about the fact that the Government , with the intentioned / unintentional assistance of the Courts has been able to seize and hold my property for 9 months now , without a hearing on the matter . "
She says that she will pursue her own press strategy of mass mailings " with the blessings of my legal team . "
" I am embarking upon my own informational and update mailings , along side those of Mr. Sibley , " she wrote .
" I am doing this in large measure because of the excellent data and evidence which is being brought to my attention piecemeal , by sundry investigators , journalists and bloggers interested in my case .
It is becoming increasing difficult for me to relay such information onto individual recipients .
Ergo , my decision here to forward pertinent info en masse . "
" Make no doubt about it , " she concludes .
" My case is political in nature . "
Tax rates are falling all over the globe -- even in Sweden .
The exception is the U.S. Congress , which is scrambling to find some way , any way , to raise them .
The proposed 44 % top marginal rate would reduce U.S. competitiveness by reducing the after - tax return on investment .
Less investment means fewer jobs and lower wages .
A Tax Foundation analysis of tax returns finds that roughly three in every five Americans in the highest income tax bracket are small business owners , who create most new jobs .
What 's missing from this Congressional tax debate is any recognition that today 's tax rates are producing record tax receipts .
If the current pace of tax collections continues amid a modicum of spending restraint , the federal budget could be balanced within 18 months .
The tax share of GDP is approaching 19 % , which is above its modern historical average .
It 's a sorry day when American politicians have to be instructed in the virtues of low tax rates by the Swedes .

The SMH has an article on why John Howard 's Australia is going backward on many fronts .
The world economy has rarely been kinder to Australia than in the past five years .
Where once we rode the sheep 's back , we now ride the coal truck , masking underlying problems .
This economic luck - and , to be fair , some good management - means we still have one of the highest standards of living in the world .
But with this security has come a lack of vision , an absence of courage and a poverty of ambition .
We are happy in the prosperous present , but not doing enough to build for the future in a world where other countries are pedalling a lot harder .
To some , this is epitomised by our Prime Minister , John Howard , who was elected on a promise to make the nation relaxed and comfortable after we had become distinctly uncomfortable with the grand visions of his predecessor .
Described in a recent essay by the journalist David Marr as the " exalter of the average " , Howard is a sharp contrast to Paul Keating , who was voted out not so much because he had run out of ideas , but because he had too many that were too big and remote from an electorate that yearned for a return to a quiet life .
But Howard is not the problem , and replacing him wo n't necessarily solve the underlying malaise .
If Howard and other political leaders are triumphs of the ordinary , lacking policy vision and imagination , it 's because we have wanted them to be so .
To Marr , Australia is a nation that has always been " uncomfortable with high principle " , preferring the pragmatic and the mundane .
That we should happily elect and re-elect a man who offers the political equivalent of a pipe and slippers should , in this light , come as no surprise .
But in a changing world , being relaxed and comfortable can be a dangerous thing , particularly when the minerals bonanza runs out and the future kicks in .
As a nation we need to lift our horizons and regain our lost spirit of adventure .
...
Australia 's focus on cost , rather than benefit , in areas such as broadband is also symptomatic of a broader problem which until recently has resulted in chronic underinvestment by government in key infrastructure .
For more than a decade , public debt was seen as public enemy No. 1 and reducing it a central aim of governments , state and federal .
Debt was bad - even though , when it comes to capital spending on socially productive capital such as infrastructure , eschewing debt means today 's taxpayers pay for assets which will benefit taxpayers of the future .
It is only in the past couple of years that state governments , faced with crumbling and inadequate infrastructure and huge demands created by the minerals boom and population growth , have rediscovered that when you renovate you sometimes have to borrow .
The infrastructure inadequacies flowing from this can be seen in transport , another area where Australia has fallen behind the world .
Road and rail links are a country 's economic arteries , but if the nation was a patient it would be at risk of a serious heart attack .
Trains should be the best way to carry goods over Australia 's long distances .
But only about 10 per cent of Australia 's freight travels by rail , putting us below other OECD countries .
Passenger services are no better .
A recent RailCorp study put CityRail behind every other city on every key indicator .
Sydney does not even have an integrated ticketing system - like Hong Kong 's Octopus card or London 's Oyster card .
" We stopped investing in rail in 1960 in Australia , " said Bryan Nye , the chief of the Australasian Railway Association .
" We have quite a deficit to pick up .
We are almost a Third World country . "
Our roads are already choked with cars and trucks , but the number of commercial vehicle trips on Sydney roads is expected to double to 2.4 million by 2026 .
Internationally , governments are thinking laterally when it comes to road congestion .
In Europe and North America , they are starting to use toll roads to control traffic - a move that requires political courage , but works .
In London , the inner-city congestion charge has been a success and New York is looking at one , too .
In Sweden , motorists pay varying amounts to use roads depending on where and when they drive .
Some countries encourage trucks to use motorways at night by giving them a discount .
Some spread the commuter rush by giving motorists discounts if they drive outside the peak .
Others encourage rail freight by charging trucks a levy to use city roads .
Australia is also lagging when it comes to the business opportunities created by the response to climate change and the shift to " carbon trading " , especially in alternative low - emission technologies that will become commercially viable as we adjust to demands to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
Under pressure from vested interests in the mining and energy sector , the Government stalled on a move to carbon trading for a decade and has only moved in recent months after a huge shift in public opinion and acceptance of the inevitable by business .
Even now , the debate is still largely about the pain , the cost to the economy , business and consumers , rather than the opportunities it opens .
Meanwhile , other countries have had almost a decade 's head start .
Nations which have taken deliberate and politically risky steps to promote alternative energy - using financial carrots and sticks and introducing binding targets - are the global leaders in environmental technology .
While there have been new costs , successful governments have been able to persuade voters with the message that you have to spend money to make money , jobs and opportunities .
Germany , the unlikely world leader in solar power , kick - started its renewable energy sector in 2004 .
New legislation required power companies to buy solar - and wind - generated power for US54 - 57 cents a kilowatt hour and US8.9 cents a kilowatt hour , respectively .
Electricity from coal - fired power stations can be generated for US2 - 4 cents a kilowatt hour .
The high " buy - in " prices suddenly made investing in renewables very attractive , especially with low - interest loans available to householders , farmers and businesses willing to put solar cells on their roofs or wind turbines in their paddocks .
Globally , solar power has grown by 41 per cent year over the past three years and wind power by 18 per cent a year .
China is also emerging as a solar player .
About 80 per cent of the solar collectors manufactured in China use University of NSW technology , world - class science pushed offshore by lack of interest at home .
The failure of government to stimulate the development of a solar energy industry , when Australia has consistently led the world in solar science , is the most glaring example .
But we could also have seized opportunities to develop clean coal technology earlier , in collaboration with India and China , explored hot rocks technology , and got in on the ground in a long - term international effort to develop nuclear fusion , a process discovered by an Australian , Mark Oliphant , in the 1930s .
Sweden introduced the world 's first carbon tax in 1991 .
The $ US100 - a - tonne tax on carbon dioxide led to a dramatic restructuring of the heating and electricity sector , a sharp reduction in emissions and the development of a global clean technology industry .
Sweden now leads the world in biofuels - mainly used for heating and electricity production - and is close to phasing out the use of imported heating oil .
Long - term vision has been lacking in other areas , including biodiversity , genomics and commercialisation of medical discoveries .
The revolutionary technology of genomics provides a way to produce a stocktake of our unique flora and fauna , so we can protect them as well as profit from their unusual characteristics .
Yet we have left it to other countries to work out the genetic codes of Australian species including the platypus and gum trees .

Today , the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) released its first projections of world grain supply and demand for the coming crop year : 2007/08 .
USDA predicts supplies will plunge to a 53 - day equivalent - their lowest level in the 47 - year period for which data exists .
“ The USDA projects global grain supplies will drop to their lowest levels on record .
Further , it is likely that , outside of wartime , global grain supplies have not been this low in a century , perhaps longer , ” said NFU Director of Research Darrin Qualman .
Most important , 2007/08 will mark the seventh year out of the past eight in which global grain production has fallen short of demand .
This consistent shortfall has cut supplies in half - down from a 115 - day supply in 1999 / 00 to the current level of 53 days .
“ The world is consistently failing to produce as much grain as it uses , ” said Qualman .
He continued : “ The current low supply levels are not the result of a transient weather event or an isolated production problem : low supplies are the result of a persistent drawdown trend . ”
…
Qualman said that the converging problems of natural gas and fertilizer constraints , intensifying water shortages , climate change , farmland loss and degradation , population increases , the proliferation of livestock feeding , and an increasing push to divert food supplies into biofuels means that we are in the opening phase of an intensifying food shortage .
With global oil production virtually stalled in recent years , controversial predictions that the world is fast approaching maximum petroleum output are looking a bit less controversial .
At first blush , those concerned about global warming should be delighted .
After all , what better way to prod the move toward carbon - free , climate - friendly alternative energy ?
But climate change activists have nothing to cheer about .
The U.S. is completely unprepared for peak oil , as it's called , and the wrenching adjustments it would entail could easily accelerate global warming as nations turn to coal ( see BusinessWeek.com , 4/19/07 , " Rx for Earth : Sooner Not Later " ) .
Moreover , regardless of the implications for climate change , peak oil represents a mortal threat to the U.S. economy .
Peak oil refers to the point at which world oil production plateaus before beginning to decline as depletion of the world 's remaining reserves offsets ever - increased drilling .
Some experts argue that we 're already there , and that we wo n't exceed by much the daily production high of 84.5 million barrels first reached in 2005 .
If so , global production will bump along near these levels for years before beginning an inexorable decline .
What would that mean ?
Alternatives are still a decade away from meeting incremental demand for oil .
With nothing to fill the gap , global economic growth would slow , stop , and then reverse ; international tensions would soar as nations seek access to diminishing supplies , enriching autocratic rulers in unstable oil states ; and , unless other sources of energy could be ramped up with extreme haste , the world could plunge into a new Dark Age .
Even as faltering economies burned less oil , carbon loading of the atmosphere might accelerate as countries turn to vastly dirtier coal .
GIVEN SUCH UNPLEASANT possibilities , you 'd think peak oil would be a national obsession .
But policymakers can hide behind the possibility that vast troves will be available from unconventional sources , or that secretive oil - exporting nations really have the huge reserves they claim .
Yet even if those who say that the peak has arrived are wrong , enough disturbing omens — for example , declining production in most of the world 's great oil fields and no new superfields to take up the slack — exist for the issue to merit an intense international focus .
...
There are many things we in the U.S. can do ( and should have been doing ) other than the present policy of crossing our fingers .
If an oil tax makes sense from a climate change perspective , it seems doubly worthy if it extends supplies .
Boosting efficiency and scaling up alternatives must also be a priority .
And , recognizing that nations will turn to cheap coal ( recently , 80 % of growth in coal use has come from China ) , more work is needed to defang this fuel , which produces more carbon dioxide per ton than any other energy source .
Even if the peakists are wrong , we would still be better off taking these actions .
And if they 're right , major efforts right now may be the only way to avert a new Dark Age in an overheated world .
As previously noted Honda began construction of a ¥ 7 - billion ( US$ 61 million ) plant to mass produce solar cells at the end of September 2006 .
Now Green Car Congress1 has provided a follow - up report that Honda has begun sales of thin film solar cells .
In noting that Honda now has joined a growing field of manufactures of CIGS solar cells Jim Fraser states the belief that CIGS have a chance to become the low cost PV cell of the future .
He is particularly encouraged by the addition2 of Honda and the recent addition3 of Q - Cells because of their “ global reach and marketing prowess ”
He now includes those two companies on his list of manufacturers of low cost fairly efficient * solar panels that also includes Daystar , Global Solar , HelioVolt , Konarka , Miasole , and Nanosolar .
At present , the solar cell made by Honda Engineering Co. are available only in Japan , primarily in the Kanto area , through distributors that provide the installation service .
And , at a very good says GCC commentator Henrik .
From his sample , the average price of a 125W PV module is about $ 610 while the Honda go for $ 495 .
For how long that we shall continue to see increased installation of thin film PVL ( Photo Voltaic Laminates ) is at question .
Production is ramping up because of the current scarcity of pure silicon ; solar modules that use less or no silicon can be made for less .
Another reason is that developers have improved production methods .
A third reason is that photo electronic engineers have improved PVL efficiency , bringing the level of efficiency closer to what standard silicon cells previously could offer .
Where will the car of the future come from ?
Detroit , which fumbled the electric automobile and let Japan grab the lead in hybrids ?
Not likely .
Instead , try NASA , MIT 's Media Lab or Silicon Valley , where the sizzling , battery - powered Tesla Roadster debuted last summer .
New technology that promises to revolutionize the automobile as we know it is emerging from research institutions and startups -- and these innovations wo n't set you back $ 100,000 like a Tesla will .

Flightlink put four of its 160 - horsepower electric motors in the wheels of a BMW Mini to produce a concept car that shoots from zero to 60 in about four seconds and hits a top speed of 150 miles an hour .
The engines also act as brakes , recovering energy that charges a battery and giving the car a range of more than 200 miles .
A tiny gasoline motor can be used to recharge the battery for longer trips , on which the car gets 80 miles per gallon .
Another British firm , the Lightning Car Company , has already begun taking orders for its Lightning GT , a sleek , 700 - horsepower sports car powered by PML's wheel motors .
A team of researchers at MIT 's Media Lab , meanwhile , hopes to use the same approach to reduce congestion in today 's crowded cities .
They 're experimenting with small electric motors located in the wheels of the CityCar , a tiny , nimble and practically silent vehicle with wheels that turn 360 degrees , enabling it to slip neatly into tight urban parking spaces .
Designed to stack like supermarket carts when not in use , the cars could be parked strategically in front of subway stations and office buildings , where people could grab one as needed for short - term , one - way rentals , says Ryan Chin , one of the MIT researchers .

While this breakthrough discovery may not immediately resonate with a majority of the population ( not 70 % of it anyway ) , it has already sent the scientific world into a tizzy over its potential implications for biorefinery and our dependence on oil .
As reported in this week 's issue of Science ( subscription needed ) , a group of scientists have discovered a way to convert glucose into HFM ( hydroxymethylfurfural ) , a chemical that is broken down into components used to manufacture products now made from oil .
Since crude oil is the base component for fuels , plastic and several industrial and household chemicals , finding a method of replacing it with an environmentally friendly , cheap renewable plant matter has long been one of the Holy Grails in science .
Z. Conrad Zhang , the lead author and a scientist with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) - based Institute for Interfacial Catalysis , described the team 's accomplishment thusly : " What we have done that no one else has been able to do is convert glucose directly in high yields to a primary building block for fuel and polyesters . "
HMF , the putative building block , is a chemical derived from sugars like glucose and fructose that has shown promise as a replacement for oil - based chemicals typically used to make several consumer goods and industrial chemicals .
Although glucose , a sugar commonly found in plants , is the planet 's most abundant carbohydrate , developing a method of extracting a measurable amount of HMF from it had proven difficult until now , not least because of the production of several impurities .
Using an innovative non-acidic catalytic system containing metal chloride catalysts ( a class of metal halides ) in a solvent , or liquid , capable of dissolving cellulose , Zhang and his colleagues were able to obtain HMF yields of 70 % or higher from glucose and nearly 90 % from fructose with few impurities .
Solvents such as the one used here are beneficial in one important respect : they are reusable and therefore do not produce the wastewater typically found in other fructose to HMF conversion processes .
" This , in my view , is breakthrough science in the renewable energy arena , " said J.M. White , the director of the Institute for Interfacial Catalysis and Robert A. Welch chair in materials chemistry at the University of Texas .
" This work opens the way for fundamental catalysis science in a novel solvent . "
Zhang and his team are now hoping to increase HMF yield from glucose while minimizing the formation of impurities by tweaking the combinations of metal halides and ionic solvents used in the process .
" The opportunities are endless and the chemistry is starting to get interesting , " Zhang said .
There ’s a saying : “ everything ’s bigger in Texas . ”
Usually applied to SUVs , exurb - dwelling women ’s hair , and tex - mex dishes , it ’s starting to look like a lot of the biggest initiatives to green a metropolis are being born in Austin , Texas .
Will Wynn is not just Austin ’s mayor with a politically auspicious name : he ’s also Al Gore with a Texas twang .
A Worldchanger much more literate than I has already provided an excellent summary of Wynn ’s speaking points , to which I have nothing substantive to add .
The truly curious can also read the full current version of the Austin Climate Protection Plan .
A short list of not - so - little ways in which Austin , the capital of the most polluting state in the most polluting country in the world , is giving most other locales a run for their money at the slowly starting race to think big about being green :
1. Transportation Is Becoming Less Insane
Yes , our highways are still as clogged as last time you visited .
However , the vehicle in front of you seems increasingly likely to be practical in size , maybe even a scooter , perhaps even an electric one .
If you ’re really lucky , you ’ll catch a glimpse of one of the increasing number of electric vehicles .
With a small new subsidy on electric vehicle purchases or conversions and a campaign to encourage automakers to create plug - in hybrids , Austin ’s air will begin to smell more like barbecue and less like smog .
Add in plans for an expansive light rail system and Austinites just might stop thinking Hummers are cool rides .
2. Local Conservation Alive and Well
What good a little salamander can do !
The endangered Barton Springs Salamander serves as a mascot for Austin ’s efforts to protect our natural resources , with groups like Save Our Springs Alliance serving as watchdogs on even the largest companies that want to build in our backyards .
From Whole Foods to Alamo DraftHouse , Keeping Austin Weird entails buying local for both better experiences and less carbon .
3. Energy Policy Approaching Sensibility
Austin currently gets about 35 % of our electricity from coal , 30 % from natural gas , 29 % nuclear , and 6 % wind .
Wynn showed intellectual honesty during his presentation by mentioning the need to think about more nuclear capacity for long - term energy needs .
The city ’s wholly - owned utility , Austin Energy , is putting its money where the ( other ) green is : Austin Energy customers can get free fancy thermostats that help prevent brownouts , rebates on energy efficient appliances and solar cells , and sell back any excess energy generated to Austin Energy .
Lastly and probably most importantly :
4. Embracing Clean Tech Capitalism
To quote Austinite and Worldchanger Bruce Sterling : “ It ’s about a bunch of start - up companies asking rich people for money ” .
Love it or hate it , capitalism is getting the innovation job done slowly but surely in Austin .
We ’ve got an established innovator or two around town , and the city is trying to attract as many fresh innovations as possible .
Wynn ’s roadmap plan to allow local spend and purchase of carbon credits just might let Joe Sixpack join in on the fun .

Attempts to thwart identity theft and fraud through technology advances are likely to prove counterproductive , a British academic warns .
Dr Emily Finch , of the University of East Anglia , said the introduction of Chip and PIN on credit cards and UK government plans to introduce identity card schemes will only encourage crooks to become more imaginative .
She said there was no substitute for individual vigilance .
" There is a worrying assumption that advances in technology will provide the solution to identity theft whereas it is possible that they may actually aggravate the problem , " Finch told the British Association science conference , Reuters reports .
Finch ( something of the Clarice Starling of the Fens , it would seem ) bases her warning on her interviews with convicted fraudsters on the likely impact of technology advances on criminal behaviour .
" Studying the way that individuals disclose sensitive information would be far more valuable in preventing identity fraud than the evolution of technologically advanced but ultimately fallible measures to prevent misuse of personal information after it has been obtained , " she added .
The conclusions Finch reaches parallel those of some security experts who warn government attempts to sell identity cards as a means to combat ID theft are misguided .
These and other objections to the UK government 's ID card plans were outlined in a London School of Economics ' study involving more than 100 academics published in March . ®
