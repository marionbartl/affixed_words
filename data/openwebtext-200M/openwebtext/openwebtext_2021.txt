Those who can , do .
Those who can't , make those who can draw a picture
My first effort in instructing computers , about 30 years ago , was drawing a flowchart .
Here it is as I remember it , albeit without the smears and crossings - out with which my 14 - year - old self doubtless decorated the original .
We were unconstrained , in those far off days , by such piffling issues as web interface , unit tests , or code efficiency .
Nor did we have to contend , as did some of my luckier contemporaries , with complex systems where punched cards were sent off to a local bureau .
The fact was we simply had no hardware at all , unless you counted the clear plastic stencil that had to be bought from WH Smith's .
The only opportunity we got to exercise our " code " was by slogging through a " dry run " , a notably unsatisfactory exercise involving an imaginary computer .
It was , to borrow a crisp , vulgar phrase from Robert Robinson , " ... like losing one 's virginity without having the f*ck " .
When a school micro finally did arrive , a year or two later , those of us who had been bitten by the programming bug gleefully threw our inky stencils aside and proved we could tackle non-Radox problems without diagramatic props .
But after that uninspiring formative experience , I have tended to be suspicious of those who would oblige me to make pretty pictures when I should be banging out code .
This article is a record of how those suspicions have panned out .
Again with the flowchart
Flowchart worship persisted long beyond the point where even British management might have been expected to spot they were rubbish .
In the mid-1980s , I watched from a safe distance as a colleague attempted to code up an entire application from a flowchart specification .
This massive document , beautifully hand - Rotringed on best engineering paper , was hundreds of pages long .
Its pages all looked something like this :
Only much bigger and scarier .
Any sense of structure of the original program had , naturally , been entirely suppressed .
My colleague operated a dual coping strategy to deal with this monster : during working hours she wept delicately and persistently ; during the lunch break she scanned the job ads .
I do n't believe the port was ever completed .
During the late 1980s , the flowchart was at last jeered out of software development .
A host of alternatives competed to occupy its throne , usually proprietary and usually associated with an expensive CASE tool .
Although some approaches really hit the spot - for example relational database schema design - a lot of other diagramming techniques just left you with the sensation of being lectured at .
For example , there was something called the context data flow diagram .
The version I was taught comprised a single circle , surrounded by labelled arrows .
A hypothetical clearing bank system would look like this :
Other not - terribly - good diagrams I was obliged to draw at around the same time were structure charts ( I think these were just function call hierarchies ) ; thread diagrams ( dull short stories expressed as data flows ) and , a little later , class hierarchies .
These last I believe were a hangover from Smalltalk , and when first introduced ( always as an IDE feature called a " class browser " ) were thought to be a vital prerequisite to any OO development .
It took a while before it was noticed that nobody used them .
This realisation may have coincided with Borland releasing a version of its C++ framework called " OWL " .
Previous class libraries had displayed as elegant inverted " V " shapes .
But this particular version of OWL , the first to make extensive use of multiple inheritance , looked like a basket of wool that had been romped in by an exceptionally lively litter of kittens .
It was enough to put you off your templates .
Its trading losses spiralled to 4.9 billion euros ( $ 7.1 billion ) as the bank tried to close out the rogue positions in Monday 's sliding market .
The country 's top banker dubbed the trader " a genius of fraud . "
SocGen declined to give a name , but three sources at the bank named him as Jerome Kerviel , 31 , a trader on the bank 's award - winning equity derivatives desk earning less than 100,000 euros a year .
Kerviel could not be reached for comment .
If fraud is proved , the loss will be the biggest caused by a single trader , dwarfing the $ 1.4 billion loss by trader Nick Leeson that broke British bank Barings , and the $ 2.6 billion Sumitomo Corp lost in rogue copper trades in the 1990s .
It also eclipses a $ 6 billion - plus loss racked up by hedge fund Amaranth trader Brian Hunter and his team ahead of the fund 's collapse in 2006 .
" It was an extremely sophisticated fraud in the way it was concealed , " said Societe Generale Chairman Daniel Bouton , who offered to resign and was asked to stay on by the board .
Some investors wondered whether the bank 's manouevres had contributed to Monday 's market fall , and to the U.S. Federal Reserve 's decision to cut interest rates , but CNBC reported a Fed source saying the central bank had not been aware of SocGen 's problems ahead of the emergency 75 basis point cut .
Shares in SocGen , which has a market capitalisation of about 36 billion euros , fell more than 4 percent to 75.81 euros .
Traders said the shares were cushioned from further falls after the French financial establishment moved quickly to shore up SocGen 's shattered capital .
One of France 's oldest banks but a world leader in free - wheeling modern financial derivatives , SocGen said the losses came to light at the weekend when it found that a junior trader had tried to cover up bad bets on the stock market .
Instead of beating a path to cash - rich sovereign wealth funds , as some U.S. banks have done during the recent credit slump , SocGen announced a capital increase of 5.5 billion euros
and said this had already been underwritten by other banks .
France 's prime minister reassured investors that SocGen 's woes were isolated from the malaise sweeping global financial markets after a meltdown in U.S. sub -prime credit markets .
A Question for Leonard Peikoff
State Torture
On his website Leonard Peikoff calls himself “ the world ’s foremost authority on Ayn Rand ’s philosophy ” and solicits your philosophical questions , a select number of which he will answer via podcast – an audio file you can play any time .
Past subjects have included metaphysics , consciousness , career , politics .
We trust he will have time for government institutionalized torture .
Mr. Peikoff was one of the first American intellectuals to promote state - sanctioned torture , perhaps the first . [ 1 ]
Other writers at the Ayn Rand Institute continue in the same vein : [ 2 ]
“ Why does it [ the administration ] fear torturing prisoners of war , if that could save American lives ? ”
“ If ... torture is an effective method of extracting information that would save American lives , we [ or rather U.S. government agents ] should ... torture prisoners as necessary . ”
“ If torture works , torture him , if uh if torture does n’t work then do n’t torture him . ”
( From a radio interview .
Perhaps the “ uh ” hid the mental question : how does the thug undo the torture after finding out it did n’t work ? )
“ If ... torturing any terrorist captive [ alleged and proven alike ? ] can be expected [ by a U.S. agent ] to provide information that will prevent the murder of Americans , we [ or rather U.S. government agents ] are morally obligated to do it . ”
And in spite of what ARI writers insinuate , the U.S. gives little consideration – at times none at all – to the guilt or innocence of those chosen for torture .
ARI writers have nothing to say about steps of undisguised tyranny such as the Real ID Act , the Military Commissions Act , the Martial Law Act , the Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , etc. like a trap slowly being assembled .
They ignore government whistleblowers trying to expose the compromising of America to foreign interests .
But when it comes to promoting thugs in the name of “ fighting our enemies , ” you can count on them to make the effort .
January 2008 was a good time to ask Mr. Peikoff a question about this because the next few weeks his podcasts originated from the Ayn Rand Institute offices in Irvine , California ; the ARI staff sat in on the recordings and occasionally contributed to them .
Taking advantage of Mr. Peikoff ’s offer I emailed him a question , in brief : “ What ’s your position on state torture ? ” along with scraps of argument supporting my own position against it .
Judging from ARI articles any appeal to psychology and decency would have been futile , so I focused on the pragmatic : how does state torture defend a civilized country as a civilized country , and even more crudely , does it even work in the short term ?
Frankly my own first reaction to such questions is : even to discuss this is obscene , even to debate it is to give in .
On further reflection , the sophistries of ARI writers and their ilk must be exposed , at least by pointing to them .
Here is my letter , dated January 12 , 2008 ( footnotes added ) .
Dr. Peikoff , [ 3 ]
Several Objectivists at the Ayn Rand Institute have said ( paraphrasing ) :
If torturing a man will help defend American troops , then our government ought to torture him .
They make their point in IF - THEN form .
The assumption , the IF , is : Government torture helps defend American troops .
Yet many professional interrogators emphatically say :
No , torture does n’t work .
For example James H. Harper , former Lieutenant Colonel , Chief , MI ( Military Intelligence ) Branch , U.S. Total Army Personnel Command ; and Daniel Coleman , former FBI agent .
Alleged examples of torture that worked are found on examination to be false ( such as Abu Zubaida , who had been cooperating without torture and whose subsequent torture yielded nothing of further value – under it he confessed to everything but the kitchen sink ) or from an unreliable source ( such as a Third World government , or the Bush administration ) . [ 4 ]
Among intellectuals it ’s hard to find any defenders of state - sanctioned torture outside of Neoconservatives , Alan Dershowitz ( I repeat myself ) – and the Ayn Rand Institute .
Even if we were to grant that under torture certain men , in real cases , had provided information later found reliable – I assume you believe that information obtained under torture is not by itself reliable – you still would need to show that the information could not have been obtained just as well , even setting aside decency , without torture .
My question – and it ’s a philosophical question , relevant today and for all time – is :
Should the state employ agents who torture men ?
The answer does not begin with IF per above .
And please , no unreal ticking bomb “ men in a lifeboat ” made - up examples designed to elicit a preconceived answer .
I seek an answer based on induction from the real world : history , examples , facts , not daydreams or television shows .
Life and reason , not tautology .
When has torture as a legitimate method of inquiry ever helped a free country as a free country ?
Though philosophy deals in generalities and with situations which could happen though perhaps only rarely , that does n’t mean we can make up situations out of thin air , arbitrarily .
As someone once ironically remarked on this subject : “ Suppose you had to kill everyone on earth so you could survive ... . ”
This is no way to do philosophy .
Especially when some politico like Yoo , Gonzales , or Mukasey might use your answer to justify Khiam Prison .
Include in your answer , if you would , any difference between the levels of “ state ” – that is , torture performed by local city cops , by county police , state troopers , and federal agents .
If one is beneficial , why not the others ?
During the American Revolutionary War George Washington forbade his men to torture British prisoners and threatened court - martial and death to anyone who disobeyed . [ 5 ]
My question of course is prompted by our government ’s conduct today .
By now countless men – hundreds , some totally innocent – have been swept up and tortured at U.S. facilities or rendered ( as in “ extraordinary rendition ” ) to Third World countries to be tortured at U.S. behest and under its supervision .
Though water - boarding – much in the news – is something out of Medieval times , U.S. torture goes far beyond that .
The Mafia has nothing on what the U.S. is doing today .
I look forward to hearing your answer via podcast on your website .
Since this is part of the broader question of what America is and how to defend it , I want to say that any real defense of America must begin with – first and foremost – ending the criminal corruption in our government revealed by such whistleblowers as Rodney Stich , Catherine Austin Fitts , Thomas Drake and many others . [ 6 ]
Sincerely yours ,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
While Mr. Peikoff considered this letter I ventured a guess as to how he might respond :
George Washington lived over two centuries ago .
Our situation today is unprecedented .
Iranian savages who hate us for being civilized will design and build a nuclear bomb in only a few months and , bent on self - destruction ( Iran a known fixed location ) , nuke New York .
These savages are so powerful , so resourceful , we must become savages ourselves .
Do n’t tie my hands by rejecting ARI ’s conditionals .
If torture works , then by God torture works .
John Dewey ... I mean ... uh ... can we restart the recording ?
Our situation is desperate .
That ’s why we at ARI did not protest the Military Commissions Act , the Patriot Act , the Martial Law Act , the Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act and so forth .
Faced as we are with Islamics ten feet tall , now is no time to be squeamish .
We can always trust our government .
Do n’t talk to me of Rodney Stich , Thomas Drake and so on , whoever they are .
After five months Mr. Peikoff had not replied .
He did however have time to answer “ When you refer to a dictionary for word definitions , which published edition of a dictionary do you rely on ? ” and others equally shallow .
He answered some questions having depth but most of them still were far less important than the question of state torture .
Finally Mr. Peikoff replied to a similar question asked by someone else , and committed all the fallacies warned about here .
See Leonard Peikoff on Torture .
Mr Howard said Labor had won " fairly and squarely "
Mr Howard , whose centre - right coalition led Australia for 11 years , is only the second sitting leader in the country 's history to be unseated in an election .
Labor rival Maxine McKew , a former TV reporter , took the Sydney constituency of Bennelong which Mr Howard had represented for 33 years .
Labor won a convincing victory in last month 's federal elections .
Mr Howard had already been replaced as leader of the Liberal Party by former Defence Minister Brendan Nelson .
Ms McKew was a popular and respected political reporter
Newly - elected Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has given
Ms McKew a job in his government , as parliamentary secretary to the prime minister and cabinet .
But she was not officially confirmed as an MP until a ceremony on Wednesday .
Mr Howard said Labor had won the seat " fairly and squarely " and wished the new government well .
" It was [ a ] very long campaign and it was a tough campaign and I have no complaints . "
The race in the Bennelong constituency had been very tight , and a final result could not be declared until postal and absentee votes had been counted .
Rudy Giuliani is currently the clear front - runner on the Republican side for the nomination .
He leads in every major poll , he ’s got a 13 - 14 point lead on Romney on Intrade , and in a fairly weak Republican field , very few of his opponents seem to have the strength to mount a significant challenge to him .
Yet , despite all that , there ’s a lot of uneasiness on the Republican side .
Very few Republicans actively wish Giuliani to gain the nomination .
Outside of the neoconservatives , there are a lot of people who are praying for anyone but him to win the nomination .
Yet he still leads by a wide margin in the polls .
How can a candidate who generates such little excitement , and who is anathema to the social conservatives and the libertarians in the Republican base , lead the race ?
Well , much like the relative obscurity of Ron Paul in major national polls , the “ popularity ” of Giuliani may simply be that nobody knows him beyond his service as the mayor of New York under 9/11 .
In fact , I was surprised to find that many in the Republican base know very little about him :
Some of these social conservatives are nonetheless so appalled by Mr Giuliani that they threaten to back a third - party candidate if he wins the Republican nomination .
Others think that would be foolish , since it would virtually guarantee victory for the Democrats .
But many Republicans fall into a third category — they are simply unaware that Mr Giuliani is socially liberal .
A recent Gallup poll found that only 37 % knew he was pro-choice and only 18 % knew he favoured civil unions for gays .
This makes the race for the Republican nomination extremely hard to predict .
As the primaries draw near , will voters learn more about Mr Giuliani and reject him ? …
Civil libertarians , too , distrust Mr Giuliani .
He is worryingly vague as to what constitutes torture .
He tried unsuccessfully to stay on as mayor beyond his term limit , citing the emergency of September 11th 2001 .
Washington Monthly , a Beltway journal , predicts — on the evidence of his record in New York — that if Mr Giuliani were elected president he would grab even more executive power than Mr Bush has .
I increasingly believe that the Republican primaries are going to be a lot more exciting than many are currently predicting .
Republican voters may currently have Giuliani sitting in first place , but I think quite a large number of them do so not because they admire his policies , but because they do n’t know anything about him or any other candidates .
Ron Paul appears to be catching the hearts and minds of the civil libertarians , and although he ’s not polling well , he ’s bringing in money .
Mike Huckabee– the evolution non-believer that he is– seems to be collecting the social conservatives , and while he ’s got very little money , he ’s polling better than expected .
Might it be that as we approach the primaries , we begin to see a mass flight away from Giuliani , as the Republican party fractures between the neocons , libertarians , and social conservatives ?
I see the potential for some major fireworks , and the time might have finally arrived where the Republican party has to have some debates about what it is and what it stands for .
Does that mean that I ’ll predict a Giuliani defeat ?
It ’s possible , but a lack of excitement does n’t preclude him from winning the nomination .
Nobody liked or was excited by John Kerry in 2004 , but he got the nod simply because it was expected that he was the most “ electable ” .
It may be that Giuliani squeaks through because Republicans think he ’s the only one that has the power to stand up to Hillary , but I think that is misguided .
If Republicans are forced only to vote against something , I do n’t see the necessary numbers making it to the polls to stand a chance .
I , for one , would rather stay home that vote for Giuliani , even if it means that Hillary will win .
And if Republicans can’t come to enough of a consensus to agree on voting for a candidate and platform , perhaps it ’s best to take the time in the minority to figure it out .
Via Chicago Tribune :
The Bush administration is considering air strikes against the Kurdish rebel group PKK in northern Iraq in an attempt to stave off a Turkish invasion of Iraq to fight the rebels , administration officials said .
President Bush spoke with Turkish President Abdullah Gul by phone Monday in an effort to ease the crisis .
According to an official familiar with the conversation , Bush assured the Turkish president that the U.S. was looking seriously into options beyond diplomacy to stop the attacks coming from Kurdish - controlled northern Iraq .
" It 's not ' Kumbaya ' time anymore -- just talking about trilateral talks is not going to be enough , " the official said .
" Something has to be done . "

How many new insurgents will this create ?
Juan Cole has more on Bush 's collapsed foreign policy and the consequences at Salon .
UPDATE : ( Nicole )
It should be noted that the Special Envoy to Turkey , Gen .
Joe Ralston resigned in protest just weeks ago essentially because he was frustrated by the lack of interest in diplomacy by the Bush Administration in his year - long tenure .
I tried to cram myself with Stephen Wolfram trivia ( there ’s all you might want at his website ) before seeing him live at the 2006 Summer Startup School but I wish I had read this brief correspondence he had with Feynman .
I would have been in still more awe ( which might had been counterproductive , I might no have had the courage to approach him and make a fool of myself ) .
STEPHEN WOLFRAM TO RICHARD P. FEYNMAN , SEPTEMBER 26 , 1985
In the early 1980s , Stephen Wolfram turned his energies from traditional areas of fundamental physics to creating the new field of complexity research .
Some physicists and science administrators were skeptical about this new direction .
Dear Feynman ,
First , thanks very much for your letter on the cryptosystem .
I managed to break my addiction to studying the thing for a while , but am now getting back to it .
I would like to try and understand systematically how far one can get with the kind of approach you were using : in particular , whether it allows the seed to be found in polynomial time .
But I must say I am still reasonably confident that the system is at least hard to break .
I have a new idea for showing that breaking it would be equivalent to solving an NP , complete problem ; I ’ll let you know if this works out .
I thought I would send the enclosed stuff that I have just written .
It is not about science ( which is what I would prefer to write about ) , but rather about the organization of science .
I am being treated increasingly badly at IAS , and really have to move .
I ca n’t see anywhere that would really be nice to go to , and would support the kinds of things I am now interested in .
So I am thinking of trying to create my own environment , by starting some kind of institute .
It would be so much nicer if such a thing already existed , but it does n’t .
There are a few plans afoot to create things perhaps like this , but I think they are rather misguided .
You probably think that doing something administrative like this is an awful waste of time , and I am not sure that I can disagree , but I feel that I have little choice , and given that I am going to do it , I would like to do it as well as possible .
Any comments , suggestions , etc. , that you might have I would very greatly appreciate .
Best wishes ,
Stephen Wolfram
RICHARD P. FEYNMAN TO STEPHEN WOLFRAM , OCTOBER 14 , 1985
Dear Wolfram :
It is not my opinion that the present organizational structure of science inhibits “ complexity research ” — I do not believe such an institution is necessary .
You say you want to create your own environment — but you will not be doing that : you will create ( perhaps ! ) an environment that you might like to work in — but you will not be working in this environment — you will be administering it — and the administration environment is not what you seek — is it ?
You wo n’t enjoy administrating people because you wo n’t succeed in it .
You do n’t understand “ ordinary people . ”
To you they are “ stupid fools ” — so you will not tolerate them or treat their foibles with tolerance or patience — but will drive yourself wild ( or they will drive you wild ) trying to deal with them in an effective way .
Find a way to do your research with as little contact with non-technical people as possible , with one exception , fall madly in love !
That is my advice , my friend .
Sincerely ,
Richard P. Feynman
Wolfram did not follow Feynman ’s advice .
Not only did he establish an insti-tute but he also founded the company Wolfram Research , makers of the widely used Mathematica software system .
Contrary to Feynman ’s expectation Wolfram has been a successful CEO for many years .
Within this environment he has managed to pursue ambitious directions in basic science , particularly through his 2002 book A New Kind of Science .
He has also been happily married since the early 1990s .

ABSTRACT
JTEC SOLAR POWERED CELL TOWER GENERATOR
This project will attempt to resolve the key technical issues and uncertainties regarding a
breakthrough concept for low - cost high - efficiency solar power .
The proposed approach is based
on a conceptual system for providing independent power for cell towers that will allow them to
function even after emergencies like hurricane Katrina .
The solar engine is based on the Johnson
ThermoElectrochemical Converter ( JTEC ) concept for converting heat to electricity invented by
( Lonnie ) Johnson , who will be available to assist Tuskegee University in carrying out this work .
Except for the working fluid , JTEC is an all solid state engine that does not have mechanical
moving parts .
Different from conventional solid state thermoelectric devices , it does not have
inherent parasitic heat loss paths .
JTEC uses Membrane Electrode Assemblies ( MEA ) similar to
those used in fuel cells ; however , it does not require oxygen or a special fuel , only heat .
The
availability of a range of proton conductive membrane materials that operate from room
temperature up to and exceeding 1200 oC suggests that JTEC could generate electricity from
practically any heat source , from very small , just a few degrees , to very large temperature
differences .
JTEC approximates the Ericsson thermodynamic cycle which is Carnot equivalent .
Research on this technology offers the potential for achieving solar power efficiency of 50 % in
the short - term and 80 % in the long - term , far beyond what is expected from photovoltaics both in
efficiency and in cost .
(1) Intellectual merit of the proposed activity
JTEC is a fundamentally new solid state engine concept .
Critical research is needed to enable a
credible analysis of its potential .
Research is needed into the properties of proton conductive
materials needed to make a working system .
The materials are similar those being studied in
fuel cell research , but new material properties must be investigated in order to optimize the
choices for this application .
Research is needed to model , simulate and optimize an integrated
systems design for cost - effective recharge power for cell towers .
(2) Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity :
Cell towers running out of battery power were a crucial problem in the wake of Katrina and
resulted unnecessary deaths and destruction .
This project , with follow - on research , could
provide un-interruptible , cost effective power for communications in areas threatened by
hurricanes and other disasters that is not limited by battery life .
The proposed engine technology
will have major impacts on the international energy economy particularly with respect to the
need for economical , green , renewable energy .
This research is consistent with NSF goals for
minority education and outreach .
Tuskegee University is a HBCU institution and Johnson
Research is a minority owned small business .

The team managed to film the wolves taking to the water to hunt waterfowl - behaviour that has never been seen before , according to an expert .
Arctic wolves live in the Canadian Arctic and northern parts of Greenland ; observing them is a difficult task as they rarely interact with humans .
The team followed a pack on Ellesmere Island for several weeks last summer .
This glimpse into the lives of these elusive animals was filmed for the Natural World wildlife programme : White Falcon , White Wolf , which also features other animals , including gyr falcons , Arctic foxes and snowy owls , that live on the remote island .
The wolves were filmed along with other animals on the island
Snowy owl attack
Wolf expert David Mech , from the US Geological Survey , said : " I 'd never seen wolves try to catch waterfowl before and this was interesting to see . "
Usually , he said , wolves eat large hoofed animals , although they will vary their diet as circumstances dictate .
He explained : " They take advantage of whatever food opportunities are available , and in this case , these waterfowl were available , so they took advantage of trying to get them .
" I 'm interested in the challenges these animals overcome to hunt their food .
I 've been intrigued with how the wolf manages to solve problems in so many different ways , with so many different species . "
Lucky find
Ellesmere Island sits at the northernmost tip of Canada ; it is only during the brief Arctic summer that the snow thaws to reveal the true features of the rugged landscape beneath .
Here , the BBC Natural History Unit tracked down a pack of eight wolves , including a dominant male and three one - year - olds .
The wolves , especially one called Lucy , were bold and playful
Inquisitive nature
Harry Hoskyns - Abrahall , assistant producer of White Falcon , White Wolf , said the team was lucky to come across the wolves almost as soon as they arrived on the island .
He told the BBC News website : " We went to this particular area because wolves had been spotted there a few years earlier .
" We were immediately encouraged when we found wolf tracks and marking posts on day one ; and then the next day , we went out on the same route and we saw a wolf , which was absolutely unbelievable and very exciting . "
By following the wolf and its tracks , the team was eventually able to track down a den .
" We were incredibly lucky , " said Mr Hoskyns - Abrahall .
" Once you 've got the den , you have somewhere where the wolves are going to focus their behaviour . "
THE ARCTIC'S WHITE WOLF
The Arctic wolf is actually a subspecies of the grey wolf
In comparison it has a shorter stature but a bulkier build Scientific name for the Arctic wolf is Canis lupus arctos
It ranges across the Canadian Arctic and north Greenland Packs will prey on caribou , musk oxen , hares , lemmings
The crew was able to film the animals going about their daily business .
" The most incredible part was when we saw the young wolf swim out to the middle of a lake and go after the geese , we just could n't believe that it could seriously consider getting a goose in that way , " he added .
Inquisitive nature
The team was also amazed by the wolves ' boldness .
" The younger wolves in the pack would come right up to us , and they would come up to our camp and empty our rucksacks - you would wake up and find your clothing spread all over the place .
They were very inquisitive , " explained Mr Hoskyns - Abrahall .
Arctic explorer Jim McNeill , who worked with the crew and kept a diary of his experiences for the BBC News website , was particularly taken with one young wolf who he nicknamed Lucy .
He said : " The highlight for me was one afternoon when the crew was off filming .
" Lucy came near the camp and I spent the best part of an afternoon with her in spectacular sunshine .
We just shared a space - it felt extremely special . "
He added : " I 've been exploring this area for 25 years and to spend this time with these animals gave me another perspective on Arctic life .
Luck played a factor when tracking down the Arctic wolves
" To be part of the process of finding them and then capturing that footage was a fantastic feeling . "
Fergus Beeley , producer of the programme , said making the film was something of an accomplishment .
He said : " Arctic wolves have been an aspiration [ to film ] of mine for about 15 years .
" I have a bit of a reputation for going for animals that are a tricky : filming the wolves posed the ultimate challenge .
" We did n't know where they would be ' denning ' , what their movements would be , so we had to do a lot of planning based on ' guestimates ' - and luckily they worked out to be right . "
White Falcon , White Wolf is on BBC Two on Friday 1 February at 2000 GMT and Sunday 3 February at 1755 GMT
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Internet veterans have long complained about the steady erosion of civility -- and worse , intelligence -- in online discourse .
Initially the phenomenon seemed to be a seasonal disorder .
It occurred every September when freshmen showed up for college and went online .
Tasting for the first time the freedom and power of the Internet , the newbies would behave like a bunch of drunken fraternity pledges , filling electronic bulletin boards with puerile remarks until the upperclassmen could whip them into shape .
Things took a dramatic turn for the worse in 1993 , when AOL ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) loosed its tens of thousands -- and then millions -- of users onto the Net .
The event came to be known as the Endless September , and true to its name , it continues to this day .
It 's a serious problem .
Fools and bandwidth hogs have a way of driving traffic away from the most successful online destinations , a phenomenon that could ruin the emerging social networks and user - generated aggregators like Digg .
But there 's still hope for intelligent life on the Internet .
A team of software developers is hard at work on a " stupid filter " that promises to do to idiotic online comments what a spam filter does to junk and unwanted e-mail : put it in a place where it can't hurt anyone anymore .
That 's the mission , anyway , of the cadre of techies toiling under the leadership of Gabriel Ortiz , a 27 - year - old systems administrator in Albuquerque .
Ortiz 's team is readying a free , open - source version they hope to release by year 's end and make available as a standard plug - in on the popular Firefox browser by early next year .
How does it work ?
Say a user wants to post a really , really dumb comment on , for example , cnnmoney.com , where some of you might be reading this now .
If cnnmoney had the filter installed on its servers , it would intercept the comment just before it was published and flash a little alert at the author that reads : " This comment is more or less unintelligible .
Please try to restate it . "
The writer would get another crack at it , and another , until at last he was able to muster a few words of intelligence , or in frustration wandered off to inflict those LOL !!!!!s and OMG !!!!s on some more tolerant site .
From a programming standpoint , not to mention a social one , building a piece of software that can separate intellectual wheat from chaff is tricky ; it 's far more difficult than building a spam filter , says Ortiz .
That 's because spam filters tend to do relatively simple pattern matching , searching e-mail for words that pop up frequently in junk mail .
Your spam filter sees V * I * A * G*R* A and without rolling its eyes flicks the offending missive into the junk folder , where it can be deleted along with the rest of its filthy brethren .
But thanks in part to irony and its sneering cousin , sarcasm , stupidity is tougher to spot .
" Smart people are often ironic , " says Ortiz , noting that irony , to a computer anyway , can sound stupid .
Writers who are otherwise intelligent will intentionally misspell words or break the ironclad rules of grammar to make a point .
The stupid - filter team is trying to accommodate this behavior with a variety of rules of thumb .
For instance , Ortiz , who studied linguistics as an undergrad , recently noticed a pattern in the way some writers use letter repetition .
The clueless tend to repeat consonants : " This video is amazinggggg ! ! ! "
By comparison , says Ortiz , " when you repeat a vowel , you 're being sarcastic -- ' Yeaaaaaah . '
We 'll be using several different methods to try to mediate this . "
The first line of defense is context -- using well - established markers of standard English to judge a piece of writing .
For instance , if the rest of the sentences in a comment are grammatical , and difficult words are spelled properly -- Ortiz mentioned " zucchini , " which I had to look up -- the message ought to get by the filter .
If the rest of the comment is unintelligible , it will be screened .
Perhaps the most interesting -- and ironic -- aspect of the project is the way Ortiz 's team is tapping into the wisdom of crowds to debug its filter .
They are encouraging readers to visit their site , http://stupidfilter.org/main/, where you can help them rate on a scale of one to five a selection of potentially dumb posts culled from -- where else ? -- YouTube .
Ortiz has clearly hit a nerve .
Offers of help have been rolling in from all over the world ever since the project was unveiled .
He thinks there might even be a business in it , since staying current with pop culture and maintaining the corpus of stupidity is more or less a full - time job .
To which I 'd add , Yeaaaaaah .
ベストセラー『国家の品格』の著者藤原正彦が、画家安野光雅との対談を収めた一冊。
それなりにおもしろい。おもしろいのだが、どうも首をかしげる記述が多すぎる。日本語贔屓が過ぎて、贔屓の引き倒しになってしまっている気がする。
たとえば、日本語の語彙の豊かさを語った箇所はこう。
五百年前の一個人と現代の辞典を比べることにどれほどの意味があるのだろう。比較するならせめて同時代の英語と日本語でなければならないだろう。
そもそも語彙が多ければ言葉遣いが豊かだということにはならないし、古の日本語はやたらに「をかし」だの「わろし」で済ませてしまう言語ではなかったか。
また、藤原は安野の言葉を受けて、欧米の韻文を批判する。
藤原 その通りです。行末に同じ音を置くことでリズムがでます。例えば、red , head , dead , breadなどを文末に配します。欧米人は好むようですが、私には「無理しているなあ」とか、「駄洒落っぽい」と思えることもあります。リズムは確かに出るのですが。
しかし、文末で韻を踏むのは何も欧米の詩だけではない。藤原が賞賛する漢詩だって原文はそうである。何も日本語を褒めるために外国語を貶すことはないじゃないか。
藤原はいう 。
わが国は世界に冠たる文学の国である。全国民がこれに触れ、とりわけ若いうちに触れ、美しい情緒を培い、祖国への深い誇りや自信を得ることは、私の、そして恐らく安野先生の願いでもある。本書がそのための水先案内人となったとしたら幸いである。
本当にそうなのだろうか。日本語はほかの言語より美しい言語なのか。そして、文学とはその美しい言語を通して祖国への自信をはぐくむような代物なのか。何か違うんじゃないの、とぼくなどは思ってしまう。
石川九揚は、西洋言語学を批判した著書『日本語とはどういう言語か』のなかで、こう書いている。
三種類の文字をもつ言語が世界に類例を見ないことからいえば、日本語は非常に特異な言語です。ただしそのことは、先ほどもお話したように、優れたことでも劣ったことでもなく、メリットとデメリットの両方をもたらすことがあると、少し注意深く考えておいたほうがいいと思います。よく「美しい日本語」という言葉を耳にしますが、漢字と平仮名と片仮名の三つの文字が混在して使われるのですから、整合的な美しさに乏しく、一概に「日本語が美しい」とはとてもいえないはずです。
この意見に賛成する。たくさん文字があれば美しい豊かな言語だというなら、日本語にアルファベットを加えればもっと美しい言語が出来るはずだ。そんな話はない。
日本語ブームである。それも、やたらに「美しい日本語」と「祖国への誇り」がワンセットで語られる。たとえば、このサイトでは、「日本の弱体化」を救うため、「美しい日本語」を集めている。
ここにあるものは、日本民族の象徴としての日本語という概念である。しかし、日本語とはそもそも、外国語である漢語を取り込むことによって成立したものではないか。
この試みは、決して荒唐無稽なものではない。じっさいに、「乱れた日本語」ならぬ「美しい日本語」だけを集めた『美しい日本語の辞典』という本が出版されている。
美しい日本語。乱れた日本語。両者は対極の概念に思える。しかし、そもそも、「言葉の乱れ」とは何か。
この点にかんしては藤原も少しふれているが、言葉は乱れるものであり、昔から乱れつづけているものである。
たとえば、川口良と角田文幸『日本語はだれのものか』では、清少納言が「言葉の乱れ」を嘆く言葉を取り上げている。
男も女もよろづの事まさりてわろきもの ことばの文字あやしく使いたることあれ。ただ文字一つに、あやしくも、あてにもいやしくもなるは、いかなることにかあらむ。（中略）なんなき事を言ひて、「その事させんとす」と、「言わんとす」「何とせんとす」と言ふを、「と」文字を失ひて、ただ「言はんずる」「里へ出でんずる」など言へば、やがていとわろし。まして文を書きては、言うべきにもあらず。
口語訳は面倒なので省略するが、簡単にいうと、「言はんとす 」
「何とせんとす」などというべきところを、「と」を除いて「言はんずる」
「里へ出でんずる」などと云えば、ひどく「わろし」であるという意味だ。
ようするに、清少納言はその時代の「と抜き言葉」が気にいらなかったわけだ。現代の「らぬき言葉」とそれに対する反発が、日本語の長い歴史を眺めれば決してめずらしい現象ではないことがわかる。
また、清少納言から一千年後の作家兼エッセイストである三島由紀夫はいう。
私は小説ではない随想の文章に、「僕」と書くことを好みません。「僕」という言葉の日常会話的なぞんざいさと、ことさら若々しさを衒ったような感じは文章の気品を傷（そこな）うからであります。私は「僕」という言葉は公衆のまえで使う言葉とは思いません。それは会話のなかだけで使われる言葉でありましょう。
しかし、その三島の使う 「日常会話的」も、柳田国男にいわせれば、「あさましい」間違えた日本語である。
今日標準語として余儀なく認められるものの中にも、いたって素性の不明な下品なものが幾らもまじっており、それでいてなおわれわれはいつも形容詞の飢饉を感じているのである。これに対する応急策としては、かの何々的とかいうやつはむしろあさましい鼻元思案であった。歴史になんの根拠もないのみか、中国の元方においてもそんな風には「的」は使っていない。幸いにして今はまだ年寄りや女子供はこれを顧みず、歌謡文芸にまで取り入れようとするほどの勇敢な者もないからよいようなものの、こんなものが日本の標準語になるようであったら、それこそ大変な話ではあるまいか。
このように、一千年間も日本語は「乱れ」つづけていて、その時代の識者に不快感をもたらしていたのである。いまさら「言葉の乱れ」を批判してもどうにもならない。
それでは 、 「美しい日本語」なんてものは存在しえないのか。しょせんそれは幻なのか。
いや、ある、とぼくは思う。正しくは「美しい日本語」はなくても、「美しい日本語の使い方」はある。
たとえば、こんな日本語を見ると、ぼくは瞬間的に「美しい」と、狂おしいような感覚を味わうことになる。
わたくしといふ現象 は
仮定された有機交流電燈の
ひとつの青い照明で す
（あらゆる透明な幽霊の複合体）
風景やみんなといつしよに
せはしくせはしく明滅しながら
いかにもたしかにともりつづける
因果交流電燈 の
ひとつの青い照明で す
（ひかりはたもち その電燈は失はれ ）
宮沢賢治の『春と修羅』と中島敦の『山月記』だ。
主観の粋をこえるものではないにしろ、ここにはたしかに「美しい日本語」、「美しい文学」があるように思える。
しかし、それは、即座に 「祖国への誇り」につながっていくような、いうなれば漂白された日本語ではなく、増して「正しい日本語」などではありえない。
ただ、日本語のもつ可能性を極限まで引き出しているという一点に於いて名文となっているだけである。「美しい日本語」はないが「日本語の美しい使い方」はある、というのはこういう意味だ。
どんな言葉でも、それなりの歴史と、可能性、メリットとデメリットを秘めている。
レゴのブロックのようなものだ。組み立てるものが組み立てれば城砦を築くことも出来るその一方、下手糞が造れば奇怪な建物まがいが出来るばかり。ブロックを取り出して美しいの汚いのといっても意味がない。
そして、長い時間のなかで、必要でないブロックは排除され、必要なブロックは補充される。ブロックそのもののかたちが変わることもある。それが「言葉の乱れ」。
若者たちが使う 「 ら抜き言葉 」 や「乱れた言葉」を腹立たしく思うひともいると思う。しかし、そんなときは、清少納言も「と抜き言葉」を怒っていたことを思い出そう。
そして、その「乱れ」が、一時のものなのか、それとも時代の流れなのか見極めよう。もしそれが時代の流れならば、どんなに抵抗しても受け入れられていくだろう。
「 と抜き言葉 」 も 「 ら抜き言葉」も同じことだ。
Your Gun Was Made To Comfort — Not for Comfort
by Greg Perry by Greg Perry
DIGG THIS
Not everybody reading this carries a gun .
Several reasons exist for most freedom - loving Americans to still be disarmed .
Reason for Not Carrying a Gun # 1 : Your Locale
You live in a state where carrying a weapon is not permitted .
Why do you still live there ?
You ’re almost complicit in whatever danger comes your way .
Move .
Let your state fend for itself and it will die out .
Once you leave , only the bad guys will have guns and they ’ll shoot each other ; the liberals wo n’t marry or have babies so they ’ll die out ; no productive citizens will be left to steal money from to give to non-workers so illegals and freeloaders will die out ; eventually it will become a barren wasteland that good citizens can reclaim some day .
Fantasy ?
Yes but only because the good people still living there would rather acquiesce in the loss of their freedoms than move to a safer state .
If you remain in a state where carrying a weapon is not permitted , but you fear the government more than you love your family , you ’ll remain unarmed and you keep living there .
Reason for Not Carrying a Gun # 2 : Your Knowledge
You approve of the right to carry weapons but you do n’t know anything about them .
Perhaps they frighten you some .
This is understandable and it ’s good you do n’t want the liability since you ’re ignorant about guns .
So learn something !
Gun classes are all around you and world - class gun-training schools are far less costly for a week of training than you think .
If you convince yourself you cannot attend a gun class , you can still read or you would n’t be right here now so get Boston ’s Gun Bible and begin your education .
Reason for Not Carrying a Gun # 3 : You ’re a Hypocrite
You love to quote R&R ( Rothbard and Rand ) but you do n’t put into practice what you preach because you ’re not willing to defend your liberties or self when the time comes .
( You ’re worst of all by the way . )
Reason for Not Carrying a Gun # 4 : You Want to But Can’t
You understand weapons and know how to use them but carrying one concealed is difficult or virtually impossible given the way you must dress for your profession ( such as physician or beautician perhaps ) .
I have no statistic to back this up , but I bet many reading this are in this fourth group .
Carrying a weapon all day in all situations is extremely cumbersome , takes too much time to get used to , takes effort to locate a well - fitting holstering system , and gets costly trying several methods until you find one that works best .
For the majority of us who ’d rather slouch on a couch than jog in the fog , that extra tire under our ever - widening belt considerably increases the difficulty in carrying a weapon .
Too Many Carry Methods Simply Wo n’t Work
It ’s true that lots of books and magazine articles have been written describing innumerable carry clothing and concealment methods but in general , for most of us , most ways stink .
I carry outside the pants , under a shirt , holstered at my right , strong side ’s 3 - o’ clock position .
I ’ve done this for years .
I love that carry position but I hate trying to conceal that position .
I ’ve been doing a lot of study lately on a better position and I ’m beginning to believe that an appendix inside - the - waist carry is better .
Inertia keeps me from wanting to switch but people whose wisdom I ’m beginning to appreciate are starting to convince me that the appendix carry offers the most benefits .
It conceals well and is far easier to draw from concealment than one might first think .
I ’ll keep you posted on what I decide .
By the way , tactical strategy dictates that in general , if you live in a state such as Arizona where you can legally carry an unconcealed gun ( called open carry ) , you should n’t carry openly .
When I attended what is considered the world ’s finest training school , Gunsite Academy located in Arizona , I just had to walk into the local Safeway supermarket carrying openly .
Just once .
It was the most surreal feeling .
The only one who cared that I had a Government Model 1911 strapped to my side was me — everybody else was used to it .
Once I got that out of my system , I wo n’t do it again .
See , I do n’t want the bad guys taking me out before they commence the ceremonies of murder , rape , pillage , and plunder .
I want to be inconspicuous .
I do n’t want to wear a sportsman ’s / photographer ’s vest because those are known as " Shoot Me First Vests " and the bad guys know it .
A fanny pack on a man who ’s not an obvious tourist is another giveaway that the baddies had better take you out just in case .
Given a few missing fingers ( seven at last count ) and deformity of the ones I have left , I personally have a tremendous advantage if a situation breaks out .
I ’m the last person they think will be able to shoot a gun and I am the first person they will feel confident enough to turn their backs on .
For you normal people , I ’m sorry that you have to go through life in such a severely unsafe condition .
If you ’re a woman or smaller man , you have a similar advantage as I because bad guys wo n’t perceive you as a threat as much as they will the cop on duty , or as much as the cop off duty wearing the vest that announces to the world he ’s armed .
So it ’s a tactical advantage to look as unarmed as you can be while still being armed .
That makes deciding how you will carry a gun even more difficult .
The easiest way is to just carry openly but you ca n’t in most states and you should n’t anyway .
The next easiest way is to cover your gun with a vest but that make it far easier for the bad guys to separate you from the living before the fight even begins .
The difficulty in carrying gets more and more difficult the more effectively you hide a weapon that is big enough to handle a threat that might come your way .
How Caliber Plays Into Things
The more effective the gun , the more magnified the problem becomes .
A one - shot Derringer .22 is far easier to carry and less obvious than a full - sized Springfield 1911 in .45 caliber but which do you need in your hands most when a drug - crazed madman runs at you with a machete ?
Well , the .22 Derringer is better if you have only it because you left the .45 in your bedside dresser since it was too cumbersome to carry .
The gun you have with you when you need it is the best one to carry , not the biggest that you own , necessarily .
Add to that , the gun you know best and shoot the best is better than the largest caliber weapon on earth .
So size is n’t everything when it comes to the weapon you carry .
Guess what the smallest caliber on earth is ?
It ’s the caliber you have in your hands when the bad guy is shooting at you !
Guess what the largest caliber on earth is ?
It ’s the caliber the bad guy has in his hands when he ’s shooting at you !
So no matter what you do , you will always want and need something better when the fan gets hit .
The perfect self - defense firearm will always be in dispute .
There is one thing never in dispute : having a gun is the first rule of a gun fight .
( This also makes an excellent rule for a knife fight too . )
I Have the Answer
For those of you in group # 4 , the people who know how to use a gun and who want to carry but have n’t found a way that works for your situation , I recently discovered an answer .
This answer works well and although I still prefer a gun on my person , I use this concealed carry method when I do n’t want to carry on my person for whatever reason .
The answer is to carry your self - defense firearm in a purse or an appointment book that contains an easily accessible concealed pouch for your firearm .
Neither of these is a new carry method .
I take them a step further , however , to eliminate their primary disadvantage .
The number one reason why you should — before now — never consider carrying a firearm outside your person in a case like a purse or day planner is due to loss .
There ’s something about the human condition that the more valuable something is we ’re carrying , the more likely we are to lose it .
You ’ll invariably walk out of the stall with the appointment book left on the back of the toilet .
You ’ll leave your purse in the seat beside you .
It happens too much .
For ladies whose purse is like an appendage on their bodies , stick a gun in there and all of a sudden the purse will be left where you should n’t leave it .
You know it will happen , and it ’s far worse to lose your money , credit cards , keys , and personal information when a loaded weapon is there too .
The disadvantage of carrying in such a way is you ’ll be slower to draw your weapon when you need it .
The fact that you have your weapon with you , whereas you may not have had to otherwise , certainly helps make up for your slow draw .
Also , it ’s incumbent upon you to be more aware of your immediate situation so you ’ll react sooner than later if need be .
The advantage of carrying concealed off your person in such a carrying case means that you ’re free to wear whatever clothing you want to wear and your weapon will still be with you .
This is a huge advantage and I ’ve often carried this way when I would not be able to conceal a gun on my person .
In the hot summer , you may want to go out in shorts and a T - shirt ; how will you hide that Glock then ?
Well , hide it in a purse ( for ladies ) or in that gun-ready appointment book but make sure you do n’t leave it somewhere !
Obviously that is the answer but until now , that was unrealistic .
A while back , I heard of a tiny device that parents can pull apart and put one half in their pocket and hang the other half around a small child ’s neck on a lanyard .
The device , extremely inexpensive , is adjustable from 6 to 30 feet .
Here ’s what happens when you pull the device apart : nothing .
Nothing happens until your child wanders further than the distance limit you ’ve set .
If you ’ve set it for 10 feet and your child wanders 11 feet from you your device begins beeping !
You ’ll know right away if your child is getting away from you too far .
I love this device , the Child Guard Transmitter , for its intended use .
Parents of toddlers in busy malls and elsewhere can finally glance away from their child and still know the child is close at hand .
I love this device for its unintended use too !
It ’s obvious where I ’m going with this .
Put one half in your gun-friendly purse or appointment book and wear the other half around your neck or in your pocket .
You can go about your day without a care because the thing wo n’t beep .
It wo n’t beep until you walk 6 feet from the bathroom stall where you left your gun !
Seriously , I cannot believe that others have not thought of this .
If they have , I ’ve never heard of it being used this way .
I think gun owners all over the country should consider getting this device but especially you if you do n’t carry now because you just have n’t found a way to carry and still wear your spandex aerobics pants .
Your Gun ’s Intentions
Your gun was made to be comforting .
Your gun was never made to be comfortable .

He expressed distress that he was not able to see his daughter Matilda Ledger as frequently as he would have liked .
The model could see that he was frustrated .
Ward does n't believe that Ledger could have taken his own life .
She said he was smoking cigarette's when they were together but was n't using drugs or alcohol .

Real Time with Bill Maher : Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel and panel discuss how to end the war
Author Michael Eric Dyson , Illinois Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel and author Pete Hamill square off with Bill Maher over Iranian President Ahmadinejad 's recent visit to Columbia University and the ensuing discourse .
" They found the only picture of this guy where he was n't smiling , " quips Bill Maher , referring to the New York Daily News ' cover photo of Ahmadinejad .
" This is not a good guy , " says Maher .
" Nobody likes this guy .
But , did we not do him a big favor ? "
" Absolutely , " says author Pete Hamill .
" I think , to turn the Daily News , which is an honorable paper , into a pamphlet to support a particular political point of view , is a mistake , always ... "
Maher contends :
" It does seem like the media is just taking the Administration talking points about this drumbeat of war with Iran the way they did five years ago with Iraq . "
He continues , " You 'd think that was fifty years ago , and they forgot all about 'oh , that 's right , we bought the bullshit about Saddam ...' but it was five years ago . "
Begs Maher : " Scott Pelley said to Ahmadinejad : ' You have American blood on your hands . '
Does n't [ President Bush ] have American blood on his hands ? "
The following video is from HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher , broadcast on September 28 , 2007 :
Rising pork prices are making many Chinese do without
Retailers and producers will face heavy fines if they increase the price of basic necessities , the government says .
Food prices climbed more than 18 % in November , while the price of pork jumped by more than 50 % .
Inflation has traditionally been associated with civil unrest in China , and correspondents say the intervention shows the government is very concerned .
During the past 20 years , the Chinese administration has largely abandoned price controls , as the free market took hold across the country .
The price of basic essentials has increased hugely during this time , and families on low incomes - numbered in their hundreds of millions in China - currently spend between 30 % and 50 % of their income on food for the table .
According to the BBC correspondent in Shanghai , Quentin Sommerville , rising prices were the main concern among Chinese households last year , outranking worries over corruption and the growing wealth gap .
But economists are sceptical that the new rules will work , as price controls often lead to empty shelves .
And the UN's food aid agency is warning that another measure taken by China - restricting the exports of rice and other staples - could have serious effects in the region .
The World Food Programme says China 's move , which followed similar restrictions imposed by India and Vietnam , could help to cause acute food shortages .
The WFP says North Korea , East Timor , Afghanistan , Bangladesh and Cambodia are particularly at risk .

...otherwise , why would they spend so much time trying so hard to dismiss him ?
When asked by host George Stephanopoulos which of the presidential contenders " handled " the assassination of Benazir Bhutto the best ( a strange question in and of itself ) George Will did not focus on Huckabee 's lack of knowledge or Richardson 's demand that Musharraf step down , but rather on the fact that John Edwards made a phone call .
GS : ( The Bhutto assassination ) was a major event , at least for a day , on the campaign trail .
It seemed to freeze the campaigns .
Who handled it well ; who did n’t ?
GW : Opinions differ .
I would love to have been a fly on the wall of President Musharraf ’s office when the aide came in .
The country ’s in flames , the army ’s in doubt and the guy comes in and says , “ We have holding on the line a former one term senator from North Carolina , calling from Iowa . ”
Could
Will be more dismissive and patronizing if he tried ?
Turns out , yes .
Because as the discussion moved to the upcoming Iowa primary and whose message was resonating most , again , Edwards ' message of populism was brought up .
David Brooks immediately pulls a Noonan and discounts how " tough " Edwards can be , and George Will then subverts the whole definition of populism to pull as many conservative scare tactics as possible .

GW : Here you have the fundamental contradiction of populism .
He does n’t like Washington and Washington power .
He also vows to increase the power of Washington .
Populism has to do that .
He ’s going to increase the regulatory state and with it , he ’s going to increase the stakes of politics and therefore the importance of lobbyists .
Why does George & Co. feel the need to dismiss Edwards ?
Could it be that in head - to - head match ups , Edwards is the candidate who fares the best ?
Some of the few people who have seen the car describe a tiny , charming , four - door , five - seater hatchback shaped like a jelly bean , small in the front and broad in the back , the better to reduce wind resistance and permit a cheaper engine .
“ It ’s a nice car  cute , ” said A. K. Chaturvedi , senior vice president of business development at Lumax Industries , a supplier in Delhi that developed the car ’s headlights and interior lamps .
Driving the cost - cutting were Tata ’s engineers , who in an earlier project questioned whether their trucks really needed all four brake pads or could make do with three .
As they built Tata ’s new car , for about half the price of the next - cheapest Indian alternative , their guiding philosophy was :
Do we really need that ?
The model appearing on Thursday has no radio , no power steering , no power windows , no air - conditioning and one windshield wiper instead of two , according to suppliers and Tata ’s own statements .
Bucking prevailing habits , the car lacks a tachometer and uses an analog rather than digital speedometer , according to Mr. Taneja , who until recently was president of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India , representing many of Tata ’s suppliers as they signed deals with the company .
Frugal engineering pervades the car ’s internal machinery , too , with even greater implications for the vehicle ’s safety and longevity .
To save $ 10 , Tata engineers redesigned the suspension to eliminate actuators in the headlights , the levelers that adjust the angle of the beam depending on how the car is loaded , according to Mr. Chaturvedi of Lumax .
In lieu of the solid steel beam that typically connects steering wheels to axles , one supplier , Sona Koyo Steering Systems , used a hollow tube , said Kiran Deshmukh , the chief operating officer of the company , which is based in Delhi .
Tata chose wheel bearings that are strong enough to drive the car up to 45 miles an hour , but they will wear quickly above that speed , reducing the car ’s life span but not threatening consumer safety , according to Mr. Taneja .
The car ’s top speed is 75 miles an hour .
Reducing the weight curbed material costs and enabled the company to use a cheaper engine .
People familiar with the car describe a $ 700 rear - mounted engine built by the German company Bosch , measuring 600 to 660 cubic centimeters , with a horsepower in the range of 30 to 35 .
By comparison , the Honda Fit , one of the smallest cars available in the United States , has a horsepower of 109 .
The unemployment rate surged to 5 percent in December as the nation added only 18,000 jobs , the smallest monthly increase in four years , the Labor Department reported on Friday .
Investors responded by sending the stock market down sharply .
Economists treated the report as the most powerful evidence to date that the United States could well be falling into a recessionary downturn in economic activity .
“ This is unambiguously negative , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ The economy is on the edge of recession , if we ’re not already engulfed in one . ”
The swift deterioration in the job market resonated as a warning sign that troubles once confined to real estate and construction are now spilling over into the broader economy , threatening the ability of American consumers to keep spending with customary abandon .

The US rationale for war in Iraq has morphed from ousting strongman Saddam Hussein , to countering Al - Qaeda militants to its latest incarnation — facing down what officials in President George W. Bush ’s administration call the Iranian “ threat ” .
“ Iraq is the convergence point for two of the greatest threats to America in this new century : Al - Qaeda and Iran , ” Bush said last week , renewing accusations that the Islamic republic is backing Iraqi militias hostile to US forces and covertly seeking nuclear weapons .
“ If we succeed in Iraq after all that Al - Qaeda and Iran have invested there , it would be a historic blow to the global terrorist movement and a severe setback for Iran , ” he said .
With Saddam dead and Al - Qaeda weakened — according to Bush — Iranian - financed extremists , which top US commander in Iraq David Petraeus has called “ special groups , ” have emerged as a key reason for maintaining US troop levels in Iraq .
“ Unchecked , the ‘ special groups ’ pose the greatest long - term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq , ” Petraeus said last week as he told US lawmakers of military strategy in Iraq for the coming months .

Wireless networking startup Meraki plans to deliver free wireless Internet access , supported by advertising , across San Francisco by the end of the year , it announced Friday .
An earlier attempt by Google and EarthLink to offer free city - wide Wi-Fi access in San Francisco foundered in August when EarthLink pulled out .
They had planned a two - tier service , with faster , paid access provided by EarthLink and a more limited , advertising - funded service to be offered by Google .
The search engine giant is also an investor in Meraki .
Meraki will base the service on an existing project covering parts of the city , Free the Net , which has signed up 40,000 users over an area of 5 square kilometers since it began last March .
To avoid the need for extensive cabling , Meraki will build the backbone of the network using a mesh network of solar - powered wireless repeaters installed on rooftops .
The nodes will use some of their wireless capacity to offer Internet access to those nearby , and the rest to haul traffic back , via adjacent nodes , to the network 's core .
The company is looking for city residents willing to put a repeater on their roof .
Those hosting a repeater will get free access to the service -- but so will their neighbors -- although for them , the signal may not be as strong .
Although devices are shared , Meraki aims to deliver data rates of around 1 M bps ( bits per second ) to each user .
Meraki will pay the cost of rolling out the service , and no public funds are involved , it said .
Investors have offered the company an additional US $ 20 million in venture capital to fund the move , it announced Friday .
Ozone in Paris offers a similar wireless Internet service based on a network of wireless repeaters .
Its service is only free for those who host repeaters , though : others must pay € 18 ( US $ 26 ) a month .
Updated with 2006 data : Average Income in the United States ( 1913 - 2006 )
Here is a graph of average income ( 1913 - 2004 ) that I have been working on for a while .
I am trying to incorporate into the graph economic and world events that would have affected the U.S. economy , making the assumption that the avg income is also affected by these events .
The graph shows income that includes capital gain and income that does not include capital gains .
After you finish looking at the historical average income you should check out my series of graphs on Income Distribution to understand why average income does n't tell the whole story .
24th Anniversary Macintosh
This is a Macintosh 512 k which I upgraded to run OS X by replacing the innards with a modern Mac Mini and various supporting components , including a grayscale CRT monitor , an LS - 120 floppy disk drive , and a microcontroller - based USB device that interfaces the Mini to the original keyboard and mouse .
Why ?
Mainly because I wanted to experiment with creating a custom USB device .
Also I guess I wanted to waste hundreds of dollars and countless hours building a semi-useless computer with a 9 inch black and white screen and no arrow keys .
Note that this project involves dangerous high voltage electronics .
If you decide to take apart your computer or monitor , and you touch the wrong thing at the wrong time , you could be killed .
This can happen even after you 've disconnected the power , as the CRT and capacitors on the circuit board may hold a significant charge for hours or even days after being unplugged .
So do n't mess around with this stuff unless you know what you 're doing .
The exterior of the case is essentially unchanged by the modification .
The keyboard and mouse are 100 % original , inside and out .
The keyboard , mouse , and floppy drive all work , as do the front brightness control knob and the rear power switch .
The connectors on the rear have retained their original appearance , although some have had their function changed .
The mouse port is still a mouse port .
The floppy port is present but nonfunctional .
The printer port is used for Ethernet , via a small dongle that has a DB - 9 connector on one end and a RJ45 jack on the other .
The modem port is used for USB and FireWire , via two cables I made with a DB - 9 connector on one end and a USB or FireWire connector on the other .
The audio port can be used for either audio - in or audio - out .
The most interesting part of the project for me was the circuit that allows the old original keyboard and mouse to be used with the Mini .
It is based on an Atmel AT90USB162 microcontroller , which is basically a standard AVR µC with a special coprocessor dedicated to USB signaling .
It comes with a C library that makes it relatively easy to create USB devices like HID keyboards and mice , speakers , storage devices , etc .
My device advertises itself as a generic HID keyboard / mouse combo , and the Mini recognizes it as such , with no special drivers or configuration necessary .
The code for interfacing with the keyboard and mouse is based on a discussion of the original hardware and protocols in the Macintosh Family Hardware Reference , an out of print technical manual for the early Macs .
The mouse is a simple 2 - axis optical quadrature encoder .
The keyboard uses a custom 2 - wire bidirectional serial interface .
Here is the sourcecode for the AVR .
My code is covered by a BSD license .
Atmel has its own license on the library , which can be downloaded here .
I etched the board at home using the Staples photo paper + laser printer + clothes iron + ferric chloride technique , which works amazingly well .
Here is a ( boring ) video showing startup , floppy use , firewire hard drive use , and playing a random video on youtube .

" Legalizing warrantless surveillance is actually a dangerous step backwards , " complained Stephen Colbert on Tuesday 's Colbert Report , pointing out that " just five days after 9/11 , the Vice President Cheney told us what it would take to win the war on terror , explaining , ' We have to work the dark side , if you will .
Spend time in the shadows ... ' "
" You do whatever it takes , " said Colbert .
" You go beyond what 's legal .
You go past what 's acceptable .
But thanks to this new law , all that dark side is now allowed .
And we know doing what 's allowed is not enough . "
" We are illuminating more and more of the dark side every day , " Colbert continued .
" It is getting harder and harder to find those things that we as Americans theoretically cannot bring ourselves to do .
...
What 's left that 's beyond the pale ? ...
We should n't be even able to conceive of the actions necessary to win this conflict . "
" I 'm calling on you the heroes to imagine scenes of physical depravity and shocking illegality , " he concluded .
" Quickly .
Before Congress legalizes them . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's Colbert Report , broadcast on August 7 .
Two years is a really long time to test a software product , but that 's about how long it took for Yahoo to finish its slick new version of Yahoo Mail , the popular email program you access from a Web browser .
This new Yahoo Mail entered its beta , or test , stage in September 2005 , and this week it emerged in finished form .
The result is a polished , fairly powerful email program that I prefer to Google 's much - hyped Gmail , which is undergoing an even longer gestation .
It has been in beta status since April 2004 .
I 've been testing the new Yahoo Mail on both Windows and Macintosh computers .
It has some downsides , but it beats Gmail , in my view , both in terms of features and in terms of its ability to act like a standard computer program rather than a Web page , something for which Gmail often gets more credit .
A closer competitor to Yahoo Mail is actually Microsoft 's Hotmail , now called Windows Live Hotmail .
But Yahoo tops Hotmail , too , in my opinion .

The digital camera blonde who attracted thousands of admirers on Facebook has been exposed - she is nothing more than a pretty advert for a porn site .
Images of the mystery blonde were posted on the internet - supposedly in a bid to trace the owner of a camera lost on holiday .
Scroll down for more ...
And the revealing pictures prompted tens of thousands of offers of help in the quest to return the lost property - at a rate of one every five seconds .
The pictures included the mystery girl in a bikini and underwear - and some naked .
But the object of their fascination turns out to be Wendy , a model who poses for X - rated pictures online .
The porn site has admitted that it was all a " clever viral marketing campaign " .
The Facebook plea read : " We are trying to track down the lovely lass in these photos so she can be reunited with her lost digital camera .
She certainly knows how to use it !
Scroll down for more ...
" Please get invites sent out to all gents in your friends list as if we all work together we can hunt this lass down . "
Men up and down the country posted messages of support .
Yu - San Chan , from Birmingham , wrote : " This is probably the most wanted woman in the country right now . "
And Martin Farrell , from London , said : " I thought I saw her today in Chiswick but it was a false alarm , the hunt continues . "
Another Londoner , Darren Gormley , commented : " Poor girl , I hate losing things .
Not surprising she lost it though - no pockets ! "

Colmes : Could Edwards right now have an effect on the outcome of this race if he wanted ?
Morris :
He might , but at the moment his voters are those that can't decide which they do n't like more --- a black or a women getting elected .
And ..
Colmes : Wait , wait , you 're saying his voters are bigots ?
Morris :
I 'm saying a lot of his voters are there because they do n't want a women and they do n't want a black .
Colmes :
So his voters are bigots is what you 're saying .
Morris :
No , I said what I just said .
Morris :
And if Edwards withdrew
God only knows where they 'd go .
After being pressed on it some more by Alan Colmes --- Morris finally said that he thinks Edwards is a good man and brought in some vague " exit poll " data to justify his original position .
Hannity chirped in with the " anti-Hillary vote " defense to try and help dig him out as well .
In Dick 's opinion , the Edwards voter is just going to the ballot box because they hate the black and they hate the female ... What 's the word for that frame of mind ?
John Edwards has done a good job of articulating his populist positions and had attracted a large number of voters , ( not enough to stay in the race ) none of whom made their choice because a " woman " or a " black " is in the field .
He was a very popular VP nominee back in '04 as well and many people felt he was the better candidate .
Morris knows this all too well , but wants to slam a portion of the Democratic Party .
His motives are obvious from his own past behavior ... Dick 's website is a pay site ... Figures ...
Two orbiting U.S. spacecraft were forced to change course to avoid being damaged by the thousands of pieces of space debris produced after China carried out an anti-satellite weapon test one year ago today .
The maneuvering , ordered by ground controllers and conducted several months after the test , is an example of lingering problems caused by China ’s Jan. 11 , 2007 , missile firing in a bold demonstration of space weaponry against a weather satellite , said Air Force Brig .
Gen .
Ted Kresge , director of air , space and information operations at the Air Force Space Command in Colorado .
Gen .
Kresge , a F - 15 fighter pilot , said the Chinese ASAT weapon test changed the equation for the military , which is working to better understand strategic threats posed by China ’s satellite - killing missiles , ground - based lasers , cyberwarfare and other ground station attack capabilities .
The Space Command is conducting a series of reviews to better identify threats and develop defenses for U.S. and allied military and commercial satellites against future attack .
“ We have embraced the notion that we now operate in a contested domain , ” the one - star general said .
However , other defense officials said the test set off a debate within the Bush administration over how to respond .
Officials who seek to minimize China ’s arms development within the U.S. intelligence and policy communities are said to be playing down the seriousness of the ASAT weapon test , arguing in interagency meetings that it was a one - time event that poses no strategic threat .
Military officials , including Gen. Kresge and Marine Corps Gen. James E. Cartwright , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , see Chinese anti-satellite weapons as new threats that could cripple the U.S. militarily and economically in a future conflict .
They said the U.S. needs to step up spying efforts to learn more about the secret Chinese weapons program and develop defenses against it .
Chinese military writings have revealed that space weapons should be built in secret and used for “ shock and awe ” attacks against U.S. satellites , said defense analyst Michael Pillsbury who revealed the plans in a report to a congressional commission .
Gen .
Cartwright testified before a Senate subcommittee last year that conventionally armed Trident missiles are needed to pre-empt space attacks through strikes on ASAT missile launchers in China .
But , Congress restricted funding for the program in the latest defense spending bill , and Pentagon civilians did not fight to keep the conventional Trident program going .
The White House opposed the curbs on the Trident conversion that are part of what the Pentagon calls “ prompt global strike ” weapons .
The restrictions “ limit the ability to field a near - term capability to strike globally , precisely , and rapidly with non-nuclear kinetic effects against high - priority , time - sensitive targets , ” the statement said .
The Chinese anti-satellite test used a ground - based mobile “ direct ascent ” missile that destroyed the orbiting Feng Yun - 1C weather satellite by ramming into it .
By some estimates , China could produce enough space weapons to knock out all low - Earth orbit U.S. satellites by 2010 .
China tried to carry out the test in secret but it was detected by U.S. intelligence agencies days before the launch .
The Bush administration rejected State Department appeals to try and head off the test , fearing it would disclose U.S. spying capabilities .
Instead , the administration organized a formal diplomatic protest to Beijing , that was joined by several other nations , including Britain , Japan and India .
China ’s government , which advocates a United Nations ban on space weapons , confirmed the test several weeks later , but Chinese officials have refused to reveal details of the arms program .
Beijing also is asserting national sovereignty over all space above Chinese territory , setting up the potential for a future confrontation with the U.S. , which operates intelligence and other satellites that pass over China .
Gen .
Kresge said international treaties protect space from such claims of national control , “ so from my perspective that is an illegitimate claim on their part . ”
“ If their intent was to enforce that , then we run into a space protection problem , and that is why we are so aggressively working the issue , ” he said .
Options for countering China ’s space arms include dissuading China from attacks through political , economic and diplomatic means , and deterring attacks by threatening U.S. counterstrikes , Gen. Kresge said .
Developing international coalitions with nations that operate satellites is being considered to help share satellites in an emergency , and “ provide an adversary with a targeting problem , ” he said .
Defensive measures include maneuvering satellites or shielding them from damage from ground - based lasers .
China fired a laser at a U.S. satellite in December 2006 .
The broad area of wreckage in space is called the “ Feng Yun - 1C debris ” and threatens about 800 satellites in space , 400 of which are American .
According to the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California , the commercial communication satellite Orbcomm FM 36 maneuvered to avoid passing within about 123 feet of the debris field on April 6 .
A NASA Earth observation satellite Terra was moved June 22 to avoid coming within about 90 feet of the debris .
Gen . Kresge said the Chinese ASAT weapon test , after two misses , “ made a mess ” in space .
There are no indications China is preparing more tests but doing so would create a “ huge ” problem , he said .
“ Essentially what it did was increase the amount of space debris orbiting the Earth by about 20 percent , ” he said .
The debris threatens spacecraft for up to 100 years , he estimated .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush has urged North Korea to keep its promise to reveal all nuclear programs , in his first direct communication with the reclusive leader of a country he once branded part of an “ axis of evil . ”
North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in an undated photo released by Korea News Service in Tokyo on June 8 , 2007 .
President Bush has urged North Korea to keep its promise to reveal all nuclear programs , in his first direct communication with the reclusive leader of a country he once branded part of an " axis of evil . "
REUTERS / Korea News Service / Files
Bush wrote to Kim Jong - il , a communist leader he once said he loathed , telling him “ we ’re at a critical juncture ” for Pyongyang to meet its year - end deadline for key steps toward nuclear disarmament , the White House confirmed on Thursday .
But other U.S. officials acknowledged that North Korea might not fully comply before early 2008 and indicated that Washington was prepared to show some flexibility .
“ The president ... stressed the need for North Korea to come forward with a full and complete declaration of their nuclear programs , as called for in the September 2005 six - party agreement , ” White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
Visiting U.S. envoy Chris Hill handed the letter to North Korea ’s Foreign Minister on Wednesday , Pyongyang ’s KCNA news agency said .
The White House declined to release a copy .
Bush ’s gesture underscored U.S. efforts to get North Korea to make good on its pledge to disable its main nuclear complex and declare all of its nuclear activities in exchange for economic and diplomatic incentives .
White House press secretary Dana Perino said Bush decided to send the letter “ so that we can keep it all on track . ”
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , traveling to Brussels for a NATO meeting , said : “ It ’s going to take a monumental effort to get all of this done by the end of the year and I am not too concerned about whether it is December 31 or not . ”
Bush ’s letter signaled limits to U.S. patience but also a willingness to open a new line of communication with the isolated communist state .
It was addressed “ Dear Mr. Chairman ” and signed by the president , Perino said .
Until now , Bush had shunned direct contact with Kim , whom he has called a “ tyrant . ”
“ I loathe Kim Jong - il , ” Bush told Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward in an August 2002 interview .
“ I ’ve got a visceral reaction to this guy , because he is starving his people . ”
In his 2002 State of the Union speech , Bush said North Korea , along with Iran and Iraq , constituted an “ axis of evil . ”
LETTERS TO ALL SIX PARTIES
In his letter , Bush told Kim that North Korea must not only detail “ all nuclear facilities , materials and programs ” but address issues of proliferation and uranium enrichment .
Questions about proliferation have increased since an Israeli air strike inside Syrian territory on September 6 .
Some U.S. officials have linked the raid to suspicions of secret nuclear cooperation between Damascus and North Korea .
Damascus and Pyongyang have denied nuclear ties .
While writing to Kim , Bush also sent letters on December 1 to other countries involved in the six - party talks , Russia , Japan , China and South Korea , the White House said .
North Korea shuttered its main reactor at Yongbyon in July under a February deal .
In October , North Korea agreed to disable all of its nuclear facilities by the end of this year .
In exchange , the impoverished country will receive 1 million tons of heavy fuel oil or equivalent aid .
As part of the accord , Pyongyang , which tested a nuclear device last year in defiance of international warnings , must also provide a complete accounting of its nuclear programs .
Korea expert Noriyuki Suzuki of the Tokyo - based Radiopress news agency suggested the letter was also meant to reinforce some of the potential benefits of compliance for Pyongyang .
“ The letter must contain the basic U.S. stance that Washington is ready to drop North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism , improve relations and normalize diplomatic relations ... on condition that the North disable and abandon its nuclear weapons programs , ” Suzuki said .
Hill has said the North was moving to cripple the reactor and other units at Yongbyon .
But disagreement remains over what should appear in the tell - all declaration .
But Rice took a largely upbeat view , saying , “ Things seem to be on track . ”
We do n't doubt reports that Yahoo and News Corp. are talking – given Yahoo's desperate state of affairs , who would n't the company talk to ?
The real question is this :
What would Yahoo get out of a partnership with News Corp. , other than bitter heartache when the relationship sours ?
A potential deal could be structured so that News Corp. gets a 20 - plus percent stake in Yahoo , according to a Wall Street Journal report .
Under the agreement , MySpace and other News Corp. properties would be combined with Yahoo .
Although News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch ( right ) has shown a keen interest in the internet – as evidenced by his $ 580 million acquisition of MySpace – we remain highly skeptical of the reports .
Buying a stake in Yahoo is a pretty pricey way for News Corp. to grow its online presence .
And while the deal could , theoretically , stave off a hostile bid from Microsoft , it would n't help Yahoo grow its search business , which is one of its biggest problems at the moment .
" A News Corp. deal would do nothing to solve Yahoo's decline in search market share , " says Kevin Lee , executive chairman of Didit , an online advertising buyer .
" It would allow Yahoo to create a larger display advertising property , but Yahoo already has more than enough of that inventory .
I 'm having a hard time understanding why this deal would happen . "
We do n't really get it , either , but if we had to guess , we 'd say Yahoo is just toying with Microsoft in hopes of getting a higher bid .

Shopdropping was probably the last kind of giving on most people ’s minds as they shopped during the holiday season .
Shopdropping , also known as droplifting , is the incredible act of reverse shoplifting : going into stores and putting things onto the shelves .
Banksy is probably the best known shopdropper , famous for putting out his own subvertised versions of Paris Hilton ’s CDs and hanging his subversive art in galleries .
Here is your beginner ’s guide to the art ( or science ) .
Above : great ‘ beginner ’s guide to shopdropping ’ including Banksy
Shopdroppers have their own reasons for doing what they do .
Some are social and political culture jammers who want to raising awareness about consumerism or adding warnings to dangerous products .
Others seek to promote their own product , such as an album left in a record store .
Still others do it for their own amusement and artistic fulfillment without expectations of any kind of return .
Some shopdrop projects are individual endeavors while others are the work of highly organized groups , such as the Droplift Project .
The Droplift Project takes found sound and turns it into an audio collage to create “ new art , social commentary , parody and contemporary criticism . ”
Ryan Watkins - Hughes of ShopDropping .net adds his own labels to commercial products simply as a form of self - expression .
It might not surprise you to learn that reactions to shopdropping or droplifting vary as much as approaches to it and reasons for doing it .
Some people find it harmless and amusing while others find it shocking and disturbing .
Shopdroppers who are caught are variously freed by confused police or held on charges related to destruction of property or even fraud .
Reactions , criticisms or other shopdropping thoughts ?

1987 : The first version of the Perl programming language is released .
Perl was the brainchild of Larry Wall , a programmer at Unisys , who borrowed from existing languages , especially C , to create a general - purpose language intended originally to simplify text manipulation .
Through constant upgrading
Perl is now used for practically everything else as well , including all aspects of web development , system administration and networking .
Perl went through a rapid series of upgrades – less than seven years elapsed between versions 1.0 and 5.0 – before the language was fully mature .
Even at that , Perl 5 has been continuously tinkered with since 1994 , with many additional features keeping Perl at the forefront of programming languages .
Wall designed Perl to reflect the realities of modern computer programming .
As the cost of hardware was dropping and computers became a central feature of everyday life , the cost of programmers soared .
Perl 's relative simplicity and flexibility helps wring the maximum amount of efficiency out of these highly skilled – and highly paid – individuals .
Although the name Perl is sometimes said to stand for " Practical Extraction and Report Language , " its actual origin is not so colorless :
Wall originally intended to call his language Pearl , a reference to the Parable of the Pearlfrom the Gospel of Matthew .
But a programming language called Pearl already existed , so Wall dropped the a to avoid confusion .

Weight - loss surgery works much better than standard medical therapy as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes in obese people , the first study to compare the two approaches has found .
The study , of 60 patients , showed that 73 percent of those who had surgery had complete remissions of diabetes , meaning all signs of the disease went away .
By contrast , the remission rate was only 13 percent in those given conventional treatment , which included intensive counseling on diet and exercise for weight loss , and , when needed , diabetes medicines like insulin , metformin and other drugs .
In the study , the surgery worked better because patients who had it lost much more weight than the medically treated group did  20.7 percent versus 1.7 percent of their body weight , on average .
Type 2 diabetes is usually brought on by obesity , and patients can often lessen the severity of the disease , or even get rid of it entirely , by losing about 10 percent of their body weight .
Though many people can lose that much weight , few can keep it off without surgery .
( Type 1 diabetes , a much less common form of the disease , involves the immune system and is not linked to obesity . )
But the new results probably do not apply to all patients with Type 2 diabetes , because the people in the study had fairly mild cases with a recent onset ; all had received the diagnosis within the previous two years .
In people who have more severe and longstanding diabetes , the disease may no longer be reversible , no matter how much weight is lost .
There is so much goodness in this short 2 - minute clip that it 's tough to know where to start .
First we see the 9/11 Express ( a.k.a Giuliani's campaign bus ) taking a lap at Daytona , much to the delight of both Tweety and ESPN Radio 's Stephen A. Smith .
When the conversation moves to the Republican presidential field , Smith makes it pretty clear that he wo n't be donating to the Giuliani campaign anytime soon , while Pat Buchanan concedes Rudy 's foreign policy would essentially be Norman Podhoretz 's policy , but adds that he fears an increasingly " bellicose " McCain may be like " Bush on steroids " and continue a neo -conservative foreign policy .

We heard a lot of different performance claims about Vista SP1 in past few months , and now that it 's finally ( sort of ) here , it 's time to bust out the stopwatches and see what 's what .
According to CNET , early tests of SP1 indicate that while there are some performance enhancements to be had , they 're mostly driver related -- so if you 've been updating all along , you wo n't see much of an improvement .
What 's worse , certain tasks like copying files to USB 2.0 hard drives have gotten around 50 percent slower , a speed hit that overshadows the other filesystem improvements in SP1 .
All in all , though , it looks like SP1 is a worthwhile update -- just do n't expect anything to get noticeably faster .

This week the Zoological Society of London published a list of the world 's weirdest animals , including a purple frog that lives 12ft underground .
But as a new website shows , there are plenty of other bizarre facts about the animal world ...

The former Murdoch retainer Andrew Neil , who edited the London Sunday Times , has described James Murdoch , the heir apparent , as a “ social liberal . "
What strikes me is his casual use of “ liberal ” for the new ruler of an empire devoted to the promotion of war , conquest and human division .
Neil ’s view is not unusual .
In the murdochracy that Britain has largely become , once noble terms such as democracy , reform , even freedom itself , have long been emptied of their meaning .
In the years leading to Tony Blair ’s election , liberal commentators vied in their Tonier - than - thou obeisance to such a paragon of “ reborn liberalism . "
In these pages in 1995 , the liberal writer Henry Porter celebrated an almost mystical politician who “ presents himself as a harmonizer for all the opposing interests in British life , a conciliator of class differences and tribal antipathies , a synthesizer of opposing beliefs . "
Blair was , of course , the diametric opposite .
As events have demonstrated , Blair and the cult of New Labor have destroyed the very liberalism millions of Britons thought they were voting for .
This truth is like a taboo in Britain today .
Gone is the bourgeoisie that in good times would extend a few rungs of the ladder to those below .
From Blair ’s pseudo - moralizing assault on single parents a decade ago to the government ’s recent attacks on the disabled , the “ British Project ” has completed the work of Thatcher and all but abolished the premises of tolerance and decency , however amorphous , on which much of British public life was based .
The tradeoff has been mostly superficial “ social liberalism ” and the highest personal indebtedness on earth .
In 2007 , reported the Joseph Rowntree Foundation , the United Kingdom faced the highest levels of inequality for 40 years , with the rich getting richer and the poor poorer and more and more segregated from society .
The International Monetary Fund has designated Britain a tax haven , and corruption and fraud in British business are almost twice the global average , while UNICEF reports that British children are the most neglected and unhappiest in the “ rich ” world .
Abroad , behind a faade of liberal concern for the world ’s “ disadvantaged , " such as waffle about millennium goals and antipoverty stunts with the likes of Google and Vodafone , the Brown government , together with its EU partners , is demanding vicious and punitive free - trade agreements that will devastate the economies of scores of impoverished African , Caribbean and Pacific nations .
In Iraq , the bloodletting of a “ liberal intervention ” may well have surpassed that of the Rwanda genocide , while the British occupiers have made no real attempt to help the victims of their lawlessness .
And putting out more flags in the pretense of British troops ’ “ withdrawal ” will not cover the shame .
“ The mortality of children in Basra has increased by nearly 30 % compared to the Saddam Hussein era , ” says Dr. Haydar Salah , a pediatrician at Basra children ’s hospital .
In January nearly 100 leading British doctors wrote to Hilary Benn , then international development secretary , describing how children were dying because Britain had not fulfilled its obligations under UN security resolution 1483 .
He refused to see them .
Even if a contortion of intellect and morality allows the interventionists to justify these actions , the same cannot be said for liberties eroded at home .
These are too much part of the myth that individual freedom was handed down by eminent liberal gentlemen instead of being fought for at the bottom .
Yet rights of habeas corpus , of free speech and assembly , and dissent and tolerance , are slipping away , undefended .
Whole British communities now live in fear of the police .
The British are distinguished as one of the most spied upon people in the world .
A gray surveillance van with satellite tracking sits outside my local supermarket in London .
On the pop radio station Kiss 100 , the security service MI5 advertises for ordinary people to spy on each other .
These are normal now , along with the tracking of our intimate lives and a system of secretive justice that imposes 18 - hour curfews on people who have not been charged with any crime and are denied the “ evidence . "
Hundreds of terrified Iraqi refugees are sent back to the infinite dangers of the country “ we ” have destroyed .
Meanwhile , the cause of any real civil threat to Britons has been identified and confirmed repeatedly by the intelligence services .
It is “ our ” continuing military presence in other people ’s countries and collusion with a Washington cabal described by the late Norman Mailer as “ pre-fascist . "
In broadcasting , a prime source of liberalism and most of our information , the unthinkable has been normalized .
The murderous chaos in Iraq is merely internecine .
Indeed , Bush ’s “ surge ” is “ working . "
The holocaust there has nothing to do with “ us . "
There are honorable exceptions , of course , as there are in those great liberal storehouses of knowledge , Britain ’s universities ; but they , too , are normalized and left to natter about “ failed states ” and “ crisis management ” — when the cause of the crisis is on their doorstep .
As Professor Terry Eagleton has pointed out , for the first time in two centuries almost no eminent British poet , playwright or novelist is prepared to question the foundations of western actions , let alone interrupt , as the critic DJ Taylor once put it , all those “ demure ironies and mannered perceptions , their focus on the gyrations of a bunch of emotional poseurs … to the reader infinitely reassuring … and infinitely useless . "
Harold Pinter and Ronan Bennett are exceptions .
Britain is now a centralized single - ideology state , as secure in the grip of a superpower as any former eastern bloc country .
The Whitehall executive has prerogative powers as effective as politburo decrees .
Unlike Venezuela , critical issues such as the EU constitution or treaty are denied a referendum , regardless of Blair ’s “ solemn pledge . "
Thanks largely to a parliament in which a majority of the members cannot bring themselves to denounce the crime in Iraq or even vote for an inquiry , New Labor has added to the statutes a record 3,000 criminal offenses : an apparatus of control that undermines the Human Rights Act .
In 1977 , at the height of the cold war , I interviewed the Charter 77 dissidents in Czechoslovakia .
They warned that complacency and silence could destroy liberty and democracy as effectively as tanks .
“ We ’re actually better off than you in the west , ” said a writer , measuring his irony .
“ Unlike you , we have no illusions . ”
For those people who still celebrate the virtues and triumphs of liberalism — antislavery , women ’s suffrage , the defense of individual conscience and the right to express it and act upon it — the time for direct action is now .
It is time to support those of courage who defy rotten laws to read out in Parliament Square the names of the current , mounting , war dead , and those who identify their government ’s complicity in “ rendition ” and its torture , and those who have followed the paper and blood trail of Britain ’s piratical arms companies .
It is time to support the National Health Service workers who up and down the country are trying to alert us to the destruction of a Labor government ’s greatest achievement .
The list of people stirring is reassuring .
The awakening of the rest of us is urgent .

On Committing to a Career in Comedy
“ Even if I could just make enough to buy a loaf of bread and not starve to death , [ being a comedian ] would be the greatest adventure that I could ever go on .

Death is an irreplaceable part of life , and even though it can be uncomfortable , it ’s smart to think about it .
Preplanning your own funeral is one of the most unselfish things that you can do , especially once you consider how much of a burden it can be .
Making the appropriate decisions can be a difficult task , but the following few reasons will reassure you that it ’s more than worth it .
Eliminate The Burden Associated With The Costs
Funerals are becoming more expensive each passing year , with some reaching tens of thousands of dollars .
The emotional and mental stress is already tricky enough to deal with – having to think about the material aspect as well can quickly become overwhelming .
Your loved ones can spend this valuable time healing and saying their final goodbyes instead of doing all the arrangements .
Also , paying for the funeral now will help you avoid future inflation and increasing prices .
By visiting arlingtonmortuary .com you can use an online pre-planning form and go through a checklist to ensure that you ’ve got all the necessary arrangements covered .
Make Your Own Decisions
Even though your loved ones will do everything in their power to honor you properly , only you know exactly how the service should look like .
People have to make over a hundred different decisions in a day after their loved one passes – this is an overwhelming responsibility that nobody except you should have to deal with .
They wo n’t have to wonder whether everything is like you ’d want it to be since most of the work is already done .
Also , every decision that you make is going to be well thought out , in a relaxed state of mind .
In contrast , if the family was doing everything that same day , they would n’t be able to think rationally which would likely lead to some poor choices .
With preplanning , nothing is left to chance .
Peace of MInd & No Conflict
Once you ’ve settled everything , you can put your mind at peace knowing that your family will have one less thing to worry about once the time comes .
It ’s somewhat of the last gift – one of the most caring and thoughtful things that you can do , especially for all the family members who will be exhausted .
Finally , it eliminates the possibility of conflicts when your loved ones try to determine who ’s responsible for the arrangements .
Preplanning with Arlington mortuary offers multiple different payment options if you decide to pre-fund your funeral .
The price is determined at the moment of completed payment , without any additional costs in the future .
Wherever you ’re located , your wishes will be granted .…
Editor 's note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
Here , Gary Tuchman talks about covering people praying on what they call America 's " holy highway . "
DALLAS , Texas ( CNN ) --
If you turn to the Bible -- Isaiah Chapter 35 , Verse 8 -- you will see a passage that in part says , " A highway shall be there , and a road , and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness . "
Churchgoers in six states have held prayer sessions along the side of Interstate 35 .
Now , is it possible that this " highway " mentioned in Chapter 35 is actually Interstate 35 that runs through six U.S. states , from southern Texas to northern Minnesota ?
Some Christians have faith that is indeed the case .
It was with that interesting belief in mind that we decided to head to Texas , the southernmost state in the I - 35 corridor , to do a story about a prayer campaign called " Light the Highway . "
Churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside Interstate 35 , but the prayers are still continuing .
Some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I - 35 being the " holy " highway , it needs some intensive prayer first .
So we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic Christians prayed on the the interstate 's shoulder in Dallas .
They chanted loudly and vibrantly , making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on .
They prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would " see the light " and perhaps close down .
They prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate .
They prayed that all Americans would accept Jesus into their lives .
Watch believers offer prayers »
The woman who came up with the concept of " Light the Highway " is a Texas minister named Cindy Jacobs .
She says she can't be sure Interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the Bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after " once again reading Isaiah , Chapter 35 . "
Jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history , such as the bridge collapse on I - 35 in Minneapolis last August and the assassination of JFK 44 years ago near I - 35 in Dallas .
That 's why prayer certainly can't hurt , she adds .
Now , it 's only fair to say most people , the religious and the non-religious alike , do n't buy any of this , but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along I - 35 .
At an adult go - go club , the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others .
And he says his club holds fundraisers , food drives and toy drives to help the community .
But on the side of the road , the prayerful are n't going to change their minds .
Holy highways and nude clubs , they believe , are not a combination God has in mind .
E-mail to a friend
The Tibetans are being relocated to protect the source area of key Chinese rivers in north - west China 's Qinghai province , Xinhua news agency reported .
The grasslands are suffering from overgrazing , desertification and the effects of climate change , it said .
Some 60,000 people will be moved by year - end and 40,000 more by 2010 .
Housing will be provided for all those forced to move , Xinhua said , but the head of one Tibetan community said it was not an easy process .
Tibetan lifestyle
Qinghai province is a source for both the Yangtze and Yellow rivers , but experts have warned of a crisis over water supply .
Climate change is melting glaciers that feed the rivers and subterranean water supplies have been reduced by increased population and industrialisation , experts say .
The relocation programme , aimed at restoring the ecology of the grasslands , is China 's biggest resettlement project , Xinhua said .
Those who move will be given accommodation and greenhouses in which to grow vegetables , Li Xiaonan , an official in charge of the project , told the agency .
But the BBC's James Reynolds , in Beijing , says that it appears that the nomads have no choice in the matter .
The ruling communist party says that everyone affected is being offered compensation , but that is unlikely to satisfy Tibetans , our correspondent says .
Many argue that China has been determined for many years to destroy their way of life as a people .
Environmentalists suggest that if China is really keen on protecting its environment it should focus its efforts on cleaning up its polluted rivers and reducing its carbon emissions , our correspondent says .

You hit the nail right on the head Floridiot .
In non-American governments the officials have teflon protection against the people , but in American government the people have teflon protection against the government .
Hence , we are in Amurka where the government has teflon protection against the people .
But Americans just may rise up in righteous indignation .
It just might if the MSM will convert from evil , repent of its evil ways , and honor the citizenry it is supposed to protect .
The Amurkan MSM , spreading its deceit infested legs for the fascist propagandists , the enemies of America .
And they have given birth to a heckuva job type swine - hound .

Been a very busy few weeks here , but I 'm following this story closely on Bradblog ... and doing a google news search every few hours to see if any media outlets in the US have picked it up .
So far it 's being reported in European and Middle Eastern papers , but I still do n't see a US report - gee , wonder why ?
Thanks for keeping us informed Brad .

Thank you thank you thank you Sibel , Brad , Luke and everyone else trying to bring this to LIGHT .
I hope Sibel has good protection .
I 'm sure hope there are safe deposit boxed lined up in case of ER .
What these people have done is TREASON .
This story has been running under the radar for too long .
I can guess why .
These guys are traitors , plain and simple .
I bet the SCOTUS puts the death penalty on hiatus for a year or ten , what with the crimes their FRIENDS committed , and the FRIENDS they would have to convict and assign the death penalty to once their cases are resolved and penalties assigned .
Oh , ya , and there is no INCOMPETENCE being committed by this bunch - they are quite well aware of what they are doing .
CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE is the best then can do .
All else is simply CRIMINAL .
One other thing to consider , Condi : if you were in this administration and you knew there were traitorous acts being committed , and you did nothing , you are also an accessory to the crimes .
Same applies to you , Nancy and Harry .
And where is the Waxman ?
What IS in Cheney 's MAN - SIZED SAFE , anyway ?

Bra , Sibel , and Luke !
Kudos for all of your efforts and others to try and overcome one of the largest criminal conspiracies on our planet I 'm betting .
If you also go to this youtube and note how Henry Waxman tries to avoid dealing with the Sibel Edmonds hearing question from multiple questioners there , it shows you what we 're up against !.

The President of Turkey , Abdullah Gul is right now visiting President Bush and I wish some enquiring journalist will stand up and ask some penetrating questions about these dark relationships between the US Neo Cons and the Turkish ' Deep State ' .
I am worried that this alliance is emboldening Turkey to take a purely military line with the Kurdish Question in Turkey and could even , in my opinion , deteriate to Turkey invading Kurdistan with the full support of this alliance .
Is there anything amongst this mess that points to Exxon Mobil and possible lobbying of Turkey .
Does for example , Michael Rubin come up anywhere on the radar ?
Well done again and I really hope that it comes to a tipping point and the US Media take it up .

Media ownership study ordered destroyed
Sept 14 , 2006 ' Every last piece ' destroyed Adam Candeub , now a law professor at Michigan State University , said senior managers at the agency ordered that " every last piece " of the report be destroyed .
" The whole project was just stopped - end of discussion , " he said .
Candeub was a lawyer in the FCC's Media Bureau at the time the report was written and communicated frequently with its authors , he said .

FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein
15 August , 2006 http://www.cbsnews.com/s...ational/main1900602.shtm
On ABC's Nightline , Monday , August 14 , former hostage Jill Carroll recounted how the Iraqi insurgency was " like a family affair … what are you gonna do , arrest them all , kill them all ? "
At that moment over on C - SPAN , President Bush , in the State Department 's Treaty Room , was giving the answer : Yes .
In the very next segment on C - SPAN , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu each delivered their own declarations of war in the Knesset .
All three leaders , in the US and in Israel , pointed to Syria and Iran as the new front in the " war on terror . "
This during a " cease - fire . "
Did the FCC Report about MEDIA CONTROL reveal that the Zionists control the US Media ?
Is that why a report , funded with your tax dollars , was destroyed ?

You have to keep reminding yourself this is not fantasy : that truly dangerous men , such as Perle and Rumsfeld and Cheney , have power .
The thread running through their ruminations is the importance of the media : " the prioritized task of bringing on board journalists of repute to accept our position " .
" Our position " is code for lying .
Certainly , as a journalist , I have never known official lying to be more pervasive than today .
We may laugh at the vacuities in Tony Blair 's " Iraq dossier " and Jack Straw 's inept lie that Iraq has developed a nuclear bomb ( which his minions rushed to " explain " ) .
But the more insidious lies , justifying an unprovoked attack on Iraq and linking it to would - be terrorists who are said to lurk in every Tube station , are routinely channeled as news .
They are not news ; they are black propaganda .

" Television is altering the meaning of " being informed " by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation ...
Disinformation does not mean false information .
It means misleading information - misplaced , irrelevant , fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something , but which in fact leads one away from knowing . "
Neil Postman SENATOR GRAHAM CALLS FOR ACTION AGAINST AMERICANS WHO DISAGREE WITH BUSH NAT PARRY , CONSORTIUM NEWS - Sen.
Lindsey Graham suggested to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales a new target for the administration 's domestic operations --- Fifth Columnists , supposedly disloyal Americans who sympathize and collaborate with the enemy .
" The administration has not only the right , but the duty , in my opinion , to pursue Fifth Column movements , " Graham , R - S.C. , told Gonzales during Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Feb .
6 . " I stand by this President 's ability , inherent to being Commander in Chief , to find out about Fifth Column movements , and I do n't think you need a warrant to do that , " Graham added , volunteering to work with the administration to draft guidelines for how best to neutralize this alleged threat .
" Senator , " a smiling Gonzales responded , " the President already said we'd be happy to listen to your ideas . "

“ Most people prefer to believe that their leaders are just and fair , even in the face of evidence to the contrary , because once a citizen acknowledges that the government under which he lives is lying and corrupt , the citizen has to choose what he or she will do about it .
To take action in the face of corrupt government entails risks of harm to life and loved ones .
To choose to do nothing is to surrender one ’s self - image of standing for principles .
Most people do not have the courage to face that choice .
Hence , most propaganda is not designed to fool the critical thinker but only to give moral cowards an excuse not to think at all . ”

It was during a press conference on Sept. 16 , 2001 , in response to a question about homeland security efforts infringing on civil rights , that Bush first used the telltale word '' crusade ' ' in public .
'' This is a new kind of --- a new kind of evil , '' he said .
'' And we understand .
And the American people are beginning to understand .
This crusade , this war on terrorism is going to take a while . ''
In the summer of 2002 , after I had written an article in Esquire that the White House did n't like about Bush 's former communications director , Karen Hughes , I had a meeting with a senior adviser to Bush .
He expressed the White House 's displeasure , and then he told me something that at the time I did n't fully comprehend --- but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency .
The aide said that guys like me were '' in what we call the reality - based community , '' which he defined as people who '' believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . ''
I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism .
He cut me off .
'' That 's not the way the world really works anymore , '' he continued .
'' We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you 're studying that reality --- judiciously , as you will --- we 'll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that 's how things will sort out .
We 're history 's actors . . . and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . ''

So according to dear Sibel Mr Feith ( son of the Israeli murderer and terrist Mr feith ) was helping the Pakis arm themsleves with nukes ?
Sounds highly plausible .
Of course it 's plausible .
The ZOG is interested in creating problems , not solutions .
Baffling indeed that Sibel should take her story to neocon zionist disinformation specialist and arch - liar Rupert Murdoch !
Why would he want to print her revelations , given that they 're just the type of thing he would normally be most anxious to suppress ?
It makes no sense at all .

Hey sandra day oconner , hope your feeling very responsible today !
The road to HELL was paved with good intentions sweetie , not empirical data .
At the moment it meant the most , you went partisan hack and handed us our present nightmare !
I would like to clarify my comment in the last Sibel article about the military stepping in .
With the obvious partisian corruption of the doj ( although I believe there are still some left there that act ethically , unfortunately not in top positions that direct all other 's actions ie gonzo , mukasey ) they are no longer qualified to investigate Sibel 's case .
I found it extremely interesting when recently the executive branch wanted to have authority over the nomination of JAG appointments , which thankfully they refused .
That leads me to believe with this highest level of government sponsored terror they would be the best qualified as independent to do any investigation .
Is it possible to demand an uncorrupted JAG as a special prosecutor to investigate ?
That is assuming there is at least one person left in this government with the courage , other than Sibel , to protect humanity .

I could easily say the Islamic Jihadi are crazy or that the Zionist Jews are crazy , but that would be a disservice to the Truth .
More accurate , I believe , is to say they are devout .
They are fully committed to their cause and they have resources and intelligence with which to execute their plans .
The effect of this is that the tail is wagging the dog ( the world ) .
However , step back one bit and consider another possibility .
What if this extreme behavior is being fed ( inspired ) by the warmongers , the war profiteers , the Military - Industrial Complex ?
They did this to America and the Soviet Union for years .
They did this to America with regard to Vietnam and many other wars and they did it repeatedly to keep our military spending high --- now as high as the rest of the world combined !
After the Soviet Union fell ( or shortly before ) they must have felt their party was coming to a close and that they needed to start another conflict .
Well , the Israeli - Palestinian conflict had been raging since WWII and the feelings were intense ( they still are ) .
That 's when they turned Saddam Hussein into an enemy .
War war war , profits profits profits .
And , since when have the American people cared who gets killed in our name in some ' God - forsaken part of the world ' ?
The Jews and Muslims are perhaps being played for fools , all to make money for someone else .
We were beginning to break the habit with the Clinton administration and then boom , right back to the Global War on Terror and war war war .
Maybe George W. Bush 's nickname should be ' boom boom ' for something more fitting for war .
Sibel Edmonds is amazingly courageous .
But , perhaps she felt she had to act now to avoid catastrophe .
I hope she stays safe and we get all the bastards .
This also ties in to the John Edwards campaign for the presidency .
The ' powers that be ' do n't want him anywhere near the presidency and they 're happy to turn Obama into a mediocrity or worse yet , a puppet .
This is one reason I believe we must elect Edwards --- justice sometimes requires great courage , strength and force , even if it comes from the mighty pen in the hand of a fragile woman .
Go Sibel !
Go John go !
But , stay safe , please !

While it 's true that care must be taken not to tar all Jews far - right Zionists , to ignore such truths as 100 % of Israel 's extreme right are also Zionists , while more moderate Israeli's do not neccesarily characterize themselves as such .
It is also true that a large number of religious Jews entirely rejects Zionism , believing it to be a heresy and a violation of Jewish Law , a reading tthat places the Kingdom of Israel in one 's heart , that it has nothing to do with actual land deeds .
But as many have already noted , the US gets a very skewed perception of what Israeli 's themselves believe .
The MOTR American Jew typically has notions more in line with the Israeli right as a result of being kept oblivious to the words and activities of the entire left - leaning or liberal half of Jewry .
In any case , the wholesale incorporation of PNAC membership into Dubya 's WH is the result of the alliance between Cheney and Wolfowitz to work out a way the US war - industry could avoid losing those lucrative contracts by seeing money redistributed into a " peace - dividend " at the close of the Cold War .
" Rebuilding America 's Defenses " was delivered by PNAC to Bush ... by Cheney .. in 2000 .
It has been followed as close to the letter as realities allow ever since .
The collaboration of Perle and others on both the Israeli " Clean Break " policy and US foreign policy initiatives that we all now know as " The War on Terror " shows quite clearly that Likudniks have taken a measure of power in Washington that no sovereign nation should ever allow itself to come under .
The power of AIPAC , AEI and the PNAC on determining how US military might is used is obvious and should be a front page scandal many times over .
But the hijacking of the US military by far - right Zionists sees no ink , Edmonds sees no ink , the spy (s ) operating out of Feith 's office downstairs , nor the clearly divided loyalties of Abrams , Perle , Wolfowitz , Libby , Armitage , Feith , Zelikow , Kristol , Kagan , and the many others self - described Zionists who conceived the US 's use of preemptive war , the toppling of Saddam Hussein ( with or without WMDs ) , the use of torture , and of course the US 's unilateral withdrawal from international conventions , treaties and courts .
Bolton at the UN was pure PNAC .
I mean ... c'mon ?
The " War on Terror " serves only the expansionist policies of the Israeli Zionists .
How could it possibly have served US interests to inflame the passions of Muslim 's the world over by attacking Iraq ?
Even more bizarre is the selling of the notion that Al Queda could be seen as a threat so dire that the Constitution would have to be shelved .
The Cold War was fought and won without it and that was against far , far more sophisticated and numerous opponents who had WMDs up the ying - yang .
So does AQ have any nuclear tipped ICBMs ?
Or multi- warheaded nuke missiles sitting on subs 15 minutes of the California shoreline ?
No .
Yet when big - building - fall - down go -Boom !
suddenly a few hundred cave - jumping religious kooks armed with pipe - bombs and AKs warrants more drastic war - measures ?
Give me a break !
The shame alone should have you all in open rebellion .
And yet here 's more nonsense about being nice and not using the " Z- word " .
But it 's this very fear of being labeled anti-semitic that was used to manipulate their way into power .
It now allows Likud to exercise Israeli foreign policy from the WH without any worry of being called on it by the MSM .
This fear of calling a spade a spade is the reason US kids are dying at the hands of Iraqi's who feel a tad defensive about having a massive US FOB ( Forward Operating Base ) built on their soil in a war that was engineered by a ' self - described ' Zionist , Paul Wolfowitz back in ' 92 .
Yes .
During Clinton 's term these hawks used their banishment from the WH to transform Cheney 's white paper from the blatantly war - seeking form into the one that reappeared years later in a barely recognizable form ... which was the whole purpose behind the PNAC .
This " media - friendly " package was the creation of fellow Zionists Kagan(s ) and William Kristol ... a man with extensive media experience and connections .
Bill Kristol managed to sell it to an intellectually outclassed dimwit - cum - President by the name of George W Bush .
' Self - selected ' VP Dick Cheney was then the primary instrument through which PNAC flowered into Pax Americana .
Libby & Cheney watched the Prez , while Armitage ( also PNAC ) watched Powell .
It was Armitage that tried to bail Libby out at the end of Fitz 's investigation by saying that maybe it was he , Armitage , that let the Plame thing slip out if you will remember .
Bolton 's recess ( rammed through ) appointment to the UN was another PNAC installation as well .
Yet despite all these Zionist PNAC members , the link was virtually dismissed by the MSM .
Do n't you .

この文書のステータ ス
この章は、この文書の公開時におけるステータスについて説明しています。このため、他の仕様がこの文書を上書きしている可能性があります。W3C による他の出版物およびこの技術レポートの最新版は
W3C 技術レポートインデックス ( http://www.w3.org/TR/)
で探すことができます。
この文書は HTML Activity の HTML ワーキンググループ が作成した最初の公開草案 ( First Public Working Draft ) です 。HTML ワーキンググループはこの文書を 部会ノート ( Working Group Note ) として 、HTML 5 仕様 とともに公開する予定です。仕様書やこの文書へのコメントを寄せるのに適切なフォーラムは
public-html-comments@w3.org です。公開アーカイブ も存在しています。
草案としての仕様書公開は 、W3C メンバーによる支持を意味するものではありません。この文書は更新されたり他の文書と置き換えられたり、また破棄される可能性もある草稿段階の仕様書です。策定中ということを明記せずに、この文書を引用することは適当でありません。
この文書は 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy の下で活動するグループにより作成されました。W3C は 特許情報の開示に関する公開リスト を関連する団体と共に、その成果物とあわせて管理しています。リストには情報開示に関する説明もありますので、ご参照ください。特許について十分に知識のある人物が、当該仕様に関し Essential Claim(s ) が認められると判断した場合は 、W3C 特許方針の 第6 章 に従い情報を開示する必要があります。
目次
1. はじめに
HTML は 1990 年代初頭の誕生から今日まで発展を続けてきました。HTML における機能は仕様書で定義されることもあれば、ソフトウェアのリリースにより導入されることもありました。いくつかの点において、HTML の実装や作成者の慣習は互いに近づき、また仕様書や標準とも合致しました。しかし一方で、それらの間には相違も生まれ続けています。
HTML 4 は 1997 年に W3C 勧告となりました。今日までその仕様書は、HTML の核となる機能を大まかに説明するガイドとして利用されています。しかし、HTML
仕様書は実装どうしの相互運用性や、莫大な数に達した
Web 上の HTML 文書をどう扱うかという重要な問題に対し、十分な情報を提供していませんでした。また、同じことがHTML 4 を XML でシリアライズした XHTML1、そして HTML と XHTML に JavaScript API を定義する DOM Level 2 HTML に対しても起こってしまいました 。 [
HTML4 ] [ XHTML1 ] [ DOM2HTML ]
HTML 5 仕様の草案は 、2004 年に始まった現在の HTML 実装と 、Web に公開されている HTML 文書に対し行った調査を反映し、次の要件を掲げています。
HTML 5 と呼ばれ、 「 カスタム 」HTML または XML で記述する、ひとつの言語仕様を定義する。 詳細な処理モデルを定義し、相互運用可能な仕様の実装を手助けする。 文書のマークアップを改善する 。
Web アプリケーションのような新しい表現に対し、マークアップと API を提供する 。
1.1. 未解決の問題
HTML 5 は未だ草稿段階です。HTML
5 仕様書および、この文書中の HTML 5 に関する項目は、現在も HTML ワーキンググループや WHATWG メーリングリストで検討中です。網羅的ではありませんが、未だ解決されていない問題について次に記します。
表象的であった要素に対して与えられた、デファクトな意味定義。
longdesc 、 alt 、 summary 、 headers など、アクセシビリティおよびメディア非依存な機能の詳細。
、 、 、 など、アクセシビリティおよびメディア非依存な機能の詳細。 style 属性 。
属性。 繰り返しモデル 。
1.2. 後方互換性
すでに Web 上に公開されている HTML 文書への扱いに対して 、HTML 5 はユーザーエージェントが後方互換を取るようにと定義しています。
HTML 5 では、オーサリング言語を製作者のためシンプルにした結果、表象的な要素をはじめとするいくつかの要素や属性が含まれていません。CSS の使用が推奨されるこれらの要素や属性に関しては、後のセクションに詳しい説明があります。
一方で、ユーザーエージェントはこれらの古い要素をサポートし続けなければなりません。このため、仕様書は製作者に対する要件とユーザーエージェントの要件を明確に分けています。たとえば、製作者は isindex や plaintext 要素を使用することはできませんが、ユーザーエージェントはこれらの要素が過去にどう振舞っていたかを考慮し、それに互換性を持つ形でサポートする必要があります。
HTML 5 は製作者とユーザーエージェントに別々の適合性要件を設けたことにより、「非推奨 ( deprecated ) 」という扱いを行う必要がなくなりました。
1.3 . 開発モデル
HTML 5 仕様は、少なくともふたつの完全な実装が登場するまでは完成したとみなされません。これは過去の
HTML とは異なるアプローチです。この開発モデルを採用する目的として、開発者やデザイナーに仕様が完成した時点で実装可能、使用可能であることを保証したいというものがあります。
2. 構文
HTML 5 言語は 、Web に公開されてい る HTML 4 や XHTML1 と互換性のある 「 カスタム 」HTML 構文を採用しています。しかしこの構文は
HTML 4 における、たとえば < em/ content / などの難解な SGML の機能とは互換性がありません。この 「 カスタム 」構文を使用する文書は text / html MIME タイプで供給される必要があります。
HTML 5 はまた、この構文にエラーハンドリングを含む詳細なパース処理規則を定義しています。これらの規則は、よくある実装と大部分において互換性を持つよう設計されています。ユーザーエージェントは text / html MIME タイプを持つリソースに対し、これらの規則に従いパース処理を行います。「 カスタム」HTML 構文に適合する HTML 文書の例は、次のようなものになります。
<! doctype html > < html > < head > < meta charset = " UTF - 8 " > < title > Example document </ title > </ head > < body > < p > Example paragraph </ p> </ body > </html >
HTML 5 で使用できるもうひとつの構文は XML です。この構文は XHTML1 文書およびその実装と互換性をもちます。XML 構文を使用する文書は XML の MIME 型により提供される必要があります。また、XML 仕様にて述べられた規則に基づき、要素 は
http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml 名前空間に属する必要があります。 [ XML ]
次の例は HTML 5 文書の XML 構文に適合する文書の例です。この XML 文書は XML の MIME 型、すなわち application / xhtml+xml または application / xml を持たなければならないことに注意してください。
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head > < title > Example document </ title > </ head > < body > < p > Example paragraph </ p> </ body > </html >
2.1. 文字符号化方式
HTML 5 の HTML 構文において、作成者は次に示す三つの方法から、文書の文字符号化方式を指定できます。
HTTP の Content - Type ヘッダなど、トランスポートレベルでの指定。
ヘッダなど、トランスポートレベルでの指定。 ファイルの先頭に記述する Unicode 文字である 、Byte Order Mark ( BOM ) を用いた指定。この特殊文字により、使用する符号化方式を特定することができます。
meta 要素の charset 属性による指定。この要素は head 要素の一番初めに宣言します。たとえば < meta charset = " UTF - 8 " >
は、UTF -8 符号化方式を指定する場合に用いることができます。これは今まで使われていた < meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=UTF - 8 " > という指定方法を置き換えるものです。
XML 構文では、作成者は XML 仕様の規定に基づき文字符号化方式を指定する必要があります。
2.2 . DOCTYPE
HTML 5 の HTML 構文では、ブラウザがページを標準モードで描画することを保証するため、
DOCTYPE が必須となります。 DOCTYPE はこのほかに何も目的を持っていないため、XML 構文での記述は任意となります。これは、XML の MIME 型で供給される文書は常に標準モードで扱われるためです。 [
DOCTYPE ]
DOCTYPE 宣言は <! DOCTYPE html > となります。HTML 構文では大文字と小文字を区別しません。以前の
HTML は SGML であり 、DTD を参照する必要があったため DOCTYPE は長いものとなっていました。HTML 5 はこれに当てはまらず、 DOCTYPE は HTML 構文において標準モードを有効にする手段として必要となっています。なお、ブラウザは現段階において既に、
<! DOCTYPE html > を標準モードのトリガーとして解釈しています。
3. 言語
このセクションは 、HTML 4 とHTML 5 の違いをより明確に説明するため、いくつかの小セクションに別れています。
3.1. 新しい要素
文書のより良い構造化のため、次の要素が新しく追加されました。
section 要素は文書やアプリケーションにおける一般的なセクションを表します。
h1 - h6 と共に用いることで、文書構造を示唆することができます。
article 要素は blog エントリや新聞記事など、文書の中で独立した一片の内容を表します。
aside 要素はページのほかの部分とわずかにのみ関係する一片の内容を表します。
header 要素はヘッダにあたるセクションを表します 。

When you pay off the first baseman every month , who gets the money ?
< dt> Abbott < dd >
Every dollar of it .
</ dialog >
figure 要素は画像やビデオなどの埋め込み内容に、説明文やキャプションを付加するために用いられます。 < figure > < video src=ogg >…</ video > < legend > Example </ legend > </ figure >
他にも、新しい要素が追加されています。
マルチメディアのための audio および video 要素が導入されました。どちらの要素にも製作者がスクリプトを用い、独自のユーザーインターフェースを作成できるような
API が提供されます。もちろん、ユーザーエージェントによるインターフェースの提供を働きかけるための仕組みも存在します。これらの要素と source 要素を共に用いることで、異なるタイプの多重ストリームを記すことができます。
embed 要素はプラグイン用のコンテンツに用いられます。
m 要素は印づけされた一連のテキストを表します。
meter 要素はディスク容量などの測定値を表します。
time 要素は日付や時刻などの時間情報を表します。

url
これらの属性値は、ユーザーエージェントがユーザーインターフェースを提供し、決められたフォーマットでサーバーにデータを送信させることができるように定義されました。これらはたとえばカレンダーにおける日付選択のインターフェースや、ユーザーのアドレスブックと統合した機能に役立ちます。また、これらの属性値により、ユーザーがサーバーにデータを送信する前にフォームの内容をチェックすることができます。このため、フィードバックを待つ時間の短縮を実現し、ユーザーにより良いエクスペリエンスを提供することができます。
3.2. 新しい属性
HTML 5 は HTML 4 で定義されていた要素に、新しい属性を導入しました。
a および area 要素は media 属性を持つことができるようになりました。これは link 要素との一貫性を保持するためで。この属性は、純粋に助言的な情報です。
a および area 属性は新しい属性 ping を持つことができます。属性値はスペース区切りの URI で、ハイパーリンクをたどるときに ping されなければならないリソースを指定します。現在ユーザートラッキングはリダイレクト処理により行われていますが、この属性によりユーザーエージェントはユーザーに対し、どの
URI が ping されるのかを教えることができ、かつプライバシーを意識するユーザーに対し、その機能を無効にする仕組みを用意することができます。
area 要素は、一貫性保持のため hreflang および rel 属性を持つことができるようになりました 。
base 要素は a 要素との一貫性保持のため、また広くサポートされていることから、 target 属性を持つことができるようになりました。また、 a および area 要素の target 属性は非推奨ではなくなりました。これは iframe など 、Web アプリケーションにおいて役立つものであるからです 。
li 要素の value 属性は表象的ではないことから非推奨ではなくなりました。 ol 要素の start 属性も同様に非推奨ではなくなりました 。
meta 要素は charset を持つことができるようになりました。これはすでに広くサポートされており、また文書の 文字符号化方式 を指定する、より素敵な方法です 。
input 、 select 、 textarea 、そして button 要素に autofocus 属性を指定できるようになりました ( ただし、 type 属性に hidden が指定された input 要素には指定できません ) 。この属性はページがロードされたときに特定のフォームコントロールにフォーカスを与える仕組みを提供します。気に入らなければユーザーが自動フォーカス機能をオフにできることも含め、この属性はユーザーエクスペリエンスを向上させるでしょう。
input 、 output 、 select 、 textarea 、 button 、そして fieldset 要素に新たに導入された form 属性により、ひとつ以上のフォームにコントロールを指定することができるようになりました。
input 、 button 、そして form 要素は replace 属性を持つことができるようになりました。この属性は、フォームが送信された後の処理に影響します。
datalist 要素と同様に、 form 、 select 要素は data 属性を持てるようになりました。この属性により、 form 要素やフォームコントロールでは自動的なフォーム内容の記入が、また select や datalist 要素ではサーバーからデータの自動読み込みが可能となります。
input および textarea 要素に required 属性を指定できるようになりました ( ただし、 type 属性に hidden 、 image 、そして submit など何らかのボタンタイプが指定された input 要素には指定できません ) 。この属性により、ユーザーはどのフォームに記入することでフォームを送信できるかを知ることができるようになります。
input および textarea 要素は新しい属性 inputmode を持つことができるようになりました。この属性により、ユーザーはどのような入力が求められるのかをヒントとして知ることができるようになります。
disabled 属性により、ひとつの fieldset 要素全体を無効にすることができるようになりました。この機能は今まで可能ではありませんでした。
input 要素は次に挙げる新しい属性により、さまざまな制約を加えることができるようになりました。 autocomplete 、 min 、 max 、 pattern 、そして step がその属性です。また、先に述べたように、 datalist および select 要素と併用する list 属性も存在します 。
input および button 要素は新しい属性 template を持つことができるようになりました。この属性により、繰り返しテンプレートを利用することができるようになります。
menu 要素は三つの新しい属性 type 、 label 、そして autosubmit を導入しました。これらの属性により、要素を典型的なユーザーインターフェースで見られるようなメニューに変形させることができます。またグローバル属性 contextmenu と併用することで、コンテキストメニューの提供も行うことができるようになりました。
style 要素は新しい scoped 属性を持つことができるようになりました。これによりスコープを絞ったスタイルシートの指定が可能となります。このような style 要素によるスタイル指定は、ローカルツリーにのみ適用されます。
script 要素は新しい async 属性を持つことができるようになりました。この属性はスクリプトのローディングおよび実行に影響を与えます。
html 要素は manifest と呼ばれる新しい属性を持つことができるようになりました。この属性は、オフライン
Web アプリケーションのための API と強調し、アプリケーションキャッシュのマニフェストを指定します。
HTML 4 で定義されていたいくつかの属性は、すべての要素に適用できるようになりました。これらはグローバル属性と呼ばれ、 class 、 dir 、 id 、 lang 、 tabindex 、そして title 属性が当てはまります 。
また、新しいグローバル属性も導入されました。
contenteditable 属性は要素が編集可能領域であることを示す属性です。ユーザーは内容を変更し、マークアップを操作することができます。
属性は要素が編集可能領域であることを示す属性です。ユーザーは内容を変更し、マークアップを操作することができます。 contextmenu 属性は製作者によって提供されるコンテキストメニューを指定します。
属性は製作者によって提供されるコンテキストメニューを指定します。 draggable 属性は新しく定義されたドラッグ & ドロップ API と組み合わせて利用します 。

次に記すものは繰り返しモデルにて利用される属性です。これらはグローバル属性であり、すべての
HTML 要素に用いることが出来ます。また 、
http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml
名前空間に属することで、他の名前空間に属する要素にも用いることができます。
repeat
repeat - start
repeat-min
repeat-max
HTML 5 はまた、HTML 4 で定義されていた on event - name という形をとるすべてのイベントハンドラ属性をグローバルなものに変更しました。また、新たなイベントの定義と共に、それを処理するイベントハンドラ属性も設けています。たとえば、新しい event - source 要素およびクロスドキュメントなメッセージ API と共に用いる、 onmessage 属性などが当てはまります 。
3.3 . 変更された要素
次に挙げる要素は HTML 5 で若干意味が変更されています。これらの変更は
Web における使われ方を反映したもの、またはより便利なものとなるよう行われています。
href 属性のない a 要素は 「 リンクのプレースホルダ」を意味するようになりました。
address 要素は新しいセクショニングの概念により、スコープが狭まりました。
b 要素は文章において重要性を与えるわけではないものの、スタイル上表現が異なった部分を表すようになりました。たとえば概要におけるキーワードや、レビューにおける製品名など、タイポグラフィの慣習上よく太字にされるものが当てはまります。
hr 要素はパラグラフレベルでの主題変化を表すようになりました。
i 要素は文章において、異なった声やムード、または文章からオフセットとなっているものを表します。たとえば分類指示、専門用語、他言語での慣用句、考え、船舶名など、タイポグラフィの慣習上、斜体で表されるものが当てはまります。言語により幅広い用例が想定されます。
label 要素と結びつけられたコントロールに、ブラウザがフォーカスを移すことは行われなくなるでしょう。しかし、同様のコントロールがプラットフォームのユーザーインターフェースで標準的な動作となる場合は当てはまりません。
menu 要素は実際のメニューを表すよう再定義されました。
small 要素は脚注や法的条項などの細字部分を表すようになりました。
strong 要素は文章の一部を部分的に強調するものではなく、文章の重要度を示すものとなりました。
3.4 . 不在の要素
このセクションにある要素は、製作者が使用することのできない要素です。しかし、ユーザーエージェントはそれらをサポートし続けなければならないでしょう。また、HTML
5はそのうち、それらの要素をどうサポートすべきかをまとめた描画に関するセクションを設けるでしょう
( たとえば、 isindex 要素はすでにパーサがサポートしています ) 。
次に挙げる要素は HTML 5 に存在しません。なぜならこれらの要素は表象的であり、CSS にて扱われるべきだからです 。
basefont
big
center
font ただし WYSIWYG エディタにはユーザーインターフェースの制限があることから、この要素の使用が許可されます。
ただし WYSIWYG エディタにはユーザーインターフェースの制限があることから、この要素の使用が許可されます。
s
strike
tt
u
次に挙げる要素もまた HTML 5 に存在しません。これらの要素はユーザビリティやアクセシビリティに影響し、エンドユーザーに良くない結果をもたらすからです。
frame
frameset
noframes
次に挙げる要素は使用例が少ない、混乱の元になる、また他の要素で代用できることから含まれていません。
acronym 要素は多大なる混乱を引き起こしたことから削除されました。略語には abbr 要素を用いてください 。

要素はフォームコントロールの代用により置き換えられます。 dir 要素は ul 要素が支持されたことから廃止されました 。
最後に、 noscript 要素は HTML 構文でのみ適合するようになりました。これは noscript 要素の使用が HTML 構文にのみ依存するからであり、そのため XML 構文には含まれません 。
3.5 . 不在の属性
HTML 4 で定義されていたいくつかの属性は HTML 5 に存在しません。それらの属性が互換性に関する理由からユーザーエージェントに大きな影響を及ぼす場合、どのように働けばよいのかを明らかにしなければなりません。
a 、 area 、 button 、 input 、 label 、 legend 、そして textarea 要素の accesskey 属性 。

4.1. HTMLDocument の拡張
HTML 5 は DOM Level 2 HTML の HTMLDocument インターフェースをさまざまな方向に拡張しました。このインターフェースは
Document インターフェースをインプリメントするすべてのオブジェクトにインプリメントされます。このため、複合文書においても意味を持つことになります。また他にもいくつか注目すべきで新しいメンバがあります。
getElementsByClassName( ) は class 名により要素を選択するものです。このメソッドは class 属性を持ついかなる内容、また SVG や MathML などの Document オブジェクトで使用できるよう定義されました。
innerHTML は HTML や XML を簡単にパースし、シリアライズできるものです。この属性は
HTMLElement のみに存在し、また標準にはなっていませんでした。
activeElement および has Focus はどの要素に現在フォーカスが当たっているか、また
Document がフォーカスをそれぞれ行っているかを決定するものです。
getSelection ( ) は現在のセレクションを表すオブジェクトを返すものです。
designMode および execCommand ( ) は主に文書の編集に使われるものです。
4.2 . HTMLElement の拡張
HTML 5 では HTMLElement インターフェースに対しても、いくつかの拡張が行われました。
getElementsByClassName ( ) は基本的に HTMLDocument のものよりスコープが狭まったものです。
innerHTML は今日の Web ブラウザでサポートされているものです。また、XML 文書として扱われる場合には、XML でも働くように定義されています 。
classList は className のための便利なアクセサです。このアクセサが返すオブジェクトは、要素の class を操作するとき has ( ) 、 add ( ) 、 remove ( ) 、そして toggle ( ) といったメソッドを開きます。 a 、 area 、また link 要素も、 relList という rel 属性に関して同様の処理を行うアクセサが定義されています。

Video : Parody of Al Gore film tied to ExxonMobil lobbying firm RAW STORY
Published : Thursday August 3 , 2006 Print This | Email This
An online parody of Al Gore 's film , An Inconvenient Truth , has been tied to a lobbying firm which counts ExxonMobil among its clients , The Wall Street Journal reported today .
The online YouTube profile , which is where the film is hosted , indicates that it was made by a twenty - nine year old working in his Beverly Hill basement .
A Wall Street Journal investigation included and email exchange with the gentleman , nicknamed " Toutsmith . "
Research in to the routing of the email revealed that it was sent from the offices of DCI Group , the firm which ExxonMobil has a contract with .
The Journal report said : A DCI Group spokesman declines to say whether or not DCI made the anti-Gore penguin video , or to explain why Toutsmith appeared to be sending email from DCI 's computers .
" DCI Group does not disclose the names of its clients , nor do we discuss the work that we do on our clients ' behalf , " says Matt Triaca , who heads DCI 's media relations shop .
Dave Gardner , an Exxon spokesman , confirms that Exxon is a client of DCI .
But he says Exxon had no role in creating the " Inconvenient Truth " spoof .
" We , like everyone else on the planet , have seen it , but did not fund it , did not approve it , and did not know what its source was , " Mr. Gardner says .

Activists ask : Can ' weak - kneed '
Dems stand up to Bush on spying ?
Nick Juliano

As a foreign surveillance bill moves forward this week , civil libertarians and litigants against the nation 's telecommunications companies are urging Democrats to finally stand up to the Bush administration and refuse to " short circuit " the Judiciary by giving the companies immunity .
If Congress were to intervene and grant telecoms immunity , it would invalidate complaints lodged form dozens of litigants alleging the phone and internet companies violated their privacy by illegally handing over sensitive information to the government , lawyers arguing the case and civil liberties advocates said on a conference call Monday .
The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to consider a bill that would do just that this week , although privacy and civil liberties advocates are still working furiously to prevent the proposal from becoming law , which the Bush administration and its allies have said is vital to protect national security .
For that to happen , Democrats would have to stand up against Republican attacks that they are weak in fighting terrorists .
" The Democrats are so weak - kneed when it comes to discussing issues relating to the war on terror , " said Caroline Fredrickson , the American Civil Liberties Union 's top lobbyist .
A long road lays ahead until Congress is expected to send President Bush a bill updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , to which the immunity provision is now attached .
A House bill does not contain immunity and Democratic leaders there are working to round up enough votes to secure passage .
A temporary FISA update rushed through Congress in August would expire in early February , and it is beginning to look like lawmakers may not pass a bill until that deadline is imminent .
Even if telecom immunity remained in a bill , it would not mark the end of the road for anti-immunity activists .
" We will litigate against any of this , " Kevin Bankston , the lead attorney in a case against AT&T in California , told RAW STORY during Monday 's conference call .
Although he was hesitant to " preview litigation strategy , " Bankston said there are " serious constitutional questions " stemming from Congress 's attempts to interfere with cases currently moving through the courts .
" The immunity currently being proposed is unparalleled historically , " he said .
Furthermore , call participants said , the Congress is attempting to forestall any further legislation while the courts are just beginning to review the cases .
Years more litigation are expected before the courts issue any definitive rulings , and the cases could go all the way to the Supreme Court .
A federal judge rejected the government 's arguments that the class action suit against AT&T , which was brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , cannot go forward on states secrets grounds , and the district court judge , whose ruling is being appealed , said AT&T should have known that the government 's request was illegal .
Responding to critics who say they would tie the government 's hands during an emergency by not letting companies off the hook , the lawyers said that the lawsuits are not calling into question the phone companies actions in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 , but the warrantless surveillance apparently continued until January of this year , long after the immediate threat abated .
" We are talking about a systematic violation of law that occurred over half a decade , " Bankston said .
Congress passed FISA in 1978 after Idaho Sen .
Frank Church led a commission that found government surveillance was targeting activists , war protesters and political enemies of the Nixon administration .
The law was meant to prevent further encroachments and moderate the virtually limitless access to private communications the government could access because of increasing technology .
" I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America , and we must see to it that [ the National Security Agency ] and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision , so that we never cross over that abyss , " Church said at the time , according to a lenghty Atlantic article on warrantless wiretapping .
" That is the abyss from which there is no return . "
Although they did n't say so as explicitly Monday , the civil liberties lawyers argued that their litigation was the public 's only recourse to ensure that Americans ' constitutional rights have remained in tact .
It is up to the telecoms to responsibly manage the endless reams of data they have access to , and they must be held to account in the courts to ensure they would push back the next time the government comes around with questionable requests , said Harvey Grossman , an ACLU lawyer also working on lawsuits against the companies .
" A get out of jail free card , " he said , " is something that can only encourage future misconduct . "
Two Signs , Different Results
-- by harry , posted Feb 11 , 2008
A blind boy sat on the steps of a building with a hat by his feet .
He held up a sign which said : " I am blind , please help . "
There were only a few coins in the hat .
A man was walking by .
He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat .
He then took the sign , turned it around , and wrote some words .
He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by would see the new words .
Soon the hat began to fill up .
A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy .
That afternoon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were .
The boy recognized his footsteps and asked , " Were you the one who changed my sign this morning ?
What did you write ? "
The man said , " I only wrote the truth .
I said what you said but in a different way . "
What he had written was : " Today is a beautiful day and I can not see it . "
Both signs told people the boy was blind .
While the first sign simply said the boy was blind , the second sign pointed the fortunate ones to their positive possibilities .
Moral of the Story : Be thankful for what you have .
Be creative .
Be innovative .
Think differently and positively .
Invite the people towards good with wisdom .

Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich created a stink on the House of Representatives floor Wednesday when he announced he 'll introduce a measure to impeach President Bush when Bush delivers his final State of the Union address Jan. 28 .
" We already know the State of the Union , " said Kucinich , whose earlier effort to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney has languished in the House Judiciary Committee because of opposition from Democratic leaders .
" It 's a lie . "
I ask you , when will any of the other candidates on the Democratic Party be willing to stand up and say about the state of the union that " It 's a lie . "
Yes , it 's blunt .
But we also know it 's true .
Republicans objected to Kucinich 's statements , and the congressman returned to the floor a few minutes later to withdraw his " offending words . "
Florida GOP Rep. Cliff Stearns called his remarks a " clear and egregious violation of House rules " and scolded Kucinich for ut tering " personal ac cusations " against Bush and Cheney .
If you have n't seen it :
Dennis is willing to stand for the Constitution !
With the New Hampshire recount he 's paid for , Dennis has shown that he is willing to stand for the voters of the US !
It 's called leadership !
And in case you forget where your candidate stands on impeachment :
And if you wonder why he 's being kept off the stage during the debates :
Do you support impeachment ?
Do you support Single Payer ?
Do you support getting out of Iraq now ?
If you do , go to Dennis ' campaign site .
You can read his positions on the issues , join his volunteer team through his action page , and you can donate to his campaign .
Dennis Kucinich :
It 's called leadership !
As always , now more than ever ,
Go Dennis !

See , the housing pyramid was very simple : Buy a house beyond your means .
It ’s okay if you ca n’t afford the monthly payments because you simply sell the house for a profit in a year or two .
With lots of people doing the same thing , house prices were guaranteed to go up faster than most Americans could afford .
“ You do n’t mind making a $ 2,000 payment when the house is going up ” in value , said Steve Walsh , a mortgage broker in Scottsdale , Arizona , who has seen several clients walk away from their homes because they could n’t refinance or sell .
“ When it ’s going down , it becomes a weight around your neck , it becomes an anchor . ”
No one wants to hear this , but the housing market in this country has become a massive pyramid scheme .
If you need any proof , read this quote from The New York Times :
The irony ?
I did n’t even know what a pyramid scheme was !
It just seemed like the right descriptive words .
When I was a teenager , a relative of mine was excited about joining an “ investment club ” in which members passed $ 5,000 up the chain to higher - level members .
Each member , who kept a percentage of the money moving up the ladder , had to recruit more people to keep feeding the system .
But the market moves at a glacial pace compared with other financial scams , so it seemed safer .
My favorite argument : “ You can live in this investment . ”
Um , yeah .
With such a cultural mentality , it became difficult for individuals to recognize that such an investment scheme could n’t go on forever .
It turned out a credit crunch stopped the game because suddenly the players could no longer sell or refinance their overpriced homes .
Financial pyramid schemes , like the one I mentioned at the beginning of this post , are pretty easy to spot because they explode in size overnight and collapse even quicker .
Those at the bottom usually complain first .
Investigators then prosecute those at the top , but the transfer of wealth tends to be permanent .
Damage occurs from top to bottom of they pyramid , though those at the top tend to fair much better – as long as they escape prosecution – than those at the bottom .
So here we have the housing market collapsing in slow motion just like a financial pyramid scheme .
First came subprime , the bottom part of the pyramid .
Next comes the middle portion of the pyramid , which mean option - ARMS and Alt - A .
Then comes prime mortgages .
The wealthy are better situated to weather the collapse because they have more resources to begin with .
Writes the Times :
As home prices fall and banks tighten lending standards , people with good , or prime , credit histories are falling behind on their payments for home loans , auto loans and credit cards at a quickening pace , according to industry data and economists .
The rise in prime delinquencies , while less severe than the one in the subprime market , nonetheless poses a threat to the battered housing market and weakening economy , which some specialists say is in a recession or headed for one . …
“ This collapse in housing value is sucking in all borrowers , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
The delinquency rate for all mortgages is at 7.3 percent , which is at the highest rate since 1979 when such numbers were tracked , according to the Times .
At the end of September , 4 percent of prime mortgages were past due .
Delinquency rates are n’t quite so high at Fannie Mae , according to the company ’s monthly report ( pdf ) , but the number of seriously delinquent homeowners has been consistently rising since mid-2007 .
( see chart . )
Because the pyramid is eroding from the base first , it ’s hard for those still doing well to see what is happening under their feet .
Most of those who hold prime mortgages still have jobs and have deep enough pockets to hang on longer than those with subprime mortgages .
The question becomes : How long will the Middle Class hang on ?
It ’s hard to say .
Economists seem to have forgotten that recessions do n’t occur in a straight line down .
Instead , the economy stair - steps its way into the basement .
Interestingly , the pyramid may still be growing at the top .
Even in Los Angeles , where median listing prices have dropped to $ 475,000 , some zip codes are seeing home values increase .
Just take a look at the map on L.A. Land , a Los Angeles Times real estate blog .
Of course , the numbers come from Zillow , so it ’s hard to know how accurate they are .
I ’m of the opinion , though , that the pyramid , because of its massive size , will continue to crumble from the underside until the damage is across the board .
But do n’t believe me , look at what lenders are doing , according to the Los Angeles Times :
6 Firms Act to Help Avert Foreclosures
The mortgage lenders will team up with nonprofits to reach out to borrowers at risk .
Struggling to connect with their delinquent customers , a group of six major mortgage lenders is teaming up with nonprofit groups to serve as a go - between .
As part of the program , borrowers who get behind on their payments will receive notice from a financial counseling service “ instead of the big , bad bank , ” said an executive with one of the lenders .
Hmm , think these lenders are satisfied that write - downs are coming to an end ?
Hah !
Besides , this latest scheme comes on top of the other bailouts such as : Fed Rate Cuts , tax cuts , stimulus packages , mortgage rate - freezes and a plan to allow Fannie Mae to buy crappy mortgages from other financial institutions .
In case you ’re wondering , I suspect our esteemed leaders understand what is happening ; the fight is over who should take the biggest hit from the mess that is being created .
The goal seems to be this : save the financial institutions , screw the homeowners and / or shift as much of the pain into the future through more deficit spending and cheap credit .
The best part ?
The seeds – such as the Fed making credit dirt cheap to banks – for the next big pyramid scheme are being planted today so we can do it all over again in the future .
Odds are that in 20 years or so , a new pyramid will have been built and everyone will be shocked and surprised .
Fourteen companies , including some of the world 's largest banks , are being investigated over possible accounting fraud , improperly securing loans and insider trading during the sub - prime mortgage scandal .
The FBI said yesterday that it had opened criminal investigations into improper lending in the American housing market .
Neil Power , head of the FBI 's economic crimes unit , told journalists that the investigation includes the companies that securitised the loans and investment banks that bought those products , as well as the developers and sub - prime lenders .
" We 're looking at the accounting fraud that goes through the securitisation of these loans , " said Power .
The FBI did not name the companies it is investigating .
Several of the world 's largest banks separately revealed yesterday that they are cooperating with official investigations .
Bear Stearns , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley all announced , via official filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission , that government investigators have asked for information about their sub - prime lending practices .
According to Reuters , Swiss bank UBS – which today unveiled new sub - prime losses – is also being investigated by the FBI .
The sub - prime crisis broke last year , after billions of dollars of home loans were made to people with poor credit history or little income .
The mortgages were initially available at attractively low rates , but when these " teaser rates " ended many borrowers found they were unable to keep up with the payments .
These sub - prime mortgages were then bundled together with other loans and sold on to other financial institutions – often with a high credit rating .
Once the US housing market began to slide , banks began admitting that they had incurred large losses – prompting the credit crunch , as bankers became increasingly unwilling to lend to each other .
It is estimated that more than $ 100 bn ( £ 50 bn ) was been wiped off the balance sheets across the financial sector , in losses and asset writedowns .
Share prices have also fallen heavily .
The SEC is already conducting a clutch of civil investigations into the scandal .
Some US states have launched their own legal action .
Yesterday , Connecticut state attorney general Richard Blumenthal said his office has issued subpoenas to all major rating agencies and bond insurers in a widening probe of industry practices related to the sub - prime mortgage crisis .
He said this includes MBIA and Ambac , the two monoline insurers who guarantee municipal loans whose shares plunged last week over concern they do not hold enough capital to guarantee their ratings , after getting caught in the sub - prime chaos .
Blumenthal also told Reuters that Connecticut was cooperating with the state of New York over its investigation .
These days , as opposed to the times when money was tight , there is plenty to go around .
There were Christmases when the boys received no presents .
They wore patched jeans and hand - me - downs , and their parents somehow made six pork chops feed nine mouths .
Nineteen years separate the oldest Jones child from the youngest , but each still sprinkles sentences with “ yes , sir ” and “ no , ma’am . ”
“ Your bond with your family got you through those times , ” said Thomas A. Jones , the father whom everyone calls Big Thomas .
“ Nobody goes to Wal - Mart and buys a cup of happiness .
That ’s how two children can come from where they came from , go to where they are and hold on to what they have . ”
Some brothers , like quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning , seem to have been born into professional football .
Others , like the twins Ronde and Tiki Barber , made their mark with quick feet and photogenic smiles .
What stands out for the Jones brothers is the speck of a town they grew up in and emerged from , nourished at all times by family .
Thomas Q. Jones , the son whom everyone calls Little Thomas , said the brothers always had to prove themselves .
“ Constantly , ” he said .
“ Over and over again . ”
Race was a factor at times , particularly away from home during their high school football and basketball careers .
They were two African - Americans at a predominantly white school in an overwhelmingly white town .
Those from opposing schools sometimes waved rebel flags , and there was the occasional taunt at road games .
Dear Mrs ....
I gather from your letter that your son is a homosexual .
I am most impressed by the fact that you do not mention this term yourself in your information about him .
May I question you , why you avoid it ?
Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage , but it is nothing to be ashamed of , no vice , no degradation , it can not be classified as an illness ; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function produced by a certain arrest of sexual development .
Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals , several of the greatest men among them ( Plato , Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci , etc. ) .
It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime , and cruelty too .
If you do not believe me , read the books of Havelock Ellis .
By asking me if I can help , you mean , I suppose , if I can abolish homosexuality and make normal heterosexuality take its place .
The answer is , in a general way , we can not promise to achieve it .
In a certain number of cases we succeed in developing the blighted germs of heterosexual tendencies which are present in every homosexual , in the majority of cases it is no more possible .
It is a question of the quality and the age of the individual .
The result of treatment cannot be predicted .
What analysis can do for your son runs in a different line .
If he is unhappy , neurotic , torn by conflicts , inhibited in his social life , analysis may bring him harmony , peace of mind , full efficiency whether he remains a homosexual or gets changed .
. . .
Sincerely yours with kind wishes ,

Judge : Bush officials broke law by not reporting on warming
2007-08-21 16:32:00 PDT
OAKLAND --
The Bush administration has violated a 2004 congressional deadline for presenting the latest scientific research about global warming to lawmakers and the public and must submit its report by next spring , a federal judge ruled today .
Federal officials have " unlawfully withheld action they are required to take , " preparing a new scientific assessment by November 2004 and a research plan by July 2006 , said U.S. District Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong of Oakland .
" Congress has imposed clear - cut , unambiguous deadlines for compliance . "
A 1990 federal law requires the government to produce a scientific report every four years on climate change and its effects on the environment , including land , water , air , plant and animal life and human health .
The Clinton administration issued the first report in October 2000 , warning of severe effects on different regions .
The Bush administration has not issued a report and , according to environmental groups that filed the lawsuit last November , has tried to bury the Clinton report .
" This administration has denied and suppressed the science of global warming at every turn , " said Brendan Cummings , an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity .
Administration officials were unavailable for comment on the ruling .
When the suit was filed , a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the government had chosen other means of complying with the law : a series of 21 mini-reports on various aspects of climate change , issued over a two - year period .
The first of those documents , in May 2006 , discussed temperature trends in the lower atmosphere but did not describe any potential effects on the environment .
Armstrong ordered the administration to publish a summary of its climate research plan by March 1 and to submit the plan to Congress 90 days later after receiving public comments .
She ordered Bush officials to publish the scientific assessment of global warming and its effects by May 31 .
Armstrong was appointed in 1991 by President George H.W. Bush , who signed the 1990 law requiring the reports .
The ruling was the second legal defeat for the administration on global warming this year .
The Supreme Court ruled in April that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted from vehicle tailpipes were pollutants subject to federal regulation -- rejecting the government 's position that it lacked such authority -- and said the voluntary measures promoted by the Bush administration were an inadequate substitute for regulation .
President Bush opposes mandatory emissions limits , saying they would damage the U.S. economy .
In 2001 he pulled the United States out of the Kyoto Protocol , which requires curbs on greenhouse gases .
Government lawyers sought to dismiss the lawsuit over the scientific reports , arguing that the 1990 law was intended only to provide information to Congress and that private citizens had no right to sue over the deadlines .
But Armstrong said the law also entitles the public to take part in the planning process by commenting on the government 's disclosures .
If the research plan is delayed indefinitely , the judge said , the public participation intended by Congress " has no real value or substance . "

As your business grows , you may be researching how to apply for a small business loan to fund your expansion .
Whether you ’re applying for a mortgage , a line of credit or an equipment loan , getting a small business loan can sometimes be a challenging and drawn out process .
However , the more you prepare , the more smoothly the application process can go , and you may even have a better chance of being approved for a loan or business line of credit by having all your finances in order .
As a business owner , it ’s not just your company ’s financials you have to consider , most lenders will also look at your personal banking history .
Before you start considering lenders , follow these tips for managing your personal finances .
Personal credit reports matter
Like it or not , your personal credit history will be considered when applying for a small business loan or line of credit .
Before you start the application process , request a copy of your credit report and review the information provided .
Pay close attention to detail and look for any errors , such as the wrong address or incorrect payment dates .
If you do find errors , make sure to get them corrected before you start applying for a loan or business line of credit .
Additionally , your track record of making payments on time , whether on personal lines of credit , student loans , mortgages or auto loans , will make a big impact on whether or not you get approved for a small business loan and the rate you get if you do .
Managing your personal finances before you apply will help you be in a better state for approval .
Determine your collateral
As defined by the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) , collateral is an extra form of security that can be used as a source of repayment for your loan .
Most lenders will require collateral when you ’re getting a small business loan so they will be able to get their money back if you ’re not able to repay the amount borrowed .
You can use both business and personal assets to secure your loan .
Typically a lender will require the amount of collateral to be greater than the amount of your loan .
It ’s important to note that what the bank appraises your assets to be worth may be less than what you would value them at .
If you find yourself with less collateral than required , the bank may require you to have a co-signer .
Determining your collateral before you apply for a small business loan can help cut down on unexpected road blocks .
Avoid big purchases before applying
Before you apply for a small business loan , try to avoid making any big purchases that would require additional debt .
Lenders want to see that your current debt is manageable , and making a big purchase could increase your debt to earnings ratio which may hurt your chances of being approved for a business loan or line of credit .
So , hold off on buying a new house or a new car until after you have secured the funds needed to improve your business .
Perfect your business plan
When applying for a small business loan , you may be asked to provide a copy of your business plan or detail elements of your company in a financing request .
This will reassure your potential lender that you have carefully and strategically thought through the needs of running your own business .
A well - planned business model also shows an element of responsibility and could help your chances of being approved for a loan .
As you move forward and apply for a small business loan , consider your ability to support additional debt , your working capital needs , as well as the cost of your planned renovation , move or equipment to decide how much you will need from your lender .
A business loan calculator and working capital calculator can help you get started .
From there , schedule a meeting with your lender to discuss what will be required and what solutions are available for a business loan or line of credit .

The driver programmed the wrong Lille into the navigation system
Instead of arriving in Lille , France , 50 members of Cheltenham and Gloucester ( C&G ) Social Club were taken 98 miles ( 157 km ) away to Lille , Belgium .
When they finally arrived , they had two hours to shop before the stores closed .
The detour happened during a weekend coach trip from Gloucester to Ostend , Belgium , costing staff £ 150 .
Tim Knight , manager of Travelscope , the company which arranged the trip , said : " Part of the weekend trip was an afternoon shopping in Lille .
" Unfortunately the driver from the coach company we commissioned made a blunder on his satellite navigation . "
On the trip back to their hotel , the coach driver unplugged the navigation system and , with the help of a passenger and an atlas , made it back to Ostend .
C&G spokeswoman Melinda Russell , said : " We 're very sorry that our staff and their families have been let down , especially as we have enjoyed so many successful trips through the course of the year .
" Unfortunately , even the best laid plans can go awry , especially when relying on sat-nav . "
Clinton Camp Pre-Spinning Possible Bad News in Iowa Clinton reps say third - place in Iowa OK , while Romney boasts no scandals .
INDIANOLA , Iowa , Jan. 2 , 2008  --
As the presidential candidates engage in furious pre-caucus spin , one of Sen. Hillary Clinton 's most prominent Iowa supporters said Wednesday that she 's already accomplished what she needs to in Iowa and can declare success even if she finishes in third place .
Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack told ABC
News that Clinton has shown that she can appeal to a wide swath of Democrats , which is what she came to Iowa to do .
" She has done what she needed to do here , " Vilsack said shortly before a Clinton campaign event in Indianola .
" When she started the process she was way behind — it 's now by all standards a competitive race . "
Asked if the order of finish matters , Vilsack deflected the question .
" She absolutely had to be competitive , and she 's accomplished that , " he said .
" Obviously , everybody 's interested in winning , and I think we 're going to do well .
It 's tight .
There 's no question about that . "
Vilsack 's comments stand in marked contrast to optimistic predictions he has made in the past , including last May , when he endorsed Clinton 's candidacy .
In May , Vilsack was quoted in The Washington Post as saying , " There 's no question she 's playing in Iowa and playing to win . "
Vilsack dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year and endorsed Clinton . "
Vilsack 's comments reflect the widespread uncertainty — and the panicked dash to manage expectations — among both Democratic and Republican candidates as all candidates seek to close strong in the most wide - open set of caucuses in Iowa 's history .
Former Massachusetts Republican Gov. Mitt Romney used his last full day on the trail before Iowa to blast Clinton , suggesting that he would n't embarrass the nation with scandals — a not particularly veiled reference to the Clinton administration .
" We 'll try to represent ourselves and our nation well also to our kids , because I think kids watch the White House , and there have been failures in the past in the White House if you go back to the Clinton years and recognize that I think [ they ] had an enormous impact on the culture of our country , " Romney said on CNN .
" If we can't be perfect , we 'll do our best to uphold and to be a good example for the kinds of values I think people expect from our leaders . "
Thursday 's caucus results will clarify and almost certainly shrink the field of candidates .
The Democratic race is a three - way contest among Clinton , Sen. Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards to be first .
The Republican fight for first is among former Govs. Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney , with the battle for third place carrying almost equal importance .
As candidates crisscrossed the Hawkeye State in a final burst of campaigning , all three Democrats purchased television time across Iowa markets for Wednesday evening .
Edwards of North Carolina is using his 60 seconds of airtime to have an Iowa resident , who lost his job when a Maytag plant closed , talk about his first interaction with Edwards .
Edwards " grabbed my 7 - year - old son by the hand , he dropped to one knee , and he looked him straight in the eye and he said , ' I 'm going to keep fighting for your daddy 's job .
I promise you that . '
You know , that stuff sticks with you , " Doug Bishop , the laid - off worker , says in the ad .
" That 's the kind of things we need in a leader in this country , " Bishop said .
" I want a guy that 's going to sit down and look a 7 - year - old kid in the eye and tell him , ' I 'm going to fight for your dad 's job . '
That 's what I want . "
Edwards ' fiery rhetoric on the stump stands in sharp contrast to the sober , low - key close Clinton is offering Iowans .
" After all the town meetings , the pie and the coffee , it comes down to this :
Who 's ready to be president and ready to start solving the big challenges we face on Day 1 , and we can solve them , " Clinton says in her ad .
On the Republican side , Huckabee took an unorthodox approach to the final night before Iowa :
He 'll be on Jay Leno 's couch on the first episode of " The Tonight Show " to appear live since the writers ' strike .
Romney , R - Mass. , used that as an opportunity to take a swipe at his rival .
" He is more focused on the caucus in L.A. than the caucus in Iowa , " Romney told reporters .
Before leaving Iowa , Huckabee cast himself as the underdog , playing colonial revolutionary to Romney 's British Red Coats .
" At the beginning of this country , there were some farmers with muskets .
Nobody thought they could beat the British .
After all , the British were so well - financed .
And they had the nice long rifles , " Huckabee said .
" They had a magnificent Navy ; our guys had a few rowboats . "
Sen . John McCain , R - Ariz. , planned to return to Iowa Wednesday afternoon , taking a break from New Hampshire campaigning in an effort to snag third place .
The biggest surprise of the early episodes is the rural — agrarian , even — sequences .
Episode 1 spends a stoned time warp in the company of backlighted cows , while they mill around and chew cud .
This pastoral scene rolls to an industrial voiceover explaining dairy farms , and the sleepy chords of Joe Raposo ’s aimless masterpiece , “ Hey Cow , I See You Now . ”
Chewing the grass so green / Making the milk / Waiting for milking time / Waiting for giving time / Mmmmm .
Oh , what ’s that ?
Right , the trance of early “ Sesame Street ” and its country - time sequences .
In spite of the show ’s devotion to its “ target child , ” the “ 4 - year - old inner- city black youngster ” ( as The New York Times explained in 1979 ) , the first episodes join kids cavorting in amber waves of grain — black children , mostly , who must be pressed into service as the face of America ’s farms uniquely on “ Sesame Street . ”
In East Harlem and Bedford - Stuyvesant in 1978 , 95 percent of households with kids ages 2 to 5 watched “ Sesame Street . ”
The figure was even higher in Washington .
Nationwide , though , the number was n’t much lower , and was largely determined by the whims of the PBS affiliates : 80 percent in houses with young children .
The so - called inner city became anywhere that “ Sesame Street ” played , because the Children ’s Television Workshop declared the inner city not a grim sociological reality but a full - color fantasy — an eccentric scene , framed by a box and far removed from real farmland and city streets alike .
The concept of the “ inner city ” — or “ slums , ” as The Times bluntly put it in its first review of “ Sesame Street ” — was therefore transformed into a kind of Xanadu on the show : a bright , no -clouds , clear - air place where people bopped around with monsters and did n’t worry too much about money , cleanliness or projecting false cheer .
The Upper West Side , hardly a burned - out ghetto , was said to be the model .
People on “ Sesame Street ” had limited possibilities and fixed identities , and ( the best part ) you were n’t expected to change much .
The harshness of existence was a given , and no one was proposing that numbers and letters would lead you “ out ” of your inner city to Elysian suburbs .
Instead , “ Sesame Street ” suggested that learning might merely make our days more bearable , more interesting , funnier .
It encouraged us , above all , to be nice to our neighbors and to cultivate the safer pleasures that take the edge off — taking baths , eating cookies , reading .
Do n’t tell the kids .
Points of Entry
Caveat teletor : Volumes 1 and 2 of “ Sesame Street : Old School ” are available on DVD , which you can sample and buy on Sesameworkshop.org .
With a few episodes , extras and celebrity appearances by the likes of Richard Pryor and Lou Rawls , “ Old School ” sounds harmless enough .
But are you ready to mainline this much ’ 70s nostalgia ?
The Way Old : YouTube is great for performance art .
If 1969 is not far back enough for you , how ’s 1935 ?
The Oscar - winning short film “ How to Sleep , ” by the Algonquin Round - Tabler Robert Benchley , can be found here in sumptuous black - and - white ; search for his name and the film ’s title on YouTube .
Come of Age : Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick , the men of “ My So - Called Life ” and “ thirtysomething , ” have at last introduced their online - only young - adult series , “ Quarterlife . ”
It started Nov. 11 on MySpaceTV.com , and it marks the first time a network - quality series — a long indie film , really — has been produced directly for the Internet .

The gray plaza in front of Shenyang ’s century - old gothic cathedral is largely abandoned on this Sunday morning , the church ’s twin spires separated from a bustling shopping district by a crusty wrought - iron fence that does nothing to keep out the thump of Chinese hip - hop blaring from nearby storefronts .
From a bunker - like convent beside the cathedral , the Catholic seat of northeast China ’s Liaoning Province , a nun in a calf - length habit rushes toward me .
Sister Fabian Han Fengxia , 36 , wears wire - rimmed glasses and a shiny silver medallion that signifies her place among the diocese ’s community of 93 nuns .
“ We are very busy these days , ” she says , firmly shaking my hand .
“ Many new clients . ”
These particular clients are 68 mostly gay HIV - positive residents of Shenyang , an industrial metropolis of 7 million people .
“ The gay community is where the disease is here , ” she tells me .
“ So we work with them . ”
Sister Fabian directs a program that provides all manner of support for HIV - positive men and women , such as emergency funds , job training , medical services at the diocesan clinic — and even house calls .
Though most of the clients are in Shenyang , Fabian and the other sisters also tend to a rural village of farmers infected during a blood collection drive in the 1990s .
Officially , it ’s estimated that there are more than 650,000 HIV - positive people in China ( unofficially , the number is thought to exceed 1 million ) , with Liaoning home to 3,000 of them , according to Fabian .
China ’s Ministry of Health says that between 2.5 and 6.5 percent of China ’s gay men are infected , and the number is growing ; these days , the ministry records an average of 3,000 new cases per month .
While it ’s not unusual for the Catholic church to assist HIV - infected men and women — according to the Pontifical Council on Health Care , Catholic organizations provide a quarter of HIV - related services worldwide — it ’s quite unique that a church should work so closely with an organized gay community .
Such alignments are rare in other parts of the world , where Rome ’s canonical view of homosexuality as “ contrary to the natural law ” often sets the agenda .
Yet in China , where the church was persecuted and cut - off from mainstream Catholicism for more than half of the last century , a more progressive and independent perspective has arisen .
Fabian is certainly aware of Rome ’s views .
But she says she is unmoved by the prejudices of others .
“ We help whoever needs our help , ” she says .
“ We do n’t differentiate between gay men and poor farmers . ”
Fabian leads me to a cramped , cubicle - divided , fluorescent - lit office where her two assistants , Sister Catherine and Sister Peter , report that a client is having difficulty applying a salve to sores on his back .
“ He uses a chopstick to do it because he can’t reach , ” Fabian sighs .
“ He does n’t want his family to know that he is sick . ”
Later that afternoon , she will ride her bicycle for an hour to his home and help with the medicine .
In China , AIDS is highly stigmatized — associated as it is with sex workers , drug users , and those of generally low character — to the point where it ’s often impossible even to discuss with blood relatives .
The three sisters all know of families broken apart or ostracized after an HIV - positive diagnosis .
When Fabian took the helm of the diocese ’s program in 2005 , she and the other sisters struggled with their own prejudices against gay men .
“ We all thought they had a psychological problem or something bad happened in their family that changed their sex behavior , ” she explains .
“ But time after time , you begin to understand and love them .
Really love them . ”
Raised in a non-religious family , Fabian joined the convent at age 21 after she “ ran away ” from a dead - end sales job in 1992 .
“ I did n’t know anywhere else to go , ” she laughs .
The sisters offered to send her to medical school and in 1996 , after graduating with honors , she established a clinic for Shenyang ’s priests and sisters .
Two years later , she expanded the clinic to provide free services to the city ’s poor .
“ Perhaps that ’s a calling , ” she remarks offhandedly .
When pressed to explain further , she snaps , “ Maybe you think I ’m a lovely person , but my colleagues think otherwise . ”
Referencing a deep strain of impatience and a quick temper , she finally adds , “ I do it because I love the people . ”
In 2003 , with the help of the Catholic Maryknoll order in New York , Sister Fabian enrolled in a two - year course at Fordham University and earned her Masters of Arts in pastoral care .
Not long after her return to China , the diocesan leadership placed her in charge of its AIDS program which , at that point , lacked clients from Shenyang ’s gay population .
“ At first , ” Fabian says , “ they were suspicious of us because of what they ’d heard about the Church in the past . ”
But with the assistance of Sisters Peter and Catherine , she aggressively pursued a relationship .
She offered frank advice on risk prevention , speaking to any group or meeting that would have her , and perfected what appears to be the city ’s first and only HIV support groups , where clients discuss practical topics such as nutrition .
“ They do n’t really share their feelings or their conditions , ” she explains .
“ It ’s not very Chinese to do so . ”
The turning point for the program came in late 2005 .
A man dying of AIDS had been abandoned by his family and was alone .
So the sisters cared for the man , and after his death , washed and prepared his body for the funeral .
“ From that point , ” Fabian says , “ trust developed .
We became very close . ”
Now , HIV - positive people who ca n’t or wo n’t go anywhere else seek out Sister Fabian , who is known to be not only sympathetic but adept at negotiating China ’s formidable medical bureaucracies ( though illegal , many healthcare facilities refuse to treat HIV - positive patients ) .
Two years ago , in cooperation with Shenyang ’s two largest gay - rights organizations , Fabian arranged to have 250 men tested for HIV at a remote site , and though she concedes that “ the only ones who came were those who wanted to prove to their partners that they did n’t have it , ” she is proud of the accomplishment .
In August , when a destitute gay man in Dalian was dismissed from his hospital bed because of his HIV - positive status , Fabian arranged for and even financed his treatment from her program budget .
“ I asked the [ Dalian ] gay community leader to come with me , ” she recalls .
“ And he did , ” making for an unusual paring in modern China .
After spending the afternoon in Fabian ’s office , viewing a formidable collection of slides and documents , she and I walk to Changzhi ’s Farmer Food , a tiny restaurant dominated by a plastic tree trunk and hanging branches so that it resembles a tree house .
Fabian orders a large bowl of tofu in a salty sauce , spicy eggplant , and mushroom soup .
In speaking of Chinese religious life , she says solemnly , “ The roles for sisters are changing so fast .
It makes it hard to know the proper course . ”
When we ca n’t finish the food , she asks for boxes .
“ So much pressure these days , ” she offers .
Later , at the cathedral gate , she gives the leftovers to the guards .
That letter was followed up by a letter in May 1998 to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Newt Gingrich .
From this and other lobbying came the Iraq Liberation Act.
Calling for " regime change " and the establishment of a democracy in Iraq , it was passed with the broad support of congressional Republicans and all but a few Democrats , and signed into law by President Clinton in October .
As consequence , the U.S. was soon funneling millions of dollars to the Iraqi National Congress run by an exile named Ahmed Chalabi .
Despite the massive four - day bombing campaign of Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 , however , the PNACers got nowhere near what they wanted from Clinton , the overthrow of Saddam Hussein .
Still an advocacy - group in obscurity , these fanatics were going a good deal further than writing letters and twisting arms .
On their minds was the development of a blueprint for global domination .
In 2000 , as part of an effort to influence the foreign policy debate during the presidential campaign , they published a white paper titled Rebuilding America 's Defenses : Strategy , Forces and Resources For a New Century ( pdf ) that argued for massively increasing defense spending and developing the capacity to fight several major wars simultaneously .
That same year , William Kristol and Robert Kagan edited Present Dangers : Crisis and Opportunity in American Foreign and Defense Policy ( pdf ) , , with one chapter by Richard Perle , " The Prince of Darkness , " called " Iraq : Saddam Unbound . "
The imperialist dreams and strategies expressed in these manifestoes can be traced back to ideas contained in the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance , a document written by Paul Wolfowitz and his deputy , I. Lewis Libby , in the office of then - Secretary of Defense Cheney .
After being leaked to excoriating reviews in the press , President H.W. Bush ordered it to be rewritten and toned down .
Eight years later , on October 11 , 2000 , in the second debate with Al Gore , George W. Bush seemed to be on the same page as his father when he said he wanted a " humble " foreign policy in the Middle East , one which rebuilds the anti-Iraq coalition of the Gulf War .
Exactly two months later , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5 - 4 to plop Mister Bush into the Oval Office .
Soon , several members of PNAC were highly placed inside the executive branch , including Dick Cheney , the self - selected Vice President ; his chief of staff and national security advisor , I. Lewis Libby ; Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz at Defense ; Richard Armitage , John Bolton and Paula Dobriansky at State ; and Elliott Abrams on the National Security Council .
Shortly before Rumsfeld took over at Defense , the work of the second so - called Rumsfeld Commission was released .
The first , in 1998 , had dealt with ballistic missile defense .
This new document called for a deepening of the militarization of space and reiterated for that arena the PNAC answer for everything : American supremacy and control backed up by unilaterally applied lethal force .
While the neo-conservatives in the first few months of the Cheney - dominated Bush Administration pondered global and extraterrestrial hegemony , they ignored the ideas for counter - terrorism found in the Hart - Rudman Report and rejected the entreaties of counter - terrorism adviser Richard Clarke to pay attention to Osama bin Laden .
Instead , they talked about Iraq and how to achieve what the first Bush administration had left unfinished , bringing down Saddam Hussein .
When the Towers fell on September 11 , 2001 , they lost no time in pressing the case .
On September 20 , with many of their number already highly placed in the executive branch , PNAC sent a letter to Mister Bush :
We agree with Secretary of State Powell ’s recent statement that Saddam Hussein " is one of the leading terrorists on the face of the Earth .... "
It may be that the Iraqi government provided assistance in some form to the recent attack on the United States .
But even if evidence does not link Iraq directly to the attack , any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq .
Failure to undertake such an effort will constitute an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism .
It was scarcely needed .
Within five hours of the attack on New York City and Washington , D.C. , Rumsfeld had already ordered his aides to begin preparing attacks on Iraq .
While divisions within the administration delayed the invasion for 19 months , the wheels had been set in motion .
Within a year PNAC ’s ideas were encapsulated in the Bush Doctrine , with Iraq the first real - world test .
All the real evidence showing Saddam Hussein had no connection to the 9/11 attacks was useless against the concocted evidence the administration and its leading PNACers arrayed against doubters at home and abroad .
Now , 10 years after PNAC made its case to Bill Clinton , Iraq is in shambles , with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead , millions wounded , and millions displaced or in exile .
The most basic amenities Iraqis had access to under their cruel dictatorship , including reliable electricity , have vanished .
Meanwhile , U.S. foreign policy is a heap of smoking wreckage , its diplomacy mistrusted and in disarray , its military weakened .
The families of 3934 dead and tens of thousands of wounded and mentally traumatized American soldiers face a lifetime brutally changed by the arrogance , greed and authoritarian proclivities of fanatics who thought post - Republican Rome was a good model for America today .
The experience in Iraq , the forced departure of Rumsfeld , the criminal prosecution of Libby , the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran , the partial awakening of the traditional media , and the lame - duck period associated with any president in his final year of office have all done their part to weaken the neo-conservatives .
They ’ve disconnected the phones at the PNAC offices .
But nobody has yet put a stake through the hearts of these men and women who began their ascent to power nearly 30 years ago and have so far avoided prison .
So where are the 18 who signed that letter a decade ago ?

Judge whether good enough hit S.H. [ Saddam Hussein ] at same time .
Not only UBL [ Osama bin Laden ] .
Dec. 11 , 2007  -- Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , is the only Republican presidential candidate who says we need to get our troops out of Iraq now , and that we never should have invaded Iraq at all .
The United States should not be the " world 's policeman , " said Paul .
" It 's OK for us to have a responsibility , personally , to help other people … [ but ] to go around the world and spread democracy and spread our goodness , no .
I think it does n't work … too many unintended consequences , and , to spread our goodness overseas , it usually requires force .
" We 're spreading our goodness in Iraq , [ and ] we can't do that without dropping bombs on them and killing a lot of people . "
I pointed out to him that many people say , " If we do n't attack the enemy over there , then they 'll attack us here . "
Paul argued that the opposite is true , that America having bases overseas is what inspires hatred against the United States , especially American bases in areas that many Muslims view as holy .
He also said he does n't view suicide terrorism as a solely religious issue .
" The country that has the most suicide terrorism is Sri Lanka , and it 's not a Muslim issue . …
The two most radical Islamic countries in the world , Iran and Sudan , do not commit suicide terrorism , so that is not the litmus test ; the litmus test is whether they interpret , or we are actually occupying a territory that they resent , [ and ] in the case of Saudi Arabia , that was holy land for them .
" If China were to do the same thing to us , and they were here , and they had troops in our land , and they said they were going to protect their oil … we would resent it , we 'd probably do some shooting , " he said .
As far as the threat of Middle Eastern countries acquiring nuclear weapons , Paul said , " It 's the lack of diplomacy that is the greatest threat , not the weapons themselves . "
I asked him if war is ever justifiable .
" Sure , " he said .
" If you 're attacked , you have a right and an obligation to defend our country , and the Constitution is very clear on that .
…
I do not believe there is ever a moral justification to start the war . "
By that reasoning , he said , World War II was justifiable , because the United States was attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor .
The Korean War ?
" Totally unjustified , " he said .
The Vietnam War ?
" A horror , " he said .
And the Gulf War in Iraq ?
" A border dispute , " he said .
" Not our business . "
He said he voted for the authority to invade Afghanistan after Sept. 11 , because we were pursuing those who had attacked us .
However , he has been unhappy with what 's happened since then .
" We neglected to pursue Osama bin Laden . "
And voting for the authority to invade Afghanistan " did not mean that they had the authority to occupy and try to transform Afghanistan . "
When I pointed out that many say the surge in Iraq is now succeeding , Paul called that view " propaganda , " and said he receives more donations from active military personnel than any other presidential candidate , because those soldiers " see it more from [ his ] viewpoint . "
If elected , Paul would work to pull American troops not just out of the Middle East but out of Korea , Germany and the 100 other countries where American troops are currently stationed .
" Under the Constitution , we do n't have the authority to put troops in foreign countries , willy - nilly , when we 're not at war … [ and ] we can't afford it anymore — we 're going broke .
We 're on the verge of doing what all great empires have done in the past — spread themselves too far wide around the world . "
What about sending our military forces to prevent genocide and terrible human suffering ?
" I think it 's a tragedy , and we can have a moral statement , but you can't use force of arms to invade other countries to make them better people .
Our job is to make us a better people . "

The motto of the CRTC , Canada ’s telcom regulator is “ Communications in the Public Interest ” .
Right .
If you live in Canada , write to your MP .
The CRTC , as an institution , needs to be taken out and shot . *
This chart charts the best rates available from all carriers .
And all levels of government say that “ ICT ” competitiveness is key factor in Canada ’s future economic
prosperity .
Ya. Right .
I would like to say that Canada is a 3rd world country when it comes to Mobile ICT , except you can clearly see from this chart that even * Rwanda * has orders of magnitude better Mobile Data service than Canada .
As I ’ve noted in the chart , 500MB is about 100 minutes of usage at a Canadian Carrier ’s maximum ( advertised ) download speed of 700 kB / s ( your mileage will vary , International carriers are typically twice or four times faster ) .
500 MB is not a lot of data in the grand scheme of things , a few GB could make a better example but in that case the red bars would be completely off the charts .
If you do n’t live in Canada but you or your small business depends on mobile connectivity or net neutrality in general , do n’t come here .
If see these numbers makes you mad , then Digg this article and spread the word on your site .
( and leave a comment , what is mobile service like where you live ?
why do you think mobile data is important ? )
Here is the complete data table including data speed and Caps for each of the services listed .
You ’ll notice Canadian carriers lag substantially in every category .

Says We Put ' Too Much Stock ' Into Something That Is Often Wrong As Was The Case In New Hampshire
Guest Keyllyanne Conway Concurs And Points Out That Exit Polls Were Also Wrong In The 2000 And 2004 Presidential Elections ...
A Funny Little Story About Suharto
Indonesia 's former dictator Suhato , one of the 20th century 's greatest butchers , is dead at 86 .
This reminds me of a funny story !
When Suharto was falling from power during 1998 , I listened to an NPR show on Indonesia .
It was hosted by the father of someone with whom I 'd gone to high school .
The guests and the host spoke about Indonesian history , but made no mention of the " staggering mass slaughter " after Suharto took over in 1965 , nor of the US support for all of it .
Then someone called in and asked why they had n't .
Specifically the caller spoke of how the US embassy had given the Indonesian military lists of thousands of members of the communist party , so they could be more efficiently killed .
The host found all this preposterous and scoffed .
In particular he wanted to know how the caller had gotten the ridiculous idea that the US had handed over death lists .
I do n't know where the caller had gotten that idea , but I know where I 'd gotten it : from a book on Indonesia I checked out from a library THREE BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE HOST'S HOUSE .
Of course , you can't really fault the host for not knowing about this .
He was only a New York Times reporter and graduate of Harvard , so no one had ever taught him how to read .
Also , if I remember correctly , Lyndon Johnson had attended his wedding ... which must have been during the same period as the coup , when Johnson was making decisions that led to the hundreds of thousands of people being shot and / or hacked to death with machetes .
You can see how you might not want to find out you 're the kind of person who has friends like that .
In any case , I 've long planned on the day of Suharto 's death to listen to a version of " How Can I Keep From Singing ? " from the Eva Cassidy album Eva by Heart .
And someone 's made a little youtube slideshow using it as a soundtrack , so you can listen too , especially the part about tyrants trembling with fear :

If you do n't vote in February for what you believe in , you wo n't get to vote for it in November
OPINION
At a recent Potrero Hill Democratic Club presidential forum , when the representatives of Hilary Clinton , John Edwards , and Barack Obama spoke more about how the candidates made them feel than about their positions on the issues , it first struck me as strange .
Eventually , though , their approach made sense — I realized these people were n't necessarily all that hot about their candidates ' actual policies .
In defending their health care programs , for instance , the Clinton and Obama reps tacitly acknowledged that a single - payer plan was superior to their candidates ' offerings , while the Edwards spokesperson cautioned the audience against seeking a candidate who believed everything they believed .
Maybe it 's the lack of distinct seasons in San Francisco or something , but these people seemed confused about the difference between voting in a primary and in a final election .
November is the month when you vote for what you have to vote for ; in February you can vote for what you believe in .
In November the halfhearted health plan of one of these candidates , which would continue siphoning scarce public funds away from health services and into the coffers of the private health insurance industry , will likely be superior to whatever scheme the Republican nominee offers up .
But in the February primary you can actually vote for Dennis Kucinich 's single - payer plan .
Logically , we might ask why any of these front - running candidates who wo n't pledge to have all American troops out of Iraq by the end of their first term should expect much support in San Francisco , arguably the nation 's most antiwar city .
Why would anyone who opposes this war not back a candidate like Kucinich , who calls for complete troop withdrawal within three months ?
Or why , for that matter , would voters who support gay marriage not also back Kucinich , a gay - marriage supporter himself ?
Well , when I appear as a Kucinich representative at election forums , people answer those questions for me all the time in postmeeting conversations .
They and their friends believe in what Kucinich says , they often tell me , but " he can't win , " so they 'll vote for someone who they think can .
Now let 's be honest here and admit that those of us who get worked up about peace and justice issues are prone to complain a lot .
We are ever bemoaning the influence of money in politics and the poor job the news media do in covering the real issues .
But when we get to the point where a candidate is raising the important issues and we know we agree with him and we still wo n't vote for him , then the next time we start complaining , it may just be time to look in the mirror .
Casting a vote against the war in Iraq is a lot easier than marching against it or even writing a letter .
But if antiwar voters wo n't vote for antiwar candidates , you have to ask why those candidates should go to the trouble of running and why the big - money candidates should pay any attention to the supposed antiwar vote .
Whatever else happens in this election , one thing is certain : if you do n't vote in February for what you believe in , you wo n't get to vote for it in November .
And then there will be no one else to blame . *

The Anonymity Experiment
During a week of attempting to cloak every aspect of daily life , our correspondent found that in an information age , leaving no trace is nearly impossible
Here ’s an interesting image released today captured by NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
It ’s of an unnamed crater on Mars in the Terra Cimmeria region that could contain ancient deposits of chloride salts .
The region is one of the most geologically interesting on Mars .
It ’s riddled with impact craters , crisscrossed by dried up river channels , and sculpted by wind .
Water probably acted on the region a long time ago , building up the salt deposits .
This region of Mars is of great interest to scientists .
Three separate missions have studied the area in great detail : Mars Global Surveyor , Mars Odyssey , and now the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
Over the years , they have shown how these small deposits of chloride salts are scattered across the Martian surface .
They ’re more widely found in the Noachian ( most ancient ) regions , and less found in the Hesperian ( middle geologic time ) terrain .
This means that the deposits were probably laid down in the earliest epochs of Martian history , and then later geologic processes resurfaced them .
This image , captured by the HiRISE instrument on NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows one of these deposits .
The photograph reveals an area about 900 metres across , including a partially buried unnamed crater in Terra Cimmeria .
The chloride salt deposits in this photograph are the lighter toned colour .
The deposits are relatively thin and occur in low lying areas .
This one has been heavily eroded , which suggests that it ’s very old .

Dennis Kucinich 's statement to the Iranian - American Community
Dennis Kucinich
11/26/07
Dear Friend ,
As you know , I have been the leading voice in the United States Congress for peaceful relations with Iran .
I have repeatedly challenged the Administration 's ill - advised and polarizing approach .
America needs a healing hand in the White House .
I intend to reopen diplomatic relations with Iran and meet with Iran 's leaders to begin a new era of peace .
I am also challenging the build up to war against Iran .
It would be a great tragedy for the world , for the Iranian people and for America if the United States government moved forward with military action against Iran .
I am dedicated to averting any conflict against Iran .
My election as President will mean a new direction and a new hope for America and our role in the world .
Thank you for joining me in this effort .
Best wishes ,
Dennis

Whether it 's research results , strategies for development , product information , client data or budget plans -- business secrets of successful companies are increasingly becoming coveted by industrious spies .
The spies , said Elmar Remberg , deputy chief of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( Germany 's domestic intelligence agency ) , come from the former republics of the Soviet Union , but primarily , from China .
" China is intensively collecting information around the world -- political , military and scientific data , and company strategies in order close the gap in their technology developments as quickly as possible , " Remberg said .
Current studies show that around 40 percent of German companies fall prey to industrial espionage .
Furthermore , expertise worth up to 50 billion euros ( $ 74 billion ) is at risk , according to the studies .
The target of the espionage are primarily nano and armament technologies , as well as that involving transportation , environment and energy .
Mid-sized businesses especially at risk
Computer systems are particularly at risk
Andreas Blume , who is responsible for protecting new scientific findings at the chemicals company Evonik - Degussa , said small and mid-sized companies that are leaders in their field are especially at risk .
He said he is often approched at seminars , workshops and conferences .
" Alarm bells should go off whenever someone is willing to pay for your flight , accommodations or entertainment , " Blume said .
" But a lot of mid-sized companies are blinded by the generous offerrs and later , they 've given away their information . "
Blume is also familiar with some of the tricks the intelligence services use : supposed document shredders that are actually equipped with internal shredders and UMTS transmitters , beamers that record presentations and USB sticks with so - called Trojan Horse programs that allow hackers to spy on computers .
According to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution , Chinese case officers go undercover and work as journalists and diplomats in Germany , or visit trade fairs and companies with delegations .
Insiders pose major threat
Employees often pass on too much information
Leaks from inside firms are increasing in number -- companies that take on interns from abroad are at risk , for example .
Hansjörg Fromm , director of the IBM European Center for Business Optimization in Germany , said he seen studies that show that in 2005 , more than a third of assaults on security are due to breaches among employees of companies .
Former employees and partners were responsible for 28 percent , he said .
" Abuse can come in many forms , " Fromm said .
" And as our firewalls , virus protection devices , passwords and biometic access portals become more refined , so too do the spies .
They find ever cleverer ways of getting around things . "
More and more e-mail spying
Internet - based assaults from outside are also increasing .
Recent reports that attacks on German government computers came from China have been confirmed , said Remberg of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution .
German government confirmed electronic attacks stemming from China
" Since 2005 , we have been finding such e-mail - based electronic attacks on German government offices and companies , " Remberg said .
" These are pursued with incredible intensity ; currently , an attack is detected every one to two days . "
E-mails can contain spy programs that automatically install themselves without the user noticing .
Collected information is then sent back over the Internet .
Often , the programs are so well - made , that even specialists cannot detect them .
And there are other weak points , said Michael Hange , deputy chief of the German Federal Office for Information Security .
" W - Lan and mobile communication are popular points of assault , " he said .
A company in Thailand , for instance , offers monitoring services of cell phone conversations .
" You only have to get a hold of your parnter 's cell phone and type in a few commands and then you can monitor all the calls , " Hange said .
Experts say , however , that there is no way to protect against industrial espionage one hundred percent .
They recommend that companies have a good IT security plan and stress that managers of companies must be more aware of the dangers .
Employees must also be trained , even if they are trusted .
Thin is a web server that glues together 3 of the best Ruby libraries in web history :
the Mongrel parser : the root of Mongrel speed and security
Event Machine : a network I/O library with extremely high scalability , performance and stability
Rack : a minimal interface between web servers and Ruby frameworks
Which makes it , with all humble humility , the most secure , stable , fast and extensible Ruby web server ever built , bundled in an easy to use gem for your own pleasure .
Why another web server ?
Thin started as an experiment to build an 100 % Ruby singled threaded server which ended up being as fast as Mongrel on some cases ( like handling Rails request ) .
But that was not enough .
Using the EventMachine library the performance and stability are now more impressive then a 500 pounds guy standing on one hand and juggling with the other .
It ’s less then 500 lines of clean and fully tested Ruby code plus the customized Mongrel parser ( written in C ) .
Faster then Mongrel ?
Yeah right !
Yes it is !
It ’s even faster then the patched version of Mongrel that uses EventMachine ( aka Evented Mongrel ) .
Try it
sudo gem install thin
Then in your Rails application directory :
thin start
You can also use it with any framework that support Rack .
More info on the usage page .
More alpha then the Greek letter
This is the first experimental release .
If you use this on your production server right now you are stupid , looking for extreme sensations or trying to find a way to get fired .
If you ’d like to help , have fun or report a bug , join me in the project Google Group and get the code :
git clone http://code.macournoyer.com/git/thin.git
Stay tuned for updates and releases !

Striking writers for The Colbert Report and The Daily Show masterminded a brilliant comedy mock - hearing on the Hollywood writers ' strike , including an arch ( and brilliant ) meta-moment where they disrupted their own hearing with nonsensical grandstanding from seeming participants .
On one side , in shirts , was the striking Writers Guild of America , played by " Daily Show " writers Rob Kutner , Tim Carvell and Jason Ross .
On the other side , in suits , was the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers , played by " The Colbert Report " writers Michael Brumm , Peter Grosz and Tom Purcell .
Crashing out of the starting gates , the shirts argued it would cost the suits less than 1 % of their total revenue to give the writers everything they wanted .
For Paramount Pictures , that comes to $ 4.6 million , or " half the amount it takes to get Reese Witherspoon into a movie . "
" I ask you , " one writer noted , " which is more important to a movie — a script , or half of Reese Witherspoon ? "
The studio suits thought for a second .
" Which half ? "
Romney is also quite unpopular among middle - and lower - middle class voters .
In poll after poll , he leads among Republicans making more than $ 75,000 a year .
He does poorly among those who make less .
If Romney is the general election candidate , he will face hostility from independent voters , who value authenticity .
He will face hostility from Hispanic voters , who detest his new immigration positions .
He will face great hostility in the media .
Even conservative editorialists at places like The Union Leader in New Hampshire and The Boston Herald find his flip - flopping offensive .
But his biggest problem is a failure of imagination .
Market research is a snapshot of the past .
With his data - set mentality , Romney has chosen to model himself on a version of Republicanism that is receding into memory .
As Walter Mondale was the last gasp of the fading New Deal coalition , Romney has turned himself into the last gasp of the Reagan coalition .
That coalition had its day , but it is shrinking now .
The Republican Party is more unpopular than at any point in the past 40 years .
Democrats have a 50 to 36 party identification advantage , the widest in a generation .
The general public prefers Democratic approaches on health care , corruption , the economy and Iraq by double - digit margins .
Republicans ’ losses have come across the board , but the G.O.P. has been hemorrhaging support among independent voters .
Surveys from the Pew Research Center and The Washington Post , Kaiser Foundation and Harvard University show that independents are moving away from the G.O.P. on social issues , globalization and the roles of religion and government .
If any Republican candidate is going to win this year , he will have to offer a new brand of Republicanism .
But Romney has tied himself to the old brand .
He is unresponsive to the middle - class anxiety that Huckabee is tapping into .
He has forsaken the trans - partisan candor that McCain represents .
Romney , the cautious consultant , is pivoting to stress his corporate competence , and is rebranding himself as an Obama - esque change agent , but he will never make the sort of daring break that independent voters will demand if they are going to give the G.O.P. another look .
The leaders of the Republican coalition know Romney will lose .
But some would rather remain in control of a party that loses than lose control of a party that wins .
Others have n’t yet suffered the agony of defeat , and so are not yet emotionally ready for the trauma of transformation .
Others still simply do n’t know which way to turn .
And so the burden of change will be thrust on primary voters over the next few weeks .
Romney is a decent man with some good fiscal and economic policies .
But in this race , he has run like a manager , not an entrepreneur .
His triumph this month would mean a Democratic victory in November .
The topic of Net neutrality is a sensitive one .
The forces on either side of the mightily contentious divide have long been wielding their torches and various sharp - edged gardening devices .
Unfortunately , the advocates of an equality - driven , unbiased platform upon which various networks ( the Verizons , the Comcasts , etc. ) would continue to build , compete , and serve their users , have taken a significant beating in recent months .
There have been several points at which federal and state representatives have been convinced by the corporations of the need to erect a system by which operators would be allowed to offer preferential treatment for data transmission .
The telecommunications providers ’ official reasoning : the continuation of Net neutrality would eventually cause digital gridlock .
( Also , there ’s been the mention of a desire for increased profits . )
Even as recent as yesterday , word from one of the largest of American ISPs , Comcast , was presented in defense of Internet filtration .
The company has essentially stated its devotion to filters and other measures to ensure things go swimmingly upon its network .
Well , shortly following Comcast ’s open pledge to remain a bugger of a control freak , US House representative Ed Markey , along with Chip Pickering , officially introduced “ bipartisan legislation to help preserve Internet freedom and explicitly make “ Net neutrality ” a guiding principle of U.S. broadband policy . ”
( Google later delivered its admiration for the Markey - Pickering proposal in its Public Policy Blog .
The Mountain View giant is all about keeping the Web open and uber - competitive .
That is , after all , the basis upon which it went from plain Google to Big Google . )
I must say , it is about time that a legislator on Capitol Hill introduced a sensible policy proposal on the matter of Net neutrality .
After all , a level playing field is what the free market is purportedly intent on keeping in place .
How the non-neutral argument given by a number of ISPs went as far as it did is really very puzzling and disconcerting .
And I do very much hope a reversal of the present trend occurs reasonably soon .
It is of course necessary to keep in mind that this newly introduced legislation is only being championed by very small number of individuals .
Ed Markey and Chip Pickering do not constitute a supreme influence .
So whether Congress on the whole will be convinced to side with the pro-neutrality tribe in this case is something to ponder at great length .
But perhaps this move to raise the red flag will act as a catalyst to break the thick cloud of gloom that hovers over Silicon Valley - and even the nation in general .
We ’re well overdue for a bill that would greatly fortify the interests of the public , as well as innovators all around the technology industry .
Though it is much too early to say definitively how the winds will blow now , I have to tell you , my mood got a little boost of happy upon hearing this news .
How ‘ bout you ?

The whine of voracious liberals / Does the extremism of some progressives spell danger to delicious evolution ?
Well , yes
I hear it nearly every week in response to nearly any column that has anything to do with me daring to say I appreciate or admire or moderately wish to commend some sort of progressive movement or corporation or product , one that appears to be creating some sort of good in the world , moving things forward or upending the status quo or infuriating the religious right and making you think / shop / screw anew .
I get the e-mails .
And there is , by and large , a general outpouring of agreement , understanding , clarity .
There are also lots of healthy disagreement , discussion , valid points of contention .
There is the requisite tiny hunk of phlegmy , grunting hate mail from the turgid and the monosyllabic and the neoconservative .
Well and good and lovely .
But then there 's this other hunk , a surprisingly large and very whiny group of responders who invariably say something like this :
It does not matter that Company X has made impressive strides in environmental awareness or product design or gay rights or whatever the hell you 're talking about .
It does not matter that maybe you 're a little bit right and this is a slightly revolutionary thing you mention .
It is still not enough .
Company X has Serious Flaws .
Product Y still kills trees in Bangladesh .
CEO
Z hates kittens and wears fur mittens and once said something mean about transsexual midgets .
Therefore , you are completely wrong and I cannot believe you support this company / idea and this must mean you 're a capitalist idiot Audi- driving hypocrite and I 'm never reading your column again .
Unless I do .
So there .
Specific example ?
Sure .
I recently wrote a big pile of words in tentative but still enthusiastic praise of the Whole Foods juggernaut , a fascinating and innovative mega - grocer led by an equally fascinating , contradictory jerk / genius of a chief executive , John Mackey , half cutthroat libertarian mega- capitalist and half spiritual yoga - loving employee - supporting industry - upending revolutionary .
Here 's where it got ugly :
While most readers generally agreed ( or thoughtfully disagreed ) with my assessment that the positive changes Whole Foods is forcing upon the otherwise rather toxic American grocery universe far outweighed the scattershot negatives , a significant chunk were , if not furious , at least sneering and bitter and dissatisfied , wailing to me that , oh my God , did n't I know John Mackey is , for example , anti-union ?
( Well , yes , I did . )
Well then , did n't I know he used questionable business tactics to buy out Wild Oats ?
Did n't I know Whole Foods has shoved some mom ' n ' pop grocers out of business and did n't I know some small organic farmers do n't like their buying power and did n't I know that not everything they offer is totally organic and by the way have n't I noticed their stores are staffed by way too many grungy sullen tattooed hipsters and are n't tattoos and nose rings totally ugly and gross ?
Uh , sure .
And finally , did n't I know that this one time Reader X got some horrible customer service and Reader Y once encountered snooty patrons and Reader Z can't believe I like them given that they sell bananas imported all the way from Guatemala and therefore Whole Foods is detestable and hateful and blah and blah and blah ?
It was like reading a stack of letters from your nasty , drunk hippie grandparents .
It was like having a potential lover suddenly slap you for no reason and then tell you their laundry list of impossible needs and STD precautions and all the reasons you can never touch them again , despite how you never really wanted to in the first place .
And here 's why : Such letters are all too similar in tone and attitude to the stance of the fundamentalist Christian right , the bitter and perpetually unsatisfied throngs for whom no behavioral law is strict enough and no relationship is unhappy enough and no repressed homosexual desire is self - hating enough .
Let 's compare .
Because I also recently wrote a piece in celebration of the glorious downfall of the Godmongers in America , the end ( at least for now ) of the radical Christian right 's influence over a wary and dogma - stomped society .
I cheered the collapse of the insufferable " family values " fundamentalist groups that , until recently , controlled much of Congress and yanked Bush 's puppet strings and have done so much damage to women and gays and science and love and sex and hope , lo , these past seven years .
( Check that : 2,000 years .
But that 's another column . )
The reason for their glorious collapse ?
Insatiable zealotry .
The fact that , no matter how far to the right BushCo shoved this nation , for this hardcore base of fear - drunk evangelicals , it was never enough .
They want nothing short of the complete destruction of gay culture , abortion rights , the end of the separation of church and state .
They want , in short , absolute sexual , ideological , and moral lockdown .
To which I responded : Yay !
Because ultimately , this sort of rabid zealotry spells certain defeat .
Such moronic groups have the seeds of their own destruction built right into their impossible worldviews .
Brutal absolutism is their one fatal flaw .
So long as it exists ( and it always has existed ) , progress and evolution will always win .
It 's an obvious parallel , to see an uber - progressive left that , while encompassing an entirely different ethos ( extreme openness and egalitarianism versus extreme clampdown and religious ignorance ) , still resonates with the same kind of impossible standards of behavior .
It 's like demanding that the whole world instantly turn into one big PETA rally .
There is just no way .
I mean , thank God .
Whole Foods is but one example .
I 've heard the same outcry when I praise , say , Apple product design ( which , I admit , is nearly always ) .
It happens when I suggest CFLs are a small but terrific environmental advancement ( but do n't I know they contain trace amounts of mercury and disposing of them might possibly be a problem in 10 years maybe ! ? )
And it happens , perhaps most disturbingly , when I write of fitful political progress .
It happens across the liberal political blogs , where otherwise well - informed , intelligent commentators will screech that they were once , say , a Barack Obama supporter , but then they heard him say one single thing that sounded " too political " or that was n't in exact accord with their pet issue of ( nukes / war / gays / health care / porn / medical marijuana ) , and hence they got all pissed and disgusted and now they hate hate hate Obama and are voting for Dennis Kucinich .
I mean , please .
On the one hand , I get it .
We want to hold progressive companies / people to a higher standard , especially if they want to market themselves as these high - concept change - the - world do - gooders .
We , as conscious , informed , progressive consumers have every goddamn right to keep their feet to the liberal fire , and what 's more , this zeal has often resulted in a given company / person responding positively .
( Ref : Apple 's impressive green initiative , Whole Foods working more closely with local farms , et al . )
But ultimately , this sort of excessive , all - or - nothing liberal zealotry will only result in the same dangerous fracturing as always befalls the extreme right .
Yes , it seems fairly obvious , but it bears repeating , over and over again , especially as Dems gain more political traction and we head into what will hopefully be a far more enlightened , juicy , and balanced era , where gays marry and wars end and dolphins dance and trees sing and President Jobs gives everyone an organic iPhone .
What , too extreme ?
Sorry .

Speaking as a proud asexual , Valentines Day means nothing to me , but apparently there are a lot of people who enjoy wasting their money on cards and furry animals as part of the complicated human mating game .
One important demographic which will not be around to celebrate Valentines Day 2008 is the dinosaurs .
According to reports , they are all dead .
This makes it extremely difficult to perform the most basic tasks , never mind buying gifts .
That 's why I 'd like to ask each and every one of you to enjoy the following images from our forum goons of dinosaur - inspired love notes , while keeping in mind that many species depicted in these contributions are no longer with us .
Unless they are hiding with Elvis and laughing it up at the fossils that the Illuminati planted .
The idea behind this article came from GeekGoddess and here are around one million efforts from that particular individual .
Greenpeace has sent a letter to Senator Barbara Boxer expressing their support for Friends of the Earth ( FoE ) effort calling on the Senate to Fix or Ditch the Lieberman - Warner Global Warming Bill .
Senator Boxer jabbed back at FoE
“ They ’re sort of the defeatist group out there .
They ’ve been defeatists from day one .
And it ’s unfortunate .
They ’re isolated among the environmental groups . ”
Well , Greenpeace ’s letter makes it clear that , contrary to Senator Boxer ’s statement , FoE does n’t stand alone .
I also strong disagree with your sentiment that Friends of the Earth stands isolated its position .
As I travel across the country , I meet people looking for leadership on this issue , but not just any leadership .
As ice caps continue to melt , seas continue to rise adn weather gets more and more extreme , they are not looking for government action simply for action ’s sake .
I find it difficult to locate any citizen concerned about global warming does does n’t want the same result as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace .
This letter is a strong endorsement of the FoE effort , calling on Senator Boxer to either Fix Lieberman - Warner or Ditch It .
This is an extremely well - written letter , one that speaks beyond the controversy of the day to larger principles .
It opens with a direct call to Senator Boxer ’s long - held positions re Global Warming .
I write to express my profound disappointment in your reaction to Friends of the Earth ’s Fix It or Ditch It campaign .
I was surprised to read your reaction because in my mind , their Fix It or Ditch
It campaign represents the principles I thought you stood for , having authored teh strongest climate bill in the Senate with Senator Bernie Sanders .
That bill , with its targets for 80 % reductions in US greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions from 1990 by 2050 , fit with core science .
It hits with what is viewed as minimum requirements to provide a 50 percent chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change , unlike the far weaker targets ( and other problems ) of the Lieberman - Warner Coal Subsidy Act .
The letter then turns to the political environment .
As you know , Friends of the Eart is correct in saying that both Democratic presidential candidates support porposals that would achieve significantly deeper emissions reductions than would the Lieberman - Warner bill .
In addition , both Democrats in the presidential race support auctioning 100 % of the allocations while avoiding the multi-hundred billion - dollar giveaway to the fossil fuel industry .
Starting from a position in the Democratic - led United States Senate that is well short of the Democrats running for president lowers instead of raises the bar on what will ultimately be passed and signed into law .
Senator Boxer argues that there is a requirement to test the waters , see where the votes lie when it comes to Global Warming legislation .
Is it normal practice to test one ’s feet with hotter waters ( e.g , in this case , less ) than what the ( next ) President would want to see come to the Oval Office ?
As per the first quotation , the letter than reinforces that Greenpeace stands with Friends of the Earth ( as do Americans across this country concerned with Global Warming ) in calling for the Senate to “ Fix It or Ditch It ” .
The letter concludes with a heartfelt appeal .
As your comittee works through thsi issue over the course of 2008 and beyond , it is my sincere hope that y ou will will , in fact , Fix It or Ditch It .
That you will lead your colleagues to “ fix ” any proposal that falls short of the emissions reductions that scientists say are required to avoid the impending climate crisis .
That you will work to “ ditch ” any proposal that gives away hundreds of billions of dollars to the fossil fuel industry .
And , that you will be driven by the need to protect the planet for future generations , instead of protecting profits for the fossil fuel industry .
“ Fix ” the bill to make sure that it meets the science .
“ Ditch ” absurd subsidies and giveaways to serial polluters , who have poisoned our airs and seas for free for far too long .
And , yes , think seven generations for all humanity , rather than seven years for the balance sheets for Exxon - Mobil and Peabody Energy , in your deliberations .
And , Madame Chairperson , if you take this path ,
We stand ready to support you in these efforts .

To some , the term “ trophy wife ” connotes an enviable achievement , while to others it 's an idiomatic synonym for “ idiot . ”
The contradictory connotations that riddle the following definition probably please both sides :
Trophy wife :
The ( rarely first ) wife of an affluent ( often older ) man who is ( often younger and ) exceptionally ( more ) attractive ( than he is ) .
Prevailing synonyms include : gold digger , socialite , shopaholic , secret envy of countless women , and object of feminist scorn .
However interpreted , the customary concept of marriage based strictly on romantic love is both young and narrow .
Historically , people have gotten married for a wide variety of reasons — social , economical , political , professional — so the trophy wife has plenty of precedence .
Evaluate the pros and cons
The decision to pursue a trophy wife should involve a good degree of deliberation weighed across a number of different scales .
Core traits
Beyond personal preferences , you should consider certain traits indispensable :
Education :
She should be college - educated and hold a degree .
Unless she ’s somehow self - made , avoid dropouts — particularly from high school .
Charm :
As your wife , ally and other half , she ’ll accompany you to any number of events ; her social skills ought to be anywhere from above - average to electric .
Looks :
By definition , this is a given .
Ambition :
You ’re ambitious ; how much respect do you have for people who are n’t ?
You may not want her taking over your business , but neither do you want her taking the concept of “ day bed ” seriously .
Lower this standard for your mistress , not your wife .
She may be hot , but she also comes with her own set of flaws …
Laws to protect the Sumatran tiger are failing to prevent body parts of the critically endangered animal from being sold openly in Indonesia , according to a report released today .
Body parts including canine teeth , claws , skin pieces , whiskers and bones were found on sale in one in 10 of the 326 retail outlets in 28 cities and towns across Sumatra that were surveyed during 2006 by the wildlife trade monitoring body , Traffic .
Its report , The Tiger Trade Revisited in Sumatra , found tiger parts being sold in goldsmiths , souvenir and traditional Chinese medicine shops , and shops selling antique and precious stones .
Trade was concentrated in Medan , the capital of North Sumatra province , and Pancur Batu , a smaller town nearby , the report found .
Based on the number of teeth on sale , the survey estimates that 23 tigers were killed to supply the products found .
Traffic says this figure is down from its last survey in 1999 - 2000 , which estimated that there were 52 tigers killed per year for the trade in body parts .
" Sadly , the decline in availability appears to be due to the dwindling number of tigers left in the wild , " said Julia Ng , programme officer with Traffic south - east Asia and lead author of the report .
" The Sumatran tiger population is estimated to be fewer than 400 to 500 individuals .
It does n't take a mathematician to work out that the Sumatran tiger will disappear like the Javan and Bali tigers if the poaching and trade continues . "
The Sumatran tiger is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN - World Conservation Union 's " red list " of threatened species – the highest level of threat that a species may become extinct in the wild .
Indonesia 's only wild tigers are found on the island of Sumatra .
Wild Bali and Javan tigers became extinct last century due to habitat destruction and hunting .
Despite international and domestic bans preventing trade of the animal , a thriving black market for tiger skins and bones is threatening to wipe out the world 's remaining wild tiger population .
Traffic says that despite providing Indonesian authorities with the details of traders involved , it is not clear whether any serious enforcement action has been taken .
" Successive surveys continue to show that Sumatran tigers are being sold , body part by body part , into extinction , " said Heather Sohl , wildlife trade officer at WWF , which runs Traffic as a joint programme with the IUCN .
" This is an enforcement crisis .
If Indonesian authorities need enforcement help from the international community they should ask for it .
If not , they should demonstrate they are taking enforcement seriously . "
The report recommends that resources and efforts should concentrate on effective enforcement to combat the trade by arresting dealers and suppliers .
It says trade hotspots should be continually monitored and all intelligence should be passed on to the authorities for action .
Those found guilty of trading in tigers and other protected wildlife " should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law " , it says .
" We have to deal with the trade .
Currently we are facing many other crucial problems which , unfortunately , are causing the decline of Sumatran tiger populations , " said Tonny Soehartono , the director for biodiversity conservation for Indoneia 's ministry of forestry .
" We have been struggling with the issues of land use changes , habitat fragmentation , human - tiger conflicts and poverty in Sumatra .
Land use changes and habitat fragmentation are driving the tiger closer to humans and thus creating human - tiger conflicts . "
Sumatra 's few remaining tigers are under threat not only from the illegal wildlife trade in their body parts , but from loss of their habitat due to deforestation .
Unless tackled immediately , these combined threats will be the " death knell " for Indonesian tigers , Traffic says .
" The Sumatran tiger is already listed as critically endangered , " said Jane Smart , the head of the IUCN 's species programme .
" We can not afford to lose any more of these magnificent creatures . "
At last year 's climate change summit in Bali , the Indonesian president launched a conservation action plan to protect the Sumatran tiger .
As it chairs this year 's Asean Widlife Enforcement Network , Traffic is urging Indonesia to show leadership in south - east Asia by taking action against the illegal wildlife trade .
COLUMBIA , S.C. ( AP )  Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama has moved a campaign rally with talk show host Oprah Winfrey to a football stadium that can hold more than 80,000 people , officials said Wednesday .
The Sunday event had been scheduled for an 18,000 - seat coliseum near the University of South Carolina campus , but the campaign ran out of the free tickets just two days after it began distributing them .
Tickets will no longer be needed .
" We wanted to make sure everyone in South Carolina who wanted to see Barack Obama and meet Oprah Winfrey had the opportunity , " said Inez Tenenbaum , an Obama supporter and former state schools superintendent .
" Everyone can attend who wants to attend . "
The campaign does n't expect to fill Williams - Brice Stadium , where college football coach Steve Spurrier and his Gamecocks play on fall Saturdays .
But with the attention the event has drawn , and temperatures forecast in the 70s , officials are expecting a large crowd .
Obama 's campaign said thousands of people called after the tickets for the coliseum all had been distributed .
" I have been called at my house , " Tenenbaum said .
" Everywhere I go , my friends say , ' I did n't get a ticket . " '
Doors will open at 12:30 p.m. and the program is to begin two hours later .
Winfrey also is to hold events with Obama in Iowa and New Hampshire .
Previous non-athletic events at Williams - Brice Stadium have included a mass by Pope John Paul II — the first pope to visit South Carolina — and the Billy Graham Crusade , both in 1987 , and Bob Hope 's " Salute to America " celebration in 1975 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A federal judge on Friday approved subpoenas for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and White House national security adviser Stephen Hadley in the case of two former pro-Israel lobbyists accused of disclosing national defense information .

U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis in Alexandria , Virginia , approved nearly all of the subpoenas the defense requested for current or former U.S. government officials , including Rice and Hadley , as witnesses at the trial set for next year .
The defense had requested 20 subpoenas .
U.S. government prosecutors objected to 16 of them on the grounds the testimony would not be important or favorable to the defense .
The judge for the most part rejected the government ’s arguments .
Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman , former American Israel Public Affairs Committee officials , are accused of conspiring with a former Pentagon analyst to communicate national defense information to persons not entitled to receive it , including foreign government officials , policy analysts and the media .
The trial has been scheduled to begin in January .
Among the other subpoenas approved were for White House deputy national security adviser Elliott Abrams , former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and former Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith .
A former Pentagon analyst , Lawrence Franklin , has pleaded guilty in the espionage case to disclosing information to Rosen and Weissman from early 2002 through June 2004 .
Ellis also approved a subpoena for Franklin .
NO COMMENT
Asked about the Rice subpoena , State Department spokesman Tom Casey said , “ We are not going to comment on an ongoing legal matter .
I would refer you to the Department of Justice . ”
A Justice Department spokesman had no comment .
The judge said the defense argued that the testimony of the prospective witnesses will negate the government ’s contention that the information involved the national defense .
The defense wanted to show the information was neither closely held by the U.S. government nor were disclosures of it damaging to the United States , the judge said .
Ellis said the defendants argued the testimony by the witnesses will show their acts reflected nothing more than the well - established official Washington practice of engaging in “ back channel ” communications to advance U.S. foreign policy goals .
The defense argued that U.S. government officials regularly conveyed sensitive , nonpublic information to the defendants and others at AIPAC , with the expectation it would be disclosed to foreign government officials and the news media .
Ellis said in the 19 - page ruling that there is no indication that any government agency will direct any current or former official to refuse to comply with a subpoena .
BASRA , Iraq ( Reuters ) - Residents of Iraq ’s southern city of Basra have begun strolling riverfront streets again after four years of fear , their city much quieter since British troops withdrew from the grand Saddam Hussein - era Basra Palace .

Political assassinations and sectarian violence continue , some city officials say , but on a much smaller scale than at any time since British troops moved into the city after the 2003 U.S. - led invasion .
Mortar rounds , rockets and small arms fire crashed almost daily into the palace , making life hazardous for British and Iraqis alike in Iraq ’s second - largest city .
To many Basrans the withdrawal of the British a month ago removed a proven target .
“ The situation these days is better .
We were living in hell ... the area is calm since their withdrawal , ” said housewife Khairiya Salman , who lives near the palace .
Civil servant Wisam Abdul Sada agreed .
“ We do not hear the sounds of explosions which were shaking our houses and terrifying our women and children , ” he told Reuters .
Basra , in Iraq ’s Shi’ite south , has enormous strategic importance as the hub for the country ’s vital oil exports that account for 90 percent of its revenue and a centre of imports and exports throughout the Gulf .
The volatile city has witnessed its share of violence in a sectarian conflict and insurgency that has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis since the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam .
While the British were frequent targets -- 41 soldiers were killed this year , the most since 2003 -- Basra has also been the centre of a turf war between rival Shi’ite groups .
That fighting was mainly between the Mehdi Army militia loyal to fiery anti-American cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council whose armed Badr wing controls police in much of the south , and the smaller Fadhila party .
The three groups have been battling for political supremacy .
The violence , which has become part of the fabric of Basra life , has not completely abated since about 500 British soldiers withdrew from the palace in the city centre to the vast airbase on its outskirts in early September .
Last week , a suicide car bomber killed three people and wounded 20 in an attack on a police station .
Suicide car bombs are the hallmark of Sunni Islamist al Qaeda and are rare in Basra , where most fighting is between rival Shi’ites .
Gunmen also killed a religious aide to revered Shi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani a week earlier .
ASSASSINATIONS
Even before those attacks some disagreed over whether the city was now safer than anywhere else in the volatile south .
Two SIIC governors were assassinated in the southern provinces of Muthanna and Diwaniya in August .
Basra city councillor Munadhil al - Mayahi said security had deteriorated over the past three months .
“ Political assassinations have increased , armed robberies have increased , kidnappings have increased , ” he said .
“ But this has nothing to do with the British withdrawal .
All that changed after the British troops left was that bombardment of the palace stopped . ”
Others described their departure from the palace as “ a wish come true ” .
“ Their presence was annoying and provocative most of the time , ” said Mehdi Obaid , a 39 - year - old civil servant .
The pullout will lead to a planned reduction in British forces to about 5,000 .
Britain has already handed over security command for three other southern provinces to Iraqi forces .
A recent quarterly Pentagon report said security in southern Iraq had taken a “ notable turn for the worse ” in August , adding that there could be an increase in intra-Shi’ite fighting , once centred in Basra , across the south .
It had been feared the British withdrawal would trigger an upsurge in violence in Basra .
Merchant Faris Mohammed
Ali described the British soldiers as a “ scarecrow ” .
“ Frankly I did n’t want the British troops to withdraw , not because I liked them but because I am afraid of the factions and their armed groups , they are in a constant struggle which may burn the city one day , ” he said .
But for now Basra seems quieter and safer to some families who have started to come out at night to stroll along the banks of the Shatt al - Arab river , something that would have been unthinkable not long ago .
“ A year or six months ago , we were afraid to go out to this place , ” Baidaa Razaq told Reuters as she walked with her son .
“ The occupiers used to come often to this place , ” she said referring to the British troops who had been stationed in Basra city since the 2003 U.S. - led invasion .
PROBABLY nothing during the course of the last twelve months has been more detrimental to the true progress of eugenics as a science than the papers read and the statements made at the recent International Eugenics Congress .
In some branches of knowledge little harm would be done by the statement of erroneous conclusions ; no public opinion would be based on them , and there would be no likelihood of social action resulting from them .

( Previous posts here , and here . )
So , let ’s talk about patch theory !
I should start by saying that I have obviously drawn a lot of ideas and inspiration from darcs , and especially from the wikibook explanation of darcs patch theory , but I do think there might be some nuggets of original contributions here ( in subsequent posts at least ) , but I ’m not yet familiar enough with the literature to really say .
In this post I ’d like to start off by giving an overview of the basics of patch theory , to lay a foundation for the things I plan to talk about in future posts .
Patches and documents
A patch is essentially a function which takes a document as input and produces another document .
A “ document ” is just any sort of thing that we might wish to modify .
In the context of darcs , a “ document ” is an entire directory tree ; in a collaborative editor it would be just a single file .
Note , however , that patches are partial functions : not every patch can be applied to every document !
For example , a patch which ( to use a darcs example ) makes a modification to file X cannot be applied in a context in which there is no file X .
As another example , a patch to delete the character ‘ z ’ from the first position in a file cannot be applied to a file which begins with the character ‘y ’ .
But thinking of patches as partial functions is not a very useful point of view .
The main point is that the context of a patch matters — both the context to which it is applied , and the context which it produces .
We will write to denote a patch which , when applied to document , produces document .
We say that is the domain of , and is its codomain .
Of course , this immediately suggests …
The category of patches
Patches can be most usefully viewed as morphisms in a category with documents as objects .
( If you do n’t know any category theory , do n’t worry : the rest of this post does n’t particularly depend on any background knowledge . )
To wit : given two patches and , we can compose them to form the composite patch , which has the same overall effect as applying first , then .
( Of course , there are good arguments for writing this composition in the other order , like — function composition and all that — but this is the way I ’ve been writing it , so get used to it . =)
Since patches can be viewed as functions from one document to another , and function composition is associative , patch composition is obviously associative as well .
Finally , for every document , we will have a null patch which sends to itself .
Since we ’re very interested in the “ undo ” operation , we also require that every patch must be invertible — that is , for every patch there must be a corresponding patch , such that and .
Of course , this also means that .
So , the category of patches is actually a groupoid .
A groupoid can be viewed as a set with inverses and a partial binary operation — here , the partiality comes from the fact that not all patches can be composed — but I prefer the category - theoretical view of a groupoid as a category with all morphisms invertible .
Because really , who likes partial functions ?
( A quick note : I ’m playing a little fast and loose with patch equality here ; when I say that two patches are equal , what I really mean is that they are observationally equivalent .
So technically , the morphisms in the category of patches are equivalence classes of patches ; in a particular implementation there may be patches with distinguishable representations which nevertheless have the same effect — that is , they produce the same output document given the same input document . )
Commutation
The other central operation on patches is that of commutation .
As a motivating example , let ’s consider the problem of undo in a text editor .
Suppose , starting from a blank document , you sequentially apply the five patches through .
Therefore , the current document state can be described by the composite patch
Now suppose you want to undo your last change .
This is easy : since every patch has an inverse , you can just apply to obtain
( In practice , to remember the fact that you performed an undo , and to allow the possibility of redo in the future , an editor would retain the patches and rather than deleting them .
But the overall effect is the same . )
Nice .
But what if you are using a collaborative editor , and changes and were made by a different user ( perhaps you are not even aware of their changes , if they were made in a different part of the document ) ?
You want to undo patch , which is the last change that you made , but simply applying does n’t work anymore , since cannot be composed with ( the codomain of does not match the domain of ) !
We need a way to “ move ” to the end of the patch sequence , like this :
Now we can simply apply the inverse patch to undo .
This process of reordering patches is referred to as commutation .
The composite patch commutes to the composite patch ( written ) if , and represents “ the same change ” as , and similarly for and .
Of course , “ the same change ” is quite vague , but it ’s a necessary restriction ; just requiring that is not enough , since in that case we could , for example , choose and — obviously not what we want .
I ’ve wondered whether there is a formal way to pin this down , although I think it might depend on the particular document type being used .
However , for now a simple example should suffice .
Suppose Alice and Bob are editing a document together , which contains the word “ cap ” .
First ,
Alice inserts the letter “ m ” at position 2 ( positions are zero - indexed ) , to produce the word “ camp ” ; call this patch .
Next , Bob inserts the letter “ r ” at position 1 , producing the word “ cramp ” ; call this patch .
Now Alice decides that she wishes to undo her change , since “ crap ” is a much better word than “ cramp ” .
In order to do this , the patches and must first be commuted : we want to find patches and such that adds the letter “ r ” , adds the letter “ m ” , and when composed , still sends the document “ cap ” to the document “ cramp ” .
In this case , it ’s not too hard to see that should still insert “ r ” at position 1 , but now should insert “ m ” at position 3 instead of position 2 , since the location in the document where inserted an “ m ” has been “ shifted over ” by the patch .
After commuting and , the patch can now be applied to undo Alice ’s change .
Now , the big question : does every pair of patches commute ?
In the case of a version control system like darcs , the answer is definitely “ no ” .
For example , suppose creates file X , and adds some content to file X .
There is no way we can meaningfully reorder the two patches — content cannot be added to file X before it has been created !
In the case of a collaborative editor , on the other hand , the answer is … maybe ?
This is one of the central questions I plan to address in later posts .
If the patches and commute , a nice property that we ’d like to have hold in all cases is
,
that is , we want the commute operation to be an involution , so applying it twice is the identity .
This also has some interesting implications for the theory of a collaborative editor , and it will come up again in later posts , too !
Merging
The other fundamental operation on patches , of course , is merging : taking two patches made to the same document in parallel , and merging them into a sequence of patches that performs both changes .
In a version control system , this happens all the time , when two people have the same source and start making changes to it at the same time , and later want to get the other ’s changes as well .
It happens in a collaborative editor , too , because of network latency .
When you start typing something , someone else may have already typed some things that have not yet propagated to you over the network ; when you finally receive the propagated changes , they will have to be merged with the changes you have made .
It turns out , however , that merging is really not a fundamental operation at all !
It can be implemented very simply in terms of commutation and inverses .
Here ’s the situation : suppose we have two patches , and , made in parallel to the same document , .
We want to find a patch which performs the “ same change ” as , but which can be composed with .
How can we find ?
The key is to note that if we invert , this looks just like the diagram for commuting two patches , but on its side !
In other words , to merge patches and , we first commute to obtain .
Then we can simply discard .
( Of course , this sounds like wasted computation , but supposing we were to use some sort of lazy language … =)
Let ’s illustrate this with a simple example .
Alice and Bob are at it again ; this time , they are editing a document containing the word “ hat ” .
Alice adds the letter “ c ” to create the word “ chat ” ( patch ) .
At the same time , Bob adds the letter “ s ” to create the word “ hats ” ( patch ) .
Now Alice ’s editor gets Bob ’s patch , and needs to merge it with Alice ’s .
Commuting yields , as shown in the diagram , and Alice ’s editor applies patch , producing the document “ chats ” .
Of course , at the same time , Bob ’s editor receives Alice ’s patch , and performs the dual merge shown below .
This illustrates an obvious and important property that must hold : merging must be symmetric !
From the above two diagrams , we must have .
Onward
Alright , enough for today !
Next time : some actual Haskell code implementing all of this for a simple document type !

Abstract
Science and religion both make claims about the fundamental workings of the universe .
Although these claims are not a priori incompatible ( we could imagine being brought to religious belief through scientific investigation ) , I will argue that in practice they diverge .
If we believe that the methods of science can be used to discriminate between fundamental pictures of reality , we are led to a strictly materialist conception of the universe .
While the details of modern cosmology are not a necessary part of this argument , they provide interesting clues as to how an ultimate picture may be constructed .
Introduction
One increasingly hears rumors of a reconciliation between science and religion .
In major news magazines as well as at academic conferences , the claim is made that that belief in the success of science in describing the workings of the world is no longer thought to be in conflict with faith in God .
I would like to argue against this trend , in favor of a more old - fashioned point of view that is still more characteristic of most scientists , who tend to disbelieve in any religious component to the workings of the universe .
The title ” Why cosmologists are atheists ” was chosen not because I am primarily interested in delving into the sociology and psychology of contemporary scientists , but simply to bring attention to the fact that I am presenting a common and venerable point of view , not advancing a new and insightful line of reasoning .
Essentially I will be defending a position that has come down to us from the Enlightenment , and which has been sharpened along the way by various advances in scientific understanding .
In particular , I will discuss what impact modern cosmology has on our understanding of these truly fundamental questions .
The past few hundred years have witnessed a significant degree of tension between science and religion .
Since very early on , religion has provided a certain way of making sense of the world — a reason why things are the way they are .
In modern times , scientific explorations have provided their own pictures of how the world works , ones which rarely confirm the pre-existing religious pictures .
Roughly speaking , science has worked to apparently undermine religious belief by calling into question the crucial explanatory aspects of that belief ; it follows that other aspects ( moral , spiritual , cultural ) lose the warrants for their validity .
I will argue that this disagreement is not a priori necessary , but nevertheless does arise as a consequence of the scientific method .
It is important from the outset to distinguish between two related but ultimately distinct concepts : a picture of how the world works , and a methodology for deciding between competing pictures .
The pictures of interest in this paper may be labelled ” materialism ” and ” theism . ”
Materialism asserts that a complete description of nature consists of an understanding of the structures of which it is comprised together with the patterns which those structures follow , while theism insists on the need for a conscious God who somehow rises above those patterns .
( These categories can be found , for example , in Richard Swinburne ’s Is There a God ?
( Oxford , 1996 ) .
I do n’t mean to pick on the conference organizer , but this short book is a well - presented and paradigmatic example of the kind of view I want to contrast with mine . )
Science is most often associated with a materialist view , but the essence of science lies as much in a methodology of reaching the truth as in any view of what form that truth might ultimately take .
In particular , the scientific method is an empirical one , in contrast to appeals to pure reason or to revelation .
For the purposes of this paper I will assume the validity of the scientific method , and simply ask what sorts of conclusions we are led to by its application .
Within this framework , there are two possible roads to reconciliation between science and religion .
One is to claim that science and religion are not incompatible because they speak to completely distinct sets of questions , and hence never come into conflict .
The other is to assert that thinking scientifically does not lead to rejection of theism , but in fact that religious belief can be justified in the same way that any scientific theory might be .
I will argue that neither strategy succeeds : science and religion do speak to some of the same questions , and when they do they get different answers .
In particular , I wish to argue that religious belief necessarily entails certain statements about how the universe works , that these statements can be judged as scientific hypotheses , and that as such they should be rejected in favor of alternative ways of understanding the universe .
Probably nothing that I say will be anything you have not heard elsewhere .
My goals here are simply to describe what I think a typical scientist has in mind when confronted with the question of science vs. religion , even if the scientists themselves have not thought through these issues in any detail .
Worldviews
One of the most difficult tasks in discussing the relationship between science and religion is to define the terminology in ways that are acceptable to everyone listening .
In fact , it is likely impossible ; especially when it comes to religion , the terminology is used in incompatible ways by different people .
I will therefore try to be as clear as possible about the definitions I am using .
In this section I want to carefully describe what I mean by the two competing worldviews , materialism and theism , without yet addressing how to choose between them .
The essence of materialism is to model the world as a formal system , which is both unambiguous and complete as a description of reality .
A materialist model may be said to consist of four elements .
First , we model the world as some formal ( mathematical ) structure .
( General relativity describes the world as a curved manifold with a Lorentzian metric , while quantum mechanics describes the world as a state in some Hilbert space .
As a more trivial example , we could imagine a universe which consisted of nothing other that an infinitely long list of ” bits ” taking on the values 0 or 1 . )
Second , this structure exhibits patterns ( the ” laws of nature ” ) , so that the amount of information needed to express the world is dramatically less than the structure would in principle allow .
( In a world described by a string of bits , we might for example find that the bits were an infinitely repeated series of a single one followed by two zeroes : 100100100100 … )
Third , we need boundary conditions which specify the specific realization of the pattern .
( The first bit in our list is a one . )
Note that the distinction between the patterns and their boundary conditions is not perfectly well - defined ; this is an issue which becomes relevant in cosmology , and we ’ll discuss it more later .
Finally , we need a way to relate this formal system to the world we see : an ” interpretation . ”
The reader might worry that we are glossing over very subtle and important issues in the philosophy of science ; they would be correct , but need n’t worry .
Philosophy of science becomes difficult when we attempt to describe the relationship of the formalism to the world ( the interpretation ) , as well as how we invent and choose between theories .
But the idea that we are trying , in principle , to model the world as a formal system is fairly uncontroversial .
The materialist thesis is simply : that ’s all there is to the world .
Once we figure out the correct formal structure , patterns , boundary conditions , and interpretation , we have obtained a complete description of reality .
( Of course we do n’t yet have the final answers as to what such a description is , but a materialist believes such a description does exist . )
In particular , we should emphasize that there is no place in this view for common philosophical concepts such as ” cause and effect ” or ” purpose . ”
From the perspective of modern science , events do n’t have purposes or causes ; they simply conform to the laws of nature .
In particular , there is no need to invoke any mechanism to ” sustain ” a physical system or to keep it going ; it would require an additional layer of complexity for a system to cease following its patterns than for it to simply continue to do so .
Believing otherwise is a relic of a certain metaphysical way of thinking ; these notions are useful in an informal way for human beings , but are not a part of the rigorous scientific description of the world .
Of course scientists do talk about ” causality , ” but this is a description of the relationship between patterns and boundary conditions ; it is a derived concept , not a fundamental one .
If we know the state of a system at one time , and the laws governing its dynamics , we can calculate the state of the system at some later time .
You might be tempted to say that the particular state at the first time ” caused ” the state to be what it was at the second time ; but it would be just as correct to say that the second state caused the first .
According to the materialist worldview , then , structures and patterns are all there are — we do n’t need any ancillary notions .
Defining theism is more difficult than defining materialism , for the simple reason that theist belief takes many more forms that materialist belief , and the same words are often taken to mean utterly different things .
I will partially avoid this difficulty by not attempting a comprehensive definition of religion , but simply taking belief in the existence of a being called ” God ” as a necessary component of being religious .
( Already this choice excludes some modes of belief which are sometimes thought of as ” religious . ”
For example , one could claim that ” the laws of physics , and their working out in the world , are what I hold to be God . ”
I am not what the point of doing that would be , but in such a case nothing that I have to say would apply . )
The subtlety has therefore been transferred to the task of defining ” God . ” I will take it to mean some being who is not bound by the same patterns we perceive in the universe , who is by our standards extremely powerful ( not necessarily omnipotent , although that would count ) , and in some way plays a crucial role in the universe ( creating it , or keeping it going , etc. ) .
By a ” being ” I mean to imply an entity which we would recognize as having consciousness — a ” person ” in some appropriately generalized sense ( as opposed to a feature of reality , or some sort of feeling ) .
A rather concrete God , in other words , not just an aspect of nature .
This notion of God need not be interventionist or easy to spot , but has at least the capability of intervening in our world .
Even if not necessarily omnipotent , the relevant feature of this conception is that God is not bound by the laws of physics .
In particular , I do n’t include some sort of superhero - God who is bound by such laws , but has figured out how to use them in ways that convey the impression of enormous power ( even if it is hard to imagine ultimately distinguishing between these two possibilities ) .
When I say that God is not bound by the laws of physics , I have in mind for example that God is not limited to moving more slowly than the speed of light , or that God could create an electron without also creating a corresponding positively - charged particle .
( We are not imagining that God can do the logically impossible , just violate the contingent patterns of reality that we could imagine having been different . )
Of course these are meager powers compared to most conceptions of God , but I am taking them to be minimal criteria .
There are various types of belief which are conventionally labelled as religious , but inconsistent with my definition of God ; about these I have nothing to say in this paper .
It should be clear that , by these definitions , materialism and theism are incompatible , essentially by definition .
( The former says that everything follows the rules , the second says that God is an exception . )
It does not immediately follow that ” science ” and ” religion ” are incompatible ; we could follow the scientific method to conclude that a materialist description of the world was not as reasonable as a theist one .
On the other hand , it does follow that science and religion do overlap in their spheres of interest .
Religion has many aspects , including social and moral ones , apart from its role in describing the workings of the world ; however , that role is a crucial one , and necessarily speaks to some of the same issues as science does .
Suggestions that science and religion are simply disjoint activities .
generally rely on a re-definition of ” religion ” as something closer to ” moral philosophy . ”
( See for example S.J. Gould , Rocks of Ages : Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life , Ballantine , 2002 . )
Such a definition ignores crucial aspects of religious belief .
In judging between materialism and theism , we are faced with two possibilities .
Either one or the other system is logically impossible , or we need to decide which of the two conceivable models better explains the world we experience .
In my view , neither materialism nor theism is logically impossible , and I will proceed on the idea that we have to see which fits reality better .
Of course arguments against materialism have been put forward which do not rely on specific observed features of our world , but instead on either pure reason or revelation ; I wo n’t attempt to deal with such arguments here .
Theory choice
Given this understanding of materialism and theism , how are we to decide which to believe ?
There is no right answer to this question , and sensible arguments can only be made after we agree on some basic elements of how we should go about choosing a theory of the world .
For example , someone could insist on the primacy of revelation in understanding deep truths ; in response , there is no logical argument which could prove such a person wrong .
Instead , I would like to ask what conclusion we should reach by employing a more empirical technique of deciding between theories .
In other words , we address the choice between materialism and theism as a scientist would address the choice between any two competing theories .
The basic scientific assumption is that there is exists a complete and coherent description of how the world works .
( This need not be a purely materialist description , in the language of the previous section ; simply a sensible description covering all phenomena . )
Although we certainly do n’t yet know what this description might be , science has been extremely successful at constructing provisional theories which accurately model some aspects of reality ; this degree of success thus far convinces most scientists that there really is a comprehensive description to be found .
This underlying assumption plays a crucial role in determining how scientists choose between competing theories which are more modest in their goals , attempting to model only some specific types of phenomena — in a nutshell , scientists choose those models which they feel are more likely to be consistent with the true underlying unified description .
We can make such a sweeping statement with some confidence , only because it avoids all the hard questions .
In particular , how do we go about deciding whether a theory is more or less likely to be consistent with a single coherent description of nature ?
It is at this point that the judgment of the individual scientist necessarily plays a crucial role ; the process is irreducibly non-algorithmic .
A number of criteria are employed , including fit to experiment , simplicity , and comprehensiveness .
No one of these criteria is absolute , even fit to experiment ; after all , experiments are sometimes wrong .
Let me give an example to illustrate the different criteria employed by scientists to judge theories .
When we observe the dynamics of galaxies , we find that the apparent gravitational force exerted by the galaxy on particles orbiting far around it is inevitably much larger than we would expect by taking into account the combined mass of all the visible material in the galaxy .
A straightforward and popular hypothesis to explain this observation is the idea of ” dark matter , ” the notion that most of the mass in galaxies is not in stars or gas , but rather in some new kind of particle which has not yet been observed directly , and which has an average mass density in the universe which is approximately five times greater than that of ordinary matter .
But there is a competing idea : that our understanding of gravity ( through Einstein ’s general relativity ) breaks down at the edges of galaxies , to be replaced by some new gravitational law .
Such a law has actually been proposed by Milgrom , under the name of ” Modified Newtonian Dynamics , ” or MOND ( M. Milgrom , 1983 , Astrophys .
Journ . 270 , 365 ) .
At this point we do n’t know for certain whether the dark matter hypothesis or the MOND hypothesis is correct , but it is safe to say that the large majority of scientific experts come down in favor of dark matter .
Why is that ?
On the one hand , there is a sense in which MOND is more compact and efficient : it has been demonstrated to accurately describe the observations of a wide set of galaxies , with only a single free parameter , while the dark matter idea is somewhat less predictive on this score .
But there are two features working strongly in favor of dark matter .
First , it makes detailed predictions for a wide class of phenomena , well outside the realm of individual galaxies : clusters of galaxies , gravitational lenses , large - scale structure , the cosmic microwave background , and more , while MOND is completely silent on these issues ( there is no prediction to verify or disprove ) .
The second ( closely related ) point is that MOND is not really a complete theory , or even a theory at all , but simply a suggested phenomenological relation that is supposed to hold for galaxies .
Nobody understands how to make it part of a larger consistent framework .
Therefore , despite the greater predictive power of MOND within its domain of validity , most scientists consider it to be a step backward , as it seems less likely to ultimately be part of a comprehensive description .
( Nobody can say for sure , so the issue is still open , but the majority has a definite preference . )
It should be clear why choosing between competing theories is difficult — it ’s a matter of predicting the future , not of applying a set of unambiguous criteria .
Nevertheless , it ’s not completely arbitrary , either ; it ’s simply a matter of applying a set of somewhat ambiguous standards .
Fortunately , cases in which a certain theory would be favored by applying one reasonable criterion while a different theory would be favored by applying a different reasonable criterion are both rare and typically short - lived ; the acquisition of additional experimental input or increased theoretical understanding tends to ultimately resolve the issue relatively cleanly in favor of one specific model .
According to this description , the evaluation of a scientific theory involves both a judgment about the theory itself and about the more comprehensive theory which would ultimately describe nature .
While a number of disparate factors are applied to concrete theories , the criteria relevant to judging competing comprehensive theories are much more straightforward : among every possible model which fits all of the data , we choose the simplest possible one .
” Simplicity ” here is related to the notion of ” algorithmic compressibility ” : the simplicity of a model is judged by how much information is required to fully specify the system .
There is no a priori reason why nature should be governed by a comprehensive model which is at all simple ; but our experience as scientists convinces us that this is the case .
It should be clear how these considerations relate to the choice between materialism and theism .
These two worldviews offer different notions of what form a comprehensive decription will take .
Acting as scientists , it is our task to judge whether it seems more likely that the simplest possible comprehensive theory which is compatible with what we already know about the universe will turn out to be strictly materialistic , or will require the introduction of a deity .
Cosmology and belief
If we accept the scientific method as a way to determine the workings of reality , are we led to a materialist or theist conclusion ?
Naively , the deck seems to be stacked against theism : if we are looking for simplicity of description , a view which only invokes formal structures and patterns would appear to be simpler than one in which God appeared in addition .
However , we are constrained to find simple descriptions which are also complete and consistent with experiment .
Therefore , we could be led to belief in God , if it were warranted by our observations — if there were evidence ( direct or otherwise ) of divine handiwork in the universe .
There are several possible ways in which this could happen .
Most direct would be straightforward observation of miraculous events that would be most easily explained by invoking God .
Since such events seem hard to come by , we need to be more subtle .
Yet there are still at least two ways in which a theist worldview could be judged more compelling than a materialist one .
First , we could find that our best materialist conception was somehow incomplete — there was some aspect of the universe which could not possibly be explained within a completely formal framework .
This would be like a ” God of the gaps , ” if there were good reason to believe that a certain kind of ” gap ” were truly inexplicable by formal rules alone .
Second , we could find that invoking the workings of God actually worked to simplify the description , by providing explanations for some of the observed patterns .
An example would be an argument from design , if we could establish convincingly that certain aspects of the universe were designed rather than assembled by chance .
Let ’s examine each of these possibilities in turn .
We turn first to the idea that there is something inherently missing in a materialist description of nature .
One way in which this could happen would be if there were a class of phenomena which seemed to act without regard to any patterns we could discern , something that stubbornly resisted formalization into a mechanistic description .
Of course , in such a case it would be hard to tell whether an appropriate formalism actually did n’t exist , or whether we just had n’t yet been clever enough to discover it .
For example , physicists have tried for most of the last century to invent a theory which described gravity while being consistent with quantum mechanics .
( String theory is the leading candidate for such a theory , but it has not yet been fully developed to the point where we understand it well enough to compare it to experiment . )
It is hard to know at what point scientists would become sufficiently frustrated in their attempts to describe a phenomenon that they would begin to suspect that no formal description was applicable .
However , it is safe to say that such a point has not been reached , or even approached , with any of the phenomena of current interest to physicists .
Although there are undoubtedly unsolved problems , the rate at which successful theoretical explanations are proposed for these problems is well in accordance with expectation .
In other words , there does not seem to be any reason to suspect that we have reached , or are about to reach , the fundamental limits of our ability to find rules governing Nature ’s behavior .
A more promising place to search for a fundamental incompleteness in the materialist program would be at the ” boundaries ” of the universe .
Recall that a complete mechanistic picture involves not only patterns we discern in nature , but some boundary condition which serves to choose a particular realization of all the possible configurations consistent with such a pattern .
In the realm of science , this is an issue of unique concern to cosmology .
In physics , chemistry , or biology , we imagine that we can isolate systems in whatever initial state we like ( within reason ) , and observe how the rules governing the system play themselves out from that starting point .
In cosmology , in contrast , we are faced with a unique universe , and must face the issue of its initial conditions .
One could certainly imagine that something like a traditional religious conception of God could provide some insight into why the initial state was the particular one relevant to our universe .
In classical cosmology initial conditions are imposed at the Big Bang , a singular region in spacetime out of which our universe was born .
More carefully , if we take our current universe and run it back in time , we reach a point where the density and curvature of spacetime become infinite , and our equations ( gravity described by Einstein ’s general relativity , and other fields described by the Standard Model of particle physics ) cease to make sense .
This initial moment must apparently be treated as a boundary to spacetime .
( A boundary in the past , not in any direction in space . )
As we now recognize , the conditions near the Big Bang are by no means generic ; the curvature of space ( as opposed to that of spacetime ) was extremely close to zero , and widely separated parts of the universe were expanding at nearly identical rates .
What made it this way ?
Do we need to accept the imposition of certain boundary conditions as an irreducible part of our worldview , or is there some way of arguing within a bigger picture that these conditions were somehow natural ?
Or do we simplify our description by invoking a God who brought the universe into existence in a certain state ?
Nobody knows the answers with any certainty .
The best we can do is to extrapolate from what we think we do know .
In this context , modern cosmology does have something to teach us .
In particular , we now know that the issue of boundary conditions is more complicated than it might appear at first .
Indeed , we now understand that , despite appearances , the universe might not have a boundary at all .
This could happen in one of two ways : either the Big Bang might actually be smooth and nonsingular , or it might represent a transitional phase in a universe which is actually eternal .
The first possibility , that the Big Bang is actually nonsingular , was popularized by the Hartle - Hawking ” no boundary ” proposal for the wave function of the universe ( J.B. Hartle and S.W. Hawking , 1983 , Phys. Rev. D28 , 2960 ) .
Discussions of this proposal can be somewhat misleading , in that they frequently refer to the idea that the universe came into being out of nothing .
This would be hard to understand , if true ; what is this ” nothing ” that the universe purportedly came out of , and what caused it to come out ?
A much better way of putting the Hartle - Hawking idea into words would be to say that the apparent ” sharp point ” at the beginning of spacetime is smoothed out into a featureless surface .
The mechanism by which the smoothing purportedly happens involves technical details of the geometry of the spacetime metric , and in all honesty the entire proposal is very far from being well - formulated .
Nevertheless , the lesson of the Hartle - Hawking work is that we do n’t necessarily have to think of the Big Bang as an ” edge ” at which spacetime runs into a wall ; it could be more like the North Pole , which is as far north as you can possibly go , without actually representing any sort of physical boundary of the globe .
In other words , the universe could be finite ( in time ) and yet be unbounded .
The other way to avoid a boundary is more intuitive : simply imagine that the universe lasts forever .
Like the Hartle - Hawking proposal , the idea of an eternal universe requires going beyond our current well - formulated theories of general relativity and particle physics .
In the context of classical four - dimensional gravitation , it is well known that the conditions which we believe obtained in the very early universe must have originated from a singularity .
Extensions of this picture , however , can in principle allow for smooth continuation through the veil of the Big Bang to an earlier phase of the universe .
Within this scenario there are two possibilities : either what we see as the Big Bang was a unique event , about which the universe expands indefinitely in either direction in time ; or it was one occurrence in an infinitely repeating cycle of expansions and recontractions .
Both possibilities have been considered for a long time , but have received new attention thanks to recent work by Veneziano and collaborators ( the ” pre-Big - Bang ” model : G. Veneziano , 1991 , Phys . Lett. B 265 , 287 ) and Steinhardt , Turok , and collaborators ( the ” cyclic universe ” model : P.J. Steinhardt and N. Turok , 2002 , Science 296 , 1436 ) .
In either case , an attempt is made to circumvent traditional singularity theorems by introducing exotic matter fields , extra dimensions of space , and sometimes ” branes ” on which ordinary particles are confined .
For example , in the model of a cyclic universe advocated by Steinhardt and Turok , our universe is a three - brane ( three spatial dimensions , evolving in time , for a total of four spacetime dimensions ) embedded in a background five - dimensional spacetime .
Motion in the extra dimension , it is suggested , can help resolve the apparent Big - Bang singularity , allowing a contracting universe to bounce and begin expanding into a new phase , before eventually recollapsing and starting the cycle over again .
I do n’t want to discuss details of either the pre-Big - Bang scenario or the cyclic universe ; for one thing , the details are fuzzy at best and incoherent at worse .
Neither picture is completely well - formulated at this time .
But the state of the art in early - universe cosmology is not the point ; the lesson here is that we are not forced to think of boundary conditions being imposed arbitrarily at the earliest times .
In any of the scenarios mentioned here , the issue of initial conditions is dramatically altered from the classical Big - Bang scenario , since there is no edge to the universe at which boundary conditions need to be arbitrarily imposed .
Thus , one cannot argue that we require the initial state of the universe to be specified by the conscious act of a deity , or that the universe came into existence as the result of a single creative act .
This is by no means a proof that God does not exist ;
God could be responsible for the universe ’s existence , whether it is boundaryless or not .
But these theories demonstrate that a distinct creation event is not a necessary component of a complete description of the universe .
Although we do n’t know whether any of these models will turn out to be part of the final picture , their existence allows us to believe that a simple materialist formalism is sufficient to tell the whole story .
Being allowed to believe something , of course , is not the same as having good reasons for doing so .
This brings us to the second possible way in which scientific reasoning could lead us to believe in God : if , upon constructing various models for the universe , we found that the God hypothesis accounted most economically for some of the features we found in observed phenomena .
As noted , this kind of reasoning is a descendant of the well - known argument from design .
A few centuries ago , for example , it would have been completely reasonable to observe the complexity and subtlety exhibited in the workings of biological creatures , and conclude that such intricacy could not possibly have arisen by chance , but must instead be attributed to the plan of a Creator .
The advent of Darwin ’s theory of evolution , featuring descent with modification and natural selection , provided a mechanism by which such apparently improbable configurations could have arisen via innumerable gradual changes .
Indeed , modern science has provided plausible explanations for the origin of all the complex phenomena we find in nature ( given appropriate initial conditions , as we just discussed ) .
Nevertheless , these explanations rely on the details of the laws of physics , as exemplified in general relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics .
In particular , when we consider carefully the particular laws we have discovered , we find them to be specific realizations of more general possible structures .
For example , in particle physics we have various kinds of particles ( fermions , gauge bosons , a hypothetical higgs boson ) , as well as specific symmetries among their interactions , and particular values for the parameters governing their behavior .
Given that the universe is made out of fermions and bosons with particular kinds of interactions , to the best of our current knowledge we do not understand why we find the particular particles we do , or the particular symmetries , or the particular parameters , rather than some other arrangement .
Is it conceivable that in the particular realization of particles and forces of our universe we can discern the fingerprints of a conscious deity , rather than simply a random selection among an infinite number of possibilities ?
Well , yes , it is certainly conceivable .
In fact , the argument has been made that the particles and interactions we observe are not chosen at all randomly ; instead , they are precisely tuned so as to allow for the existence of human life ( or at least , complex structures of the kind we consider to be necessary for intelligent life ) .
In order for this argument to have force , we must believe both that the physical laws are finely - tuned to allow for life ( i.e. , that the complexity required for life to form is not a robust feature , and would generally be absent for different choices of particles and coupling constants ) , and that there is no simpler alternative explanation for this fine - tuning .
I will argue that neither statement is warranted by our current understanding , although both are open questions ; in either case , there is not a strong reason for invoking the existence of God .
Let ’s turn first to the fine - tuning of our observed laws of nature .
It is certainly true that the world we observe depends sensitively on the particular values of the constants of nature : for example , the strength of the electromagnetic and nuclear forces .
If the strong nuclear force had a slightly different value , the balance which characterizes stable nuclei would be upset , and the periodic table of the elements would be dramatically altered ( R.N. Cahn , 1996 , Rev. Mod. Phys. 68 , 951 ) .
We could imagine ( so the argument goes ) values for which hydrogen were the only stable element , or for which no carbon was formed in the life cycle of stars .
In either case it would be difficult or impossible for life as we know it to exist .
But there are two serious holes in this argument , at least at our current level of expertise : we do n’t really know what the universe would look like if the parameters of the standard model were different , nor do we know what are the necessary conditions for the formation of intelligent life .
( Both of these claims are open to debate , and there are certainly scientists who disagree ; but if nothing else these are the conservative positions . )
To appreciate the difficulty of reliably determining what the universe would be like if the constants of nature took on different values , let us imagine trying to figure out what our actual universe should look like , if we were handed the laws of subatomic physics but had no direct empirical knowledge of how particles assembled themselves into more complex structures .
A fundamental obstacle arises immediately , since quantum chromodynamics ( the theory of quarks and gluons , which gives rise to the strong nuclear force ) is a strongly - coupled theory , so that our most straightforward and trustworthy techniques ( involving perturbation theory in some small parameter , such as the fine - structure constant of electromagnetism ) are worthless .
We would probably be able to conclude that quarks and gluons were bound into composite particles , and could even imagine figuring out that the lightest nearly - stable examples were protons and neutrons ( and their antiparticles ) .
It would be very hard , without experimental input , to calculate reliably that protons were lighter than neutrons , but it might be possible .
It would be essentially impossible to determine accurately the types of stable nuclei that protons and neutrons would be able to form .
We would have no chance whatsoever of accurately predicting the actual abundance of heavy nuclei in the universe , as these are formed in stars and supernovae whose evolution we do n’t really understand even with considerable observational input .
Most embarrassingly , we would never have predicted that there was a significant excess of matter over antimatter , since the process by which this occurs remains a complete mystery ( there are numerous plausible models , but none has become commonly accepted ( A. Riotto and M. Trodden , 1999 , Ann. Rev. Nucl . Part. Sci. 49 , 35 ) .
So we would predict a world in which there were almost no nuclei at all , the nucleons and anti-nucleons having annihilated long ago , leaving nothing but an inert gas of photons and neutrinos .
In other words , a universe utterly inhospitable to the existence of intelligent life as we know it .
Of course , perhaps life could nevertheless exist , of a sort radically different than we are familiar with .
As skeptical as I am about the ability of physicists to accurately predict gross features of a universe in which the laws of nature are different , I am all the more skeptical of the ability or biologists ( or anyone else ) to describe the conditions under which intelligence may or may not arise .
( Cellular automata , the simple discrete systems popularized by Wolfram and others , provide an excellent example of how extreme complexity can arise out of fundamentally very simple behaviors . )
For this reason , it seems highly presumptuous for anyone to claim that the laws of nature we observe are somehow delicately adjusted to allow for the existence of life .
But in fact there is a better reason to be skeptical of the fine - tuning claim : the indisputable fact that there are many features of the laws of nature which do n’t seem delicately adjusted at all , but seem completely irrelevant to the existence of life .
In a cosmological context , the most obvious example is the sheer vastness of the universe ; it would hardly seem necessary to make so many galaxies just so that life could arise on a single planet around a single star .
But to me a more pointed observation is the existence of ” generations ” of elementary particles .
All of the ordinary matter in the universe seems to be made out of two types of quarks ( up and down ) and two types of leptons ( electrons and electron neutrinos ) , as well as the various force - carrying particles .
But this pattern of quarks and leptons is repeated threefold : the up and down quarks are joined by four more types , just as the electron and its neutrino are joined by two electron - type particles and two more neutrinos .
As far as life is concerned , these particles are completely superfluous .
All of the processes we observe in the everyday workings of the universe would go on in essentially the same way if those particles did n’t exist .
Why do the constituents of nature exhibit this pointless duplication , if the laws of nature were constructed with life in mind ?
Beyond the fact that the constants of nature do not seem to be chosen by any intelligent agent , there remains the very real possibility that parameters we think of as distinct ( for example , the parameters measuring the strength of the electromagnetic and nuclear forces ) are actually calculable from a single underlying parameter .
This speculative proposal is the goal of so - called grand unified theories , for which there is already some indirect evidence .
In other words , it might turn out to be that the constants of nature really could n’t have had any other values .
I do n’t think that , if we discovered this to be the case , it would count as evidence against the existence of God , only because I do n’t think that our present understanding of these parameters counts as evidence in favor of God .
But perhaps the parameters are finely tuned ; we might imagine that our understanding of physics , biology , and complexity some day will increase to a degree where we can say with confidence that alternative values for these parameters would not have allowed intelligent life to evolve .
Even in that case , the existence of God is by no means the only mechanism for explaining this apparently - unlikely state of affairs ; a completely materialst scenario is provided by the well - known anthropic principle .
Imagine that what we think of as the ” constants of nature ” are merely local phenomena , in the sense that there are other regions of the universe where they take on completely different values .
This is a respectable possibility within our current conception of particle physics and cosmology .
The idea that there are different , inaccessible regions of the universe is consistent with the theory of ” eternal inflation , ” in which spacetime on large scales consists of innumerable distinct expanding universes , connected by regions of space driven to hyper - expansion by an incredibly high - energy field ( A.H. Guth , 2000 , Phys. Rept. 333 , 555 ) .
Within each of these separate regions , we can imagine that the matter fields settle into one of a large number of distinct metastable states , characterized by different values of all the various coupling constants .
[ Such a scenario is completely consistent with current ideas from string theory ( M. Dine , 1999 , Prog .
Theor .
Phys. Suppl. 134 , 1 ) , although it is clearly at odds with the idea from the previous paragraph that all of the coupling constants might be uniquely calculable .
The truth is that either scenario is possible , we just do n’t know enough at this point to say with confidence which , if either , is on the right track . ]
In a universe comprised of many distinct regions with different values of the coupling constants , it is tautologous that intelligent observers will only measure the values which obtain in those regions which are consistent with the existence of such observers .
This is nothing more fancy than the reason why nobody is surprised that life arose on the surface of the Earth rather than the surface of the Sun , even though the surface area of the Sun is so much larger : the Earth is simply a much more hospitable environment .
Therefore , even if we were to be confident that tiny alterations in the particles and couplings we observe in our universe would render life impossible , we would by no means need to invoke intelligent design as an explanation .
Conclusions
The question we have addressed is , ” Thinking as good scientists and observing the world in which we live , is it more reasonable to conclude that a materialist or theist picture is most likely to ultimately provide a comprehensive description of the universe ? ”
Although I do n’t imagine I have changed many people ’s minds , I do hope that my reasoning has been clear .
We are looking for a complete , coherent , and simple understanding of reality .
Given what we know about the universe , there seems to be no reason to invoke God as part of this description .
In the various ways in which God might have been judged to be a helpful hypothesis — such as explaining the initial conditions for the universe , or the particular set of fields and couplings discovered by particle physics — there are alternative explanations which do not require anything outside a completely formal , materialist description .
I am therefore led to conclude that adding God would just make things more complicated , and this hypothesis should be rejected by scientific standards .
It ’s a venerable conclusion , brought up to date by modern cosmology ; but the dialogue between people who feel differently will undoubtedly last a good while longer .

To Arizona voters & Ron Paul supporters :
A story from inside the Election Process
by Jeneen Zucker
Ernest Hancock
Website : www.ernesthancock.com
Date : 02-08-2008
Subject : Voting : Vote Fraud
February 8 , 2008
On February 4 , 2008 , I , Jeneen Zucker , was asked if I was willing to work at the polling place ; located at Christ The Lord Lutheran Church at 9205 East Cave Creek Road in Scottsdale , AZ .
This polling place covered all of the Care Free / Cave Creek area .
What you will read below is what I witnessed during my long hours working in that
polling place on February 4 and 5 , 2008 .
On February 4 , 2008 I helped set things up according to the directions given to me by the other workers .
When we left we were all told to be back in the morning at 5:30 am .
When I arrived people where already lined up at the door .
To my surprise I found out the other board members , Barbara Owings and Sharron Hayes and Frank Villers , came much earlier .
We were all sworn in and the polls were opened at 6:00 am .
The room started to fill up quickly .
The two women , Barbara Owings and Sharron Hayes , were in charge of giving voter clearance with their three books , Signature Roster , Blue Poll List and Green Precinct Register .
I had the Ballots Register .
I was never given 1 of the three copies of the Yellow Add on list , to help me assist the voters on this list with their party ballots .
This set up the situation of workers announcing party preference of voters in line who were on the yellow add on list , which made voters unhappy .
I quickly became aware of multiple chronic problems that a large number of voters were experiencing , so that many of them were forced to cast Provisional Ballots .
( People in Care Free only have mail delivered to the Post Office not a physical address .
This is also true for many people living in Cave Creek . )
These are the reasons they were given .
· You are not in our books .
· Our books show a physical address , your ID is a PO Box .
· Our books show a PO Box ; your ID shows a physical address .
· Our books show you were sent an Early Ballot .
· Our books show you requested an Early Ballot .
· Our books show you got an Early Ballot .
Many people were very unhappy , even angry that their voting location was changed and they were never notified .
There were numerous people who drove to several voting locations trying to vote .
There was one lady who drove to five different locations trying to vote .
Several people came in with election board mailings , showing they were at the correct polling location and they were either sent elsewhere or told they had to cast Provisional Ballots .
The statements from the voters were the same throughout the whole day .
Their conversations with each other , of discontent , frustration and mistrust of the electoral system , were loud and clear
· I have voted every election for the last ** many years !
· Last election the books dropped my wife 's name now I am dropped !
· I was forced to vote provisionary ballet last election so I filled out the form you folks gave me to fix it and it is still not fixed !
· You can see by my new voters ID card I should be in your book !
( many of dates were within the time allotment stated in the Training Manual )
· I have lived at this address for ** years and never had a problem voting before ; it 's your books that are the problem !
· I never requested an early ballot I have always voted in person !
· No , I did not request an early ballot !
· Yes I did request an early ballot but it never came !
· I keep filling out your forms and the information never gets changed and I always told to fill out a provisional ballot
· Yes , I did request an early ballot , when I did not receive it , I requested another one ; they said one would be sent to me , and it never arrived .
· My wife 's came in the mail but mine did not , so I want to vote .
There were a number of voters that had voter ID cards issued within 60 days .
I witnessed multiple family members dropped off the list , and told to cast Provisional Ballots .
When voters initiate verbal frustration to me , of being forced to vote a Provisional Ballot .
I heard over and over again " I want my vote counted tonight with the others " I continued to tell them to call the election board .
When people would ask will my vote be counted tonight with the others ?
They were told repeatedly YES , by Tim Murphy , I would tell them it would take a couple of days .
People brought in their early Ballot wanting to have it counted with the other walk in voters and were told NO !
It had to be placed in the Early Ballot box .
Why could it not have been considered a ( Spoiled Ballot ) and allow the voter to sign the book and be reissued a new Ballot ?
( The person did not believe her ballot would be counted )
People who admit they had not declared a party ( reregistered Republican or Democrat ) were led to believe , they could still vote a Provisional Ballot and their vote would be counted .
This is not true .
Here in Arizona you must be registered as a Republican or Democrat 29 days before the primary to vote .
The Provisional Ballots are not counted at the same time .
There is a lot of work involved in verifying whether or not a Provisional Ballot can be counted .
In the Training Manual it states on page ( 3 ) under , Board Worker Courtesy :
Our primary mission of the Board is to assist voters so that they can vote properly .
This requires you to provide good customer service , even under sometimes difficult situations .
I believe we should tell the voters the truth even in difficult situations .
We need to allow the voters to make informed decisions based on the truth not coercion and lies .
Ms. Owings and Ms. Hayes became upset with me for informing the angry voters that I understood their frustrations and where to go with their complaints .
They soon quit giving me the required number beside each voter 's name .
This made it more difficult for me to assist the voters they approved with a party ballot swiftly in the appropriate manor .
Several times during this day I stated to Ms. Hayes and Ms. Owings as soon as it lets up I need to vote .
The problem was it never slowed down enough to even use the bathroom or get a glass of water or eat a bite of food .
And there were not enough workers to give me or anyone else a break .
When I asked Frank Villers if he could heat up some coffee for me I was reprimanded by Ms. Hayes that I could not have coffee at the table even though I placed it behind me away from any voting supplies .
Frank Villers told us he was going out to the end of the line to announce the polls will be closing at 7:00 pm and nobody else could get in line .
I waited till the last approved voter had received their ballot the remaining people were told to vote a provisional ballot .
I grabbed my Voter ID and my photo ID ( driver 's license ) both of which matched the Signature Roster .
I got up and went to the front of the table and placed both on the table .
The two women told me I could not vote the polls were closed .
The signature book was then closed .
I sat and worked from 5:30 am till the last approved voter received their ballot .
I never even received a five minute break and these two women , Barbara Owings and Sharron Hayes believe they hold this kind of power .
Well of course they do , they have been exerting this kind of power over the voters all day .
I became angry and demanded the right to vote , they repeatedly told me NO .
There were still people completing their Provisional Ballots in the room .
I demanded again the right to vote .
The woman again refused to open the book and allow me to sign the Signature Roster .
The woman stated because I had not voted by 7:00 pm I could not vote .
I told them I was virtually in line all day waiting for a break so I could vote .
The woman then turned the decision over to the person in charge .
Jason Nevins stood there quietly just watching .
It was Frank Villars that quietly walked towards me stating I think we should let her vote .
Still Ms. Hays and Ms. Owings refused to open the books .
By now Frank Villars was standing at my side , he again stated I think we should let you vote .
Ms. Owings and Ms. Hayes were still refusing to open the Signature Book and let me sign in .
I repeatedly and loudly demanded my right to vote I could hardly believe what was happening to me but at the same time I had witness the frustration of hundreds of people throughout the whole day .
It was Frank Villers who step in to complete this duty .
I then went over to the Optical scan equipment to write down the number of walk in voters that were allowed to vote .
The number was 751 .
I then counted the number of names of people who had to vote Provisional Ballots , the number was 540 .
This means : 751 walk in allowed to vote .
+ 540 told to vote Provisional
1291 total number of votes not including Early Ballots .
540 of 1291 = 41 % were told they had to vote Provisional Ballots .
This is a huge percentage .
" Something is wrong ! "
But it does not end there !
I quickly wrote down all the seal numbers on the Provisional Ballot box and the Early Ballot box , I noticed the numbers on the Early Ballot Box did not match I saw Frank Villers with his hand under the lid of the Early Ballot box .
I stated these zip ties Seal need to be tightened .
Nobody should be able to get their hand or anything else in these boxes .
Frank quickly tightened all of them .
At that point Jason Nevins stated " if you need to break seals I have more in my pocket . "
So the supply of seals is plenty ?
Having extra in his pocket means the equipment and sealed containers can be compromised !
I then asked , if signatures were needed on the paper tapes that was inside the Optical Scanner ?
I was told no they already on the tape from this morning , I saw none .
I asked what goes in the pink bubble sip lock baggie .
I was told the memory counter .
I asked , how are we supposed to seal this zip lock baggie ?
I was told by Jason Nevins it is SEALED with a zip lock .
I told Mr. Nevins the definition of a SEAL is something that must be broken to be opened .
I then ask Mr. Nevins if he every saw the HBO Documentary , Hacking Democracy ?
Mr. Nevins stated " I could have written the book " .
I told Mr. Nevins , if this is so , he should understand my concerns .
I then told Mr. Nevins the memory counter needs to be placed in something that can be SEALED .
Mr. Nevins then stated what is your problem lady ?
This is n't a certified election anyways .
We do n't count 45 % of the vote anyway , ( could this be the 540 Provisional Ballots ? )
He was getting ready to take the memory counter and drive off alone .
I told Mr. Nevins I wanted to go with him he told me NO !
I stated I would follow him .
He left very quickly and would not wait to allow me to follow him .
Frank Villers quickly drew me a map to the church and I was out the door .
I could not keep up with Mr. Nevins unless I was to go over the speed limit .
When I arrived at the Church , it is on the East side Scottsdale Rd. just north of Dynamite .
I pulled into the parking lot .
I stopped close to a group of people standing by a white van .
I was going to ask them if I was at the right place .
Then I saw Mr. Nevins charging me and screaming at me in a very hostel voice " did you read the manual ? "
" Did you read the manual ? "
He screamed this at me at least three times .
I replied " I read it and I was here to observe . "
For what ever reason the voting poll that I worked at was the one that held up everything .
What I mean is it took until almost 12:00 midnight to deliver the paper ballots , the provisional ballots , early ballots and what every other , documentation was to be delivered .
Why did it take so long ?
And were the Seal numbers the same as when I left or were they changed ?
Is there documentation kept when a seal must be changed and by who ?
Or were the woman busy writing a report on me because I had to demand my right to vote repeatedly ?
I see many problems in this whole system that allows for voting fraud !
It appears to be set up to deliberately make it difficult for the American people to exercise there right to vote ?
Why did the Signature Roster fail so many voters ?
Why where there so many voters marked they requested early ballots when they claimed they did not .
Why was there so many voters sent mailings of the location of their polling place but they were not in our book
Why are we allowing Early Ballots to be manipulated and treated in the same manor as Provisional Ballots ?
Why were we trained to manipulate the voters and control the crowds with long lines in the cold .
We should have had three signature books , alphabetically divided into thirds , so that we can truly provide good customer services , and move these people through the voting process in a considerate orderly fashion .
Why was there 540 out of 1291 votes forced to vote Provisional , that is 41 % not counted within 24 hours of closing the polls ?
Why were the voters lied to , they were told repeatedly their Provisional Ballot would be counted that night with the others .
Why were our maps of such poor quality ?
People were unable to locate where they lived in order to locate their polling place ?
( The map was lacking streets and basic landmarks )
Why were there no printed pads with the Election Hot Line Number printed up to pass out to voters ?
Or better yet COMPLAINT FORMS at each polling place .
Why where voters told they could not turn in their early ballot ( it could become a spoiled Ballot ) and get a new one to become a walk in voter ?
Why does the memory counter leave the building with only one person , the Trouble Shooter ( Mr. Nevins ) in a zip lock baggie with NO SEAL ?
Why does the Trouble Shooter have a pocket full of extra seals that can be used whenever needed ?
How can Mr. Nevins be of the understanding this is not a certified election when he has been given the job of TROUBLE SHOOTER ?
( The one with a pocket full of extra seals and keys and the controller of the memory counter .
The one with enormous power and control )
Why would the TROUBLE SHOOTER ( Mr. Nevins ) state we do n't count 45 % of the Ballots ?
What gave Barbara Owings and Sharron Hayes the right to disallow me from voting ?
When all of my identification matched the signature Roster and I was in the building before the polls closed and I stated repeatedly as soon as things let up I needed to vote .
And there were people still people filling out their Provisional Ballots ?
I want to know what the percent of Provisional Ballots at each and every voting poll in the State of Arizona ?
It is because of all these issues , I was witness to , I want to file a formal complaint against : Jason Nevins , Barbara Owings and Sharron Hayes and Frank Villers .
Due to their abuse of power , their treatment of voters and for not upholding the oath we all took before the polls opened .
After what I witnessed I believe the Arizona Primary Election has been compromised .
I believe after being witness to more then 14 hours of manipulation and controlled mass confusion at my Polling Place on February 5 , 2008 , I am convinced there is corruption within our electoral system .
There is not a shadow of doubt in my mind , it does not matter who votes , what matters is , who counts the votes !
I sincerely pray that those of you who read this letter , will act with do diligence and peruse justice and truth for all Americans .
Sincerely ,
Jeneen Zucker

A Malaysian teen - ager woken by a night - time noise dashed off a warning text message to her mother just in time to be rescued from an intruder who burst into her bedroom .
REUTERS / Vivek Prakash
KUALA LUMPUR ( Reuters ) - A Malaysian teen - ager woken by a night - time noise dashed off a warning text message to her mother just in time to be rescued from an intruder who burst into her bedroom .
Alerted by the mother ’s screams , relatives rushed to the rescue , breaking down a door and scaring off the man , who escaped through the back of the house , the New Straits Times said .
Salima Mohamad Noor , 17 , said a man broke into her bedroom and placed a knife at her neck just as she finished sending the message on her cellular telephone .
“ I was terrified and started screaming when he threatened to kill me , ” the newspaper quoted Salima as saying .
“ He also said no one would come to my rescue as he had already locked my mother ’s bedroom door from the outside . ”
But her mother ’s loud screams drew the attention of Salima ’s uncle , who kicked open the front door , frightening away the intruder , the paper added .
About 80 percent of Malaysia ’s population of roughly 26 million own a cell phone , statistics show , with many teenagers proficient in text messaging , as a cheaper way of talking to friends than telephone calls .
President Bush says of low polling numbers ' what am I supposed to do , get down in the fetal position because of your polls ? '
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
A federal grand jury is said to be investigating the role of Blackwater Worldwide security guards in the shooting deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad .
The Blackwater guards involved in the Sept. 16 shooting at Nisoor Square in west Baghdad initially were given limited immunity from prosecution by State Department investigators in exchange for their statements about what happened .
One senior FBI official close to the investigation told The Associated Press last week that he was aware of evidence that could indicate 14 of the shootings were unjustified .
Blackwater contends that its convoy was attacked before its guards opened fire , but the Iraqi government 's investigation concluded that the shootings were unprovoked .
The Justice Department has declined to comment on whether a grand jury has been impaneled to hear the case , but ABC News reported Monday that a number of Blackwater security guards have been subpoenaed to appear before the panel here next week .
A Blackwater spokeswoman , Anne Tyrrell , declined to comment Monday on whether the company had received subpoenas or whether its employees had been asked to testify .
" We have always supported stringent accountability for the industry , we still do , and if somebody was complicit in wrongdoing we would want that person to be held accountable , " Tyrell told The Washington Post .
" We will cooperate with any inquiry or investigation and will withhold further comment until the results are complete and made available . "
ABC said it had obtained statements given to State Department diplomatic security agents .
According to the statements , only five guards acknowledged firing their weapons in the incident .
Twelve other guards witnessed the events but did not fire , according to the statements .
Officials cautioned that the decision to begin a grand jury inquiry did not mean that prosecutors had decided to charge anyone with a crime in what they said was a legally complex case , The New York Times reported .
Some government lawyers have expressed misgivings about whether a federal law exists that would apply to the actions Blackwater employees are accused of committing , the Times reported .
Iraq , meanwhile , is demanding the right to prosecute the Blackwater bodyguards .
The Iraqi government finding that Blackwater 's men were unprovoked echoed an initial incident report by U.S. Central Command that indicated " no enemy activity involved " in the incident .
The U.S. Central Command oversees military operations in Iraq .

In late October , 1907 , the American financial system appeared to be on the verge of collapse .
The trouble had begun with a seemingly minor event — a failed attempt at stock - market speculation by a bank owner named F. A. Heinze — but it spread quickly after news of Heinze ’s losses prompted a run on his banks by worried depositors .
In a matter of days , financial institutions with connections to Heinze were facing similar withdrawal frenzies , and the stock market was falling precipitously .
Amid the turmoil , the financier J. P. Morgan stepped in .
Consulting with the Treasury Department , which committed millions in deposits to weak banks , Morgan browbeat bankers into bailing out struggling institutions , funnelled money to cash - starved brokers , and even convinced clergymen in New York City to dedicate their Sunday sermons to the need for “ calmness and confidence . ”
Within a few weeks , the fear and chaos had subsided , and the “ panic of 1907 ” left only a small dent in the U.S. economy .
A hundred years later , in the midst of what you might call the panic of 2007 , many investors are hoping that a Morgan - style rescue plan will have similarly beneficial effects .
The plan , which was unveiled last Thursday , after weeks of orchestration by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , seeks to stabilize the chaotic subprime - loan market by freezing the interest rates of some borrowers .
Although Paulson works for the government , his scheme involves no action by the state .
Instead , he has relied , much as Morgan did , on collective suasion , assembling representatives of the many parties involved — mortgage lenders and servicers , investors who bought mortgage bonds , and borrowers — and pushing them toward a solution that , in theory , will leave the economy better off .
The plan targets a looming crisis .
Many subprime mortgages came with so - called teaser rates — interest rates that start out low but quickly reset to become significantly higher .
Many of those loans — more than three hundred and fifty billion dollars ’ worth , in fact — are going to reset next year .
That means that hundreds of thousands of people who are currently able to pay their mortgages are about to see their payments rise by hundreds of dollars a month .
If the credit and housing markets were more buoyant , these people might be able to refinance their loans or sell their homes .
But the sharp decline in housing prices and the tightening of credit standards has closed off those options for most subprime borrowers , which pretty much guarantees a big increase in the number of foreclosures .
The Paulson plan is meant to buy borrowers — and , arguably , the economy — some time , by postponing the interest - rate resets for five years .
Not for everyone , though .
The plan sets up a system of triage , separating borrowers into three categories : those who will be able to keep paying after the rates reset , or else refinance their loans ; those who can pay now but wo n’t be able to when the rates go higher ; and those for whom even the current rates are too high .
Only the second group will get help .
Also , the plan does n’t go into effect until next year — if your loan resets on December 31st , you ’re out of luck .
In theory , this solution is one that lenders could have arrived at on their own .
Lenders often lose less money on a renegotiated loan than on a foreclosure , so they should be well equipped to triage bad loans , separating the workable from the truly hopeless cases .
So why did the government need to get involved ?
One reason is that so many loans are going bad that the companies servicing them do n’t have the people or the skills to evaluate them on a case - by - case basis .
( A recent study found , for instance , that mortgage servicers renegotiated only one per cent of loans that reset in the first part of this year . )
And , because most of these loans have been packaged into securities and sold to outside investors , the process of renegotiating mortgages is now far more complicated than just talking to the loan officer at your local bank .
Paulson ’s plan streamlines and simplifies the process by creating rough - and - ready definitions of creditworthiness .
The Treasury Department ’s sponsorship also permits a degree of collusion that might normally be considered illegal — banks are n’t typically allowed to work together to set loan prices .
And it reduces , although it certainly does n’t eliminate , the risk that the investors who actually own these mortgages will sue to prevent the wholesale renegotiation of the loans they own .
It ’s a powerful example of the way government can shape markets without ever passing a law or a new regulation .
Unfortunately , it ’s also an example of the limits of such intervention .
Although the plan will provide real relief for at least some homeowners , it ’s more like a Band - Aid than like the major surgery that some of the hype makes out .
That ’s because at this point interest - rate resets are just a small part of the mortgage - market problem .
Postponing rate resets does n’t change the fact that too many people spent far too much borrowed money on houses with prices that were far too high , and that they are now stuck in homes that they can’t really afford and ca n’t sell .
Even with the interest - rate freeze , foreclosures will keep rising .
More important , problems in the credit markets are no longer limited to subprime loans ; rather , they involve a wholesale reëvaluation of risk , fuelled by a deep sense of distrust in the way the financial system rates and values assets like mortgages .
For these problems , there ’s only so much that even the government can do .
In 1907 , J. P. Morgan was able to come to the rescue not just because he could get all the people who mattered into one room but because he was facing a clear problem with a clear solution .
Those were the days . ♦

When Cordelia Cowsill was born , her future looked bleak indeed .
She was suffering from an incurable genetic condition for which the only possible hope was to have half her brain removed .
Doctors warned her parents , Amanda and Martyn Cowsill , that their daughter would never walk , talk , cry or smile like a normal child - even if she survived .
Scroll down for more ...
But at the age of five , Cordelia is walking on her own and is even able to enjoy kicking a football .
" It was a difficult decision , but the operation was a lifeline , " said 39 - yearold Mrs Cowsill , a teaching assistant .
" It was like she was reborn and now she 's doing really well . "
Cordelia , from Oldham , was born with an hereditary condition called Tuberous Sclerosis .
It caused non- cancerous tumours to develop on Cordelia 's brain and meant that she suffered up to 70 epileptic fits a day .
The disorder affects one in 7,000 babies , but only a handful suffer the severe form that Cordelia has .
Her older brother Oliver , has a very mild form and Cordelia is the sixth known person in her family to inherit it .
Scroll down for more ...
Within hours of her birth at the Royal Manchester Children 's Hospital , she began to suffer a potentially deadly epileptic fit every few minutes .
Medics decided that the only way to stop them was to remove the tumours
which were affecting most of the right side of her brain , in an operation known as a hemispherectomy .
Fewer than 20 of these operations are performed in the UK each year .
However , doctors warned Mrs Cowsill and her husband , a business development manager , that there was only a 50 per cent chance that their daughter , then aged 17 months , would survive the seven - hour surgery .
" We knew she did n't really have any other option , " Mrs Cowsill added .
" Cordelia was having 70 fits a day even on the medication .
" She just could n't have carried on like that .
I 'm sure she would have died as one of the fits would have killed her .
Fortunately , Cordelia survived the operation in April 2003 , and was home within a month .
Doctorssay that most of the functions which would have been carried out by the missing half of her brain will eventually transfer to the left side , although her rehabilitation is likely to be slow .
But Mrs Cowsill added : " Cordelia is our little princess .
" She 's a very sociable little girl who enjoys learning things and is always running around , tiring me out .
She 's a real battler . "
In a recent web search , I found the following comment in a programming .
reddit.com thread from eight months ago , completely by accident :
I think prog.reddit will continue to move in phases ... a couple of days ago , someone complained about a drop - off in Haskell articles , today there were 4 or 5 ... next time Django or Rails does something worth noting , there 'll be a plethora of Python / Ruby stuff .
Despite its limb - gnawing tedium , Coding Horror will continue to rank high .
I personally think describing what I do here as " limb - gnawing tedium " is a bit hyperbolic .
But it made me laugh .
I can understand where the commenter is coming from ; the web is chock full of content that absolutely bores me to tears .
If I stopped and wrote a comment bemoaning every boring blog post or web page I 've ever found , I 'd scarcely have time to do anything else .
Such comments would also be a bit of a downer for the author , as I 'm sure someone is interested in that particular topic .
The whole point of putting content on the internet is to find an audience , however tiny that audience might end up being .
Maybe you 're not a member of the audience , and that 's OK .
I try to avoid blogging about blogging because it 's such a cliche .
And it 's boring .
However , after digging a bit deeper in the programming .
reddit.com comments , I became concerned :
What I do n't like about " Coding Horror " : the title promises " Daily WTF " style entertainment , but does n't deliver .
" Coding Horror " ought to be about people coding dynamic web pages entirely in SQL , or having some mission critical system written in a cryptic version of csh .
This is a profound misunderstanding .
If you 're coming here looking for that sort of entertainment , you 're bound to be disappointed .
I 'd like to think this site is the opposite of The Daily WTF .
I apologize for the confusion .
Allow me to explain .
First , the literal explanation .
The sidebar of Steve McConnell 's seminal book , Code Complete , contains a series of icons denoting particular areas .
There 's a " Hard Data " icon , a " Key Point " icon , and a " Coding Horror " icon .
I have to talk a little bit about the influence this book had on me as a young developer .
I graduated from college in 1992 , and entered the field of professional software development at that point , at least in terms of being paid to do so .
I loved it , but I really had no idea what I was doing .
I was a young , inexperienced developer working in small business , where there are n't a lot of other developers to look to as mentors .
Nor was the internet a factor ; the internet did n't really hit until ' 95 for most people .
I was living in Denver at the time , and I frequented the Tattered Cover , a great independent bookstore .
Code Complete was originally published in May 1993 ; I stumbled across it while browsing the computer book section at the Tattered Cover sometime in 1994 .
I was floored .
Here 's this entire book about becoming a professional software developer , written in this surprisingly friendly , humane voice .
And it was backed by rational research and real data , not the typical developer " my brain is bigger than yours " chest - thumping .
I had found my muse .
Reading Code Complete was a watershed event in my professional life .
I read it three times in one week .
It immediately became my Joy of Cooking .
I did n't even know it existed , but it showed me that if you loved food enough , it was possible to go from being a mere cook to a real chef .
One of the most striking and memorable things about Code Complete , even to this day , is that Coding Horror illustration in the sidebar .
Every time I saw it on the page , I would chuckle .
Not because of other people 's code , mind you .
Because of my own code .
That was the revelation .
You 're an amateur developer until you realize that everything you write sucks .
YOU are the Coding Horror .
The minute you realize that , you 've crossed the threshold from being an amateur software developer into the realm of the professionals .
Half of being a good , competent software developer is realizing that you 're going to make tons of mistakes .
You will be your own worst enemy almost all the time .
It 's a lifestyle .
You 're living it right now .
You , me , all of us .
The problems start with us .
We 're all coding horrors .
This story from the Tao that Reginald Braithwaite posted is as good an explanation as any :
There was once a monk who would carry a mirror wherever he went .
A priest noticed this one day and thought to himself , " This monk must be so preoccupied with the way he looks that he has to carry that mirror all the time .
He should not worry about the way he looks on the outside .
It 's what 's inside that counts . "
So the priest approached the monk and asked " Why do you always carry that mirror ? " , thinking this would surely prove his guilt .
The monk took the mirror from his bag and pointed it at the priest .
He said , " I use it in times of trouble .
I look into it and it shows me the source of my problems as well as the solution to my problems . "
If you 're horrified by what you see in the mirror , you are not alone .
I chose that title for my blog – with explicit permission from Steve – because it's a clever in - joke about becoming a humble professional programmer .
That 's what I try to do here .
I write to learn and explore topics that deal with computers and programming , and because I 'm easily bored , the topics I find most interesting tend to apply to a wide audience of programmers .
Maybe even people who do n't know they 're programmers yet .
To steal a phrase from the talented Rich Skrenta , I blog to help others and also to learn .
As it turns out both are aided by getting folks to actually read the stuff .
But that 's not the complete story .
I 'd be lying if I did n't admit that there 's an element of selfishness at work here .
I love computers and programming .
I love it so much it borders on obsession .
When I saw the movie Into The Wild , I was transfixed by the final note written into the margins of Dr. Zhivago by a doomed Christopher McCandless : " Happiness only real when shared . "
I realized , that 's it .
That 's it exactly .
That is what is so intensely satisfying about writing here .
My happiness only becomes real when I share it with all of you .

What do yoghurt pots , old Wellington boots and mobile phones have in common ?
They were all recycled and used to make the reception desk of this super - green new visitor centre .
Old tyres and inner tubes make up the roof cover and what 's more , the whole building can be entirely recycled at the end of its life .
The forest next door is proving handy – it supplies wood chips to power the boiler and is also where the wood used to clad the building came from .
A micro wind turbine and an array of photovoltaic panels supply the electricity .
Even the toilets are flushed with rainwater gathered on the roof and stored in a tank , reducing the amount taken from the village well .
The building last month won the prime minister 's Better Public Building award for 2007 .
The government praised the building for its " uncompromising commitment to sustainability " .

Wind turbines and birds are not ideal stable mates , but the RSPB is thinking about installing one at its newest - and greenest - visitor centre in the Thames Gateway .
The carbon - neutral development already uses sheep wool for insulation and nearly all materials were locally sourced .
Two translucent roof cones allow daylight in and also glow in the dark , acting as beacons for those trekking back late at night across the marshes .
The building was opened last year by Bill Oddie , the nation 's favourite twitcher , and it also found its way on to the long list for the UK's highest architectural accolade , the Stirling prize .
Gary and Keron Lawson , who live in one of four , two - bedroom bungalows say it 's like living the dream .
And paying just £ 3.80 per week for running costs , it does n't sound far off .
There 's no conventional heating or cooling system and the development has zero carbon emissions .
The houses are earth - sheltered , meaning the north , west and east walls are covered by an earth mound , almost like putting the building in its very own overcoat .
Only the south face of the house is left open to capture heat and light from the sun .
" Light comes through the full - length windows and it stays at 72 °F throughout the winter , " Lawson says .
" We had n't heard of anything like this at all before we moved in . "
The scheme was commissioned and is managed by Pedders Way housing association .
More earth - sheltered homes are in the pipeline and an earth - sheltered business campus .

If you 've got children and you want them to be green , Kingsmead primary is the ideal school .
The school is designed as a learning tool for pupils to understand more about the environment .
They 've got active voltage displays for the solar panels , as well as an electronic meter that shows how much rainwater is collected by the inverted roof .
To stop the little ones nodding off during a long sweaty lesson they 've also installed a system ( run on renewable energy , of course ) that automatically opens and shuts the windows , skylights and blinds , allowing fresh air to flow through the building and shading pupils where necessary .
You 'd expect the National Trust to have an environmentally sound building and luckily enough , they occupy one of the greenest offices in the UK .
Carbon emissions are 65 % less than similar developments , largely due to an of array photovoltaic panels on the roof , which provide 30 % of the annual electricity use .
Eco-friendly materials , such as PVC - free linoleum and water - based paints were used throughout the building .
There are some ingenious ideas here too , like the carpets in the building made from wool from the Trust 's flocks of Herdwick sheep and the ventilation snouts on the roof which come from recycled beer cans .
The secret to the success of Britain 's greenest warehouse is cannabis .
Or rather , hemp , which turns out to be an excellent green construction material because it is fireproof , does n't degrade and is unattractive to vermin .
At the brewery , it was used with lime as cavity wall insulation for the main warehouse .
The building also claims to have the largest green roof in Britain .
It 's densely planted with alpine sedum mosses and traps most of the rainwater that falls onto it , reducing the risk of flooding .
Solar panels supply 80 % of the power needed to heat water , and rainwater collected in an underground tank is used to flush toilets and wash the centre 's vehicles .

The pupils at this school do n't need to travel down to Cornwall to visit the Eden project – they 've got their very own version .
There are four biomes in the new eco centre to replicate various types of ecosystems , including arid , alpine and wet climates .
Although compost toilets did n't make the final cut , there are some inventive reuses of materials .
The paving slabs that form the foundations are recycled from a derelict cinema , and the foundation piles are old food drums .
A nine - metre high wind turbine provides electricity for lighting and supplementary heating if needed .
East London is perhaps not where you 'd expect to find one of the country 's most sustainable building but these block of four zero - fossil energy flats have so impressed the government that both Ruth Kelly and Gordon Brown have paid it a visit .
Designed by pioneering eco-architect Bill Dunster , who was also behind the BedZed development in south London , the building is so well insulated there are no central heating systems in the flats .
The inhabitants – which include one of the architects who designed the development – get 40 % of their electricity from photovoltaic panels and 50 % from a micro wind turbine on the stair tower .
Hot water is provided by a boiler powered by wood pellets and the residents say three tonnes is enough to fuel the four flats for a year .
The show apartment cost 15 % more than an average property the same size , and was bought for £ 275,000 , prompting environmentalists to claim that there is a healthy appetite for eco-housing in the market place .

Next time you 're in Brighton and have tired of the usual tourist trappings , head north of the Lanes to what is rapidly becoming another stop on the sightseeing tour of the town .
Politically controversial because of its procurement by the council through the private finance initiative ( PFI ) process , the Jubilee library has won the hearts and minds of the locals for its design and environmental values .
The architecture , engineering and green elements are all blended into one here , using the cement in the building structure as an energy store to either heat or cool the building as necessary .
There are also solar - controlled louvres on the enormous glass frontage , which stop the building from over - heating .

Architect Sir Nicholas Grimshaw has found a better use than fish and chip wrapping for his old newspapers .
He 's used them as insulation for the floors , wall and roof of the Eden project 's offices , making it one of the best insulated buildings in the UK .
The building is raised off the ground on timber columns to minimise the volume of soil removed from the site during construction , and also to reduce the amount of cement ( one of the most un - eco - friendly products around ) needed to build it .
To top it all off , the development is entirely PVC - free .
So , next time you visit the Eden project , make sure you sneak a peek at the offices as well .

Next ' One day my men will be ready to die for me '

T wenty years from now , men will be ready to die for me , but not for you .
' This is what a cadet at the National Defence Academy in Khadakvasla , Pune , tells his friends pursuing engineering when they discuss how much money they will make in their careers compared to him .
It is an explosive response for someone who is just 21 but that is not what makes it so staggeringly impressive .
It is the belief with which it is said that gives it gravitas .
In a country bankrupt of many new heroes and an army of youngsters focused on campus placements and pay packages , the conviction of these young men is truly heartening .
To hear them speak convincingly about country and duty when nationalism is often restricted to tokenism .
The Indian Army confronts a worrying shortage of 11,200 officers .
At the NDA -- the premier training institute for future officers of the army , navy and air force -- the first term cadets number 197 , its lowest intake in many years ; the NDA 's average capacity is 300 per course .
About Rs 8,200 is what a newly commissioned officer gets paid after four - and - a- half years of rigorous training -- paltry compared to what Class 12 students at swanky call centres earn every month .
Most observers believe a revision in wages will bring in more aspirants into the armed forces , if and when it were to happen .
In spite of that , there are young men who think of the armed forces as their true calling .
Some have spurned other lucrative jobs , others have defied their parents to undergo three years of training at the NDA to become fine officers and gentlemen .
Rediff.com met some NDA cadets this week .
Men who will become leaders of men and of whom great things will be expected of one day .

Everyone agrees , however , that the main attraction is Coach Barta and the football program he has built amid wheat fields and water towers .
Not only does Hubbard Stadium attract more than 1,600 people to watch his team each home game , but Barta ’s scouting report for the coming opponent also becomes the hot topic of discussion throughout the week .
This week for Oakley , it runs 28 pages and kicks off simply with , “ This is the real deal , we must prepare well and quick . ”
“ We get it on Monday night , ” said Joe Windscheffel , the Redmen ’s senior quarterback .
“ As soon we get home , our dads start devouring it , and pretty soon , wherever you go in town , that ’s all anyone is talking about . ”
Barta , 62 , is quick to smile and is a gentle sort with a honey baritone .
Over 30 years here , he has won 273 games against 58 losses ( an .825 winning percentage ) and guided the Redmen to six state titles .
He has had plenty of offers to move up and on , but instead he stayed and watched dozens of his boys go to play college football .
One , Mark Simoneau , reached the National Football League .
Image Cards of the Redmen , like this of Joe Windscheffel , are traded at the elementary school .
“ He looks and sounds like a math teacher , which he is , and is about as laid - back as they come , ” Simoneau , a linebacker for the New Orleans Saints , said by telephone .
“ As good a coach as he is , he ’s a better guy .
He treats people like gold . ”

IBM 's technical support grunts may have won the battle for overtime pay , but the company has cooked a major catch to its peace agreement .
Big Blue is now conceding that about 7,600 IT specialists and tech support workers ( about 6 per cent of its US workforce ) need to be reclassified as being eligible for overtime wages .
But the company is simultaneously slashing the base pay of those employees by 15 per cent to compensate .
The salary cut is a result of a two - year - old dispute between the company and its techies about overtime wages .
In late 2006 , IBM payed $ 65 m to settle a class - action lawsuit in which 32,000 current and former technical support employees accused the company of illegally withholding overtime .
IBM says it wants to comply with US labor law , even though it thinks overtime qualifications are ambiguous .
Under the US Fair Labor Standards
Act , some " highly skilled " white collar workers such as executives , administrative , professional and certain IT employees are exempt from overtime pay .
IBM techies argued the company unjustly lumped its support staff into that category .
With the wage cut , IBM claims that because its tech grunts regularly work overtime anyway , paying less for the first 40 hours will let the company , and the employees , break even .
" Up until now , these people have been paid a competitive rate based on their skills , " IBM spokesman Fred McNeese told us .
" If we kept them at that salary , and you add the overtime to it , they would be paid an excess of competitive rates . "
McNeese said without the change the overtime wage hike would fall on IBM customers .
The company asserts that this " changing the mix " will be cost neutral to IBM .
Affected employees will " basically be making roughly the same before the change . "
" That 's a bogus claim they 're making , " said Lee Conrad , national coordinator for Alliance@IBM , a union that represents a small number of IBM employees .
" They are n't going to be able to make it up . "
Conrad said the company has recently been pushing back on the amount of OT allowed .
IBM said it wo n't discuss specific wages or the amount of overtime required for workers to compensate for the base pay cut .
According to Conrad , the average affected worker made about $ 80,000 a year before the cut .
With a 15 per cent reduction , their wages will fall to $ 68,000 .
That lands at around 5 - 6 hours of overtime needed per week .
Internal documents obtained by The Associated Press also indicate that one - third of affected workers do n't work enough hours to make up for the cut .
The AP 's papers , however , also ask IBM managers to spread assignments around so more employees will make up for the wage reduction .
Conrad argues that the wage cut is unnecessary since IBM has been flourishing , even in a declining economy .
The company earned $ 10.4bn in 2007 and expects earning per share growth to hit at least 15 per cent during 2008 .
The company , however , has relied on workers in low - cost centers such as Argentina , Brazil , China , India and Russia to achieve such results .
Some analyst have even speculated that IBM conspires to squeeze out US employees through unfavorable conditions , rather than rely on massive layoffs .
Idle conjecture , of course .
The wage change will start on February 1 , and will show up in IBM employee paychecks around the middle of that month .
Alliance@IBM is currently hosting a petition at their website and plans to picket in the near future . ®

The Antarctic " ozone hole " should repair in about half a century
Writing on the BBC News website , Joe Farman calls for faster phase - out of some ozone - destroying chemicals , and for the destruction of stockpiles .
The Montreal Protocol regulating these substances is 20 years old this week .
Some of Dr Farman 's arguments have been echoed by senior figures in the UN , and by European and US politicians .
He is critical of the agreement that allows developing countries to keep on using some ozone - depleting chemicals until 2040 .
It is surely time to consider collecting the existing stockpile , and destroying it
Read Joe Farman 's article
Joe Farman was one of three British Antarctic Survey scientists who reported signs of severe damage to the ozone layer over Antarctic - the " ozone hole " - in 1985 .
Member countries of the Montreal Protocol are meeting this week , again in Montreal , to review progress .
Faster , sooner , cheaper
The 1987 Montreal Protocol was designed to phase out chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons which were found to be depleting the ozone layer in the Earth 's stratosphere , the higher portion of the atmosphere .
The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet - B radiation from the Sun , which can cause skin cancers and other medical conditions , as well as harming wildlife .
Industrialised nations phased out almost all CFC production in 1995 , with developing countries having a deadline of 2010 .
Ozone - depleting chemicals are still used by some fire - fighting forces
These cause much less damage to the ozone layer ; but production in the developing world is now increasing so fast that there is renewed concern about their impact .
Current regulations mean that in 2015 , developing countries will have to freeze their HCFC use at or below the level it is then , phasing out entirely by 2040 .
" The rate of HCFC use is skyrocketing , " noted Clare Perry , senior ozone campaigner with the Environmental Investigation Agency ( EIA ) .
" So it 's actually going to cost less to phase it out sooner when investment in plant and equipment is at a lower level . "
French Environment Minister Nathalie Kosciusko - Morizet said the EU would be pushing for a faster phase - out at this week 's ozone treaty meeting .
" The schedule for eliminating HCFCs must be pushed up by 10 years - that will be the benchmark for deciding if the negotiations are succesful , " she said .
Accelerating the phase - out would require new funds from the industralised world , as well as changes to the current funding regulations .
Joe Farman also wants cash set aside to combat leakage of ozone - depleting chemicals , such as the fire retardant halon 1301 , from developing world installations .
" There is some production in developing countries , " he writes , " but the main source is now through leaks from existing installations , and during recycling .
It is surely time to consider collecting the existing stockpile , and destroying it . "
Perverse climate
HCFCs also contribute to climate change .
They are much more potent , molecule for molecule , than carbon dioxide ; one byproduct of HCFC manufacture , HFC23 , is 11,700 times more powerful .
Joe Farman discovered major Antarctic ozone depletion in the 1980s
And President Bush 's chief environmental advisor James Connaughton said that accelerating HCFC phase - out by 10 years would " produce at least twice the reduction ( in greenhouse gas emissions ) of the Kyoto Protocol " .
However , some environmentalists believe there is an element of political spin here intended to divert attention from carbon dioxide , which is much more important overall as a greenhouse gas .
There is also concern that the Kyoto Protocol may be creating a " perverse incentive " for companies to boost HCFC use .
The protocol 's Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) funds the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries .
It can be used to pay for equipment to trap and burn HFC23 .
" In 2005 , the destruction of HFC23 accounted for 64 % of the value of all CDM projects , and 51 % in 2006 , " Dr Farman writes .
" There is currently much debate on whether carbon trading based so heavily on burning HFC23 constitutes sustainable development . "

In a month that has seen several people killed after being tasered , a UN committee of ten experts has ruled that tasers constitute torture and are capable of killing .
This flies in the face of the manufacturer 's statement , which is that any resulting deaths after a taser is used are " attributable to other factors . "
Intended to prevent officers from having to use lethal firearms , the taser has arguably become well established as just another tool in a regular officer 's arsenal for use in scenarios where a firearm would never be considered .
As for what effect this ruling will have on the sale of tasers , we 're guessing " not much " until all the involved parties come into agreement about the lethality ( or lack thereof ) of the taser .
US knew Musharraf planned to institute emergency rule : report John Byrne

We need you : 488 donors needed to close budget gap for investigative news .
The Bush Administration knew that Pakistani strongman Pervez Musharraf planned to institute emergency rule but did not act or speak out about the plan , according to officials with knowledge of the discussion who spoke anonymously in Friday 's Wall Street Journal .
" In the days before the Nov. 3 announcement , the general 's aides and advisers forewarned U.S. diplomats in a series of meetings in Islamabad , according to Pakistani and U.S. officials , " the paper said .
Because the US response was " muted , " Pakistan interpreted American silence as a green light to instituting martial law , quickly deposing an intransigent Supreme Court , which had ruled against the general in the past .
" One of Gen . Musharraf 's closest advisers said U.S. criticism was muted , which some senior Pakistanis interpreted as a sign they could proceed , " the Journal said .
" ' You do n't like that option ?
You give us one , ' the adviser says he told his American interlocutors .
' There were no good options . ' "
A U.S. official " familiar with the discussions " told the paper the talks were part of " ' intensive efforts ' to dissuade Gen .
Musharraf from declaring a state of emergency . "
" There was never a green light , " the U.S. official told the New York daily .
On Friday , Pakistan also denounced the Commonwealth 's suspension of its membership -- the British - led organization of former colonies -- while an opposition party said its exiled leader was taking key steps to return to the emergency - ruled country .
The government condemned the banishment from the Commonwealth as " unreasonable and unjustified " and said the 53 - nation body , composed mainly of Britain and its former colonies , had failed to appreciate Pakistan 's " serious internal crisis " in demanding that it immediately restore democracy .
The Journal also provided background to the country 's 2002 election , in which there were widespread claims of voter fraud and election tampering by the military .
" The Bush administration did n't raise a fuss , signaling to the military leader that Washington was n't going to push him for democracy , a former CIA official said .
" An ambitious U.S. aid program to reform Pakistan 's political and education systems largely served to strengthen Islamabad 's military and counterterrorism operations , say current and former U.S. officials . "
Also Friday , Saudi Arabia signaled it might abet an opposition candidate 's attempt to return to power .
The return of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from Saudi Arabia could bolster opponents of President Gen. Pervez Musharraf ahead of Jan. 8 parliamentary elections .
Sharif 's plan was announced Thursday hours after the Supreme Court , packed with pliant judges , swept away the last legal obstacles to Musharraf 's new five - year term as president .
On Friday , the handpicked court also declared Musharraf 's seizure of emergency powers was legal .
" All acts and actions taken are also validated , " Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar said .

The two stocks with the highest option implied volatility trading this year released results today .
The 2 Stocks were ; ADHD and SNSS , two biopharma stocks that had implied volatility over 300 % and in the days leading to the announcement of their phase III results implied vol spiked to over 500 % .
Today the results came out and both companies disappointed .
Both stocks gapped lower .
ADHD is down aronud 54 % at $ 6.42 currently and SNSS is down 76 % at $ 1.60 currently .
If you happened to listen to the conference call of ADHD this moring , Piper Jaffray was the first to ask questions and they first congratulated the company on the results and came out later saying that they reiterate a buy with a target of $ 42 .
This can be very confusing for investors to hear , but the price of the stock does n't lie .
Quote from Piper Jaffray from TheStreet.com
The days leading up to the announcement ADHD stock was zig zagging up and down 15 % a day .
The stock was a big gamble , with around a 6 million share float , it was poised for a large move on the news release .
I do n't know who in the world would be buying or shorting shares ahead of the news release .
The real money to be made was in the options .
The OTM $ 40 calls on ADHD were trading at over $ 1 the previous trading day and now they will expire worthless ,
The stock would have had to spike around 300 % in order for you to take any heat on the trade .
Meanwhile the $ 5 puts were trading over $ 0.50 the previous day and now are going for around $ 0.20 .
The ideal trade on this stock was selling the strangle ( $ 5 puts and $ 40 calls ) .
Something to note leading up to the press release was the short sale ban imposed by some brokers ( ie. Interactive Brokers ) and the price drop leading up the final days before the news release .
One can speculate that the only person that would short a stock with pending phase III results was doing so with knowledge of what the outcome was .
Here are some charts and numbers .

It is a sad fact of life that , in this day and age , arguments are not won with sound logic and reasoning .
Instead , applying the principle of framing an argument is much more effective at swaying public opinion .
So the next time you try to make headway introducing Test Driven Development ( or even simply introducing writing automated unit tests at all ) into an organization and are rebuffed with …
Do n’t bring your fancy schmancy flavor of the week agile manifesto infested “ methodology ” here kiddo .
I ’ve been writing software my way for a loooong time …
You can reply with …
I ’m sorry , but I ’m not a fan of Bug Driven Development .
I think Test Driven Development is not without its challenges , but it ’s a better alternative .
Either you ’re with us , or against us .
Are you a bug lover ?
Bug Driven Development gives comfort to the bugs .
UPDATE : this is an example of my dry humor .
I do n’t believe that “ Framing ” is a good way to win an argument and I would never actually say or recommend saying anything similar to to this .
It ’s meant as a bit of a joke , but with a point .
A team that is not focused on automated testing of some sort throughout the lifecycle of the project is effectively embracing Bug Driven Development .
Bugs are going to drive the development cycle at the end of the project .
Do n’t believe me though , look at the research done by others .
In Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering , Robert Glass points out …
Fact 31 .
Error removal is the most time - consuming phase of the life cycle .
In Rapid Development , Steve McConnell relates …
Shortcutting 1 day of QA activity early in the project is likely to cost you from 3 to 10 days of activity downstream .
In other words , if you do n’t control the bugs , the bugs control your schedule .

In a perfect world , there are some areas for which we would no longer need a " debate " and could move on to finding solutions .
The question of whether waterboarding is torture should not need debate .
The question of global warming should not need debate .
Global warming is real .
The scientific community agrees -- that is , those not on the payrolls of major polluters like Exxon .
But leave it to CBS and anchor Katie Couric to keep pushing the framing that the debate lies with the existence of global warming and its causes .
And in the interest of " informing " the electorate ( when in reality , they are simply retarding the discussion ) , Couric poses that question to the 10 major candidates .
Of course , two of the candidates question global warming -- Republican Fred " Why'd I wake up for this ? "
Thompson and Mike " I reject evolution , why not all other scientific documentation ? "
Huckabee .
Think Progress : Huckabee responds that " scientifically , " he does n't know whether global warming is " overblown . "
Thompson goes a step further , claiming that the " state of entitlements " and " extremists " who " want to do drastic things to our economy " are the real problems :
THOMPSON : There are a lot of unanswered questions .
We do n't know to the extent this is a cyclical thing .
This may or may not effect very much .
The extremists are the ones who want to do drastic things to our economy before we have more answers as to how much good we can do and whether people in the other parts of the world are going to contribute .
It 's the fact that our entitlements are bankrupting the next generation .
We 're spending the money of those yet to be born and we can't continue that way .
Thompson and Huckabee are wrong .
The debate is over about whether manmade global warming is a threat .
Even members of the Bush White House have admitted so .
We asked you what you think the best post - apocalyptic vehicle would be , assuming you could fuel it up and were unable to stay in one place due to the lack of other resources ( and likely abundance of radioactive zombies looking for a tasty brain to munch upon ) .
The response we received from commenters was phenomenal .
We 've culled the comments down to our ten top responses .
Some we expected and some we did n't , and we even had a quasi- fictional vehicle thrown in for some fun .
After you 've had a moment to take a gander at the zombie - fighting machines - o - war below , drop all the way down to the bottom and help us cull the wheat from the proverbial radioactive chaff and determine the ultimate ride for living through the bleak world that awaits us .
The very fate of humanity may rest upon your decision .

New York , NY – Confusion has surrounded Sony 's announcement that the company would soon be offering DRM - free music .
Instead of the simple process of purchasing the music online from retailers like Amazon , Apple 's iTunes Music Store or Emusic , Sony has taken a different path .
Thomas Hesse , President of Sony BMG Music Entertainment 's Global Digital Business and US Sales , outlined the seven - step process consumers must go through to receive DRM - Free music during his thrilling Powerpoint presentation :
The consumer must visit an outlet like Best Buy or Circuit City and buy a card which has an encrypted code on the back .
The consumer must then decode an encrypted message on the back of the card which contains latitude and longitude coordinates .
At those coordinates a small key has been buried in the ground .
That key will have a Web site imprinted on it .
The consumer must then visit that web site where they are given the location of a locker in a bus or train station where they can use the key to open to get a slip of paper .
The slip of paper can be traded for a Golden Ticket at McDonald's .
The Golden Ticket can be insert at special kiosks located at Pump - N - Pay and Fill - N - Flush gas stations that allows the consumer to download the DRM - Free songs in .sny format onto a special Memory Stick available for purchase at the locations .
Hesse said , “ The new process gives consumers access to DRM - Free music , while also ensuring music retailers still play a part in the process .
I think it 's a fair compromise that should satisfy everyone . ”
Many asked if the process was a bit excessive just to get a song .
“ We have to make sure that DRM - Free music does n't get into the wrong hands .
With this process we can be sure that terrorists wo n't get their hands on the new Celine Dion record and use it in some sort of attack , ” Hesse answered .
Puzzled journalists nodded in agreement at the statement .
Hesse also noted that royalties to musicians would have to be reduced to pay for the added infrastructure needed for DRM - Free music .
“ Somebody has to bury all those keys , ” he said .

Many pundits argue that Sony is using the complicated process to discourage purchases of DRM - Free music , so they can declare it a failure .
“ This is standard operating procedure for Sony , ” said Rory Nursepaddle of drmfreenation.com .
“ Just like they did with the PS3 , they announce a product that 's doomed to fail then go back to their old ways . ”
No consumers were excited by the news .

NOVEMBER 8-- Mug shot aficionados are likely aware that TSG has unearthed a host of previously unseen celebrity mug shots , from Tupac Shakur and Andre The Giant to Johnny Cash and 50 Cent .
Today we 're adding to that list with this marvelous booking photo of David Bowie , which was snapped in Rochester , New York following the singer 's March 1976 arrest on a felony pot possession charge .
Bowie , 29 at the time , was nabbed along with Iggy Pop and two other codefendants at a Rochester hotel following a Saturday concert .
Bowie was held in the Monroe County jail for a few hours before being released .
The Rochester Police Department mug shot was taken three days after Bowie 's arrest , when the performer appeared at City Court for arraignment .

Solid state disks ( SSDs ) are a flash - based memory storage device that carries an insane price premium in the current market .
They will usually cost $ 600 to $ 1,000 as an upgrade from the manufacturer or computer parts store , making them outside the price range of many consumers .
A new cheaper ( slightly slower ) option is available thanks to low - cost , high - capacity flash cards .
This option is using a cheap compact flash to SATA adapter , and purchasing a moderately fast memory card that would fill your storage needs .
For this review I aimed to keep the price less than $ 100 just to show how affordable this option could be .
( view large image )
Specifications of the SATA adapter and Compact flash cards used for this review :
Addonics CF To SATA HDD Adapter

Setup
One nice perk of these types of devices is they do n’t require any drivers to work on any system .
There are a few requirements though ; the system must have SATA , and the compact flash card must support DMA modes .
Some older flash cards will have problems , but since 4GB to 16GB flash cards did n’t economically exist a few years ago , this should not be a problem .

Installing the operating system was the only other setup required for this review , and it follows the same installation process as any other Windows XP install process .
If you are wondering why I did n’t pick Vista , our review budget limited us to 4GB cards that were fast enough to compete against a standard hard drive .
If you move your budget up $ 50 or $ 100 more , you will open yourself up to 8GB and larger cards that would be fine for installing Vista .
Performance
Now you are probably wondering what the performance difference is between a standard 7200rpm drive , true SSD , and my DIY SSD .
For this review I cover those three drives , as well as a handful of others to give you the best idea of what to expect .
The first lineup of benchmarks comparison use the software PerformanceTest , and the included disk test .
As you can see , the DIY SSD performs quite well , even outperforming a true SSD found in the Sony VAIO TZ .
Disk Speed Apple MacBook Air
4200 rpm 1.8 " HD 1.8 " SSD in
Sony TZ DIY SSD 7200 rpm
2.5 " HD Memoright
128GB SATA SSD Sequential Read 16.3 27.7 30.1 40.9 37.7 Sequential Write 22.7 13.4 21.0

59.2 73.4
For HDTune , we included more drives into the comparison , including multiple types of compact flash card to show you how much speed can vary between cards .
( Note : Not all compact flash cards are made equal , and the old 512MB Sandisk card has very poor access times . )

PCMark05 benchmarks :
( Higher scores mean better performance )
Lenovo T60 2.16GHz w/ 7200rpm XP : 4816
Lenovo T60 2.16GHz w/ DIY SSD XP : 3930
I figure the main difference between these two scores is the 7200rpm drive has a much faster disk transfer rate .
Still , if you violently shake a notebook with a standard hard drive while it ’s accessing the drive you will kill the drive .
You can violently shake a DIY SSD and nothing will happen .
Power Consumption
With the DIY SSD , I was expecting at least a little less power draw , but nothing was found in my use .
Idle power draw was around 15.3w for both the 7200rpm drive , and the DIY SSD .
Chances are the $ 30 adapter has nowhere near the power efficiency levels that a true SSD would have .
Conclusion
With this review I was planning on showing a proof of concept that it was possible to make your own SSD and did n’t expect that it would provide such great real world results .
While many very pricey performance SSDs exist , the module I assembled had greater speeds than the SSD found in an off the shelf notebook at a fraction of the price .
If you are on a budget and need an option for a notebook that sees very rough duty , or you just like snappy boot times you may want to check this out .
Pros
MUCH cheaper compared to any other SSD solution
You pick the flash module you trust most
Very small overall size compared to 2.5 " drives
Cons
On a perfect New Mexico winter day — with the sky almost 10 percent brighter than usual — Sandia National Laboratories and Stirling Energy Systems ( SES ) set a new solar - to - grid system conversion efficiency record by achieving a 31.25 percent net efficiency rate .
The old 1984 record of 29.4 percent was toppled Jan. 31 on SES ’s “ Serial # 3 ” solar dish Stirling system at Sandia ’s National Solar Thermal Test Facility .
The conversion efficiency is calculated by measuring the net energy delivered to the grid and dividing it by the solar energy hitting the dish mirrors .
Auxiliary loads , such as water pumps , computers and tracking motors , are accounted for in the net power measurement .
“ Gaining two whole points of conversion efficiency in this type of system is phenomenal , ” says Bruce Osborn , SES president and CEO .
“ This is a significant advancement that takes our dish engine systems well beyond the capacities of any other solar dish collectors and one step closer to commercializing an affordable system . ”
Serial # 3 was erected in May 2005 as part of a prototype six - dish model power plant at the Solar Thermal Test Facility that produces up to 150 kilowatts ( kW ) of grid - ready electrical power during the day .
Each dish unit consists of 82 mirrors formed in a dish shape to focus the light to an intense beam .
The solar dish generates electricity by focusing the sun ’s rays onto a receiver , which transmits the heat energy to a Stirling engine .
The engine is a sealed system filled with hydrogen .
As the gas heats and cools , its pressure rises and falls .
The change in pressure drives the pistons inside the engine , producing mechanical power , which in turn drives a generator and makes electricity .

Mrs. Clinton essentially conceded the three contests Tuesday morning by leaving Washington to campaign in Texas , and she signaled that she would not vigorously contest two Democratic races next week , a primary in Wisconsin and a caucus in Hawaii , where Mr. Obama spent much of his childhood .
If she loses in those two states , she will be 0 for 10 in nominating contests from Feb. 5 to March 4 , when Texas , Ohio , Rhode Island and Vermont hold primaries .
Mrs. Clinton ’s advisers say she will focus on winning over voters in Ohio and Texas to halt Mr. Obama ’s growing momentum and to try to stay close in the count of pledged delegates .
The Clinton campaign hopes that Ohio , with large numbers of lower - income and older voters , and Texas , with a large Latino electorate , will serve as a seawall against the Obama surge .
The Clinton campaign is also looking to Pennsylvania , which votes on April 22 , to provide another big - state victory and to stay competitive in the delegate chase .
“ We are going to sweep across Texas in the next three weeks bringing our message about what we need in America , the kind of president we need on Day One to be commander in chief and turn the economy around , ” Mrs. Clinton said at a rally in El Paso Tuesday night .
“ I ’m tested .
I ’m ready .
Let ’s make it happen . ”
But in the meantime , Mr. Obama will have a chance to begin persuading his party that his series of convincing wins in the last week represents a turning point in the campaign and that now is the time for Democrats to begin rallying around him as the strongest candidate to take back the White House .
In claiming victory , Mr. McCain congratulated Mr. Huckabee , saying : “ I want to commend my friend , Governor Huckabee , whose spirited campaign , many gifts as a communicator and advocate , and passionate supporters are a credit to him and our party .
He certainly keeps things interesting , a little too interesting at times tonight , I must confess .
But I have even more reason to appreciate just how formidable a campaigner he is . ”
Mr. McCain went on to add : “ We have come a long way in this campaign , and we have had our ups and downs .
But as luck , that product of opportunity and industry , would have it , we are approaching the end of the first half of this election on quite an upswing . ”
Despite losing all three primaries Tuesday , Mr. Huckabee said Republican voters still wanted to hear an alternative voice in deciding who should be the party ’s presidential nominee .
According to the FBI 's Internet Crime Complaint Center ( IC3 ) , the number of " vishing " complaints received by the center is increasing at what it calls " an alarming rate . "
Vishing and phishing are related , and both rely on e-mail as a means of delivering bait , but the two use different hooks in order to snag user data .
Vishing starts with an e-mail , like phishing , but requests that end - users contact a particular institution by phone in order to resolve an issue or re-secure personal data .
People who call the provided number will be asked to provide the same types of data phishers attempt to procure .
Ironically , vishing e-mails may even attempt to reassure recipients of their legitimacy by stating that the institution in question would never request customer financial data via e-mail or IM .
The actual specifics of the attack could vary widely , depending how large of an operation those behind the attack intend to run .
A standard vishing attack might use a phone number connected to an answering machine to harvest data .
A large - scale scamming operation , however , could theoretically employ several people to act as call - center workers — who might not even be aware that they 're in the employ of an illegal business operation .
Given the amount of outsourcing that goes on these days , it 's not exactly unusual to find yourself talking to " Ralph Smith " when you deeply suspect the person on the other end of the line is located in south Asia .
Vishing attacks are rising as voice - over - IP services become more popular .
VoIP users ( both commercial and residential ) are n't required to provide valid Caller ID information , which makes it an ideal platform from which to launch vishing attacks .
The two are n't directly linked — the FBI warning makes no particular mention of VoIP — but the service does provide a potential layer of obfuscation that is n't available with conventional phone service .
As always , the best defense against phishing or vishing is a little common sense .
If your bank or other financial institution with which you are affiliated contacts you requesting personal data , hang up ( or call them ) using only the number provided on the back of your card or official statement .
If you can't get confirmation that the request is actually legitimate , do n't follow up on it .
There is a dilemma right not facing all soulless television executives .
Now that reality TV has explored everything from You 'll Listen to Whatever Crap We Feed You ( American Idol ) , to You 're a F *** ing Liar : The Series ( Moment of Truth ) , to My Dad Can Kill Your Dad ( I think that 's actually what it 's called ) , where do you go from there ?
NBC , falling quickly behind
Fox in terms of depravity entertainment , think they have the answer : comedically boring sports .
The network has confirmed that they have rights to a 10 - episode curling competition , Rockstar Curling , in which winners get a shot at competing in the national championship .
Curling , like the thing with rocks and brooms that no one seriously watches ?
That 's the one .
" This show is all about the opportunity to expose American viewers to curling , " said Colin Campbell , Canadian president of mktgpartners and one of the creators of the show .
" We feel there might be some great athletes out there who might develop into good curlers given the chance . "
I know what you 're thinking .
When even the best curlers -- whoever they might be -- are complete unknowns in the U.S. , where does the " Rockstar " aspect come in ?
I 'm glad you asked .
NBC hopes to get rumored " closet curlers " Bruce Springsteen or Jon Bon Jovi in on the action , possibly as the host .
Whether or not they succeed in this mission , " Wanted Dead or Alive " will forever be tainted by the knowledge that Bon Jovi may have been riding his steel horse to a curling tournament .

Sorry , that should be DISINTEGRATOR , because sometimes products genuinely have earned the right to be capitalised .
So , the DISINTEGRATOR is a rubber band gun like no other .
The British - made gun can fire 40 rounds a second from 24 revolving barrels .
It ’s got a maximum range of 22 feet , takes five hours to charge , and then only lasts for around seven minutes seconds .
If you had one of these , your workmates would never flick rubber bands at your ears again .
And it even comes with a tripod .
Genius .

Florida Representative Robert Wexler is steadily closing in on 200,000 signatures on an online petition he posted in December calling for citizen support of impeachment proceedings commencing at once against Vice President Richard B. Cheney .
Rep .
Wexler , a member of the House Judiciary Committee where impeachment proceedings are considered , has said that he plans to submit this list to the HJC when the House of Representatives returns to session the week of January 15th .
Former Democratic Party Presidential nominee Senator George McGovern announced today that he has finally painfully come to agree that impeachment hearings are warranted and are in the best interest of the nation .
McGovern did so in an article published in Sunday 's Washington Post entitled : Nixon Was Bad .
These Guys Are Worse .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - EBay Inc's EBAY .O
Skype is expected to announce a deal soon with wireless service provider 3 to sell the Internet telephony company 's first mobile phone , a person familiar with the matter said on Friday .
Skype plans to introduce the phone in the countries where 3 operates , the source said , without giving a timeframe or saying where the phone would be sold first .
3 is the mobile venture of Hong Kong 's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd 0013.HK and operates in Australia , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Austria , Denmark , Italy , Ireland , Sweden and United Kingdom .
Skype spokesman Chaim Haas confirmed that 3 and Skype “ are working together on a new product to make Skype completely mobile , ” but declined to give full details .
Skype is expected to reveal its plans in the last week of October , the source said .
The company ’s software , which allows users to make free phone calls over the Internet to other Skype users , already works on some phones sold by 3 .
But the new phone is the first that Skype is having manufactured itself , and will be easier to use than existing cell phone models that support Skype , the source said .
According to its
Web site , 3 has more than 10 million customers including more than 3.5 million in the United Kingdom .
Representatives for 3 UK could not be reached for comment .
There are about 246 million registered Skype customers around the world , with about 10 million people using the service at any given moment , Haas said .
Earlier this week , eBay posted a third - quarter net loss , citing a $ 1.39 billion write - down of its Skype purchase .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
It 's lunchtime on Sand Hill Road , and Al Gore wants answers .
" How does the efficiency decline with latitude ? " he asks .
" What size community could be served by one plant ?
If a manufacturer like GE wanted to make smaller turbines , would the technology support a smaller scale ? "
We 're sitting in the giant conference room at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , where the partners hold their weekly meetings .
After loading his plate with Chinese food from a buffet , Gore is firing detailed questions at the management team of Ausra , a Kleiner - backed company in Palo Alto whose technology uses mirrors the width of a flatbed truck that focus the sun 's energy to generate electricity .
Once Gore is satisfied -- sunlight lags north of South Dakota , an Ausra plant can serve 120,000 homes , and yes , smaller turbines will work fine -- he shifts from inquisitor to fixer .
He was chatting with California Senator Barbara Boxer " on the way over , " he reports , and he is n't optimistic that Congress will extend the tax credits Ausra has been relying on .
On the upside , he offers on the spot to organize a summit highlighting the company 's solar thermal technology to educate lawmakers and other policymakers on its potential .
He also thinks a powwow at General Electric ( GE , Fortune 500 ) would be beneficial , even though Ausra is a tiny customer .
" I know Immelt well , " he says , referring to GE's CEO .
" We ought to set up a meeting . "
Gore appears utterly comfortable with this drill , but in fact he 's engaging in some on - the - job training .
The recovering politician , environmental activist , and Nobel laureate is adding another title to his r�sum� : venture capitalist .
After " a conversation that 's gone on for a year and a half , " according to Gore , he has decided to join his old pal John Doerr as an active , hands - on partner at Kleiner Perkins , Silicon Valley 's preeminent venture firm .
The move is more than another Colin Powell moment ( the former Secretary of State signed on as a Kleiner " strategic limited partner " two years ago and has hardly been heard from since ) .
Gore is joining the firm as Kleiner makes a risky move beyond information technology and health - care investing into the fast - growing and increasingly competitive arena of " clean technology . "
According to Doerr , by 2009 more than a third of Kleiner 's latest fund , which was raised in 2006 and totals $ 600 million , will be invested in technologies that aim to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide .
Already Kleiner has invested more than $ 270 million from various funds in 26 companies that make everything from microbes that scrub old oil wells to electric cars to noncorn ethanol .
Twelve of Kleiner 's 22 partners now spend some or all of their time on green investments .
In turn , Doerr , the master networker whose greatest hits include initial investments in Netscape , Amazon ( AMZN , Fortune 500 ) , and Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , will join the exclusive advisory board of Generation Investment Management .
That 's the $ 1 billion investment company Gore started three years ago in London with David Blood , the former head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management , to analyze and invest in publicly traded " sustainable " companies .
Over the past five weeks Gore , Doerr , and Blood agreed to give Fortune an exclusive look at their new alliance .
Already they 've begun to pool information .
Generation came across a small company engaged in carbon trading that Kleiner is analyzing , and Kleiner has shared intelligence about which startups could threaten the established companies in Generation 's portfolio .
In the long term , though , they want to help drive something much larger , " bigger than the Industrial Revolution and significantly faster , " as Gore puts it .
They argue that to halt global warming , nothing less will be required than a makeover of the $ 6 trillion global energy business .
Coal plants , gas stations , the internal - combustion engine , petrochemicals , plastic bags , even bottled water will have to give way to clean , green , sustainable technologies .
" What we are going to have to put in place is a combination of the Manhattan Project , the Apollo project , and the Marshall Plan , and scale it globally , " Gore continues .
" It 'd be promising too much to say we can do it on our own , but we intend to do our part . "
Does that sound grandiose ?
Sure .
Will they be accused of being partisan ?
Probably .
Is there something incongruous about globetrotting rich guys jetting between multiple homes and lecturing the rest of us about climate change ?
Of course .
But there are good reasons to take Gore and Doerr seriously .
Gore , who never seemed fully at ease as a presidential candidate , has demonstrated a real knack for using mass communications to influence public opinion .
( He estimates that he 's shown his homespun slide show on global warming more than 1,000 times , while the documentary version , An Inconvenient Truth , won him an Oscar . )
Doerr , meanwhile , has displayed a real talent for deploying venture capital to create or disrupt whole industries .
In short , the foremost eco-activist and the dean of Sand Hill Road could , together , draw a huge amount of attention and cash to companies that are aiming to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels .
There is , however , one thing standing in their way .
Five years after Kleiner Perkins made its first green investment , the firm has n't had one " exit " -- VC - speak for an IPO or a sale of a company that validates the investment thesis .
Doerr equates this moment to Internet investing ( which he famously called " the greatest legal creation of wealth in the history of the planet " ) before Kleiner took a certain web browser public in 1995 .
Now , he wonders , " what 's the company that will lead the boom ?
What 's the Netscape of green innovation ? "
A bleary - eyed Al Gore needs another cup of coffee , and no wonder .
It 's a Tuesday morning , and four days earlier he and his wife , Tipper , were up into the wee hours in San Francisco waiting to learn if he'd won the Nobel .
( He was cited " for informing the world of the dangers posed by climate change . " )
They then flew home to Nashville after a stopover in Phoenix , where Gore spoke to an advertising industry convention about Current TV , the youth - oriented cable television network he co-founded in 2002 .
Over the weekend , Tipper threw him a party with 150 or so of their closest friends .
Country singers Kathy Mattea and Kim Richey preformed at the bash , at Nashville 's Park Caf� .
" It was a good weekend , " Gore says with a grin .
Now Gore , Doerr , and Blood are gathered on the back patio of Gore 's $ 2.3 million , 10,000 - square - foot home in the Belle Meade section of Nashville .
That 's the mansion -- to Gore 's critics it 's always a mansion -- that tagged the former Vice President as an energy hog .
He 's quick to point out that the house generates electricity from more than 30 solar photovoltaic panels on the roof as well as seven 300 - foot geothermal wells in the ground , and that it has been certified as an energy - efficient home by the U.S. Green Building Council .
After offering everyone coffee or bottled water ( hey , no one 's perfect ) , Gore explains why he 's combining his advocacy work with a profit motive .
" We want to give a big shout - out , though that 's not the corporate term , to every inventor and entrepreneur and idea generator at the micro , macro , systems - integration , and global - thinker level to create with this alliance a clearinghouse for the identification and selection of the most promising ideas on the planet for quickly solving this climate crisis , " he says , without pausing to take a breath .
Then , clearly catching himself in a moment of speechifying , Gore boils it down : " We all believe that markets must play a central role . "
Professionally Gore , Doerr , and Blood have little in common .
Once the boy wonder of American politics , Gore turns 60 in March .
In addition to his roles at Kleiner , Generation , and Current , he 's an advisor to Google and a director at Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) .
He also founded an advocacy organization in Palo Alto called the Alliance for Climate Protection .
At times his schedule seems downright presidential : the week after our interview in Nashville , Gore visited the leaders of France , Germany , and Austria to talk about the environment .
Says Gary Hirshberg , a climate - change activist and the CEO of Stonyfield Farm , who has known Gore for years : " I had an easier time seeing him when he was in the White House . "
Technically , of course , Gore was never " in " the White House .
But he 's been dealing with continual speculation about whether he still has designs on the place .
Is there a chance he 'll jump into the race ?
" It 's a luxury to be able to focus on what you are most passionate about all the time , " he says .
When asked to elaborate he adds , " Casting about for words to describe this with precision is less productive than just saying that what I 'm doing feels like the right thing to do . "
So the answer is probably not , though like any good politician , he 's left the door open .
For now Gore truly seems to enjoy kicking around Nashville , where he 'll continue to be based .
Since he wo n't be on Sand Hill Road daily , he explains , he 's installed a high - definition videoconferencing system to dial into Kleiner 's weekly partner meetings .
If Gore is the elder statesman of the group , Doerr is the salesman .
Famous both for his boundless energy and his high - end hucksterism , at 56 he is wiry and birdlike in his tendency to flit from topic to topic .
He specializes in making everyone around him believe as passionately about his current cause -- - first the PC , then the Internet , now the environment -- as he does .
If your Labor Day plans include taking in one last summer blockbuster at the local multiplex , take this advice : leave that cell phone in your pocket .
Forever on the prowl for the next big thing in movie piracy , the motion picture industry is zeroing in on small and increasingly - powerful mobile - phone cameras that might be trained on theater screens .
Picture and sound quality lag behind their camcorder big brothers , but the devices offer something a camcorder cannot : stealth .
" It 's a lot less conspicuous than somebody trying to bring in a camcorder , " said Chris Null , editor and publisher of Filmcritic.com .
" This is definitely a trend .
Everybody has their cell phone at a movie . "
The world saw the cell phone 's imaging power with last year 's clandestine taping of Saddam Hussein 's hanging .
Advancements in cell phone battery life and memory has now caught the attention of pirates and Hollywood .
The Warner Bros .
Pictures invitation to screen the latest Harry Potter flick for reviewers underscored the motion picture industry 's concern that the cell phone is the latest bootlegging tool .
" Please note that mobile phones and other handheld devices will not be permitted in the theater for any pre-release screenings of Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix , " the July invitation read .
" Please leave such devices in the car . "
A small number of hijacked movie cell - phone recordings are beginning to appear on BitTorrent sites .
This month , a 21 - year - old Australian man was arrested for allegedly uploading a copy of The Simpsons Movie he recorded with a cell phone in a Sydney suburb .
The Australian Federation of Copyright
Theft said police responded to four incidents of cell phone recording this summer .
" Generally , as technology gets better , people are using more than camcorders , " said Elizabeth Kaltman , a Motion Picture Association of America spokeswoman .
" They are using cell phones to capture movies .
We 're being more vigilant about them . "
Hollywood is also watching for digital cameras capable of taking video .
Last week a Virginia teenager pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unlawfully filming a motion picture after being nabbed capturing 20 seconds of Transformers with a Canon Powershot camera .
She 'd recorded the brief action scene to show her little brother later .
But cell phones , with their tiny sizes , ease of concealment and long battery life , are slowly becoming a headache for the entertainment industry .
" I 'm seeing more reports about people taking out their cell phones at the movies , " said Patrick Corcoran , a spokesman for the National Association of Theater Owners .
Despite the industry 's growing alarm , the poor quality of cell phone recordings make them unpopular among downloaders – rating a distant fourth behind ripped DVDs , films recorded with professional - grade video cameras and movies pirated with handheld camcorders .
Consider the comments posted by discerning downloaders after a Simpsons cell phone bootleg appeared July 27th on the Pirate Bay site
" That was the worst copy I have ever seen , " one pirate wrote .
" I hate you and wish death on you .
Why not take a long walk off a short pier you complete smack tard ?
You are a pathetic excuse for a human being .
I hope you suffer when it comes your time you vile piece of scum .
Have a nice day . "
" WTF .
Why even tape this shit ? " another chimed in .
" This copy sucks really hard because it 's cammed with a cell phone camera , " a third downloader whined .
A review of the pirated footage shows it 's dark and grainy , with the screen floating around in the video frame .
The sound is poor and out - of - synch , and frequently interrupted by the bootlegger 's guffaws as he enjoyed the film he was pirating .
The impromptu laugh track did n't go unnoticed by another Pirate Bay user , whose post noted that the recording was " made worse by butthead laughing at every stupid joke . "
The downloader 's advice to future cell phone pirates : " Try not to make your laugh overpower what you are recording . "
And the feeding frenzy begins .
CYA lawsuits should start flooding the market soon enough .
If anyone believes that buyers and sellers alike were not aware of what was going on , they are nuts and only kidding themselves .
If the banks failed to understand what they were buying – despite teams of lawyers and supposed financial experts – well , tough .
Is n’t that why these companies are ( were ) raking in the big bucks ?
Fortunately for the banks ( unfortunately for everyone else ) Paulson and the Bush administration are doing their best to bail out them out .
This way , banks win even when they ’re losing .
Just add the costs to the taxpayers and worry about it later .
Nice work , if you can find it .

Most may be surprised to learn that Canada ’s largest black market involves the very same substance the government has recently deemed to be legislated as “ not illegal . ”
But for many otherwise law - abiding members of society , “ not illegal ” does n’t mean “ legal ” either .
Members of this enormous underground market are n’t tattooed thugs or violent criminals — they ’re parents , grandparents , teachers , community members , professionals , and others who prefer to buy and sell medical marijuana through local dispensaries and consume it at lounges rather than depend on corporate businesses hand - selected by government organizations like the Liquor Control Board of Ontario ( LCBO ) .
Many of Canada ’s medical marijuana dispensary and lounge owners prefer to consider themselves part of the country ’s “ grey market ” because their status under the newest marijuana laws is ambiguous at best .
Although they want to be ( and are ) productive members of society , the businesses they ’ve built are most likely to be made illegal again even after the government sought public input on its marijuana supply and consumption laws .
Read on to learn why the Canadian government ’s plan for total control of this area seems likely to lead to a much more robust underground market for the sale and consumption of marijuana , even though the vast majority of dispensary and lounge proprietors want nothing more than to become / remain legal , tax - paying business owners .
What Exactly Did the Voters Approve ?
The only “ legal weed ” available in Ontario beginning in the summer of 2018 is medical marijuana , available to those who have a documented medical condition eligible for this treatment .
Medical marijuana will be tightly controlled by the LCBO and may only be delivered to consumers by government - licensed producers who send it via Canada Post .
To begin the advent of legal marijuana in Ontario , government permits are only going to be issued to around 150 stores that are run by the LCBO .
Dispensaries , including online dispensaries , are technically considered illegal without a permit , as are lounges that offer medical marijuana to cardholders or delivery services that promise quick door - to - door service of edibles , buds , waxes , oils , or other forms of cannabis .
Meanwhile , Quebec has a recreational marijuana bill pending in the Senate , and the Minister of Public Health himself has said that the government is reaching out to private suppliers so it will be “ ready to move ” when marijuana is made legal .
While many government projects have open and transparent bidding processes , five of the six suppliers selected by the Quebec government is n’t even based in the province , a seeming slap in the face to local suppliers who would like to stay competitive ( and legal ) .
Cannabis - friendlier British Columbia has eliminated the contracting process entirely and has instead announced plans for standalone government marijuana shops .
Before the passing the Cannabis Act , the government held a number of public forums designed to solicit public input and take the temperature of the public opinion on the legalization of medical marijuana .
However , despite great public support for the services provided by current dispensary owners , lounge owners , and delivery drivers , it appears that the government is pushing for total control of the entire industry — regardless of the legal and financial impact this control may have on those brave entrepreneurs who first carved out a place for marijuana at the table .
Many of the public comments and even the votes in favour of legalization of medical marijuana envisioned a free and open market for cannabis sales , with the government merely providing standards for quality control .
One of the biggest downsides of black market marijuana had been the lack of transparency ; although some dispensaries were open when it came to the THC content of their Indica ’s and Sativa ’s , other growers were unaware ( or unwilling to disclose ) the strains or THC content of the cannabis they sold , making it tough for legitimate medical users to maintain their treatment .
By injecting government control into the process , officials promised it would be much simpler for consumers to pick and choose the strains they ’d prefer , opting for a lower THC content or a more relaxing experience based on their specific illnesses or conditions .
But because medical marijuana is still illegal for anyone but a government - sanctioned business to sell , the government is using this opportunity to hand - select big corporations to serve as legal dispensaries , choking out the small businesses that fought to make medical cannabis legal in the first place .
Not only does the stranglehold of government control harm the brave small business owners who started this process , it removes competition .
This will give the government carte blanche to set cannabis prices too high for the average Canadian to afford , decrease the THC content of government - approved cannabis , or take other measures that are based on principles of government policy .
This push could ultimately harm the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who depend on medical marijuana to prevent seizures , treat chronic pain , manage anxiety , and battle nausea and other serious side effects of chemotherapy .
If the government is permitted to control who sells , not just the quality of what is sold , the ability of private sellers to thrive seems bleak .
What Does This Mean for Online ?
Despite this at - times pessimistic outlook , there are many new companies that offer innovative technologies and other unique contributions to the industry .
Cannabis conventions draw tens of thousands of attendees and fill entire convention centres , with proprietors and purveyors optimistic that , at the end of this legalization effort , the industry will still belong to “ the people ” rather than the government .
When it comes to the marijuana industry , the Canadian government has some advantages that just are n’t available to those who do n’t write the laws .
Government organizations are able to use hosted web solutions like Shopify , while private entrepreneurs are prohibited from using these platforms because of their terms of use .
Instead , dispensaries must use WordPress or Magento to sell their products , and many online dispensaries have been under attack since their launch .
With news of data breaches hitting the airwaves on a weekly basis , the country - wide government control over the marijuana industry brings up security questions .
Just who is collecting this data , and is the government taking proper steps to keep it secure from hackers ?
Online dispensaries such as Buds2 Go and Greenz have taken steps to be as secure as possible by combining the latest in cyber - security , user - privacy controls on a reliable e-commerce platform .
Because personal identification information and financial information is deleted immediately upon verification , it completely eliminates the risk that a hacker will access long lists of customer ’s personal information .
They are also one of the few players that possess a valid business license , even offering compassion pricing for up to 75 % off the cost of medication for terminal patients .
These dispensaries bravely function and pay taxes like any other business , despite their legally ambiguous status .
Farm to consumer dispensaries such as MyKush manage to operate relatively incognito and also without the government ’s blessing , but work very hard to be transparent about the services and prices they offer .
During the course of the grey market boom , these dispensaries have been the innovators and refiners of the cannabis economy .
They ’ve designed everything from shipment methods to secure and anonymous payments , helping prevent Canadians from going into the deep black market like the Silk Road and other TOR sites that do n’t offer this security or honest customer service .
Despite this hard work , many online and brick and mortar dispensaries and cannabis suppliers are n’t able to guarantee to their employees that they ’ll have a job a year from now .
The government ’s entry into the marijuana growth and supply industry has made thriving and customer - oriented businesses run by local representatives , PTA members , taxpayers , grandparents , college students , and other contributing members of society into an illicit grey market industry .
Some opt to openly maintain their status as a supplier of marijuana , with owners promising they ’ll reopen the next day with a new name if the RCMP raids them .
Others have completely lost hope of legitimacy and gone back underground , some offering pop-up locations to their loyal customers but keeping their exact location a secret to avoid the odds of government intervention .
Each dispensary owner has reacted to this development in his or her own unique way , but it ’s clear that no one is going away soon ( or willingly ) .
It ’s still important to give proper credit where it is due .
The federal government ’s efforts to decriminalize the possession and consumption of cannabis are admirable .
Rather than giving into “ reefer madness ” like our southern neighbors , Trudeau ’s government has acknowledged the advantage of cannabis over many other drugs and prescription medications and has acknowledged the large population of recreational cannabis users that do n’t want to hide in the shadows anymore .
However , the mandate the Canadian federal government has put out along with the quasi-illegal grey area many dispensaries find themselves operating within , The Feds are making it very difficult for many would - be legitimate businesses to become legal after the government begins issuing contracts to make only certain dispensaries and suppliers government - approved .
It ’s only common sense to use the knowledge of the pioneers who founded this industry , not just a select few government - approved ventures with ties to government families and friends to make decisions and policy that govern our businesses and our industry .
The government does n’t like competition ; they are a one - trick pony .

An article from the Boston Globe is headlined : Bush Plan for Iraq Would Be a First .
No OK From Congress Seen ; Constitutional Issues Raised .
Its not dated March of 2003 , when that kind of resistance to Bush might have done some good and been an entirely accurate description of Bush 's attack on Iraq .
Its dated Friday , January 25 , 2008 , and is about , of all things , Congress ' resistance to Bush defending Iraq from attack .
Exactly the opposite of what Congress allowed him to do in 2003 .
While both are unconstitutional , Congress says its OK for Bush to attack Iraq but not OK for him to defend it .
Go figure .
To correct the article , the current Bush plan for Iraq is not a first , his declaring war on Iraq with a " preemptive " attack was a first .
Once again , Bush is planning to take unilateral action on Iraq without the approval of Congress .
Only this time , he 's planning on defending Iraq from attack , instead of attacking Iraq .
Congress is getting all bent out of shape about it and has just now , five years too late , remembered the Constitution that prohibits both attacking and defending Iraq from attack without Congressional approval .
The irony is only exceeded by the hypocrisy .
Representative Dana Rohrabacher , Republican , California : " We are here to fulfill the constitutional role established by the founding fathers .
It is not all in the hands of the president and his appointees .
We play a major role . "
Gee whiz , such thunderous rumblings , such rectitude , such sanctimoniousness , such righteousness .
Where the hell were you in March , 2003 when Bush attacked Iraq ?
When it would have saved a million innocent lives , 4000 US soldiers , two trillion in wasted expense ?
You were n't there then and your hypocrisy is not needed now .
Pounding on the table now will not undo what you 've allowed to be done .
Well , he 's right and wrong about what he said .
He 's right in that Congress has played a major role in ensuring that it IS all in the hands of the president and his appointees .
As a result of that , he 's wrong that it is not all in the hands of the president and his appointees .
It is .
He 's seen to that .
Remember that the resolution that Bush used as his excuse to attack Iraq only authorized him to use military force against Iraq to DEFEND the United States Iraq never attacked the US , so the conditions necessary to use military force never came about .
But , he declared war and attacked , anyway .
And Congress blithely ignored the Constitutional provision that only Congress can declare war .
Congress is blind to the fact that they are outraged about Bush 's unconstitutional act of making treaties with Iraq , now , that is the result of Congress allowing Bush to make the unconstitutional act of war in the first place .
From the article : " Most of the attention has instead focused on whether the pact could make it more difficult for the United States to withdraw from Iraq after Bush leaves office . "
The pact can not make it more difficult .
Withdrawing from Iraq is not difficult .
It is the reverse of the process that got the US military into Iraq .
Ships , planes , troop carriers and trucks got them there and they can get them out .
Withdrawal from Iraq is not a matter of difficulty with pacts , politics , economics , beliefs , ideology or whether you 're a Democrat or a Republican .
Withdrawal is a matter of abiding by the Constitution , the law of the land .
The law that Congress has so suddenly become enamored of .
It says the attack on and occupation of Iraq is illegal , just as it says that Congress must approve treaties with foreign countries .
Congress , whether Democratic or Republican , carefully picks and chooses when to stand up and squawk loudly about their power being ignored .
But , they only do it when it does n't matter , when they lose to George Bush , again , it wo n't really make any difference .
Bush 's relationship with Congress is like the guy who told the husband to stand in a circle the guy drew on the ground while the guy raped the husband 's wife .
When the rapist left , the husband said that the guy was n't really so tough , after all .
The wife asked what he meant .
The husband pointed out that he had stepped out of the circle twice and the guy did n't even notice .
Congress is just now , very tentatively , putting a toe out of the circle , ready to be withdrawn instantly if Bush looks around , in hopes that Bush wo n't notice , while he rapes the United States and Iraq , and is preparing for Iran to bend over .
US aficionados of Star Wars can on 15 August enjoy a cinematic launch of forthcoming animated TV series Star Wars : The Clone Wars , Variety reports .
The silver screen release is the fruit of a deal between Warner Bros , Turner Broadcasting and Lucasfilm , which described this " marrying [ of ] TV series and theatrical release " as " unprecedented " .
Dan Fellman , Warner Bros Pictures president of domestic distribution , duly enthused : " This is a breakthrough project - returning Star Wars to the big screen in a completely new way while beginning an exciting new chapter in George Lucas ' legendary saga .
We immediately felt that it would be a fantastic theatrical event and are thrilled to be bringing it to moviegoers . "
The " multiplatform " project is an expansion of the Clone Wars microseries which previously aired on Cartoon Network .
It 'll kick off with the 100 - minute movie , which picks up between episodes II and III when Anakin Skywalker is not yet Darth Vader , continuing in 30 - minute TV episodes .
Starwars.com elaborates : " On the front lines of an intergalactic struggle between good and evil , fans young and old will join such favorite characters as Anakin Skywalker , Obi-Wan Kenobi and Padmé Amidala , along with brand - new heroes like Anakin 's padawan learner , Ahsoka .
Sinister villains - led by Darth Sidious , Count Dooku and General Grievous - are poised to rule the galaxy . "
George Lucas concluded : " I felt there were a lot more Star Wars stories left to tell .
I was eager to start telling some of them through animation and , at the same time , push the art of animation forward . "
International release dates for Star Wars : The Clone Wars have yet to be confirmed . ®
After faculty role in Duke case , pick colleges carefully
Regarding the Sept. 14 article , " Legacy of Duke case : a rein on prosecutors ? "
As parents and high school seniors make plans and fill out college applications for next year , they now must consider a different " legacy . "
Critically , parents now must look closely at college faculties .
At Duke University , fully 88 faculty members signed a petition essentially declaring guilty three white male students prior to a full investigation or trial .
And Vanderbilt University hired away two of this group 's leaders .
College choices are difficult , but spending in the neighborhood of $ 200,000 to place your young - adult child in harm 's way may not be a great idea .

Collapse of the Kaloko dam
In response to the Sept. 13 article , " Problem dams on the rise in the US , " kudos for heightening public awareness of dam safety and the current state of dams across the nation .
The opening statement of this article appears to indicate that a period of heavy rains was the primary cause for the Kaloko dam breach on Kauai Island .
In fact , according to an independent investigation by a special deputy attorney general appointed by Hawaii 's attorney general , there were many human - induced factors that contributed to this catastrophe .
Lives were lost , and homes swept away .
Dams can be valuable tools , but they are inherently dangerous .
Every dam should be properly rated .
Every dam that presents a medium or high risk should be inspected annually for deficiencies , with legally mandated repairs or maintenance being performed in a timely manner .
Further , each and every person whose life and / or property would be at risk in the event of a dam failure should be notified or reminded of that fact on a regular basis .
In protecting their interests , they would more than likely be active in ensuring that inspections , maintenance , and repairs were completed regularly .

Beware fraudulent shamans
In response to the Sept. 13 article , " Sweating out war " : I was adopted by a powerful shaman as a 7 - year - old .
I saw him perform some amazing cures with his rituals .
He never allowed anyone to photograph him or his medicine bundles / props or record his voice .
There are many chants and prayers that are offered during a session .
Some rituals can last anywhere from an hour to nine days , or longer .
In addition , it can take an apprentice more than a decade to become initiated as a shaman .
So not just anyone can become a shaman .
I have to advise people against taking just any native American 's word that he is a shaman .
I am Irish / native American , and I have hair to my waist and turquoise earrings .
I could very easily gather feathers , fans , rattles , beads , and other props – and fool anyone into believing I am the real deal .
Likewise , anyone can put black shoe polish on white chicken feathers , buy a gourd rattle , burn " sweet grass , " and mumble a bunch of incoherent jabber , and make believe they are shamans .
So be very careful .
( I am not suggesting in any way that the " shaman " profiled in your piece about veterans is a fake . )

Watching TV should be criticism - free
In response to the Sept. 17 article , " Among networks , Spanish - language Univision is now a top contender " :
The implications of this article suggest that it is Hispanics who are isolating themselves and finding cultural comfort in TV .
Another case of blaming the victim , if you ask me .
How can we blame these people for being indoors watching something that is friendly and that they can relate to ?

[ Lost Island rendering and map courtesy of LostMap ]
For some , ‘ Lost ’ is more than a mere television show – it is a hobby , fantasy or even obsession .
One of the most entrancing aspects of the show is its semi-abandoned Dharma Initiative stations that dot the island and have been slowly revealed over time .
Dedicated followers of the series have slowly gathered and compiled data to compose a clearer picture of this fantastic island , cataloging locations in great detail .
[ Note that the Hydra station as shown above is likely the Looking Glass ]
While many loyal fans have devoted time to mapping the island and taking screen captures of places and events , few have attempted to integrate these to tell the visual story of the Dharma Initiative stations specifically in conjunction with a map of their location on the island – until now .
For those new to the series , think of this as an orientation .
For viewers , consider it a refresher course at the start of the new season .
The Swan station was the first discovered by the fictional survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 .
After an entire season of living off of the land and remnants from the plane wreckage , finding this station provided food , soap , showers and even a record player – a radical shift in livability .
At the heart of this station an electromagnetic charge had to be manually diffused every 108 minutes , creating dramatic tension until one survivor took it into his hands to let the timer run out .
The Staff station contains a nursery as well as associated medical equipment .
It has helped fuel speculation of possible diseases either created on or meant to be cured on the island .
One pregnant survivor was abducted early in the series and taken to this station to be monitored .
It is not clear whether the station was established for pregnancy - related or simply general medical purposes .
The Pearl represents an experiment within an experiment : a psychological study performed on people who believed they were themselves studying others .
The station consists of a room with monitors and writing pads where “ researchers ” were tasked with recording what was going on around the island .
Ultimately , they never knew that their reports went forever unread .
The Arrow is a relative mystery .
First discovered by the second set of survivors on the island ( from the crashed plane ’s tale section ) this station is quite bare .
Speculation has it that the station had something to do with mathematics , but in its current state it appears to simply be a storage area with minimal electricity running to modest bare light bulbs illuminating the spaces .
The Flame was , prior to its destruction , a relatively unique station : a simple cabin in the woods as opposed to an elaborate underground semi-industrial complex .
It was the communications hub for the island sending messages both to other stations and off the island .
Aside from equipment to support its purpose it contained a small kitchen and other minor amenities .
The Hydra is an animal research station , cages of which have been used by The Others to house captured survivors .
The station is used by The Others as a hospital , meeting area , holding facility and is also the staging ground for an unknown outdoor clearing and construction project – jokingly or seriously dubbed a future alien landing strip .
The Looking Glass is another highly unusual station – submerged dozens of feet ( or more ) underwater offshore of the island .
Among other uses , it is part communications station and also can be ( and has been ) used to jam other transmissions on and off the island .
This station was also the site of a death of one of the original main - cast survivors at the end of the third season .
The Orchid station is the 8th and final mystery station , not yet featured directly in the show .
It has been primarily revealed through a spoiler orientation video which was used to rev up viewers for the fourth season of the series and its location is completely unknown .
The video reveals first one then two rabbits that are identically numbered .
From the phrasing within the video some have speculated that this is , in fact , one rabbit that was sent back in time – hence the need to keep the two apart , but surely more will be revealed .
Of course , all of this information is subject to change and represents the work of many fans working together to produce a coherent pictures of the island .
Wikia has a good collection of more spoilers and background information on lost .
New to the series ?
It ’s never too late to start catching up .

Conditions at the front were horrendous for troops
Inside the dugout
I last visited this farm a year ago - on that occasion soggy from recent rain and swept by chilly easterly winds .
Across that landscape a small survey team were mapping what lay below , using ground - penetrating radar .
Ninety years after Flanders was torn apart by war , most of the battlefield has now disappeared .
Yet , beneath the soil hidden reminders lie undisturbed .
Daily life under fire forced the warring armies to seek safety underground ; hundreds of shelters and headquarters were constructed in this sector alone .
The archaeologists have spent years searching for one such example - the Vampire Dugout - from where a Brigadier General and his staff planned for attacks that so often proved futile , and costly .
Remarkable condition
The team have used every technique available to them - from radar , to dowsing , from spades to excavators .
Finally , it was local information that led to a crucial discovery .
The army tunnellers who spent three months digging the shelter did so using a 40 - foot deep shaft .
Today it 's open once more .
Now British experts , with their Belgian counterparts , are preparing to enter the tunnel complex .
I 've never seen anything like this .
This shaft was constructed more than 90 years ago , and you would n't know it
Peter Barton
" I 've never seen anything like this .
This shaft was constructed more than 90 years ago , and you would n't know it .
We now know that the tunnels are lined with steel , and have survived intact . "
Buckets of silt are still being winched to the surface yielding the first evidence of those who worked and slept here ; a shiny clip of British rifle ammunition , a water container , machine parts , even a brass safety pin .
Far more lies beyond , but there are hazards to be overcome .
Outside the tent , at a safe distance , a pile of rusting unexploded shells awaits disposal .
In the tunnels where pumps once ran night and day , thousands of gallons of water have accumulated , a lake that needs to be dry before the real archaeology can begin .
The team describe it as like exploring an under sea wreck without the diving suits .
Their work , deep below the old trench lines has barely begun .
It would not buy you half a cup of hot chocolate in an Alpine cafe , but for just one Swiss franc - less than 50 p - a British entrepreneur has become the proud owner of a ski resort .
Bruno Prior , a keen skier , will have the run of 12 miles of slopes and four lifts , not to mention all the machinery necessary to maintain his pistes above the Swiss village of Ernen .
And he can survey his snowy domain from the terrace of his own restaurant .
Of course , there is a catch .
Prior 's company Summerleaze has had to promise to invest more than £ 20 m to bring the resort up to scratch and save a village that has been in decline for years .
It 's a big job and Prior may be spending more time in his office than on the slopes .
The problem is that obscure resorts such as Ernen , which has only 500 or so residents , have struggled to keep pace with more fashionable places with grander facilities , better shopping , more vibrant nightlife and , perhaps , more reliable snow .
Faced with financial disaster , Ernen appealed for help last year and found a British businessman looking for a challenge .
Yesterday , on a crystal - clear day , there was fresh optimism on the slopes thanks to Prior 's intervention .
Ski shop owner Heinz Seiler , pausing briefly from his neat parallel turns on the metre - deep snow to speak to the Guardian , said Prior was the village 's " saviour " .
Down in the valley at the tourist information centre , Nadine In - Albon said the village did not mind that its rescuer came from the UK , a country whose best - known skier remains the Olympic flop Eddie " the eagle " Edwards .
" It would have been nice to have investment from Switzerland , " she said .
" But we are very happy to welcome Mr Prior .
The village needed investment and we are so glad he has come .
It 's a good thing . "
The crisis in Ernen , a pretty village of wooden chalets with only one small ski shop and one general store ( and three sets of gallows , though nobody has been executed since 1764 ) , peaked last season when the ski station lost £ 100,000 and the number of visitors staying overnight halved to 90,000 .
As with popular British seaside towns , the main problem is the phenomenon of " cold beds " .
People buy second homes in resorts such as Ernen but only stay there for a few weeks of the year , a trend that wrecks businesses such as bars , shops and ski shops .
The knock - on effect is that young people move on .
The village school in Ernen has only 13 pupils and may close if more families leave .
Plans to save Ernen by diversifying , including building an artificial lake for ice skating , were discussed and discarded .
Then , realising it was close to collapse , the ski station in Ernen , which is partly owned by the village , decided to seek an investor .
The appealed for help was published in a Zurich newspaper and more than 100 people and companies from Asia , America and Holland expressed an interest .
For legal reasons the business could not be given away - hence the one franc fee .
Prior , a 41 - year - old businessman from Berkshire , persuaded the village that he was the man to revive the area 's fortunes .
Though he is a keen sportsman , a windsurfer , rugby player and skier , the family firm 's speciality is gravel and waste rather than snow .
But he said : " It sounded fun so we thought we 'd take a look . "
Prior was struck by the beauty of the area but one problem was that the slopes are quite steep - fine for good skiers and snowboarders but not so great for beginners .
The deal looked off .
Then one day Prior and his wife , Rachel , walked to the top of a slope and looked down the other side on to a gently shelving plateau , a perfect spot for beginners to find their feet .
Prior said : " In America they do family - friendly places with easier slopes very well .
In Europe they are n't so common .
We felt we may be able to offer that here . "
The resort has tended to be popular with Swiss , German and Dutch skiers but Prior wants to bring in British and Scandinavian people too , without losing its regulars .
He won over other investors because he was keen not to develop property in the village - and probably create yet more " cold beds " - but to make the skiing side of it work well .
As well as developing the immediate ski area , Prior believes there is potential to link it into 120 miles of ski runs in the neighbouring valleys .
He believes that because the skiing area is reasonably high - 1,750 metres - the resort does have a future .
He said : " It 's a risk but any investment like this would be a risk .
I think it 's going to be a lot of fun . "
Especially if he can find time to hone his skiing skills in his very own resort .
The Appeal of the MacBook Air
A month after its debut at Macworld Expo and a few weeks after it began shipping to customers , there seem to be an awful lot of people doubting the sales prospects of the MacBook Air .
I remain convinced , however , that it ’s going to be a big hit .
The key to understanding the appeal of the Air is that you ’ve got to stop thinking about technical specs as the primary factors .
Here ’s an analogy : the MacBook Air is like a sporty convertible coupe .
You buy one not for practical reasons , but because it is satisfying to own something beautiful and clever and fun .
The MacBook Air is like no other recent notebook from Apple , in that its price is not relative to its performance .
In the previous iBook / PowerBook matrix , the “ small ” high - end machine , the 12 - inch PowerBook G4 , did have a price that was relative to its performance : it cost a lot more than an iBook but a little less than a 15 - inch PowerBook , and it performed a lot better than an iBook but a little worse than a bigger PowerBook .
The Air , on the other hand , inverts this equation : it costs about 50 percent more than a comparably equipped regular MacBook , but the regular MacBook performs about 50 percent better .
I ’m not immune to this obsession with statistical comparison .
In my initial write - up on the Air , I concluded :
The MacBook Air is undeniably beautiful and clever , but clearly designed as a secondary machine , not a main machine .
I like using a notebook as my sole machine , which means I ’m almost certain to stick with the Pros .
It is true that I ’m personally not going to buy an Air .
But I was wrong that the Air was designed to be a secondary machine .
It certainly is a compelling secondary machine for anyone whose primary machine is an iMac or Mac Pro , but for many people , the MacBook Air will serve just fine as their one and only computer .
( Again , consider an analogy to a convertible coupe — for many , yes , it ’s a secondary car , but for anyone without kids and with no need for significant storage space , it works just fine as their only car . )
In my initial Macworld Expo coverage , I asked for email from readers who had pre-ordered Airs , asking why they bought one .
Responses ( and there were many ) ran nearly 50 - 50 between those who bought the Air as a secondary machine and those who bought it as their “ fast enough for me and I never use FireWire anyway ” main machine .
Given the nerd - skewed demographics of the DF audience , I suspect the Air- as - secondary - Mac group is way overrepresented in the responses I received .
My money says most people buying an Air will be using it as their one and only computer .
Those critics predicting a sales flop seemingly are n’t aware that this second group even exists .
The smartest thing I ’ve read about the MacBook Air is this piece by David Galbraith , wherein he points out that the Air ’s CPU is several hundred times more powerful than an original Intel Pentium , and most people still use computers for the same sort of tasks .
Galbraith concludes :
The initial reception of the Macbook Air proves that the current process of designing , marketing and selling computers has nothing to do with “ specification ” requirements , but everything to do with specification lust .
What struck me regarding Macworld ’s MacBook Air benchmarks was n’t how much worse the Air performed than the standard MacBook or MacBook Pro , but how much better it performed than their baseline notebook , a 1.67 GHz 15 - inch PowerBook G4 — the fastest Mac notebook you could buy two years ago , and the very computer I still use every day .
That the Air is n’t as fast as a regular MacBook does not matter because the Air — for most people and most tasks — is clearly fast enough .
Whenever “ the Internet ” consensus is that a new Apple product is under - specced , the Internet has been wrong .
The Air ’s missing optical drive and FireWire / Ethernet ports are like the original iMac ’s missing floppy drive .
Critics panning any new Apple device will almost inevitably compare it to Apple ’s only significant product failure this decade , the G4 Cube .
Air critics are no exception .
But here ’s the thing : the Cube was not underpowered .
It was , if anything , overpowered .
I ’ve long thought that if it had been the G3 Cube rather than the G4 Cube — powered more like the then - current iMacs than the then - current Power Macs , and down - priced accordingly — it would have been far more successful .
1 I offer the Mac Mini as proof .
The apt comparison for the MacBook Air is the iPod Mini .
The iPod Mini debuted in January 2004 with 4 GB of storage for $ 249 , alongside a regular iPod with 15 GB of storage for $ 299 .
The Internet consensus was clear :
Why would anyone buy the iPod Mini when for $ 50 more they could get almost four times the storage ?
The Internet consensus was , of course , wrong .
The consumer consensus was that the iPod Mini was adorable and 4 GB of storage was more than enough .
The Mini quickly became the best - selling iPod model , a position still held today by its successor , the iPod Nano .
Here ’s what I wrote when the iPod Mini debuted :
Everyone wants to focus on the $ 50 price difference between the iPod Mini and the 15 GB iPod .
I agree that the $ 50 price difference between the Mini and 15 GB iPods is negligible .
That ’s exactly the point .
Take it a step further and imagine if Apple cut another $ 50 off the price and sold the 15 GB iPod for the same $ 249 as the Mini .
I say , even then , there would still be people who would choose the Mini .
For roughly the same price , you get to choose between a significantly smaller footprint and 11 extra GB .
If hard disk capacity were the only factor that mattered , we ’d all be using brick - sized players from Creative Labs .
Jason Fried got the iPod Mini right , too , and his argument applies just as well to the MacBook Air :
Further , when it comes to technology , smaller is almost always more expensive .
Miniaturization requires more R&D and greater engineering precision .
Given that Apple still charges a $ 125 premium for black MacBooks , it ’s hard to take seriously any argument that people are n’t willing to pay for style .
The Air ’s technical deficiencies are irrelevant to a large swath of users , and its aesthetic appeal is undeniable .

The Family Research Council is hosting a Values Voters Summit this weekend in Washington DC .
The results of the straw poll were just announced , and Romney eked out a narrow win over Mike Huckabee ( among voters in attendance , Huckabee beat Romney by 40 percentage points ) .
Over at Tapped , Kate Sheppard has been covering the convention :
I was certain Huckabee would come out on top .
I wonder what sort of effect this will have on whether or not Dobson and friends run a third - party candidate ?
If the " values voters " folks are backing a front runner , seems much less likely .
Maybe , but I think she ’s analyzing it from the perspective of electoral politics .
I ’m sure that ’s a consideration for the Dobsonites and their ilk , but I think it overlooks a more base motivation : the desire of fundamentalist Christians engaged in professional politics to keep open the financial spigots and prevent the faithful from giving up on funding their political ( and patronage ) operations .
Years ago , while interviewing for a job with a labor union , I was brought in to the office of the union 's local official .
It was a relatively small union , but the walls were covered with photos of the official with a who ’s who of Democratic glitterati from Bill Clinton and Al Gore to Ted Kennedy to just about anyone who was anybody in Michigan politics .
When he entered the office and saw me looking at the photos , he told me he did n’t really care that much about any of those photos for his own ego , but it was important to his members to know that he had that kind of access to the politicians the union asked the members to support and to whom their PAC contributions were donated .
The political fundies have traded on this kind of access with their donor base for years .
Take , for example , this convention : all the Republican nominees are in attendance .
All but one is essentially hewing to their party line on all cultural issues .
But Rudy Giuliani openly defies them on their line - in - the - sand issue , their steadfast opposition to retaining the right of a woman to chose to have an abortion .
The political fundies have been able to go to their funding base — primarily small donors — and convince them that they were part of a vanguard to return our country to the fundamental Christian values and ways of life they believed prevailed in an earlier , idyllic America ( which , btw , never really existed ) .
The country has continued to move further and further away from the fundie view of life on almost all matters .
Yes , the marriage amendments of 2004 were a setback for the acceptance and eventual full legal recognition of gays and lesbians .
But as I wrote in 2004 :
Since the early 1990's the Supreme Court has upheld both Roe v Wade and the use of affirmative action in college admissions , and it struck down state sodomy laws .
More children attend day care than ever .
More women work out of the home than ever , and most of them prefer to work out of the home even if it's not necessary for maintaining their standard of living .
" Will and Grace " is mainstream , and " Queer Eye for the Straight Guy " is on network television .
The social conservatives ' crusade against the teaching of evolution has had little success .
Since then , several states have legalized gay marriage or same - sex civil unions .
And scandals involving Mark Foley and Larry Craig have exposed a Republican party that ’s got some fairly serious issues with closeted homosexuals acting out in ways that have more to do with the hostility toward gays and lesbians within Republican politics than in society at large .
Amidst all these evolutionary cultural trends , the political fundies have been able to trot out their close association with the Republican party as proof that they were going to one day be able to rally and direct the political will to turn these trends around , to legislate morality .
After Gerald Ford , every Republican nominee for President has pledged his fealty to overturning Roe v Wade .
Thus , the political fundies could always appeal to their base , essentially saying " we ’re building political power , we ’re going in the right direction , keep the money coming . "
They could show their donors , just like that union official could show his members , that they had access , and that they had influence .
But a Rudy Giuliani nomination would show them with nothing .
On their most important issue , abortion , they would have lost the ability to say that Republicans are clearly better than Democrats as a party , and that all their time dedicated to building the Republican party had been justified .
I ca n’t think of any other group that has a more fundamental issue that would feel greater failure or betrayal .
It would be akin to organized labor supporting the Democratic party for decades and then seeing the Democratic party nominate someone who wants to wipe out collective bargaining rights for workers .
So what would those donors do if Rudy Giuliani gets the nomination , and the fundies do n’t have an alternative , like a third - party candidate such as Mike Huckabee ?
My guess is that many of them would stop sending money to folks like Tony Perkins , and groups like the Family Research Council would have to lay off a bunch of people .
Donors would feel that all those years of working within the Republican party were for naught , that murder of innocent life — and most fundies , especially the rank - and - file worker bees of the movement , sincerely view abortion as murder — would continue on unabated .
So , they might figure , why continue to engage in politics ?
Or , they could pull out of the Republican coalition for this election , see the Republican lose ( which they may be calculating is likely to happen regardless of whether they stay committed to the Republicans ) , and then say " see , we ’re the reason you lost , and you need to come back to our position or you ’ll never again win . "
Then , in a few years , the donations pick back up , because they ’ve re-exerted their coercive control and they ’ll be back in positions of influence in the GOP and their organizations will be back in the money , thanks to their donors .
It looked like the fall of the Berlin Wall .
And not only did it look like it .
For a moment , the Rafah crossing was the Brandenburg Gate .
It is impossible not to feel exhilaration when masses of oppressed and hungry people break down the wall that is shutting them in , their eyes radiant , embracing everybody they meet  to feel so even when it is your own government that erected the wall in the first place .
The Gaza Strip is the largest prison on earth .
The breaking of the Rafah wall was an act of liberation .
It proves that an inhuman policy is always a stupid policy : no power can stand up against a mass of people that has crossed the border of despair .
That is the lesson of Gaza , January 2008 .
One might repeat the famous saying of the French statesman Boulay de la Meurthe , slightly amended :
It is worse than a war crime , it is a blunder !
Months ago , the two Ehuds  Barak and Olmert  imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip and boasted about it .
Lately they have tightened the deadly noose even more , so that hardly anything at all could be brought into the Strip .
Last week they made the blockade absolute  no food , no medicine .
Things reached a climax when they stopped the fuel , too .
Large areas of Gaza remained without electricity  incubators for premature babies , dialysis machines , pumps for water and sewage .
Hundreds of thousands remained without heating in the severe cold , unable to cook , running out of food .
Again and again , al - Jazeera broadcast the pictures into millions of homes in the Arab world .
TV stations all over the world showed them , too .
From Casablanca to Amman angry mass protest broke out and frightened the authoritarian Arab regimes .
Hosni Mubarak called Ehud Barak in panic .
That evening Barak was compelled to cancel , at least temporarily , the fuel blockade he had imposed in the morning .
Apart from that , the blockade remained total .
It is hard to imagine a more stupid act .
The reason given for the starving and freezing of one and a half million human beings , crowded into a territory of 140 square miles , is the continued shooting at the town of Sderot and the adjoining villages .
That is a well - chosen reason .
It unites the primitive and poor parts of the Israeli public .
It blunts the criticism of the UN and the governments throughout the world , who might otherwise have spoken out against a collective punishment that is , undoubtedly , a war crime under international law .
A clear picture is presented to the world : the Hamas terror regime in Gaza launches missiles at innocent Israeli civilians .
No government in the world can tolerate the bombardment of its citizens from across the border .
The Israeli military has not found a military answer to the Qassam missiles .
Therefore there is no other way than to exert such strong pressure on the Gaza population as to make them rise up against Hamas and compel them to stop the missiles .
The day the Gaza electricity works stopped operating , our military correspondents were overjoyed : only two Qassams were launched from the Strip .
So it works !
Ehud Barak is a genius !
But the day after , 17 Qassams landed , and the joy evaporated .
Politicians and generals were ( literally ) out of their minds : one politician proposed to " act crazier than them , " another proposed to " shell Gaza ’s urban area indiscriminately for every Qassam launched , " a famous professor ( who is a little bit deranged ) proposed the exercise of " ultimate evil . "
The government scenario was a repeat of Lebanon War II ( the report about which is due to be published in a few days ) .
Then : Hezbollah captured two soldiers on the Israeli side of the border ; now : Hamas fired on towns and villages on the Israeli side of the border .
Then : the government decide in haste to start a war ; now : the government decided in haste to impose a total blockade .
Then : the government ordered the massive bombing of the civilian population in order to get them to pressure Hezbollah ; now : the government decided to cause massive suffering of the civilian population in order to get them to pressure Hamas .
The results were the same in both cases : the Lebanese population did not rise up against Hezbollah , but on the contrary , people of all religious communities united behind the Shi’ite organization .
Hassan Nasrallah became the hero of the entire Arab world .
And now : the population unites behind Hamas and accuses Mahmoud Abbas of cooperation with the enemy .
A mother who has no food for her children does not curse Ismail Haniyeh , she curses Olmert , Abbas , and Mubarak .
So what to do ?
After all , it is impossible to tolerate the suffering of the inhabitants of Sderot , who are under constant fire .
What is being hidden from the embittered public is that the launching of the Qassams could be stopped tomorrow morning .
Several months ago Hamas proposed a cease - fire .
It repeated the offer this week .
A cease - fire means , in the view of Hamas , that the Palestinians will stop shooting Qassams and mortar shells , and the Israelis will stop the incursions into Gaza , the " targeted " assassinations , and the blockade .
Why does n’t our government jump at this proposal ?
Simple : in order to make such a deal , we must speak with Hamas , directly or indirectly .
And this is precisely what the government refuses to do .
Why ?
Simple again : Sderot is only a pretext  much like the two captured soldiers were a pretext for something else altogether .
The real purpose of the whole exercise is to overthrow the Hamas regime in Gaza and to prevent a Hamas takeover in the West Bank .
In simple and blunt words : the government sacrifices the fate of the Sderot population on the altar of a hopeless principle .
It is more important for the government to boycott Hamas  because it is now the spearhead of Palestinian resistance  than to put an end to the suffering of Sderot .
All the media cooperate with this pretense .
It has been said before that it is dangerous to write satire in our country  too often the satire becomes reality .
Some readers may recall a satirical article I wrote months ago .
In it I described the situation in Gaza as a scientific experiment designed to find out how far one can go , in starving a civilian population and turning their lives into hell , before they raise their hands in surrender .
This week , the satire has become official policy .
Respected commentators declared explicitly that Ehud Barak and the army chiefs are working on the principle of " trial and error " and change their methods daily according to results .
They stop the fuel to Gaza , observe how this works , and backtrack when the international reaction is too negative .
They stop the delivery of medicines , see how it works , etc .
The scientific aim justifies the means .
The man in charge of the experiment is Defense Minister Ehud Barak , a man of many ideas and few scruples , a man whose whole turn of mind is basically inhuman .
He is now , perhaps , the most dangerous person in Israel , more dangerous than Ehud Olmert and Binyamin Netanyahu , dangerous to the very existence of Israel in the long run .
The man in charge of execution is the chief of staff .
This week we had the chance of hearing speeches by two of his predecessors , generals Moshe Ya’alon and Shaul Mofaz , in a forum with inflated intellectual pretensions .
Both were discovered to have views that place them somewhere between the extreme Right and the ultra-Right .
Both have a frighteningly primitive mind .
There is no need to waste a word about the moral and intellectual qualities of their immediate successor , Dan Halutz .
If these are the voices of the three last chiefs of staff , what about the incumbent , who cannot speak out as openly as they ?
Has this apple fallen further from the tree ?
Until three days ago , the generals could entertain the opinion that the experiment was succeeding .
The misery in the Gaza Strip had reached its climax .
Hundreds of thousands were threatened by actual hunger .
The chief of UNRWA warned of an impending human catastrophe .
Only the rich could still drive a car , heat their homes , and eat their fill .
The world stood by and wagged its collective tongue .
The leaders of the Arab states voiced empty phrases of sympathy without raising a finger .
Barak , who has mathematical abilities , could calculate when the population would finally collapse .
And then something happened that none of them foresaw , in spite of the fact that it was the most foreseeable event on earth .
When one puts a million and a half people in a pressure cooker and keeps turning up the heat , it will explode .
That is what happened at the Gaza - Egypt border .
At first there was a small explosion .
A crowd stormed the gate , Egyptian policemen opened live fire , dozens were wounded .
That was a warning .
The next day came the big attack .
Palestinian fighters blew up the wall in many places .
Hundreds of thousands broke out into Egyptian territory and took a deep breath .
The blockade was broken .
Even before that , Mubarak was in an impossible situation .
Hundreds of millions of Arabs , and a billion Muslims , saw how the Israeli army had closed the Gaza strip off on three sides : the North , the East , and the sea .
The fourth side of the blockade was provided by the Egyptian army .
The Egyptian president , who claims the leadership of the entire Arab world , was seen as a collaborator with an inhuman operation conducted by a cruel enemy in order to gain the favor ( and the money ) of the Americans .
His internal enemies , the Muslim Brotherhood , exploited the situation to debase him in the eyes of his own people .
It is doubtful if Mubarak could have persisted in this position .
But the Palestinian masses relieved him of the need to make a decision .
They decided for him .
They broke out like a tsunami wave .
Now he has to decide whether to succumb to the Israeli demand to re-impose the blockade on his Arab brothers .
And what about Barak ’s experiment ?
What ’s the next step ?
The options are few :
To reoccupy Gaza .
The army does not like the idea .
It understands that this would expose thousands of soldiers to a cruel guerilla war , which would be unlike any Intifada before .
To tighten the blockade again and exert extreme pressure on Mubarak , including the use of Israeli influence on the U.S. Congress to deprive him of the billions he gets every year for his services .
To turn the curse into a blessing , by handing the Strip over to Mubarak , pretending that this was Barak ’s hidden aim all along .
Egypt would have to safeguard Israel ’s security , prevent the launching of Qassams , and expose its own soldiers to a Palestinian guerilla war  when it thought it was rid of the burden of this poor and barren area , and after the infrastructure there has been destroyed by the Israeli occupation .
Probably Mubarak will say : Very kind of you , but no thanks .
The brutal blockade was a war crime .
And worse : it was a stupid blunder .
The fossil is an almost complete , articulated skeleton with a wingspan of just 25 cm , making it about the size of a swallow .
Skeletal features , such as curved , long toes , indicate it was a tree - dweller ( Illustration : Chuang Zhao )
A beautifully preserved fossil of a tiny pterosaur suggests that the giant pterodactyls that roamed the skies during the late Cretaceous period may have come from much smaller , tree - dwelling ancestors .
The new fossil , which was discovered in 2004 in western Liaoning province , China , is about 120 million years old .
The specimen is an almost complete , articulated skeleton with a wingspan of just 25 centimetres , making it about the size of a swallow , says its discoverer , palaeontologist Xiaolin Wang of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing .
Portions of its skull are not fully fused , which suggests it may not have reached its full adult size , but its well - developed limb bones make clear that it is much older than a hatchling .

The specimen ’s toe bones are long and curved , adaptations which are often seen in tree - dwelling birds and which are poorly suited for running along the ground , says Wang .
Tree dweller
These features suggest that the new fossil , which Wang and his colleagues named Nemicoloperus crypticus , was a small , tree - dwelling species that was likely to have fed on insects in the forest canopy .
Its anatomy suggests that Nemicolopterus is a relatively primitive member of the suborder that includes the giant pterodactyls , the largest flying creatures that ever lived .
Because other even more primitive pterosaurs also are small and tree - dwelling , this makes it likely that the giant pterodactyls evolved from an ancestor with similar habits , the researchers say .
Flight clues
“ This is a very , very complete specimen of an unusual little pterodactyl , ” says Michael Caldwell , a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton , Canada .
The new fossil also sheds some light on another mystery of pterosaur evolution – whether pterosaurs began to fly upwards from the ground , or whether they first climbed into trees and then began to glide downwards .
Though not conclusive , the fact that Nemicolopterus shows tree - climbing adaptations such as curved toes suggests that tree - climbing may have preceded flying , says Caldwell .

Africa has a problem with causality .
Not that the rest of the world consistently gets the idea either , but there are no other regions that so consistently mess up the nature of cause and effect .
The source of this confusion is the economic boom that results from the mere good fortune of having some valuable resources .
In both Russia and Venezuela the near vertiginous rise of oil prices has stimulated economic growth ; which is a good thing .
It has also led the Big Men in power to associate that boom with their own blunt political ministrations .
Both Hugo Chavez and Vladimir Putin have perverted their constitutions to ensure their continued control .
“ After all , ” they think , “ if it were n’t for me the economy would n’t be doing so well . ”
Sadly – for themselves – this is a woeful fantasy that the citizens of these oppressed lands are willing to go along with .
They remember the poverty of previous leaderships and confuse democracy with economic neglect .
Lest you think this is mere speculation , consider the following :
In 2003 Hugo Chavez , president of Venezuela , took control of his country ’s oil production after declaring his lack of faith in private endeavour .
It is difficult arguing that Chavez ’ nationalisation was a bad thing when daily oil revenues have risen from $ 50 million in 2003 , to $ 190 million in 2007 .
Yet it has been an appalling disaster .
Between 2003 and 2007 oil production fell from 3.3 million barrels of crude per day , to 2.5 million â€ “ a drop of 32 % .
Over the same period the price of oil has risen by over 500 % .
If the industry had been left alone Venezuela would be generating $ 60 million more per day .
At the same time , rampant public spending due to Chavez ’ determination to nationalise all parts of the economy has driven inflation to 21 % .
In similar fashion the Apartheid - era dictatorship in South Africa was paid for entirely out of the proceeds of a rising gold price .
In 1971 gold was $ 44 / ounce , in 1972 it was $ 70 / ounce and – by 1980 – it was $ 641 / ounce .
Without this windfall “ separate development ” would never have been possible .
Many societies confuse a lucky cash boom with sound economic policy .
Where there is confusion there is opportunity for analysis .
Measuring how bad it is
Various international organisations have attempted to objectively quantify what it is that separates the countries with the best economies ( consequentially offering more opportunities and better lifestyles to their people ) from those who do n’t .
The UN produces the Human Development Index .
The World Bank , The Ease of Doing Business Report .
Even Africa has its own index after Mo Ibrahim , the genius telecoms billionaire , developed his African Governance Index .
These are new ideas and have rapidly taken hold .
We have indexes ranking entrepreneurial expression , and environmental care .
However , these could simply be rankings of GDP per capita .
They offer little that is new , and little that is helpful for investors , or genuinely progressive governments .
The measure of an index is also in how it predicts the future .
Does knowing that Gambia is 143 places behind Denmark in Transparency International ’s Corruption Perception Index help in reducing corruption ?
What caused it in the first place ?
And what will the result be ?
You can figure it out , but it will require a lot of searching in other data series .
The graph above is from a new benchmarked index created by Whythawk Ratings .
The benchmark is a selection of 25 emerging nations who are currently considered fantastic ( and relatively stable ) investment bets .
The index is to be released late in January and will cover all emerging markets .
Not to elaborate on it in any great detail , but consider the two notable “ dips ” resulting in the notable bow - tie shape .
The “ Poorest 20 % ” measure considers the mobility of the poor ; accepting that there is poverty , how much opportunity do the poor have to become less poor .
The “ Wealthiest 20 % ” is independent of the “ Poorest 20 % ” and considers the extent of the middle - class and their quality of life .
Low scores in both indicates that , not only is poverty endemic and enduring , but that wealth is concentrated within a tiny portion of society .
That portion is the political class .
In other words , where poverty is entrenched and wealth derives only from political power , there is inherent instability .
That does n’t mean that society will break down , merely that all the elements are there for a blow - out .
Africa in Kenya , Kenya in Africa
The graph above is for Kenya .
For those who were n’t aware of it ( considering the excitement of the election nomination process in the US ) , Kenya just had an election .
It was so profoundly rigged and stolen that the opposition supporters protested .
Police opened fire , killing many .
Churches sheltering women and children fleeing the violence have been burned down .
Many of these murderous acts have started to look a lot like genocide .
Neither of the two political leaders will talk to the other .
In a matter of days Kenya , which had been starting to look like an emerging market bet , has fallen apart .
African politicians , no different from politicians elsewhere , like to make big promises to reach out to key electoral groups .
Since their countries are dominated by the poor , they make huge promises to that group .
Yet promises are an implicit tax .
Governments do not make money .
The money they make comes from taxing businesses , the formally employed , or from royalties derived from the exploitation of state - owned resources .
African countries are terribly poor .
There is no business class to tax .
So most government largess is derived from royalties on oil , timber , minerals and the like .
Without a middle - class there is no external scrutiny .
Political leadership is an opportunity to loot , buy the loyalty of key leaders of the police , courts and military , and salt away vast amounts of dosh .
There is little that governments can do to relieve the suffering of the poor other than through promoting economic growth .
Corruption antagonises all but the most robust businesses and little of that necessary investment will take place .
Fearful of the corruption , local entrepreneurs choose to remain outside of the law in the informal sector .
After a few years of leadership the poor are no better off than before .
Given the chance , they ’ll vote for someone else .
Lawrence Schlemmer , a South African social scientist , researched key voting trends around sub-Saharan Africa .
“ People usually vote for those who make the best promises , ” he says .
No -one worries about delivery until their chosen leaders are already in office .
Nowhere in Africa do you get the sort of live , acrimonious debates between political candidates where they challenge each other on policy .
South Africa is the only real economy in Africa , yet the African National Congress ( ANC ) – the dominant party – has just elected Jacob Zuma as their leader .
Zuma , who has just married his fourth wife , was found not guilty of raping a psychologically - disturbed , HIV positive , friend of his daughter ’s when she stayed over at his house .
Sex between the two was described as consensual .
Zuma showered afterwards to protect himself from AIDS .
If Zuma ’s fourth wife – with whom he has already had two children – cannot trust him to be honest , how can the rest of us ?
Not much .
Zuma was charged this week with racketeering , corruption , fraud , and bribery relating to payments received to promote
Thint in South Africa ’s arms deal in the late 1990s .
South Africa does not indicate the bow - tie shape in Whythawk ’s curve , so it will be interesting to monitor how the country deals with so divisive a leader .
Ending the cycle
No politician anywhere in the world is prepared to tell their citizens the truth .
It is much easier to blame external factors , or sheltered and vulnerable elites , for problems than to point out that poverty ends through hard work .
The only experience of wealth that the poorest Africans have is through watching their elected representatives on television .
The only peers they see getting rich do so through cronyism , political appointments , or state - allocated contracts .
It is no wonder that they have a lottery vision of wealth : that it derives through luck ; that wealth is not created , but taken .
It would be difficult to get elected through anything other than making improbable promises .
Yet this is precisely what African countries need to change .
And there are a few who are doing so .
But it is n’t easy .
It requires a bedrock of a nation exhausted by violence and robbed of everything they ever had .
Only when there is nothing left to be fought over do people seem willing to hear the truth .
The ex-communist countries of Eastern Europe are learning this .
Africa still has a way to go .
In the meantime , as we watch the raucous political debate taking place in the US , consider that such a thing never happens in Africa .
That the first time a citizen of an African nation has any idea – beyond sound - bites – what their politicians will do , is after it has happened .
And by then it is much too late .
Video : ' The most conclusive evidence ' Bhutto was shot David Edwards and Katie Baker

On Sunday , UK's Channel 4 news broadcasted a new video of the Bhutto assassination which they say " provides the most conclusive evidence yet that Benazir Bhutto was shot . "
Although the Pakistani government officially claims that Bhutto died from hitting her head on the sunroof as she ducked into her car , evidence in the video drastically contradicts that account .
The video shows a large crowd swarming around Bhutto 's car .
A clean - shaven man in sunglasses is visibly watching , concealing a gun ; behind him stands the suspected suicide bomber dressed in white .
As the video rolls , the man in sunglasses moves closer to Bhutto's car and fires three shots .
Directly after , the suicide bomber detonates his device and chaos ensues .
Reporter Jonathan Rugman points out how , as the gunman fires , Bhutto's hair is lifted and her shawl seems to rise as she falls inside her car .
" These images ... apparently [ contradict ] the official version of events , " Rugman asserts .
" As more such images come to light , " he says , " they will fuel the anger of protesters both here at the scene of the crime and around the country who feel that they 've been lied to by the government and that there 's been a deliberate coverup of what amounts to a massive security failure to protect this country 's best known politician . "
Authorities initially said that Bhutto died from bullet wounds , and a surgeon who treated her said the impact from shrapnel on her skull killed her .
But , Rugman points out , no blood was found on the bulletproof car -- and , every other passenger in the car survived .
The video clearly shows three policeman to the left of the car , doing nothing to hold back the crowd .
Was the government trying to cover - up a security lapse ?
Those close to the president say that was not the case .
" We do things here [ quite differently ] , " says Senator Tarif Azeem , a friend of President Musharraf , citing Bhutto's want to " be amongst the crowd " as the reason why she stood through the sunroof without much security around her .
Officials have rejected calls for independent foreign inquiry , although they have offered to exhume her body if requested .
According to Rugman , the government 's actions suggest they may be hiding something .
" [ The truth ] really matters in a country where scores of people have died in protests against Mrs. Bhutto's death and indeed against the circumstances of Mrs. Bhutto's death , " Rugman says , adding that the " great fear " in Pakistan is that the assassination will go unsolved .

Personally , I do n't feel that I 'd be doing my job as a journalist if I did n't ask a CEO whether ongoing litigation against him will affect the business or cost shareholders money .
American Apparel 's CEO Dov Charney thought otherwise though ( trades on the AMEX under the ticker APP ) .
First he tried canceling the interview 10 minutes beforehand because I would n't promise not to ask him about his sexual harassment lawsuit .
After I said that I 'm going on air to talk about his company regardless of whether he joins me or not -- he finally agreed to join us live .
Afterward he used a few of his now infamous four letter words while screaming at my producer and myself following the interview .
He yelled with pointed finger in my face ( and I 'm quoting ) " I know dirty and I know clean and that was dirty ! "
So judge for yourselves .
My transcript of the entire interview is below .
MB : How can American Apparel expand while industry is getting smaller and retail hard hit ?
DC : We 're very optimistic about the retail environment for our sector .
We 're basically selling to young international adults in cities like new York or London .
They do n't own homes , they do n't have debt , they do n't own cars for the most part , they have no heating oil bill , and their wages are going up not down .
We 're feeling very strongly about the growth opportunity for us .
We also think there can be some real estate opportunities as far as other retailers that cater to the boomers or some other generational markets that are being harder hit .
So , we 're excited about the go forward opportunities and we 're not seeing any resistance to our growth plans .
MB : APP is known for its support of fair labor practices , pro-immigration and for manufacturing in the U.S.
Are you going to have to outsource to cut costs now that you are in public markets ?
DC : We have a high gross margin to start with .
its my argument that by manufacturing in the united states , we 're able to control the quality of production and the fluidity of production and it is the least costly option for us .
Because we own our own stores and we want to have a perfect composition of inventory on the store floor .
that 's where we make our money and its well known that we have a high margin .
Our gross margins are above 75 percent of our store level .
So it would n't pay to go offshore to save a few points if you lose the upside opportunity to gross margin .
We 're looking at tightening up our facilities here in the united states and building stronger infrastructure to execute our business plan even further .
MB : When present to investors , many will ask what headline risk there is with your harassment lawsuit and personal behavior .
How tell investors that 's not a worry ?
DC : I think we have a fantastic business , I think were running it very well , we have a phenomenal management team , and we have not shown any ... our sales are in order , we had 27 percent same store sales in Q3 and I think people will be impressed with the manor in which we run our business .
I do n't see the risk you are talking about but we 'll see where it goes .
I think we need to get a few quarters under our belt but I think people will be impressed with what were doing and how were making things happen at American Apparel .
MB : The controversial advertising and ongoing lawsuits are n't a risk for shareholders -- there wo n't be a financial cost ?
DC : I think we have a fantastic ad campaign and I do n't see any problems there .
You 're asking me about law suits .
I do n't want to comment on those right now .
And there are not a multiple of lawsuits , there is one .
But I do n't see this as an ongoing risk for us .
I think we have a very tight business and we have a lot to offer shareholders .
MB : You 've gotten a lot of tabloid heat for your behavior .
Is it unfair ?
Would you like to respond ?
DC : Well , there is always a tabloid element in any situation like that .
but I think we 're doing fantastically well and I 'm optimistic about where our business is going and I think our actions will speak for themselves .
That 's all I have to say .
WASHINGTON  Mayor Giuliani will announce a new four - point war strategy in New Hampshire today , an effort to refocus a primary campaign season for Republicans that has centered in recent weeks less on foreign affairs and more on immigration and domestic issues .
Click Image to Enlarge Eric Thayer / Getty Mayor Giuliani meets with his supporters and staff at his Iowa campaign headquarters on December 29 in Clive .
Specifically , Mr. Giuliani will call for a new military surge in Afghanistan , a change in the way America 's spies are promoted so that officers are rewarded for finding actionable intelligence and not just the number of agents they recruit , and a new war on Al Qaeda 's intricate network of Web sites , sites used both to communicate with its agents in the field and to recruit new jihadis .
As Republican voters have changed the conversation , Mr. Giuliani 's campaign has dipped in the national polls and has pulled out of Iowa 's first in the nation caucuses scheduled for tomorrow .
Instead , Mr. Giuliani has focused his efforts on winning in Florida and South Carolina , and will be campaigning for a respectable showing in the first primary in New Hampshire .
Mr. Giuliani's new proposal also comes as President Bush heads to Jerusalem this week for his first trip there as president , and as the White House comes to grips with the crisis in Pakistan after the assassination of the country 's former premier , Benazir Bhutto .
" I think the problem in Pakistan and the assassination of Benazir Bhutto has raised a lot of concern and questions , " the Giuliani campaign 's senior foreign policy adviser , Charles Hill , said in an interview yesterday .
" The media has focused on it , the American people have asked questions anew , it has certainly made clear that the challenge of Islamic radicalism is very much alive and very much a threat . "
Mr. Giuliani will give his speech today at the Wright Museum in Wolfeboro , N.H .
His plan is divided into four major themes : expanding the military , improving intelligence , homeland security , and winning the war of ideas against radical Islam .
The speech differs in emphasis in important ways from Mr. Giuliani 's essay in Foreign Affairs from September , in that it focuses exclusively on what Mr. Giuliani calls the " terrorists ' war on us . "
Mr. Hill yesterday conceded that the question of Al Qaeda 's Web sites was a tricky one , both from an international jurisdiction perspective ( almost all of these sites are hosted on servers in foreign countries ) and because there is some intelligence value to monitoring the sites .
" There is the larger question of these being used for incitement .
It is a balance between the intelligence value of monitoring these and the other side where they are using them for proselytizing and inciting violence , " Mr. Hill said .
He added later that the Web recruitment for Al Qaeda is one of the areas in the current war that is " not being attended to , " by the current administration .
On Afghanistan , Mr. Hill said the military surge that the mayor envisions would potentially double the number of Americans serving there .
" We are talking about something that may be in the dimension of doubling the Americans there , which is now around 25,000 , with less than half in a combat role , " he said .
When asked from where the troops would come , Mr. Hill did not rule in or rule out reducing the size of the American presence in Iraq , but he also stressed that the troop level in Iraq should be based on the security needs there .
He pointed out that over time , a Giuliani administration would seek to expand the size of the military considerably .
For the changes to intelligence agencies , Mr. Giuliani will focus on the promotions within the CIA 's clandestine service and also potential change of the office of the director of national intelligence , the agency created in the wake of the intelligence failures after September 11 , 2001 .
That agency last month released a national intelligence estimate on Iran that in its declassified form contended that Iran 's open enrichment of uranium was distinct from a formal weapons program .
" We are not there yet , there is a lot of work to be done in terms of reconciling and reforming the intelligence community , " Mr. Hill said .
Of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , Mr. Hill said " maybe there is a lot of value in that , it does n't seem to be where it ought to be right now . "
On Homeland Security , Mr. Giuliani is going to emphasize the importance of turning " first responders , " firemen , police officers and other local officials called on to respond to crisis , into " first preventers . "
Mr. Hill said this would mean encouraging local police departments to have a closer relationship with the Department of Homeland Security than just a national data base of terror alerts .
" Law enforcement and homeland security should be talking to each other more , they should be interwired , " Mr. Hill said .
Jewish Singer to Coulter : perfect me

The latest offering from satirist Leah Kauffman , the musical mind behind the ' Obama Girl ' videos , takes a shot at conservative commentator Ann Coulter .
The video , featured in a blog post on in the ABC blog Political Punch , goes after Coulter in a far more serious tone that her previous videos .
" The song features clips of Coulter making some of her more offensive comments about John Edwards , Arabs , and the 9/11 widows , " Jake Trapper writes .
" Playing off Coulter 's recent pronouncement that Christians want to ' perfect '
Jews by converting them , Kauffman makes light of Coulter 's imperfections . "
For Kauffman , it 's no holds barred .
" Mom says she 's whore / Dad says she 's starved for attention , " Kauffman sings in the video , " But she 's got the hottest Adam 's apple at the Republican Convention . "
Kauffman refers to her Judaism throughout , usually contrasted by a controversial or infamous quote from Coulter .
Goes the chorus : " Perfect me / Make me petty / I want to be hateful like Ann Coulter / Convert me / To Christianity / I want to be perfected , " cut to a Coulterism , then : " Like Ann Coulter . "

The following video is from ABCNews.com , broadcast on October 26 , 2007 .
In some ways , self - experimentation has more in common with economics than with the hard sciences .
Without the ability to run randomized experiments , economists are often left to exploit whatever data they can get hold of .
Let 's say you 're an economist trying to measure the effect of imprisonment on crime rates .
What you would ideally like to do is have a few randomly chosen states suddenly release 10,000 prisoners , while another few random states lock up an extra 10,000 people .
In the absence of such a perfect experiment , you are forced to rely on creative proxies -- like lawsuits that charge various states with prison overcrowding , which down the road lead to essentially random releases of large numbers of prisoners .
( And yes , crime in those states does rise sharply after the prisoners are released . )
What could be a more opportunistic means of generating data than exploiting your own body ?
Roberts started small , with his acne , then moved on to his early waking .
It took him more than 10 years of experimenting , but he found that his morning insomnia could be cured if , on the previous day , he got lots of morning light , skipped breakfast and spent at least eight hours standing .
Stranger yet was the fix he discovered for lifting his mood : at least one hour each morning of TV viewing , specifically life - size talking heads -- but never such TV at night .
Once he stumbled upon this solution , Roberts , like many scientists , looked back to the Stone Age for explication .
Anthropological research suggests that early humans had lots of face - to - face contact every morning but precious little after dark , a pattern that Roberts 's TV viewing now mimicked .
It was also the Stone Age that informed his system of weight control .
Over the years , he had tried a sushi diet , a tubular - pasta diet , a five - liters - of - water - a - day diet and various others .
They all proved ineffective or too hard or too boring to sustain .
He had by now come to embrace the theory that our bodies are regulated by a " set point , " a sort of Stone Age thermostat that sets an optimal weight for each person .
This thermostat , however , works the opposite of the one in your home .
When your home gets cold , the thermostat turns on the furnace .
But according to Roberts 's interpretation of the set - point theory , when food is scarcer , you become less hungry ; and you get hungrier when there 's a lot of food around .
This may sound backward , like telling your home 's furnace to run only in the summer .
But there is a key difference between home heat and calories : while there is no good way to store the warm air in your home for the next winter , there is a way to store today 's calories for future use .
It 's called fat .
In this regard , fat is like money : you can earn it today , put it in the bank and withdraw it later when needed .
I ’m terribly sorry if this fits within the bounds of help - me - fix - my - computer threads but I need to make sure I am not crazy .
On Mac OS 10.4 , Intel , whipping up the calculator app , jumping into scientific mode and entering PI + PI = returns 6 .
Yes , just 6 .
On the other hand , PI * 1 + PI = gives 6.28318530718 .
My question is thus : am I insane or are Apple developers using Bible - based code ?
It ’s not often that I see software that really changes my world .
It ’s even rarer that I see software that I know will change the world my sons live in .
I can count those times pretty easily .
The first time I saw an Apple II in 1977 .
When Richard Cameron showed me Apple ’s Hypercard .
Microsoft ’s Excel. Aldus’ Pagemaker .
And something called Photoshop , all in his West Valley Community College classroom .
Later when I saw Marc Andreessen ’s Netscape running the WWW .
ICQ and Netmeeting which laid the ground for Skype .
Like I said , these things do n’t happen often .
Yesterday was one of those days .
Curtis Wong and Jonathan Fay , researchers at Microsoft , fired up their machines and showed me something that I can’t tell you about until February 27th .
I ’m sure you ’ll read about his work in the New York Times or TechCrunch , among other places .
It ’s too inspiring to stay a secret for long .
While watching the demo I realized the way I look at the world was about to change .
While listening to Wong I noticed a tear running down my face .
It ’s been a long while since Microsoft did something that had an emotional impact on me like that .
Why torment you with a post like this ?
Because it ’s my way of making sure that stuff that really is extraordinary gets paid attention to .
And because I wanted to get down the emotional impact of what I saw before that feeling totally wears off .
I also wanted to get down some lessons that others at Microsoft might learn from so that they can have this kind of impact in their own work .
Imagine if Microsoft did 10 things a year like what Curtis and Jonathan showed me yesterday ?
If the innovation engine at Microsoft were working that well there would n’t be any pressure to buy Yahoo .
Heck , and if there were a constant stream of stuff like what I saw yesterday Yahoo would n’t be resisting going to Microsoft .
They ’d + want + to go to Microsoft .
Yesterday is the first time since leaving that I wish I were back working at Microsoft .
Now , I can hear Christopher Coulter in my head .
The thing these two guys did wo n’t have a business impact the way , say , Microsoft Office did .
There is n’t a business model here .
But does every damn thing need a business model ?
Does a scientific paper that changes the world need a business model ?
Does it need more audience than just the other 50 scientists in the world who care about that topic ?
No .
But back to that tear .
Note that it was n’t a team of 100 people who did it .
Two guys with a supporting cast of maybe a dozen .
I ’ve noticed a trend at Microsoft : that the coolest stuff is done by small teams without a ton of resources .
Down the hall from Wong and Fay was researcher Andy Wilson .
When I walked into his lab he was working on another cool surface computing technology for Microsoft ’s upcoming Tech Fest ( which happens March 4 ) .
He , and another researcher , were playing with a cool round screen .
You might know of Andy ’s work : it was his research and demos that convinced Microsoft to build the Surface device which you touch with your hands .
No need for big teams .
I never sense a lot of bureaucracy or politics in either of these two guys ’ offices .
Back to Wong and Fay ’s work .
Could they have done this at a Silicon Valley startup ?
I doubt it .
Venture Capitalists wo n’t see enough business value in what they are doing .
Plus they would need to build a team around them , work out a business plan .
Invest their own capital and time building a prototype so that people “ get it . ”
If I told you today what they were doing , without showing you the video we ’ll have up on March 3 , you ’d tell me “ that ’s lame Scoble . ”
But when you see it face - to - face everyone I know who ’s seen it say they ’ve had an emotional reaction to it .
Buzz Bruggeman , CEO of ActiveWords , was the first to tell me about it and said it was the best thing he ’s seen in years from Microsoft .
Maybe it could be done , but they ’ve been traveling all over the world working with researchers from other institutions and getting data for their new thing .
It ’s a lot easier to get access when you say “ I ’m a researcher at Microsoft ” than when you say “ I ’m building a startup . ”
Other lessons ?
Keep up to date on the latest things happening in your industry .
In Wong and Fey ’s work you ’ll see techniques that lots of startups are using and , even , that the Google Map team is using .
This is n’t stuff that was possible in 1995 so it requires 2008 - style Web services and data centers .
Anyway , I ’m getting all geeky on you ( today Rocky and I are heading to Amazon to talk with Jeff Barr of the team that built its S3 and EC2 services , among others , so that ’s probably why I ’m ramping up my geek level ) but that should n’t take away that these two guys got me to cry yesterday .
And that was a good thing .
Two guys working inside a big company still can change the world .
Ca n’t wait to talk more about what they ’ve done .
They ’ll have a bunch of press on February 27 and our video will be up on FastCompany.tv on March 3 .
UPDATE : I ’ve updated this post with a few additions here .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Investors may snap up a planned $ 1 billion debt sale by a unit of MBIA Inc MBI.N , after the beleaguered bond insurer was forced to ramp up the deal 's yield to about 14 percent to attract greater interest , according to investors familiar with the deal on Friday .
The issue of so - called surplus notes by MBIA Insurance Corp. is part of an effort by the bond insurer to buoy capital and preserve its “ AAA ” rating .
Investors on Thursday said dealers were negotiating a coupon rate between 9 percent and 12 percent , or as much as double what similarly rated bonds offer .
“ They had problems getting it done at the levels that were initially talked about , ” said Mirko Mikelic , a portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Grand Rapids , Michigan .
“ When they bumped it out to 14 percent , it got a lot of people out of the wood work . ”
Shares of MBIA rose 18 percent to $ 16.67 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Initial market talk had the yields at 9 percent to 12 percent .
The higher yield boosted investor interest , and the deal may price as early as Friday afternoon , said a person familiar with the offering .
Surplus notes , unique to insurers , can bolster MBIA ’s balance sheet since they can be classified as equity .
Pricing on the issue , initially expected this week , is uncertain , said another investor , who declined to be named .
Delayed pricing may be due to negotiations over protections demanded by some large investors against a five - year call feature , he said .
MBIA shares have plunged in the past year amid speculation the company does not have enough capital to cover losses on bonds it insures .
The company this week said it guarantees $ 9 billion of some of the riskiest mortgage - related securities , versus $ 8.1 billion announced three weeks ago .
Investors also said the deal attracted more attention after a filing on Thursday showed that distressed debt investor Marty Whitman had doubled his stake in MBIA to almost 11 percent .
Whitman is known for generating big returns on companies going through wrenching turnarounds .
Whitman ’s Third Avenue Management LLC holds a 10.98 percent stake in MBIA , the investment fund said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
An MBIA spokeswoman declined to comment .

Everything is shut .
All the pubs have locked up and the last train went ages ago .
Las Vegas this is not .
I am in downtown Wolverhampton on a Sunday night and the temperature is somewhere below zero .
The place is dead - except for one corner of town which is not merely alive but rocking .
And , as the clock passes midnight , there is no let - up in the guffawing and applause here , in the neototalitarian splendour of the Civic Hall .
More than 2,000 people are impervious to the fact that it is now Monday morning .
It is well past bedtime for many - this is a crowd of a certain age - but few show signs of flagging .
And they are all captivated by the same comedian who first appeared on this stage back at 7 pm and shows no sign of leaving it .
What 's more , he has n't uttered a single obscenity all night .
But perhaps the most remarkable thing of all is that this man has just turned 80 .
And Ken Dodd has absolutely no intention of retiring - or even slowing down .
If you 're passing through Hanley in the Midlands at midnight tonight , listen at the door of the Victoria Hall .
It will be the same next week if you happen to be strolling past Nottingham 's Royal Concert Hall in the early hours - or Liverpool 's Philharmonic
Hall the next evening .
To his fans , he is a comic genius .
To others , he is that bloke off the telly in the Seventies who built his career on his mad hair , his duster ( or " tickle stick " ) and a supporting cast of dumpy midgets called Diddymen .
To a lot of younger people , he is , simply : " Ken who ? "
But you do n't get 2,000 sane people to maroon themselves voluntarily in Wolverhampton at midnight on an Arctic Sunday unless you 're something special .
To do so at the age of 80 is beyond commendable .
After all , this is a man who has been nominated by his fellow Liverpudlians as the greatest Merseysider of all time , no mean feat in a famously self - regarding city full of pop legends and soccer gods .
He is now a Grade One listed Scouser , elevated beyond the cluttered ranks of mere celebrities to the exalted status of national treasure .
On Christmas Eve , BBC2 devotes an entire episode of Arena to the Dodd legend .
" If you do n't laugh , I do n't mind , " he tells the Wolverhampton crowd .
" I 'll just add another five minutes to the show . "
We all laugh and the show goes on anyway .
" Doddy ' launches into another bloke - visits - doctor gag .
" So this fellow tells the doctor : ' Every time I sneeze , I feel very sexy . '
The doctor asks : ' What do you take ? ' ' Pepper . ' "
It 's not a bad joke .
It 's not a great one , either .
But many people are bent double , for two reasons .
First , the delivery and timing are spot on .
Second , it 's just part of another volley in a rapid - fire joke bombardment .
There is no time to reflect too much on the merits of any gag because another one is already under way .
Ken Dodd does n't do ' boom - boom ! ' or ' geddit ? '
He just charges ahead .
If this was being televised , they would n't need the bleep machine , even before the 9 pm watershed .
The show is packed with innuendo , of course , and plenty of oo - er- missus humour which would do justice to a Carry On film .
But unlike the average Carry On caper , this is still funny .
Scroll down for more ...
" She was a big girl , " he reflects fondly of his first girlfriend .
" You could tickle her all night and never touch the same spot . "
It might not be hilarious on paper .
But , believe me , they are howling , especially when he just keeps piling it on : " She tried the speak - your - weight machine .
It said : ' To be continued ... ' "
It 's a line which captures the cleverness of Ken Dodd .
The speak - your - weight machine is such an outdated concept from the bygone age of the knotted handkerchief that if it reappeared today it would probably be arrested under the Data Protection Act .
But the joke emerges as fresh as any expletive - packed rant about the latest iPod .
I have arranged to meet Doddy before the show in his dressing room .
He has told me to ask for him at the front - of - house .
He has not told me it will be like a silver - haired pop concert .
The show is a £ 17 - a - head sell - out and they are queuing round the block in the freezing cold .
The woman inside the front door cannot talk to me as she is too busy selling Ken's " tickle sticks " to semi-hysterical ladies keen to enter the party spirit .
Even the bouncers - a breed given to boorish self - importance at such occasions - are full of bonhomie .
They know the routine for a Ken Dodd evening .
It will be impeccably behaved and extremely long .
" Ken 's always welcome here - whatever time he wants to finish , " says manager Steve Evans .
David Prees , 57 , has had an hour 's drive from Tamworth in Staffordshire to be here .
He has been attending Dodd gatherings since the Sixties and expects a late night .
" The latest ever ?
Oh , that was probably the Alexandra in Birmingham five or six years ago when we did n't get out till 2.30 in the morning .
You sometimes hear a few jokes you 've heard before , but they 're always funny .
I 've seen Ken more than any other comic .
I just like his attitude .
And you certainly get value for money . "
There 's no grand entourage .
Anne Jones , Ken 's girlfriend , sidekick and support act for two decades , comes out to usher me backstage where the man himself is padding around his spartan dressing room in socks .
He looks much younger than his 80 years - he has became an octogenarian in the past few weeks - and his hair has the same old just - electrocuted look .
What does he put in it ?
" It 's natural .
It just does what it does . "
This is not so much a celebrity dressing room as a council office with a mirror .
Does Dodd have any diva - style demands , like those celebrities who have to have pink flowers or a feng shui furniture arrangement ?
He laughs .
" They 're very nice here and give me coffee and biscuits but I do n't ask for anything .
Most of the places I go these days , you have to take your own soap . "
Born in the Liverpool suburb of Knotty Ash - where he still lives - Dodd says he had an idyllic childhood .
His father was a coal merchant and a natural comedian from whom the boy Ken learned the art of joke - telling .
As a teenager , he bought his own ventriloquist 's dummy and went touring local stages , supplementing his wages from his father 's coal business .
His heroes were local comedians like Arthur Askey and Tommy Handley and , in 1957 , he , too , joined the ranks of the professional entertainers .
Within a decade , he was enjoying a record - breaking run at the London Palladium and beating the Beatles to Number One in the charts .
He played in front of Prime Ministers and royalty and his appearance in any seaside theatre during the summer would guarantee a sell - out season .
Television turned him into a British institution .
Other comedians could raise laughs just by impersonating Ken Dodd .
The comic landscape started to change , though .
What were originally known as " alternative comedians " started to become the norm .
The traditional variety acts started to fade .
Television stars like Mike Yarwood had been giants in the Seventies but by the late Eighties , their sort of stuff was curling at the edges .
Some of them disappeared .
Others packed their crumpled dinner jackets and hit the road , spending their summers at the end of a pier and their winters in panto .
Scroll down for more ...
The big television audiences no longer craved an old - fashioned night of " light entertainment " with a few safe song and dance routines , a half - decent magic act and a front man with a few mother - in - law jokes and the same old impressions with the same old props : Harold Wilson ( pipe ) , Denis Healey ( eyebrows ) , Robin Day ( bow tie ) , Eddie Waring ( sheepskin coat ) .
But Britain was a different country then .
And that is what I find so impressive about Ken Dodd .
He excelled in the heyday of variety , endured the comedy reformation and yet is still going strong .
In 1989 , just as his genre of entertainment was falling off a cliff , he was tried for tax evasion .
He was acquitted but the publicity , the pressure and the timing of the case might have killed off a lesser funny man .
Dodd merely picked up his tickle stick and returned to the stage to find his audience as enthusiastic as ever .
And , 18 years later , they are just as excited here in Wolverhampton as they pile in to the stalls .
The majority would probably qualify for a free bus pass but there are plenty who have a long way to go before Saga calls .
In the front row , I find three generations of the same family .
Cannock teacher Lisa Pearce , 36 , has been a Doddy fan since she first caught him in Bloxwich at the age of 12 , and tonight she is here with her mother , June Simkiss , and her 12 - year - old son , William .
All are fully equipped with tickle sticks .
" I love his humour and the fact that all three of us will laugh at the same things , " says Lisa .
It might be a far cry from a Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium but Dodd is clearly in his element .
I had half - expected a trace of ennui , a glimpse of a jaded old pro going through the motions .
Not at all .
He genuinely loves every minute on stage - " I 'm stagestruck , always have been " - and cannot envisage life any other way .
" Retirement is when a man stops doing what he does n't want to do . "
He and Ann certainly like the odd holiday .
" We 'll have a holiday for the body in somewhere like Tenerife , then a holiday for the mind - like watching circus acts in Munich . "
But life just seems to be an interval between shows .
" I love these big old halls .
They 're all different and so are the audiences .
You have to play them like an instrument and I can honestly say I 've never done the same show twice , " he says , buzzing with anticipation , ten minutes before kick - off .
Is he nervous ?
" Of course .
I 'm like a racehorse in the stalls . "
Moments later , the show starts with a few carols from a supporting cast of child performers .
It 's not much of a warm - up but Ken Dodd does n't need one .
He tells the audience that he 's rubbish and they 're rubbish but we all know that this is rubbish .
They 're loving it .
" When I first came in , I thought I was in out - patients .
Heavy breathers , go over there .
Haemorrhoids ?
You remain standing ... "
And he just hoses them down with gags for the best part of two hours .
" How many men does it take to change a toilet roll ?
Do n't know .
It 's never been done . "
The routine is peppered with jokes about money and accountants .
It 's a bit incongruous at first until I remember the court case .
Most people would probably rather forget about it - I had imagined that Dodd would , too .
Liverpool is a recurring theme .
He still lives in the same house where he grew up and is fiercely proud of his home city 's imminent inauguration as European City of Culture .
But that does n't mean it 's not a laughing matter : " The dockers are having ballet lessons ... I came down the other morning .
There was the car jacked up on four encyclopedias . "
After about an hour and a half , he makes way for a wartime sing - song .
A lot of people head for the bar but rush back when Dodd reappears in his furry red " moggy coat " for another hour and a half .
One or two unfortunates cannot stave off the call of nature and try to slide out to the loos but he 's soon on to them .
" Am I that bad ? " he shouts as a blushing woman makes a run for the ladies .
The interval finally arrives at 10 pm but the star turn has barely got going .
On and on he goes .
Some of his jokes are from another age - a distant land of coal sacks , pools coupons and beauty contests in Skegness .
Who cares ?
It all makes sense - and nonsense .
Finally , somewhere after midnight , he senses that the moment has come and launches into a parting burst of one of his old hits , Absent Friends .
It 's shamelessly sentimental .
And he does it brilliantly .
They give him an ovation .
He comes to the front of the stage to shake a forest of hands .
For us , the show is over .
For Ken Dodd , it 's the beginning of another interval before he is back on in Hanley , Nottingham , Liverpool , Derby , Brecon , Bournemouth ...
If he is lucky , he 'll be in bed by 3 am .
Happy 80th , Ken .
WASHINGTON 
The newest tool at airport security checkpoints is 3 inches long and costs only a few dollars : a handheld black light .
Airport screeners are starting to use them this month to examine driver 's licenses and other passenger ID cards presented at checkpoints to spot forgeries or tampering .
Passengers with suspicious documents can be questioned by police or immigration agents .
Black lights will help screeners inspect the ID cards by illuminating holograms , typically of government seals , that are found in licenses and passports .
Screeners also are getting magnifying glasses that highlight tiny inscriptions found in borders of passports and other IDs .
About 2,100 of each are going to the nation 's 800 airport checkpoints .
The closer scrutiny of passenger IDs is the latest Transportation Security Administration effort to check passengers more thoroughly than simply having them walk through metal detectors .
In the past six months , the agency has been taking over the checking of passenger IDs and boarding passes at airport checkpoints .
For years , security guards hired by airlines have done that .
" This is a significant security upgrade , " TSA chief Kip Hawley says .
Screeners are trained in spotting forged documents and will get some training in studying suspicious passenger behavior to pick out people who merit deeper scrutiny at the checkpoint , Hawley says .
The TSA screeners , unlike security guards , also get daily briefings on the latest airport security concerns .
More than 40 passengers have been arrested since June in cases when TSA screeners spotted altered passports , fraudulent visas and resident ID cards , and forged driver 's licenses .
Many of them were arrested on immigration charges .
Airport security consultant Rich Roth says screeners will do a better job than security guards checking identification because they have training and " a little more authority " to question passengers .
Airlines welcome having screeners observe passengers while checking their IDs and boarding passes .
" That 's the kind of resources the TSA can devote to the document - checking that the airlines didn't , " says David Castelveter of the Air Transport Association , a trade group of major U.S. airlines .
The TSA has taken over document - checking in about 400 of the 450 airports where it operates .
The agency will take over the remaining 50 in the next couple of months , TSA spokeswoman Ellen Howe says .

Bush Stealthily Authorizes Full Access to U.S. Roads for Even More Mexico - Based NAFTA
Trucks
Statement of Joan Claybrook , President of Public Citizen
In a stealthy maneuver , the Bush administration has boosted the threat to the public by increasing the number of Mexico - based trucking firms allowed access to all U.S. roads as part of the reckless North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) trucking “ pilot program . ”
The Department of Transportation recently revealed an increase in the number of NAFTA trucks permitted to all U.S. highways – now 10 carriers , sending as many as 55 trucks throughout the country .
The last time the Bush administration made a public announcement about the number of Mexico - based carriers allowed to participate in the NAFTA trucks pilot program , there were only three carriers .
It has long been the tradition by this administration to bury bad news like this by sending out press releases on Friday afternoon , but in this case , the Department of Transportation ( DOT ) reached a new low : not sending any press release at all , but simply updating a Web page .
Both houses of Congress have passed versions of the DOT spending bill that includes provisions to shut down this dangerous folly .
Unfortunately for all members of the public who must travel every day on the nation ’s roads , the White House has threatened to veto the final bill .
It is high time for President Bush to get out of the way and let the Senate vote on the final bill before any more lives are put at risk .
In 2001 , a NAFTA tribunal ordered the U.S. to permit access to all U.S. roads for Mexico - domiciled trucking companies .
The Clinton administration refused to comply with the NAFTA tribunal , citing serious safety and environmental concerns with Mexico ’s trucking fleet .
The Bush administration has tried since 2002 to enforce the NAFTA order to open U.S. highways to unsafe trucks .
Congress has intervened repeatedly to stop the Bush administration .
In September , the Bush administration tried to meet NAFTA ’s dictates by launching a pilot program to allow up to 100 motor carriers from Mexico full access to U.S. highways .
However , the project violates a 2001 congressional mandate that Mexico - domiciled trucking companies meet U.S. safety standards regarding hours of service , driver training and licensing , and vehicle safety before being allowed access to the nation ’s roadways .
A lawsuit filed by several groups , including Public Citizen , alleging that the pilot program does n’t meet congressional requirements is still pending in the Ninth Circuit .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Health - care products maker Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N won U.S. approval to sell a new HIV drug called Intelence for patients with resistance to other therapies , U.S. officials said on Friday .
An AIDS patient holds his morning dose of medication at the AIDS hospice in the Wat Phrabaht Nampu temple in Thailand 's Lop Buri province , about 160 km ( 100 miles ) north of Bangkok , July 3 , 2004 .

The drug , also known as TMC125 or etravirine , is a new member of the family of AIDS - fighting drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NNRTI ) .
More than two dozen drugs are approved for fighting the deadly HIV virus .
Patients need new options because HIV can mutate to resist existing treatments .
The Food and Drug Administration said it approved Intelence for use with other AIDS drugs .
It was cleared for adults who have failed alternative HIV therapies .
The new tablet is the first NNRTI to work for patients who have developed resistance to medicines in the same family , officials with J&J unit Tibotec said .
“ Doctors and patients can use ( Intelence ) in those patients that ... have had several or multiple rounds of resistance develop , ” Tibotec Research and Development President Roger Pomerantz said in an interview .
Tens of thousands of patients worldwide have resistance to NNRTIs and could be candidates for Intelence , Pomerantz said .
The drug ’s wholesale cost will be $ 5.45 per tablet , Tibotec spokeswoman Pamela Van Houten said .
The approved dosing is two tablets twice per day , or a total of four tablets daily .
Close to 40 million people are infected with HIV .
Medicines in different classes attack the virus at various stages in its cycle of infection and replication .
NNRTIs block a key enzyme that HIV uses to replicate .
AIDS drugs do not cure the infection but they can suppress the virus and minimize symptoms .
The approval of Intelence was based on studies of patients treated with a cocktail of AIDS drugs plus Intelence or a placebo for 24 weeks .
Sixty percent of patients treated with Intelence had their virus suppressed to undetectable levels , compared with 40 percent of placebo patients , Tibotec said .
The most common problems reported were skin rashes and nausea , the FDA said .
The agency advised patients who take Intelence to contact a doctor if a rash develops .
Rare cases of serious skin rashes such as Stevens - Johnson syndrome were reported in studies , the FDA said .
The agency also cautioned that Intelence patients may develop infections , and long - term effects are unknown .
The drug may interact with various medications and patients should tell their doctors and pharmacists about all medications they take , the FDA SAID .

A Jedi " church " has been born in a galaxy far far away - North Wales .
The Holyhead chapter of the self - styled Jedi Church , which claims up to 400,000 members worldwide , has sprung up thanks to brothers Barney and Daniel Jones , both Star Wars obsessives .
The " church " is only one of a handful around the planet , said hairdresser Barney , 26 , the Anglesey Order Minister , also known as Master Jonba Hehol .
Scroll down for more ...
" Some people think it will be quite interesting but lots of people will ridicule us because it seems quite nerdy but we 've had a good reaction so far , " he said .
" We think of it as proper lifestyle enhancement and it should be taken seriously - it can't be bad if it makes life better .
" We live normal day - to - day lives .
" We are trying to take away the humour of it all and bring more structure so people take it more seriously . "
The " religion " was born as a result of a nationwide joke in the 2001 census when nearly 400,000 claimed their belief system was Jedi .
And now Barney and musician Daniel , 21 - or Master Morda Hehol , self - appointed UK " church " leader - are getting their new " religion " off the ground .
" It 's serious , " said Barney .
" We will have teachings based on Yoda - the 900 - year - old grand master - as well as readings , essays submitted , meditation and relaxation , visualisation and discuss healthy eating .
" The Jedi religion is about life improvement , inner peace and changing your lifestyle so you have a more fulfilling existence .
" It 's based on the films but we have brought things into it because the films are a bit more sci-fi .
" But we have developed on the film 's teachings , introducing teachings we believe the Jedi Knights would seek .
" We used to watch the films over and over again and it came about from that . "
There will be no chance of their empire striking back at people who mock the Jedi , as they are a peace - loving bunch , said Barney .
The Anglesey order has 80 worshippers - whose uniform is head - to - toe black - but is growing daily , said Barney - who as a master wears brown hooded robes .
And when a building has been found to home the movement , the brothers aim to provide lightsabre fighting classes .
" Worshippers " will take a series of tests to scale the Jedi hierarchy .
Plans have also been made to open a Jedi " church " in Surrey and in the Philippines to follow on from America 's first in Florida .
Bungee Jumping a Little Scary ?
Try Human Trebuchet
Trebuchets are Middle Ages weapons , similar to a catapult with longer range and more accuracy , that use the mechanical principle of leverage to propel a stone or other projectile at a given target .
So remove the stone and make the projectile a human and you have “ Human Trebuchet “ … and the scare of your life .
This segment on a Japanese television show demonstrates the “ human trebuchet ” in action .

Echoes of Willy Wonka Chocolate Sauce Blocks Autobahn
Thirteen tons of chocolate melted and flowed across the German Autobahn on Thursday night after the truck carrying it caught fire .
Responsiveness
We have a joke around the office , when a new hire is setting up their development environment for the first time .
" Now we go to lunch while Maven downloads the Internet . "
Software should be responsive .
When you tell it to do something it should do it .
Take a pristine Maven installation and tell it to build a Java application -- i.e. perform its most obvious , primary function -- and Maven will first say " Wait a moment , I have to download three dozen different components before I can even start doing what you asked me to do . "
" Ah " , you say .
" That 's how maven works .
It 's a modular system , you 're just using it to build a Java app . "
To which I reply : " Then do n't give me a spoon and tell me to use it to cut steak . "
The fact that all these components are downloaded separately and in serial mean the overhead of not including them is far greater than if they 'd put them all ( even plus a bunch more you might not need ) in the core installation .
Worse , though , this happens not when you 're installing maven , but when you 're trying to use it to do something else .
This process does n't stop at installation .
Far too often you 'll run maven and it will gleefully traipse off through various repositories doing its own internal housecleaning before actually performing the build .
It 's like walking up to a shop assistant and asking him to help you find a book , only to watch him dust shelves for fifteen minutes first .
Reliability
Consider two pieces of software .
One uses maven ( and 1 –n artifact repositories ) to manage its dependencies , the other keeps all its dependencies in source - control .
How many potential points of failure are involved in checking out and building each product ?
Repeatability
Builds must be repeatable .
If you check out a particular version of your code and build it with particular versions of your tools , you should get a product that is binary - identical each time .
( Modulo things like compiled - in build dates , obviously )
Maven seems to try as hard as it can to prevent this .
Files go missing from public Maven repositories and suddenly a whole swathe of historical versions of open source projects can't be built without hacking .
ibiblio reorganises its directory layout and chaos ensues .
Imagine what happens in ten years time when maven has been superceded by some new tool , public maven repository maintenance is an afterthought , and you desperately need to patch some legacy Java app ?
For well - resourced projects , the solution is to maintain your own repository and ensure all your dependencies will be available from it , for all time , but even that wo n't help you if you suddenly need the compile - time dependencies of a project you previously only used as a binary .
( A number of responses to this blog post have assumed that all my problems could be solved by a locally maintained repository , and / or a repository proxy .
We have both .
They help to some extent , but they in no way solve the problem completely .
All they are is a band - aid over the fundamental issue , and once again , additional potential points of failure . )
Most open - source projects just assume their dependencies will continue to exist in " the cloud " for eternity .
Plugins are the worst culprit .
Since the core of maven exists solely to download an Internet 's - worth of plugins to do the heavy lifting , and maven has a nasty habit of upgrading those plugins without any user - prompting whatsoever , builds can be crippled by some well - meaning committer " fixing " some piece of functionality .
I 'm told this has been fixed recently ( or will be fixed soon ) but versions should not be a moving target .
v. 2.0.1 of your build tool should be v. 2.0.1 of your build tool .
Forever .
Case Study : Dependency Management
One of the big strengths of Maven 2 is supposed to be the way it manages dependencies , including transitive dependencies .
So if jar A requires jar B which requires jar C , Maven will sort all this out for you .
Tracking down dependencies and sorting out their transitive relationships is a tricky task , but it 's a tricky task you only ever have to do when you modify your dependencies .
Maven , on the other hand , wants to do this job every time you build , which adds a huge responsiveness overhead , as the " pom " definition files of each dependency must be retrieved and analysed alongside their jars .
Dependencies may live in a number of different repositories , and these repositories are out of the control of the user , especially in the case of maven - built open - source projects that almost universally rely on the public ibiblio , apache and Codehaus repositories .
This impacts both reliability , as all these repositories must be available , and repeatability , as changes to the repositories may have catastrophic effects on the build .
Reliability problems also creep in because maven , forced to do dependency resolution in each build , must hide a lot of what it 's doing from view lest it overwhelm the user even more .
Conflicting transitive dependencies are resolved implicity , and you have to make a concerted effort ( with clumsy tools ) to manually find out what was going on .
Paradoxically , by trying to make dependency management easy , maven makes it incredibly hard .
It becomes dangerously easy for a project to accumulate dependency cruft — — at best unnecessary , at worst conflicting — — and excruciatingly painful to remove them .
Conclusion
( Fortune Magazine ) -- " Sorry Steve , Here 's Why Apple Stores Wo n't Work , " BusinessWeek wrote with great certainty in 2001 .
" It 's desperation time in Cupertino , Calif. , " opined TheStreet.com .
" I give [ Apple ] two years before they 're turning out the lights on a very painful and expensive mistake , " predicted retail consultant David Goldstein .
Yet five years later , at 4:15 A.M. , a light flickered on .
Onlookers were bathed in the milky - white glow of the Apple logo , suspended in a freestanding cube of glass at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Central Park South in Manhattan .
Dazzling in clarity and 32 feet on a side , the structure was likened variously to a temple , the Louvre Pyramid , Apple 's G4 " Cube " computer , a giant button , and even - in the words of NBC's Brian Williams - Steve Jobs ' Model T .
But it was , everyone could agree , manifestly a store .
" People have n't been willing to invest this much time and money or engineering in a store before , " says the Apple CEO , his feet propped on Apple 's boardroom table in Cupertino .
" It 's not important if the customer knows that .
They just feel it .
They feel something 's a little different . "
And not just the architecture .
Saks , whose flagship is down the street , generates sales of $ 362 per square foot a year .
Best Buy ( Charts ) stores turn $ 930 - tops for electronics retailers - while Tiffany & Co. ( Charts ) takes in $ 2,666 .
Audrey Hepburn liked Tiffany 's for breakfast .
But at $ 4,032 , Apple is eating everyone 's lunch .
That astonishing number , from a Sanford C. Bernstein report , is merely the average of Apple 's 174 stores , which attract 13,800 visitors a week .
( The Fifth Avenue store averages 50,000 - plus . )
In 2004 , Apple reached $ 1 billion in annual sales faster than any retailer in history ; last year , sales reached $ 1 billion a quarter .
And now comes the next , if not must - have , then must - see , product .
" Our stores were conceived and built for this moment in time - to roll out iPhone , " says Jobs , summoning one to the table with a tantalizing I 've - got - the - future - in - my - pocket twinkle .
If sales are anywhere near expectations - Apple ( Charts ) hopes to move ten million iPhones in 2008 - the typical Apple Store could be selling , in absolute terms , as much as a Best Buy , and with just a fraction of the selling space .
You could say that Apple has landed - not only on our street corners and in our malls but also , for the first time , on the top ten of Fortune 's Most Admired Companies .
Its peers have watched it upend industries from computers to music .
But how did a high - tech wundercompany become America 's best shopkeeper ?
" I started to get scared , " says Jobs .
Looking angularly trim in his trademark mock turtleneck and jeans ( shopping , one is reminded , has never been integral to his lifestyle ) , Jobs is describing what he saw circa 2000 .
The company was increasingly dependent on mega-retailers - companies that had little incentive , never mind training , to position Apple 's products as anything unique .
" It was like , ' We have to do something , or we 're going to be a victim of the plate tectonics .
And we have to think different about this .
We have to innovate here . ' "
The leap into retail , though , would be from a standing start .
" We looked at it and said , ' You know , this is probably really hard , and really easy for us to get our head handed to us . '
So we did a few things .
No. 1 , I started asking who was the best retail executive at the time .
Everybody said Mickey Drexler , who was running the Gap ( Charts ) . "
Drexler agreed to join Apple 's board .
Next , Jobs went looking for the one right person to run Apple retail .
The answer was Ron Johnson , then a merchandising chief at Target ( Charts ) who was pushing that company 's hugely successful foray into affordable design .
" One of the best pieces of advice Mickey ever gave us was to go rent a warehouse and build a prototype of a store , and not , you know , just design it , go build 20 of them , then discover it did n't work , " says Jobs .
In other words , design it as you would a product .
Apple Store Version 0.0 took shape in a warehouse near the Apple campus .
" Ron and I had a store all designed , " says Jobs , when they were stopped by an insight :
The computer was evolving from a simple productivity tool to a " hub " for video , photography , music , information , and so forth .
The sale , then , was less about the machine than what you could do with it .
But looking at their store , they winced .
The hardware was laid out by product category - in other words , by how the company was organized internally , not by how a customer might actually want to buy things .
" We were like , ' Oh , God , we 're screwed ! ' " says Jobs .
But they were n't screwed ; they were in a mockup .
" So we redesigned it , " he says .
" And it cost us , I do n't know , six , nine months .
But it was the right decision by a million miles . "
When the first store finally opened , in Tysons Corner , Va. , only a quarter of it was about product .
The rest was arranged around interests : along the right wall , photos , videos , kids ; on the left , problems .
A third area - the Genius Bar in the back - was Johnson 's brainstorm .
" When we launched retail , I got this group together , people from a variety of walks of life , " says Johnson .
" As an icebreaker , we said , ' Tell us about the best service experience you 've ever had . ' "
Of the 18 people , 16 said it was in a hotel .
This was unexpected .
But of course :
The concierge desk at a hotel is n't selling anything ; it 's there to help .
" We said , ' Well , how do we create a store that has the friendliness of a Four Seasons Hotel ? ' "
The answer : " Let 's put a bar in our stores .
But instead of dispensing alcohol , we dispense advice . "
Johnson is telling the story as he walks the floor of Apple 's San Francisco store , a perfect stainless - steel box punctuated by a massive skylight , which is throwing sun on a thirtysomething couple getting a tutorial at the Genius Bar .
" See that ? " says Johnson .
" Look at their eyes .
They 're learning .
There 's an intense moment - like when you see a kid in school going ' Aha ! ' "
What else does Johnson see ?
A guy with a broken laptop .
The chances of getting it fixed today are one in three ; by tomorrow , two in three .
" We 're trying to get as fast as the dry cleaner , " says Johnson , crossing the glass skybridge that spans the second floor .
The most striking thing , though , is what you do n't see .
No. 1 : clutter .
Jobs has focused Apple 's resources on fewer than 20 products , and those have steadily been shrinking in size .
Backroom inventory , then , can shrink in physical volume even as sales volume grows .
Also missing , at the newest stores , anyway , is a checkout counter .
The system Apple developed , EasyPay , lets salespeople wander the floor with wireless credit - card readers and ask , " Would you like to pay for that ? "
The interiors , too , have been distilled to a minimum of elements .
" We 've gotten it down so there 's only three materials we 're using : glass , stainless steel , and wood , " says Johnson .
" We spent a year and a half perfecting that steel .
Stainless steel can be cold if you do n't get the finish right .
See the bounce ?
See the blues up there ? "
No , frankly , but Apple hunted down a Japanese supplier and pushed it to achieve the effect by blasting the metal with small beads .
Suppliers describe working with Apple as both thrilling and scary .
" We 're used to working on projects with very high standards , " says Michael Mulhern of TriPyramid Structures , whose components hold the Fifth Avenue Cube together .
" With Apple Stores , everything is two notches above that . "
And even that does n't seem to be enough .
A few years back Jobs issued a challenge :
How small could you make a store and have it still feel big ?
The resulting " ministore " ( not " nano " ) was just 15 feet wide , with a fabric ceiling that mimics pure daylight .
The minis fit nicely into a real estate strategy that Jobs calls " Ambush the customer . "
He says he wanted to show Windows users " how much better a Mac is .
But Windows users were n't going to drive to a destination . "
That 's why Johnson waited so long for the San Francisco location - a corner off Market Street where people live , work , shop , tour , and play , as he puts it .
" The real estate was a lot more expensive , " says Jobs , but it was worth it because people " did n't have to gamble with 20 minutes of their time .
They only had to gamble with 20 footsteps of their time . "
Downstairs , a man in a hardhat walks in with an iPod nano .
Johnson likes this .
" When we launched retail , there was a real cult - of - the - Mac mentality , " he says .
" But our goal was never to have a store for a cult .
It was to be a store for everyone .
So if you look around here , " you see , in fact , the sort of group you 'd see in diversity - recruiting brochures .
Nor does the store feel like a cult .
A club , maybe , in the sense that owning a Mac means joining something .
Apple wants the purchase to be the beginning , not the conclusion , of a beautiful - and , it hopes , profitable - friendship .
" Apple has changed people 's expectations of what retail should be about , " says Candace Corlett of WSL Strategic Retail in New York .
" After they 've seen Apple , how do they feel looking at a drugstore or the jeans section in a department store ? "
Other companies are asking themselves the same question .
Saturn 's car showrooms , general manager Jill Lajkziak told the Detroit News last spring , would have a " more contemporary , more interactive look and feel -- like an Apple Store . "
And several doors down from the Apple Store in the Palisades Center mall in West Nyack , N.Y. , is a COMING SOON sign with another familiar name .
It 's one of two stores Dell ( Charts ) is experimenting with .
Sorry , Michael : Here 's Why Dell Stores & oh , never mind .
Apple , meanwhile , has not returned the compliment by taking cues from others .
" Why copy when you can create ? " asks Johnson .
The Genius Bar , for instance , is now complemented by the Studio , staffed by " Creatives " who offer one - to - one training on everything from putting together your Def Leppard tribute on iMovie to how to deejay your friend 's wedding .
That 's what makes Apple such a hard study :
The subject wo n't sit still for its portrait .
" I can't even remember Apple without the stores , " says Jobs .
It 's a statement of how integral they 've become to the company ; 8,000 of Apple 's 20,000 employees , he notes , work in retail .
But it 's also a reminder that what we 're glimpsing are his taillights .
It 's customary , at this point , to say what could go wrong - a string of product misfires , some future Apple backlash , who knows ?
But the best way to predict the future is to invent it .
" Genius sits in a glass house , " the Swiss artist Paul Klee wrote .
It 's on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Central Park South , and anyone can wander in .

THE Swiss are the world 's keenest railway users .
The distance covered by rail passengers in 2005 amounted to 2,039 km for every person in the country , according to the International Union of Railways .
In the 87 countries for which data are available , the countries where railway use is heaviest have some factors in common : good rail coverage ; efficient systems ; and less appealing alternatives .
No surprise that people in rich western countries such as Japan and France travel a lot .
But , so do those in poor , large countries such as Belarus or India , where rail networks are often the legacy of a communist government , or colonial power .
By contrast , in rich and big America where the car is king , annual rail travel amounts to a paltry 29.9 km per person .

Tree stumps at the feet of Western Canadian glaciers are providing new insights into the accelerated rates at which the rivers of ice have been shrinking due to human - aided global warming .
Geologist Johannes Koch of The College of Wooster found the deceptively fresh and intact tree stumps beside the retreating glaciers of Garibaldi Provincial Park , about 40 miles ( 60 km ) north of Vancouver , British Columbia .
What he wanted to know was how long ago the glaciers made their first forays into a long - lost forest to kill the trees and bury them under ice .
To find out , Koch radiocarbon - dated wood from the stumps to see how long they have been in cold storage .
The result was a surprising 7000 years .
" The stumps were in very good condition sometimes with bark preserved , " said Koch , who conducted the work as part of his doctoral thesis at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby , British Columbia .
Koch will present his results on Wednesday , 31 October 2007 , at the Geological Society of America Annual Meeting in Denver .
The pristine condition of the wood , he said , can best be explained by the stumps having spent all of the last seven millennia under tens to hundreds of meters of ice .
All stumps were still rooted to their original soil and location .
" Thus they really indicate when the glaciers overrode them , and their kill date gives the age of the glacier advance , " Koch explained .
They also give us a span of time during which the glaciers have always been larger than they were 7000 years ago – until the recently warming climate released the stumps from their icy tombs .
Koch compared the kill dates of the trees in the southern and northern Coast Mountains of British Columbia and those in the mid- and southern Rocky Mountains in Canada to similar records from the Yukon Territory , the European Alps , New Zealand and South America .
He also looked at the age of Oetzi , the prehistoric mummified alpine " Iceman " found at Niederjoch Glacier , and similarly well - preserved wood from glaciers and snowfields in Scandinavia .
The radiocarbon dates seem to be the same around the world , according to Koch .
It 's important to note that there have been many advances and retreats of these glaciers over the past 7000 years , but no retreats that have pushed them back so far upstream as to expose these trees .
The age of the tree stumps gives new emphasis to the well - documented " before " and " after " photographs of retreating glaciers during the 20th century .
" It seems like an unprecedented change in a short amount of time , " Koch said .
" From this work and many other studies looking at forcings of the climate system , one has to turn away from natural ones alone to explain this dramatic change of the past 150 years . "

The dark side of space disaster theories Space disasters attract so much public attention and often involve such complex and subtle sequences of events that there ’s an entire Internet literature of “ crackpot causes ” on par with JFK assassination myths .
To the degree that innovative analysis is often critical to reconstructing — from partial and often garbled evidence — a shocking causal sequence leading from goodness to disaster , the initial investigation period demands that critical judgment be held somewhat in check so as not to discourage imagination .
However , once a logical reconstruction gels , is tested , and then is ultimately verified by being implemented and hence reducing future flight hazards , that official explanation achieves a substantial level of authenticity .
But not to everyone ’s satisfaction , apparently , as a search of still - thriving non-traditional explanations of the Apollo 1 fire , the Apollo 13 breakdown , the Challenger disintegration , and the Columbia catastrophe , whose fifth anniversary now approaches .
For example , in the case of Columbia , YouTube is full of videos from self - styled experts still convinced a freak bolt of ionospheric lightning crippled the spaceship .
A famous photograph supposedly shows that bolt , even though space experts have long been satisfied that the bizarre image was merely the result of camera jiggle during a time - lapse exposure .
Apart from the comic relief value of such crackpot ideas , there ’s a darker aspect of this kind of cultural pathology , just as there are serious analyses pointing to the socially toxic effects of the JFK assassination “ alternate theories ” .
For spaceflight , being distracted by the wrong cause means being tempted by the wrong fix .
That ’s never amusing , and often can be expensive .
For spaceflight , being distracted by the wrong cause means being tempted by the wrong fix .
That ’s never amusing , and often can be expensive .
As an egregious “ bad example ” of wrong causes , a recent book ( Dark Mission , by Richard Hoagland and Michael Bara ) spent a lot of time muddying the waters over a series of NASA Mars mission failures in the 1990s .
This is n’t just some remote corner of an intellectual ghetto on the Internet — the book came within one tick mark of making it onto the New York Times bestsellers list for paperback non-fiction ( it reached # 21 nationwide ) .
So as an exercise in cultural self - defense and in proselytizing sound “ space safety ” history , here is a detailed look at the claims , the delusions , and the errors in that book ’s treatment of these space accidents .
Mars Observer ( 1993 ) Dark Mission portrays the failure of the Mars Observer probe in 1993 as a deliberate act by NASA to prevent the publication of its expected photographs of artificial Martian ruins .
But the description of the events is inconsistent with well - documented accounts , reports non-existent events , and omits well - known explanations for important features of the probe ’s flight plan .
All of this can be easily confirmed through Internet searches .
Dark Mission , pp. 87–88 : “ NASA , in another unprecedented move , had inexplicably ordered Mars Observer to shut off its primary data stream prior to executing a key pre-orbital burn …
Because NASA had violated the first rule of space travel — you never turn off the radio — no cause for the probe ’s loss was ever satisfactorily determined . ”
Actually , whether a radio is turned on or off , practically all orbital insertion burns on lunar and planetary missions occur out of radio contact .
This is a result of the geometric alignment of the probe passing behind the planet ( or moon ) and hence having its radio signals blocked .
So keeping a probe ’s radio turned on during these periods is about as useless as installing windshield wipers .
To my knowledge , there is no “ first rule of spaceflight ” about never turning radios off .
Interplanetary probes do this all the time .
The “ rule ” is imaginary .
I ca n’t find any documentation anywhere that provides this “ rule ” .
I suspect that the Dark Mission authors just imagined it .
The maneuver that Mars Observer was to perform was not even , as Dark Mission claims , a “ key pre-orbital burn ” .
It was not a burn of any kind .
Instead , it was the firing of explosive bolts to open two pressurant tanks that would allow the fuel to be pushed into the probe ’s engines several days later .
There is nothing “ inexplicable ” about turning off the radio for the firing of the pyrotechnic bolts .
The sharp shock of the detonations was thought to be a hazard to the hot filament in a key radio component , which is much less brittle when cold .
Hot filaments can shatter under shocks that cold ones would n’t even notice .
This is clearly explained in on - ine documents , including the accident report .
You only have to search “ Mars Observer accident report ” to be led right to the 313 - page “ Failure Investigation Board Report ” .
Keeping a probe ’s radio turned on during orbit insertion burns is about as useless as installing windshield wipers .
Why was the radio turned off ?
“ In accordance with the mission ’s published flight rules , the transmitter on the spacecraft had been turned off during the propellant - tank Pressurization Sequence on 21 August …
To protect the spacecraft radio frequency transmitter from damage during the Pressurization Sequence ( albeit a very low probability ) , the software included a command to turn off the Mars Observer transponder and radio frequency ( RF ) telemetry power amplifier for a period of ten minutes .
This was a standard procedure that had been implemented several times earlier during the mission . ”
The report gave further details : “ This sequence included the firing of two normally - closed pyrotechnic valves , that would allow high - pressure gaseous helium to pressurize the nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer tank and the monomethyl hydrazine fuel tank . ”
More on p. 25 of the report : “ Concern existed in the Mars Observer project team that the pyro- firing event might damage the traveling wave tube amplifiers in the spacecraft telecommunications system if the amplifiers were left on . ”
Nor is it true that “ no cause for the probe ’s loss was ever satisfactorily determined ” , as Dark Mission claims .
To the contrary , in hindsight it was excruciatingly clear what almost certainly happened .
“ The Board was unable to find clear and conclusive evidence pointing to a particular scenario as the ‘ smoking gun ’ , ” the report explained , but “ the Board concluded through a process of elimination that the most probable cause of the loss of downlink from the Mars Observer was a massive failure of the pressurization side of the propulsion system .
The Board also concluded that the most probable cause of that failure was the unintended mixing of nitrogen tetroxide ( NTO ) and monomethyl hydrazine ( MMH ) in the titanium tubing on the pressurization side of the propulsion system .
This mixing was believed by the Board to have been enabled by significant NTO migration through check valves during the eleven - month cruise phase from Earth to Mars .
This conclusion is supported ( but not proven ) by NTO transport - rate data acquired by JPL , by NTO / MMH reaction simulations performed by [ the Naval Research Laboratory ] , and by NTO / MMH mixing tests performed by AFPL [ Air Force Propulsion Labs ] . ”
As to why the propulsions system hardware , adapted from a military prop module that normally needed a lifetime of only 12 hours , was used for a year - long mission , the report added that “ Too much reliance was placed on the heritage of spacecraft hardware , software , and procedures , especially since the Mars Observer mission was fundamentally different from the missions of the satellites from which the heritage was derived . ”
It specifically criticized the propulsion system for “ Inappropriate isolation mechanisms between fuel and oxidizer for an interplanetary mission . ”
“ The original [ money - saving ] philosophy of minor modifications to a commercial production - line spacecraft was retained throughout the program , ” the report continued .
“ The result was reliance on design and component heritage qualification that was inappropriate for the mission .
Examples of this reliance were the failure to qualify the traveling wave tube amplifiers for pyro firing shock [ and ] the design of the propulsion system . ”
Whether or not this particular proposed failure mode is plausible ( and from my own research I ’ve concluded it was very plausible ) , it remains untrue to state ( as Dark Mission does ) that turning off the radio was “ inexplicable ” ( and a violation of a “ rule number one ” ) and that no satisfactory explanation for the failure was ever determined .
Leaving out these easily - available views resulted in a passage that I think was incomplete and misleading .
Mars Polar Lander ( 1999 ) I noted several Dark Mission references to me personally that deal with the 1999 failure of the Mars Polar Lander ( MPL ) probe .
On page 316 : “ James Oberg published a story on UPI that accused JPL employees of knowing full well that the MPL was doomed ( due to software problems related to the spacecraft ’s landing legs ) from very early on in the mission . ”
On page 317 this is called a “ bizarre UPI accusation ” .
The brief account of the UPI article is garbled almost beyond recognition , casting serious doubts on the reading comprehension level of the author who did this section .
In the one - sentence summary ( “ James Oberg published a story on UPI that accused JPL employees of knowing full well that the MPL was doomed due to software problems related to the spacecraft ’s landing legs from very early on in the mission ” ) , practically every word is wrong .
Alleged foreknowledge of the impending failure had nothing to do with software .
The article stated :
As explained privately to UPI , the Mars Polar Lander vehicle ’s braking thrusters had failed acceptance testing during its construction .
But rather than begin an expensive and time - consuming redesign , an unnamed space official simply altered the conditions of the testing until the engine passed .
“ They tested the [ engine ] ignition process at a temperature much higher than it would be in flight , ” UPI ’s source said .
This was done because when the [ engines ] were first tested at the low temperatures predicted after the long cruise from Earth to Mars , the ignition failed or was too unstable to be controlled .
So the test conditions were changed in order to certify the engine performance .
But the conditions then no longer represented those most likely to occur on the real space flight .
“ I ’m as certain as I can be that the thing blew up , ” the source concluded .
That potential failure mode was not known “ from very early on in the mission ” , but only at the very end : “ Following the September loss of the first spacecraft due to management errors , NASA had initiated a crash review of the Mars Polar Lander to identify any similar oversights .
According to UPI ’s source , the flaws in the [ engine ] testing were uncovered only a few days before the landing was to occur on December 3 .
By then it was too late to do anything about it . ”
The brief account of the UPI article is garbled almost beyond recognition , casting serious doubts on the reading comprehension level of the author who did this section .
The specific software problem with the landing leg sensor scenario was not known before the landing at all , and the UPI article clearly states that it was discovered after the crash : “ The Mars Polar Lander investigation team has also reportedly identified a second fatal design flaw that would have doomed the probe even if the engines had functioned properly .
Post - accident tests have shown that when the legs are initially unfolded during the final descent , springs push them so hard that they ‘ bounce ’ and trigger the microswitches by accident .
As a result , the computer receives what it believes are indications of a successful touchdown , and it shuts off the engines .
Ground testing prior to launch apparently never detected this because each of the tests was performed in isolation from other tests .
One team verified that the legs unfolded properly .
Another team verified that the microswitches functioned on landing . ”
In a simple reading comprehension verification test , this one incident indicates a severe problem with the book ’s authors ’ ability to understand , and restate , simple English about space technology .
In one sentence , there were three swings , and three misses — three strikes .
By the way , after NASA ’s official denunciations of the UPI story I had written ( I have the honor of being the only journalist ever denounced by name in an official NASA press release ) , the story turned out even worse than I had written .
Space engineers had n’t fudged the test results , after all .
My source was wrong about this , this time , the first occasion in a long sequence of accurate leaks .
What was far worse was that NASA had decided that any such tests were n’t even necessary .
The engine ignition system was never tested at temperatures expected out at Mars , because ( JPL said ) the engine had already flown in space on some other mission and so did n’t need to be requalified .
But NASA press officials , despite repeated inquiries from me and promises of cooperation from them , never disclosed the space mission (s ) that these special engines had been originally flown on .
The same design engines are installed aboard the Mars Phoenix lander now on route .
Hopefully , improvements have been made .

All 38 contenders for the GOP 's presidential nomination squared off at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley , California last night .
The choice of venue was hardly a random one .
" We want the reactionary white voter who still thinks President Reagan saved the world from commies and Negroes to know that we are ' right ' there with him , " said Republican consultant Ted Reavis .
" And I think that after tonight 's debate , the reactionary white voter will be pleased .
" Each candidate fought bitterly to claim Reagan 's legacy as his own .
John McCain was perhaps the most insistent , not only claiming to be one of Reagan 's closet friends when the president was alive , but saying that Reagan 's ghost regularly visits him for casual games of checkers , and has posthumously endorsed McCain as his political heir .
Mitt Romney tried to upstage McCain by donning a plastic Reagan mask and repeatedly saying , " Mr. McCain -- tear down that gall !
" But the true highlight of the evening came when Reagan 's casket was wheeled out on stage and opened in front of the candidates .
The stench made many in the library sick , but candidate after candidate took turns kissing what 's left of Reagan 's body , with John McCain attempting to crawl into the casket with the late president .
Moderator Chris Matthews informed McCain that he was deviating from the scripted format , and awarded some of McCain 's speaking time to GOP longshot Ron Paul , who used it to denounce the IRS , advocate the gold standard , and propose that Americans trash their debit cards in favor of a barter system using animals , fuel , and ammunition .
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani stood out by wearing the still - dirty suit he had on during 9/11 , and warned the audience that if he is not elected president , the terrorists will see it as a sign of weakness and decadence , and will set - off nuclear weapons in 15 major American cities .
When Chris Matthews asked Giuliani how he knew such horrible events would happen , Giuliani replied , " I 'm a time - traveler , Chris .
I 've already seen the future where I 'm at best Secretary of the Interior , and it 's not pretty .
" Amid all the serious talk and posturing , a humorous moment arose when an unidentified man stood at an empty podium , and for a brief time was considered one of the candidates .
When asked how he would win the war in Iraq , the man replied , " I just came up here to find my wife .
Oh , there she is !
Hi honey !
I 'll be right down ! "
One of the most perplexing and vexing of mild human afflictions is the hiccup , or as it is medically known , the singultus .
Through the years , many ( ineffective ) remedies have been suggested , from holding your breath to scaring yourself .
But a larger question remained unresolved : why do humans have these involuntary spasms of the diaphragm , which produce uncontrollable funny noises at irregular and inconvenient times ?
Now , University of Chicago anatomist , Neil Shubin , has provided the world with an explanation in his book Your Inner Fish .
As described in the Guardian :
Hiccups are triggered by electric signals generated in the brain stem .
Amphibian brain stems emit similar signals , which control the regular motion of their gills .
Our brain stems , inherited from amphibian ancestors , still spurt out odd signals producing hiccups that are , according to Shubin , essentially the same phenomenon as gill breathing .
This is atavism , or evolutionary throwback activity , at work .
Luckily , you do eventually stop trying to breathe through your gills when it dawns on your brain that you are actually a modern human , not a prehistoric fish .
So perhaps the next time you are hit with a serious bout of the hiccups , instead of drinking a shot of vinegar , concentrate on your humanity .
Just read some Descartes , or Harold Bloom 's Shakespeare opus , The Invention of the Human , and you 'll be breathing like a person in no time .

The half - point cut Wednesday followed news that the the U.S. economy grew a weaker than expected 0.6 % in the fourth quarter , less than half what had been expected .
The report came amid increased concern from several quarters about a possible recession .
In a brief statement explaining their decision , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues said that " financial markets remain under considerable stress . "
The Fed move was approved on a 9 to 1 vote .
Richard Fisher , president of the Fed 's Dallas regional bank , dissented , preferring no change in rates .
The rate cut marked the fifth time that the Fed has cut the funds rate since it started with a half - point cut on Sept. 18 in response to the severe credit crisis which hit global markets in August .
The latest Fed action was expected to be quickly followed by cuts in banks ' prime lending rate , the benchmark rate for millions of consumer and business loans .
The Fed 's hope is that by making credit cheaper , it will encourage more borrowing , giving the economy a needed boost .
The Fed 's half - point move met expectations of financial markets and was a bolder move than the smaller quarter - point cut that many economists had been expecting .
In CNBC ’s latest “ Trillion Dollar Snap Survey ” , roughly four out of five respondents said the Fed made the right decision , but only 4 percent would grade Bernanke ’s overall performance an “ A ” .
( See full results )
Despite all the recession fears , the economic news lately has been more mixed .
A report Wednesday by ADP Employer Services showed private - sector employers added 130,000 jobs in January , about double what economists expected .
The official Labor Department report on January employment is scheduled for release on Friday .
A report Tuesday showed much stronger - than - expected demand for long - lasting U.S. - made goods in December , while weekly reports have shown initial claims for jobless benefits
declining .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon plans to shoot down a disabled U.S. spy satellite before it enters the atmosphere to prevent a potentially deadly leak of toxic gas from the vehicle ’s fuel tank , officials said on Thursday .
President George W. Bush decided to have the Navy shoot the 5,000 - pound ( 2,270 kg ) minivan - sized satellite with a modified tactical missile , after security advisers suggested its reentry could lead to a loss of life .
U.S. officials said they were not trying to protect classified information on the satellite or to demonstrate their capabilities to China , which downed one of its own satellites with a missile last year , drawing criticism from Washington .
But some experts disagreed and questioned the risks associated with shooting down the satellite .
Two defense officials also cited disagreement within the administration over the action and said the decision appears to have been strongly influenced by the White House .
The Pentagon hopes to strike the satellite just before it reaches the atmosphere and drive it into ocean waters .
Officials would not estimate the likelihood of success , only calling it high .
Thousands of space objects fall to Earth each year , but they generally scatter over a huge area and there have never been any reported injuries .
What makes this different is the likelihood that the satellite could release much of the more than 1,000 pounds ( 454 kg ) of hydrazine fuel as a toxic gas , according to James Jeffries , deputy national security adviser .
He said the satellite was unlikely to hit a populated area and described the danger from toxic gas as limited .
But Jeffries added : “ There was enough of a risk for the president to be quite concerned about human life . ”

SIGNAL TO CHINA ?
Jeffries and other U.S. officials rejected suggestions that Bush opted to shoot down the satellite out of concern that classified material on board could survive reentry into Earth ’s atmosphere , and potentially land in the wrong hands .
They also said Washington was not shooting the satellite down in response to China ’s anti-satellite test last year , noting the United States had already demonstrated its capability to hit a space object with a missile in the 1980s .
China did not notify other countries before its test , marking a significant departure from U.S. efforts this week .
But some experts questioned Bush ’s decision and the calculation of the risks associated with shooting the missile down compared with allowing it to burn up upon re-entry .
Jonathan McDowell , astronomer with the Harvard - Smithsonian Center For Astrophysics , called the decision “ regrettable . ”
“ Clearly someone in the administration who has the instincts of a cowboy has decided this is the perfect excuse to rattle our sabers and show the Chinese that we have the same capabilities , ” he said .
SATELLITE NEVER WORKED
The satellite is a classified National Reconnaissance Office spacecraft launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in 2006 , according to four senior U.S. officials , who asked not to be named .
Defense officials said the satellite , known as L - 21 , was built by Lockheed Martin Corp .
It cost hundreds of millions of dollars but the U.S. government will not say precisely how much , calling the figure classified .
Boeing
Co played a role early in the project , but was relieved by Lockheed .
The satellite has been out of touch since shortly after reaching its low - Earth orbit .
Since the satellite never became operational , it has toxic rocket fuel on board that would have been used to maneuver the satellite in space .
Officials said that without the shootdown , about half the satellite , including the fuel tank , would survive reentry into Earth ’s atmosphere and estimated a crash could spread toxic material across an area equal to two football fields .
“ The tank will survive .
It will be breached .
The hydrazine will reach the ground and that ’s not an outcome we want to see , ” NASA administrator Michael Griffin said at the briefing .
The Pentagon has a window of about seven to eight days to fire the missile .
That window opens in about three to four days , the officials said .

TORONTO ( AP )  Canada will extend its military mission in Afghanistan only if another NATO country puts more soldiers in the dangerous south , the prime minister said Monday , echoing the recommendation of an independent panel to withdraw without additional forces .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Conservative government is under pressure to withdraw its 2,500 troops from Kandahar province , the former Taliban stronghold , after the deaths of 78 soldiers and a diplomat .
The mission is set to expire in 2009 without an extension by Canadian lawmakers .
The panel , led by John Manley , a former Liberal deputy prime minister and foreign minister , recommended last week that Canada continue its mission only if another NATO country musters 1,000 troops for Kandahar .
European allies ' refusal to deploy to Afghanistan 's dangerous south and east has opened a rift with Britain , Canada , the Netherlands and others which , along with the United States , have borne the brunt of Taliban violence .
The U.S. contributes one - third of NATO 's 42,000 - strong International Security Assistance Force mission , making it the largest participant , on top of the 12,000 to 13,000 American troops operating independently .
NATO spokesman James Appathurai said the alliance had no immediate reaction to the comments from Harper , who said he would begin negotiating with allies prior to the next meeting of NATO leaders in early April .
" NATO 's reputation is on the line here , " Harper said .
" NATO 's efforts in Afghanistan as a whole are not adequate , but particularly in Kandahar province ...
It is the focal point of the insurgency and of the Taliban 's longer term plans to return to power . "
Harper said Canada has done more than its fair share and needs help .
" If NATO can't come through with that help than I think frankly that NATO 's own reputation and future will be in grave jeopardy , " Harper said .
Harper said he also agreed with the panel 's recommendation that the defense department speed the purchase of helicopters and surveillance aircraft .
" Both of those recommendations will have to be fulfilled or Canada will not proceed with the mission in Afghanistan , " he said .
Opposition parties have threatened to bring down Harper 's minority government if he does not end the increasingly unpopular combat mission .
" It looks like a design for a never - ending mission , " Liberal leader Stephane Dion said .
" This we are completely against .
We think it 's a mistake for Canada , for NATO and for Afghanistan .
A timeline is necessary because it gives the incentive for everyone to come with targets . "
Harper has promised to consult with Dion and to put the future of the mission to a vote in Parliament , where the opposition parties hold the majority of seats .
Harper declined to detail how Canadian soldiers have been handling detainees in Afghanistan since November , when they stopped transferring prisoners to local authorities after a prison visit showed evidence of torture .
The government only announced the change last week .
" We are not going to publicly discuss how many Afghan prisoners we have — and where they are , " Harper said .

Making a slow program fast can lead to both joy and frustration .
Frequently , the best you can do is a low - level trick to double or maybe quadruple the speed of a program ; for instance , many readers may have implemented John Conway 's " Game of Life " using bit - level operations for a significant speedup .
But sometimes a whole new approach , combining just a few ideas , yields amazing improvements .
A simple algorithm called " HashLife , " invented by William Gosper ( " Exploiting Regularities in Large Cellular Spaces , " Physica 10D , 1984 ) , combines quadtrees and memoization to yield astronomical speedup to the Game of Life .
In this article , I evolve the simplest Life implementation into this algorithm , explain how it works , and run some universes for trillions of generations as they grow to billions of cells .
Martin Gardner 's columns on Conway 's Game of Life , published in Scientific American from October 1970 onwards , inspired a whole generation of programmers ; an amazing world of two - dimensional lifeforms springs from just a few simple rules that are easy to program and display .
The Game of Life ( Figure 1 ) is a solitaire game played on an infinite two - dimensional grid .
Each cell in the grid is either alive ( 1 , denoted by a black circle ) or dead .
Every living cell that has two or three living neighbors ( of the eight immediately adjacent ) remains alive , otherwise it dies .
Any dead cell surrounded by exactly three living neighbors is a birth cell and is born into the next generation .
All the rules are applied to all the cells at the same instant .
These rules lead to life forms that are stable and oscillategliders and spaceships that transport themselves across the universe , life forms that grow without bound or completely die away .
Seed patterns with as few as nine initial living cells can mutate for many thousands of generations , with constantly moving areas of chaotic activity spewing forth gliders among a large stable menagerie .
Figure 1 : Some Life examples .
On the left is a stable loaf pattern .
In the upper left are the two phases of the blinker , an oscillator with period 2 .
In a diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right are the four phases a glider goes through as it traverses the universe .
The simplest implementations of Life use a pair of two - dimensional arrays representing the state of a finite portion of the universe .
In every generation , the neighbors of a cell in the old array are counted to calculate the state of that cell in the new array , then the arrays are swapped and the screen is updated .
This approach has a number of frustrating aspects :
The larger the universe , the slower the program runs ; yet , a smaller universe bounds the growth of patterns , constraining them artificially .
My first improvement to the basic algorithm is to replace this finite universe with an unbounded one ; at any given time it is finite , but you can increase its size as necessary .
I use a simple tree representation , called a " quadtree " ( Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 : A quadtree representation of a 4×4 cell containing a Loaf .
Each node of the tree represents a square portion of the universe .
The leaves of the tree are single bits , either 1 ( alive ) or 0 ( dead ) .
Each nonleaf node represents a larger square composed of four children , who are named by their direction from center : nw is the name of the northwest smaller square , ne the northeast smaller square , and so on .
The level of a node is the distance to the leaves ; the leaves are at level 0 .
A node at level n thus represents a square of size 2n on each edge .
The straightforward way to implement the Life algorithm is to write a recursive function that takes a tree at a given level and either updates the tree in place or returns an entirely new tree .
I choose to return an entirely new tree .
If I could return a tree at the same level , the algorithm would be very simple .
Unfortunately , this is not possible without some additional information because the neighbors of that node also influence the calculation of the next generation for the border cells .
One approach to solve this would be to pass in the neighbor nodes at the same level ; another is to maintain neighbor node pointers .
Instead , I choose a simpler approach :
The result of the recursive function is a node one level down and centered with respect to the original node .
For instance , the function takes a node at level 2 , representing a 4×4 square of the universe , and return a node at level 1 , representing the 2×2 square you can directly compute from the information in that 4×4 square .
Similarly , it takes a node at level 5 , representing a 32×32 square of the universe , and return a square at level 4 , representing the central 16 × 16 pixels that are one generation advanced .
This decision lets you use a completely functional approach on an immutable data structure , assuming you enjoy such things .
Most recursive algorithms working on trees simply recurse on the children and somehow combine the result .
If I do that here , using code like Listing One , there will be gaps between the squares calculated , as in Figure 3 .
Something more complicated is called for .
I cannot use the existing children directly in the recursive call ; instead , I must create temporary children that are shifted in place , to make sure I get a result square aligned the way we require .
Listing One
class Node { Node nextGeneration ( ) { if ( level == 2 ) { ... do base case through normal simulation ... } else { return new Node(nw.nextGeneration ( ) , ne.nextGeneration ( ) , sw.nextGeneration ( ) , se.nextGeneration ( ) ) ; } } }
Figure 3 : Why a simple recursive algorithm will not work .
The black outer square represents the area of a node ; the four red inner squares are the subnodes .
I want to calculate the area of the blue inner square in the next generation , but the inner squares of the subnodes are the green squares , which cannot be combined to form the blue inner square because they do not overlap it .
I construct nine new nodes two levels down that are shifted appropriately .
To construct these nodes two levels down , I actually access nodes that are three levels down to compose the new ones .
From these nine new nodes , I create four new nodes that are one level down .
It is these four new nodes that I recurse on .
This gives me result nodes at the appropriate locations so I can combine them into the required output node at the right level ( see Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 : A solution to the gap problem : Construct new subnodes from the components of the existing node to calculate the squares we actually need .
Again , blue is the area I wish to calculate ; I split it into four green nodes .
I compute these four blue nodes by building subnodes out of various combinations of the nine red subnodes that can be constructed from subnodes of the original node .
I do make a few minor concessions to practicality in Listing Two .
Any tree that I know is completely empty , I construct by sharing nodes ; see Figure 4 .
When I calculate the next generation of any node , I first check to see if it is empty and immediately return an empty subtree if so .
Listing Two
Node centeredSubnode ( ) { return new Node ( nw.se , ne.sw , sw.ne , se.nw ) ; } Node centeredHorizontal ( Node w , Node e ) { return new Node( w.ne.se , e.nw.sw , w.se.ne , e.sw.nw ) ; } Node centeredVertical ( Node n , Node s ) { return new Node( n.sw.se , n.se.sw , s.nw.ne , s.ne.nw ) ; } Node centeredSubSubnode ( ) { return new Node( nw.se.se , ne.sw.sw , sw.ne.ne , se.nw.nw ) ; } Node nextGeneration ( ) { if ( level == 2 ) { ... do base case through normal simulation ... } else { Node n00 = nw.centeredSubnode( ) , n01 = centeredHorizontal ( nw , ne ) , n02 = ne.centeredSubnode ( ) , n 10 = centeredVertical ( nw , sw ) , n 11 = centeredSubSubnode ( ) , n 12 = centeredVertical ( ne , se ) , n 20 = sw.centeredSubnode ( ) , n 21 = centeredHorizontal ( sw , se ) , n 22 = se.centeredSubnode ( ) ; return new Node ( new Node( n00 , n01 , n10 , n11).nextGeneration ( ) , new Node( n01 , n02 , n11 , n12).nextGeneration ( ) , new Node( n10 , n11 , n20 , n21).nextGeneration ( ) , new Node( n11 , n12 , n21 , n22).nextGeneration ( ) ) ; } }
So far , my algorithm is not any better .
It takes more memory and is slower .
It generates a lot of new nodes that need to be managed or garbage collected .
It has a somewhat complicated recursion .
I fix all of these issues in two steps canonicalization of the nodes , and " memoization . "
The quadtree data structure ( see Figure 5 ) takes significantly more space than a simple bitmap ( although only by a constant factor ) ; for a tree representing a 256×256 universe , the number of 0 leaves plus the number of 1 leaves is 65,536 , and there are 16,384 + 4096+1024+256+64+16+4+1 or 21,845 nonleaf nodes .
Each node represents a constant , immutable bitmap , so there is no need to have distinct nodes that share the same value .
All of the 1 leaves can be represented by a single canonical 1 leaf ; similarly , all nodes whose northwest quadrant is a 1 leaf and whose other three quadrants are 0 leaves can be represented by a single canonical instance of this node .
This canonicalization takes place all the way to the root .
Canonicalizing the nodes requires a simple hash set with the usual recurrence on trees ; once the nodes are canonicalized , the value of a node is completely represented ( including for comparison ) by the pointer to that node , so the hash function of a node can be as simple as some mixing of the addresses of the four subnodes .
This canonicalization step is similar to what the Java String intern function does and represents one advantage of immutable structures .
Figure 5 : Another Methuselah .
By itself , this canonicalization step is a powerful form of compression of space .
All empty areas of the universe compress into a single small set of nodes .
Common life forms , such as gliders and blocks , squeeze into commonly shared nodes .
Indeed , for some life forms being constructed now , a serialized form of this quadtree provides the only reasonable storage format , as the forms are simply too large to be distributed in the run-length - encoded format in common use .
Further , the hash set providing the canonicalization can be trivially garbage collected , even in languages like C++ , when desired ( assuming the hash set stores pointers ) ; simply create a new empty hash set , swap it with the current canonicalized hash set , recanonicalize from the current root , then delete all nodes that are in the old hash set but not the new one .
With minor variations , what 's happening now in America has happened all over the planet from the beginning of record history .
The one percent of less of " Haves " control EVERYTHING – especially politics and religion .
So , we should n't be surprised that the United States of America is a Dictatorship of the Rich .
We also should n't be surprised that the elites are rapidly evolving America into a textbook police state .
After all , we really have n't been around that long , so regressing our Constitutional Republic ( what a laugh ! ) into a Nazi - like dictatorship in 300ish years is actually a real accomplishment .
Our pitiful little democratic dance is now basically over , so get ready for ZERO privacy , ZERO human rights , and ZERO democracy .
Hitler bragged about what he called the thousand year Reich and it looks like he may bring it off after all .
It 's just that we did n't expect him to resurrect in America .
But the names are irrelevant .
Call it fascism , neo Nazism , corporate totalitarianism , or your hell - word of choice , but it all comes down to something see spot run simple .
Religion is n't the issue ; in spite of brain dead Armageddon fanatics who lie awake a night having sexual fantasies about killing Muslims .
And politics is such a joke it does n't even deserve to be mentioned .
Take Hillary Clinton ( if anyone wants her ) .
Just who / what is this person / thing ?
She 's a kind of doll constructed by James Carville and the DLC to be the token Democrat .
Dear God , she 's more of a corporate fascist that most Republicans and constantly sucks up the neocon cabal ( Bush 's advisors who get their orders directly from Israel ’s lunatic fringe right wing ) , and apparently has never once in her entire life taken a moral / rational stand about ANYTHING .
And we 're supposed to vote for this android .
In your dreams .
So , the bulls eye , the dead center of the Earth 's Heart of Darkness is what ?
What else ?
It 's rich people -- very , VERY rich people .
People who spend more on their health in an afternoon than most of us spend on our children 's health in a life time .
People who have SEVERAL mansions .
People who have so many cars many of them are n’t even driven .
People whose designer clothes cost more than everyone in your extended family makes in a year .
FOR the eighth straight year the Bush administration has ritually proposed taking a hefty whack out of the federal subsidy for public broadcasting .
The cuts would in effect slice in half the money that public television and public radio get from the government .
If we follow the usual script , this means it ’s time for upset listeners and viewers to rally to the cause , as they have in the past , and browbeat Congress into restoring the budget .
Every year , though , it gets a little harder to muster the necessary outrage , and now and then a heretical thought presents itself :
What if the glory days of public television  the days of “ Monty Python , ” “ Upstairs Downstairs , ” “ The French Chef ”  are past recapturing ?
Lately the audience for public TV has been shrinking even faster than the audience for the commercial networks .
The average PBS show on prime time now scores about a 1.4 Nielsen rating , or a little over half of what the wrestling show “ Friday Night Smackdown ” gets .
On the other side of the ledger the audience for public radio has been growing : there are more than 30 million listeners now , compared to just 2 million in 1980 .
“ Morning Edition ” and “ All Things Considered , ” NPR ’s morning and evening news programs , are the second and fourth most listened to shows in the country .
Go figure .
Who would have guessed 40 years ago , when public broadcasting came into being , that the antique medium , the one supposedly on its way out , would prove to be the greater success and the one more technically nimble .
You can even download NPR broadcasts onto your iPod .
Radio benefits of course from being a smaller target , and from attracting fewer political enemies .
In public television especially it used to be axiomatic that attacks on the budget were retaliation for perceived liberal bias .
Newt Gingrich was quite upfront about punishing PBS when he began his budgetary onslaught back in 1995 .
By now , though , that war ought to be over .
These days the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is run by Republicans , and a few years ago , Kenneth Y. Tomlinson , who was chairman of its board , was n’t the least bit shy about trying to arm - wrestle stations into running a program whose host was Paul Gigot , editor of The Wall Street Journal editorial page .
Unless you count occasional outbursts of hand - wringing earnestness on the part of Bill Moyers or David Brancaccio on “ Now , ” it ’s hard now to see anything resembling liberal excess on PBS , if there ever was such a thing .

Los Alamos , New Mexico --
With the Bush administration and Congress fighting over how to rebuild the nuclear weapons complex , one of the country 's top weapons designers said he believes it is time for the United States to consider a radical shift in policy that would ultimately eliminate the nuclear arsenal .
Joseph Martz , leader of a team designing a new generation of warheads at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , said in a series of interviews last week that he is troubled by how the debate on nuclear weapons policy in Washington is focused narrowly on the number of weapons needed for the future , and how they would be built , rather than on how to eradicate them entirely .
Lab officials originally refused to give Martz permission to be interviewed for this article .
Martz , however , said he decided to speak anyway in order to press ideas that he believes can reduce the risk of nuclear war and carve out a central role for the weapons labs , which have been threatened with budget cuts .
Martz emphasized that he was expressing only his personal views and not those of the lab .
But his comments still represent the first time in recent years that a senior scientist inside the weapons program has proposed making disarmament a concrete policy goal .
Martz said the discussion in Washington needs to reflect technological breakthroughs found in two prime areas : the weapons maintenance program , known as stockpile stewardship , and the new weapon design initiative called the Reliable Replacement Warhead , or RRW .
Martz 's aim is to help policymakers understand that , because of a more sophisticated grasp of weapons science , the United States can slowly dismantle its warheads and still protect itself .
The country could also bolster its credibility as a leading voice for disarmament by ratifying the long - stalled treaty banning underground testing .
" The time is right , " Martz said .
" A confluence of events has now allowed the debate to progress , including the changes in Congress , the maturation of the stockpile stewardship program and the recognition by the military that RRW is feasible .
A few years ago , we did n't have that . "
The key to the new policy , he said , would be slowly reducing the number of warheads over a period of years , and during that time replacing older weapons with the new Reliable Replacement Warhead weapons as an interim phase .
But the final goal , according to Martz , should be the elimination of the entire arsenal .
What the United States would retain in its place , he argued , would be the technology to assemble warheads from stockpiled materials if a grave threat to national security arose .
The labs now have the capability to do that in a relatively short period of time , he said , without the need for testing .
The U.S. nuclear deterrent would be transformed from thousands of weapons deployed on high alert to what has come to be known as the " virtual stockpile . "
Martz , 41 , described this view as part of the evolution in the thinking of a younger generation of weapons designers eager to rely more on science than missiles to deter foes .
" You understand what I 'm offering here , " he said .
" I 'm offering through our technological achievements the security we need to enter into a real discussion " of nuclear disarmament .
Martz believes the U.S. nuclear arsenal has been critical to the country 's security and should be maintained for some years .
But the nuclear policy debate , he said , has focused too much on producing new bombs and not enough on the next steps needed for broader arms control initiatives .
" I 'm trying to offer solutions that say , ' How can we get the benefits of deterrence without having to put thousands of warheads on hair - trigger alert ? ' " he said .
Some of Martz 's ideas have been discussed before , mostly among arms control experts , and there is disagreement over whether the country should deploy new generations of warheads , as Martz is proposing , even as an interim step .
These experts argue that the current stockpile will be safe and reliable for decades , and that building new warheads is too provocative .
But this is the first time a senior official involved in maintaining Cold War-era warheads and designing the weapons of the future has proposed a long - term plan for eliminating them .
Under current policy , officials say the world is too dangerous to consider eliminating the nuclear deterrent -- the U.S. now has more than 5,000 warheads -- which must be updated indefinitely .
Various treaties have reduced the size of the stockpile -- under the Moscow Treaty of 2002 , the United States will decrease its deployed arsenal to 2,200 or fewer weapons by 2012 -- but actual disarmament has never been embraced as a concrete policy objective .
In fact , even opponents of Martz 's plan are pleased with his ideas , if only because it may inspire a debate on disarmament .
" We should be on a glide path to get to lower numbers of weapons , " said Eugene Habiger , a retired air force general and former head of the U.S. Strategic Command , which manages the nuclear arsenal .
" It 's a glide path we 've been on for years , but we need to think about the next step beyond the Moscow Treaty , and nobody is doing that yet . "
Under the Reliable Replacement Warhead program , two design teams , one from Los Alamos and the other from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , submitted plans in April for a new generation of warheads .
They are supposed to be safer and more reliable than the older weapons , but they must be built without underground testing , which has never been done before .
A high - level government body , the Nuclear Weapons Council , is expected to announce shortly which design it has chosen , or whether , as some have suggested , it will propose a hybrid , combining elements of both .
Some experts , however , have been urging a deeper shift .
Two widely - read opinion pieces published in the Wall Street Journal last month argued for total disarmament .
The essays -- the first by former Secretary of State George Shultz , former Defense Secretary William Perry , former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia , and the second by the former Soviet leader , Mikhail Gorbachev -- urged aggressive steps toward this long ignored goal .
" Reassertion of the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and practical measures toward achieving that goal would be , and would be perceived as , a bold initiative consistent with America 's moral heritage , " the former U.S. officials wrote in their essay .
Martz 's ideas get a mixed response from experts .
Supporters of the weapons program maintain that it is naive to even talk about the elimination of the weapons in a dangerous world .
Others argue that manufacturing new Reliable Replacement Warhead warheads is unnecessary under any conditions .
Steve Andreasen , who was involved in nuclear weapons policy in the Reagan , Bush and Clinton administrations , said he supports the concept of some kind of virtual nuclear force and elimination of the weapons , but opposes Martz 's view that Reliable Replacement Warhead warheads ought to be produced and deployed as an interim step .
He said it appears to be a way of maintaining the budgets at the weapons labs at a time when government officials have talked about big cuts , and that the new production could encourage more countries to consider weapons production .
" If someone at the labs is saying producing the RRW is essential for getting to our vision , I would not agree , " said Andreasen .
Others say the issue is not so much numbers of weapons , but how much U.S. military policy relies on them .
Robert Einhorn , a nuclear policy expert from the Clinton administration who favors arms control , said he believes the United States should boost its conventional power to make it more unlikely that it would ever need to use a nuclear bomb .
" We should be putting far more effort into developing more effective conventional weapons , " he said .
" It 's hard to imagine a president using nuclear weapons under almost any circumstance , but no one doubts our willingness to use conventional weapons . "
Martz acknowledged that he is motivated both by a desire to shape what he thinks could be a smarter policy debate and self - interest .
Los Alamos has been bitterly criticized in Washington for a series of security lapses , and some lawmakers have threatened to slash its work and budgets .
The criticism has badly harmed morale at the lab , and Martz believes his ideas would , by enhancing the importance of the science done at the lab , help maintain budgets and job security , and also bolster a view that the labs can help reduce international tensions .
But he also sees in the virtual stockpile a program that would enable a new generation of weapons scientists to solve some of the policy conundrums left from the Cold War .
" In many ways , this answers the key question many people are asking , including people at the labs -- what is the role of the labs today ? "
Martz said .
" To me the answer is simple .
We become the deterrent in the 21st century . "
Livermore appears to have edge in competition to design new warheads
Because of concern over security lapses at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , it appears unlikely that the lab will be declared the winner of a competition to design a new generation of nuclear warheads , according to Joseph Martz , head of the Los Alamos design team .
When Congress voted to authorize development of the new weapon , called the Reliable Replacement Warhead , or RRW , it called for the country 's two weapons labs , Los Alamos and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , to produce separate proposals .
Martz said the labs handed in their designs -- for a warhead to be fitted on submarine - based Trident missiles -- in April .
He called the process revolutionary because the weapons have to be not only safer and more reliable than the current weapons in the stockpile , but the labs had to guarantee they could manufacture and deploy them without any underground testing , an unprecedented requirement .
The Livermore design essentially relied on a weapon developed but never deployed some years ago , which had been thoroughly tested , Martz said .
Los Alamos took more of a chance by designing a warhead that used elements from previously tested designs , but combined them in a way that incorporated new safety features .
Those features , Martz said , were intended to prevent both accidental detonation and unauthorized use .
The Nuclear Weapons Council has been evaluating the two designs and is expected to render a decision soon .
Martz said there are rumors , which he has not confirmed , that the weapons council will order the two labs to combine the best elements of each design , but with Livermore in the lead role .

A young man , a student of journalism , is sentenced to death by an Islamic court for downloading a report from the internet .
The sentence is then upheld by the country 's rulers .
This is Afghanistan – not in Taliban times but six years after " liberation " and under the democratic rule of the West 's ally Hamid Karzai .
The fate of Sayed Pervez Kambaksh has led to domestic and international protests , and deepening concern about erosion of civil liberties in Afghanistan .
He was accused of blasphemy after he downloaded a report from a Farsi website which stated that Muslim fundamentalists who claimed the Koran justified the oppression of women had misrepresented the views of the prophet Mohamed .
Mr Kambaksh , 23 , distributed the tract to fellow students and teachers at Balkh University with the aim , he said , of provoking a debate on the matter .
But a complaint was made against him and he was arrested , tried by religious judges without – say his friends and family – being allowed legal representation and sentenced to death .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Independent is launching a campaign today to secure justice for Mr Kambaksh .
The UN , human rights groups , journalists ' organisations and Western diplomats have urged Mr Karzai 's government to intervene and free him .
But the Afghan Senate passed a motion yesterday confirming the death sentence .
The MP who proposed the ruling condemning Mr Kambaksh was Sibghatullah Mojaddedi , a key ally of Mr Karzai .
The Senate also attacked the international community for putting pressure on the Afghan government and urged Mr Karzai not to be influenced by outside un -Islamic views .
The case of Mr Kambaksh , who also worked a s reporter for the Jahan - i- Naw ( New World ) newspaper , is seen in Afghanistan as yet another chapter in the escalation in the confrontation between Afghanistan and the West .
It comes in the wake of Mr Karzai accusing the British of actually worsening the situation in Helmand province by their actions and his subsequent blocking of the appointment of Lord Ashdown as the UN envoy and expelling a British and an Irish diplomat .
Demonstrations , organised by clerics , against the alleged foreign interference have been held in the northern city of Mazar - i- Sharif , where Mr Kambaksh was arrested .
Aminuddin Muzafari , the first secretary of the houses of parliament , said : " People should realise that as we are representatives of an Islamic country therefore we can never tolerate insults to reverences of Islamic religion . "
At a gathering in Takhar province , Maulavi Ghulam Rabbani Rahmani , the heads of the Ulema council , said : " We want the government and the courts to execute the court verdict on Kambaksh as soon as possible . "
In Parwan province , another senior cleric , Maulavi Muhammad Asif , said : " This decision is for disrespecting the holy Koran and the government should enforce the decision before it came under more pressure from foreigners . "
UK officials say they are particularly concerned about such draconian action being taken against a journalist .
The Foreign Office and Department for International Development has donated large sums to the training of media workers in the country .
The Government funds the Institute for War and Peace Reporting ( IWPR ) in the Helmand capital , Lashkar Gar .

Mr Kambaksh's brother , Sayed Yaqub Ibrahimi , is also a journalist and has written articles for IWPR in which he accused senior public figures , including an MP , of atrocities , including murders .
He said : " Of course we are all very worried about my brother .
What has happened to him is very unjust .
He has not committed blasphemy and he was not even allowed to have a legal defence .
and what took place was a secret trial . "
Qayoum Baabak , the editor of Jahan - i- Naw , said a senior prosecutor in Mazar - i- Sharif , Hafiz Khaliqyar , had warned journalists that they would be punished if they protested against the death sentence passed on Mr Kambaksh .
Jean MacKenzie , country director for IWPR , said : " We feel very strongly that this is designed to put pressure on Pervez 's brother , Yaqub , who has done some of the hardest - hitting pieces outlining abuses by some very powerful commanders . "
Rahimullah Samander , the president of the Afghan Independent Journalists '
Association , said : " This is unfair , this is illegal .
He just printed a copy of something and looked at it and read it .
How can we believe in this ' democracy ' if we can't even read , we can't even study ?
We are asking Mr Karzai to quash the death sentence before it is too late . "
The circumstances surrounding the conviction of Mr Kambaksh are also being viewed as a further attempt to claw back the rights gained by women since the overthrow of the Taliban .
The most prominent female MP , Malalai Joya , has been suspended after criticising her male colleagues .
Under the Afghan constitution , say legal experts , Mr Kambaksh has the right to appeal to the country 's supreme court .
Some senior clerics maintain , however , that since he has been convicted under religious laws , the supreme court should not bring secular interpretations to the case .
Mr Karzai has the right to intervene and pardon Mr Kambaksh .
However , even if he is freed , it would be hard for the student to escape retribution in a country where fundamentalists and warlords are increasingly in the ascendancy .
How you can save Pervez
Sayed Pervez Kambaksh's imminent execution is an affront to civilised values .
It is not , however , a foregone conclusion .
If enough international pressure is brought to bear on President Karzai 's government , his sentence may yet be overturned .
Add your weight to the campaign by urging the Foreign Office to demand that his life be spared .

“ This really is the holy grail of Capa work , ” said Brian Wallis , the center ’s chief curator , who added that besides the Capa negatives , the cracked , dust - covered boxes had also been found to contain Spanish Civil War images by Gerda Taro , Robert Capa ’s partner professionally and at one time personally , and by David Seymour , known as Chim , who went on to found the influential Magnum photo agency with Capa .
The discovery has sent shock waves through the photography world , not least because it is hoped that the negatives could settle once and for all a question that has dogged Capa ’s legacy : whether what may be his most famous picture  and one of the most famous war photographs of all time  was staged .
Known as “ The Falling Soldier , ” it shows a Spanish Republican militiaman reeling backward at what appears to be the instant a bullet strikes his chest or head on a hillside near Córdoba in 1936 .
When the picture was first published in the French magazine Vu , it created a sensation and helped crystallize support for the Republican cause .
Though the Capa biographer Richard Whelan made a persuasive case that the photograph was not faked , doubts have persisted .
In part this is because Capa and Taro made no pretense of journalistic detachment during the war  they were Communist partisans of the loyalist cause  and were known to photograph staged maneuvers , a common practice at the time .
A negative of the shot has never been found ( it has long been reproduced from a vintage print ) , and the discovery of one , especially in the original sequence showing all the images taken before and after the shot , could end the debate .
But the discovery is being hailed as a huge event for more than forensic reasons .
This is the formative work of a photographer who , in a century defined by warfare , played a pivotal role in defining how war was seen , bringing its horrors nearer than ever 
“ If your pictures are n’t good enough , you ’re not close enough ” was his mantra  yet in the process rendering it more cinematic and unreal .
( Capa , not surprisingly , later served a stint in Hollywood , befriending directors like Howard Hawks and romancing Ingrid Bergman . )
Capa practically invented the image of the globe - trotting war photographer , with a cigarette appended to the corner of his mouth and cameras slung over his fatigues .
His fearlessness awed even his soldier subjects , and between battles he hung out with Hemingway and Steinbeck and usually drank too much , seeming to pull everything off with panache .
William Saroyan wrote that he thought of Capa as “ a poker player whose sideline was picture - taking . ”

The company also cut the price of its highest - capacity model by about 17 percent .
The new version of the PS3 will come with a 40 - gigabyte hard drive , cost $ 400 , and go on sale on November 2 , said Jack Tretton , president of Sony Computer Entertainment America .
The price of the 80 - gigabyte version will be cut to $ 500 from $ 600 .
The 40 - gigabyte model has already made its debut in Europe and Japan , and was widely expected to come to the United States ahead of the crucial year - end shopping season that accounts for the largest single chunk of annual video game software and hardware sales .
“ I think the educational curve is starting to be broached with the general consumer , ” Tretton told Reuters in an interview , when asked about his expectations for the PS3 through the end of the year .
Sales of the PS3 , which has a built - in Blu-ray drive for playing high - definition DVDs , have lagged those of Microsoft Corp 's MSFT .
O Xbox 360 , which comes in versions costing from $ 280 to $ 450 , and Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974 .OS
Wii , which costs $ 250 .
Sony had previously offered a 20 - gigabyte model but stopped making it earlier this year and cut the price to clear out inventory after finding most customers were opting for higher - capacity versions .
For the new 40 - gigabyte PS3 , Sony has removed its ability to play games for the predecessor PlayStation 2 , which is still selling strong despite its aging technology .
“ We ’re choosing to focus on the PlayStation 2 consumer with the PlayStation 2 , which remains incredibly relevant , and focus on the PlayStation 3 consumer with the new 40 - gigabyte model and the great software coming out , ” Tretton said .
“ Backward compatibility is a nice secondary consideration , but it ’s far from the number - one priority . ”

Fourth - quarter net income for the second - largest U.S. bank fell to $ 268 million , or 5 cents per share , from $ 5.26 billion , or $ 1.16 , a year earlier .
Analysts ’ average forecast was a profit of 19 cents per share , according to Reuters Estimates .
Bank of America shares fell $ 2.46 , or 6.8 percent , to $ 33.51 in pre-market trading .
“ This is a weak set of results , ( and ) rather disappointing if you look at the core numbers , especially credit quality deterioration , ” wrote Ed Najarian , an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co in New York .
Results reflected $ 5.44 billion of trading losses , compared with a year - earlier profit of $ 460 million .
This reflected a $ 5.28 billion write - down related to collateralized debt obligations , which the bank said reduced trading profit by $ 4.5 billion and other income by about $ 750 million .
Charlotte , North Carolina - based Bank of America also set aside $ 1.74 billion for credit losses , including a $ 1.33 billion addition to reserves .
It also incurred $ 800 million of losses and write - downs to help some money market mutual funds exposed to risky debt maintain the $ 1 per share net asset value that all such funds try to keep .
The bank ’s Tier - 1 capital ratio , a measure of its ability to cover losses , fell to 6.87 percent in the fourth quarter from 8.22 percent in the third quarter .
Regulators say a 6 percent ratio reflects a “ well - capitalized ” bank .
NOT PLEASED
“ We certainly are not pleased with our performance , ” Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said in a statement .
“ We are cautiously optimistic about 2008 , though we believe economic growth will be anemic at best in the first half . ”
Last week , Bank of America set plans to cut 650 jobs in its markets and investment banking unit , including deep cuts in structured products .
The bank said it ended the year with $ 15.65 billion of net exposure to super - senior CDOs , before write - downs .
Analysts have said market conditions may prompt Bank of America to renegotiate its planned $ 4 billion purchase of Countrywide Financial Corp , the largest U.S. mortgage lender .
When the deal was announced on Jan 11 , it valued Countrywide at $ 7.16 per share .
Countrywide shares fell 10.7 percent to $ 4.43 in pre-market trade .
OTHER BANKS
Bank of America joined Citigroup Inc , JPMorgan Chase &
Co and other banks in reporting losses related to leveraged loans , mortgages , consumer credit , or a combination .
Last week , JPMorgan said quarterly profit fell 34 percent to $ 2.97 billion , while Citigroup posted a record $ 9.83 billion quarterly loss .
Bank of America generates more of its business in the United States , exposing it more to weakening economic conditions at home , such as in housing .
Its profit from consumer and small - business banking fell 28 percent to $ 1.87 billion .
Net interest margin fell to 2.61 percent from 2.75 percent a year earlier but held steady from the third quarter .
The fourth - quarter results were the first to reflect the bank ’s $ 21 billion purchase on October 1 of ABN AMRO Holding NV ’s LaSalle Bank .
Corporate and investment banking operations posted a $ 2.76 billion loss , compared with a year - earlier profit of $ 1.4 billion .
Wealth and investment management profit fell 42 percent to $ 334 million .
The bank ended the quarter with $ 1.72 trillion of assets .
Bank of America shares closed Friday at $ 35.97 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Through Friday , they had fallen 33 percent in the last year , compared with a 34 percent drop in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .
Now that ’s a post V - Day Miracle !
One that can be spawned only by love .
Love for art , love for architecture .
You know I ca n’t help it when finding something like that , even if it ’s not signed by Karl The Lagerfeld or shown off by Kate La Moss , I absolutely have to share beauty with you !
Nautilus Shell House was build for a Mexico City couple by Senosiain Arquitectos .
Leaving heavy architectural details aside ( always loved architecture but only as an amateur so I wo n’t charge you with construction mumbling ) , the house is put together using a frame of steel - reinforced chicken wire with a concrete spread over it , resulting an earthquake proof structure .
Just take at a look at that smooth interior , spiraled and invaded by nature .
Looks to me like a dream house made by people who are n’t afraid to make every dream come true .
And it ’s the second example of what a great house love can build that I give you .
I have to wonder , anyway , if they have kids .
And if so , how old are they ?
Because I know a couple of toddlers more than happy to decompose the place into little , tiny pieces .
I guess it ’s only up to me , writing the Mexico City Nautilus couple for a visit in their dream shell of a house .
What about you ?
Would you live in such a home ?
Or you ’re more conservative ?

Such discrimination appears to be rare ; even proponents of federal legislation that would outlaw it can cite few examples of it .
But thousands of people accustomed to a health insurance system in which known risks carry financial penalties are drawing their own conclusions about how a genetic predisposition to disease is likely to be regarded .
As a result , the ability to more effectively prevent and treat genetic disease is faltering even as the means to identify risks people are born with are improving .
“ It ’s pretty clear that the public is afraid of taking advantage of genetic testing , ” said Dr. Francis S. Collins , director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health .
“ If that continues , the future of medicine that we would all like to see happen stands the chance of being dead on arrival . ”
Caught in a Bind
For Ms. Grove , 59 , keeping her genetic condition secret finally became impossible .
When her symptoms worsened she was told to come back to the clinic before antibiotics would be prescribed .
But there had been a snowstorm that day , and she could not summon the strength to drive .
“ I have alpha - 1 , ” she remembers sobbing into the phone .
“ I need this antibiotic ! ”
The clinic called in the prescription .
Ms. Grove , who does freelance accounting from home and has health insurance through her husband ’s employer , allowed herself to be identified here because she said she felt an obligation to others  including some in her own family  to draw attention to the bind she sees herself in .
“ Something needs to be done so that you cannot be discriminated against when you know about these things , ” she said .
“ Otherwise you are sicker , your life is shorter and you ’re not doing what you need to protect yourself . ”
McCain 's full statement is after the jump :
Mr. President , I oppose passage of the Intelligence Authorization Conference Report in its current form .
During conference proceedings , conferees voted by a narrow margin to include a provision that would apply the Army Field Manual to the interrogation activities of the Central Intelligence Agency .
The sponsors of that provision have stated that their goal is to ensure that detainees under American control are not subject to torture .
I strongly share this goal , and believe that only by ensuring that the United States adheres to our international obligations and our deepest values can we maintain the moral credibility that is our greatest asset in the war on terror .
That is why I fought for passage of the Detainee Treatment Act ( DTA ) , which applied the Army Field Manual on interrogation to all military detainees and barred cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment of any detainee held by any agency .
In 2006 , I insisted that the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) preserve the undiluted protections of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions for our personnel in the field .
And I have expressed repeatedly my view that the controversial technique known as “ waterboarding ” constitutes nothing less than illegal torture .
Throughout these debates , I have said that it was not my intent to eliminate the CIA interrogation program , but rather to ensure that the techniques it employs are humane and do not include such extreme techniques as waterboarding .
I said on the Senate floor during the debate over the Military Commissions Act , “ Let me state this flatly : it was never our purpose to prevent the CIA from detaining and interrogating terrorists .
On the contrary , it is important to the war on terror that the CIA have the ability to do so .
At the same time , the CIA ’s interrogation program has to abide by the rules , including the standards of the Detainee Treatment Act . ”
This remains my view today .
When , in 2005 , the Congress voted to apply the Field Manual to the Department of Defense , it deliberately excluded the CIA .
The Field Manual , a public document written for military use , is not always directly translatable to use by intelligence officers .
In view of this , the legislation allowed the CIA to retain the capacity to employ alternative interrogation techniques .
I ’d emphasize that the DTA permits the CIA to use different techniques than the military employs , but that it is not intended to permit the CIA to use unduly coercive techniques  indeed , the same act prohibits the use of any cruel , inhumane , or degrading treatment .
Similarly , as I stated after passage of the Military Commissions Act in 2006 , nothing contained in that bill would require the closure of the CIA ’s detainee program ; the only requirement was that any such program be in accordance with law and our treaty obligations , including Geneva Common Article 3 .
The conference report would go beyond any of the recent laws that I just mentioned  laws that were extensively debated and considered  by bringing the CIA under the Army Field Manual , extinguishing thereby the ability of that agency to employ any interrogation technique beyond those publicly listed and formulated for military use .
I cannot support such a step because I have not been convinced that the Congress erred by deliberately excluding the CIA .
I believe that our energies are better directed at ensuring that all techniques , whether used by the military or the CIA , are in full compliance with our international obligations and in accordance with our deepest values .
What we need is not to tie the CIA to the Army Field Manual , but rather to have a good faith interpretation of the statutes that guide what is permissible in the CIA program .
This necessarily brings us to the question of waterboarding .
Administration officials have stated in recent days that this technique is no longer in use , but they have declined to say that it is illegal under current law .
I believe that it is clearly illegal and that we should publicly recognize this fact .
In assessing the legality of waterboarding , the Administration has chosen to apply a “ shocks the conscience ” analysis to its interpretation of the DTA .
I stated during the passage of that law that a fair reading of the prohibition on cruel , inhumane , and degrading treatment outlaws waterboarding and other extreme techniques .
It is , or should be , beyond dispute that waterboarding “ shocks the conscience . ”
It is also incontestable that waterboarding is outlawed by the Military Commissions Act , and it was the clear intent of Congress to prohibit the practice .
The MCA enumerates grave breaches of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions that constitute offenses under the War Crimes Act .
Among these is an explicit prohibition on acts that inflict “ serious and non-transitory mental harm , ” which the MCA states “ need not be prolonged . ”
Staging a mock execution by inducing the misperception of drowning is a clear violation of this standard .
Indeed , during the negotiations , we were personally assured by Administration officials that this language , which applies to all agencies of the U.S. Government , prohibited waterboarding .
It is unfortunate that the reluctance of officials to stand by this straightforward conclusion has produced in the Congress such frustration that we are today debating whether to apply a military field manual to non-military intelligence activities .
It would be far better , I believe , for the Administration to state forthrightly what is clear in current law  that anyone who engages in waterboarding , on behalf of any U.S. government agency , puts himself at risk of criminal prosecution and civil liability .
We have come a long way in the fight against violent extremists , and the road to victory will be longer still .
I support a robust offensive to wage and prevail in this struggle .
But as we confront those committed to our destruction , it is vital that we never forget that we are , first and foremost , Americans .
The laws and values that have built our nation are a source of strength , not weakness , and we will win the war on terror not in spite of devotion to our cherished values , but because we have held fast to them .

Hamsters can have a mean streak and deliver a nasty bite
Pet shop owners say stocks are running low - and prices high - as children clamour for a furry friend .
According to the Chinese media , prices have tripled to about 30 yuan ( $ 4.20 , £ 2.10 ) per hamster across the country .
In the Year of the Rat , this tiny creature has become the most acceptable rodent , a type of animal that is not everyone 's first - choice pet .
" Rats and mice have a bad image , but hamsters are gentle .
You can hold them in your hand and play with them , " Xinhua News Agency reported .
By bringing up a pet , my son will learn about compassion and caring for animals
Chinese father
Pet stores are also reporting an increased interest in other , similar - looking creatures , such as chinchillas and squirrels .
But it is the hamster that appears to have caught the imagination at the start of a new lunar year in China .
One father told the media : " I 've always wanted to buy my son a small animal and a hamster is an ideal choice .
" By bringing up a pet , my son will learn about compassion and caring for animals . "
But there is a downside .
Experts are warning that rodents have sharp teeth and can deliver a nasty bite .
Some could even be carrying the rabies virus .
Introduction
This is my second stab at Erlang ( see the ring benchmark article for my first take on it ) .
This time around I wanted to get a sense of how well Erlang and its libraries support more mundane tasks like e.g. XML parsing .
I am not a big fan of XML but it is the lingua franca of the web and any language that aspires to become “ mainstream ” has to support it in an efficient manner .
In order to get a feeling for how well Erlang is doing in this respect I am going to repeat my recent XML processing experiments with Groovy but this time using Erlang .
Example
I ’ll be doing some basic processing of RSS files .
For a full example of what these look like see e.g. the MacBreak ’s weekly RSS file .
Here ’s an excerpt ( abridged for the sake of clarity ) :
1 <? xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?>
2 < rss version = " 2.0 " > 3 < channel > 4 < title > MacBreak Weekly </ title > 5 < item > 6 < title > MacBreak Weekly 53 : Bill In A Box </ title > 7 < link >
http://www.podtrac.com/twit.cachefly.net/MBW-053.mp3 </link> 8 < pubDate > Wed , 15 Aug 2007 12:58:11 -0700 </ pubDate > 9 < enclosure url =
http://www.podtrac.com/twit.cachefly.net/MBW-053.mp3 " /> 10 </item > 11 </ channel > 12 </rss >
Each of the potentially many < item > tags keeps the data pertaining to a single audiocast episode .
What we want to extract is :
the audiocast episode title ( < title > tag )
tag ) the publication date ( < pubDate > tag )
tag ) the URL pointing to the MP3 file ( < link > tag )
Depending on the publisher the format of the RSS file may vary slightly .
The publication date is e.g. sometimes buried in a < dc:date > tag .
Likewise , the MP3 URL is sometimes not contained in a < link > tag but in the url attribute of the < enclosure > tag .
The RSS files I will be using for testing are as follows :
1 bbox33:audiocasts $ pwd 2 / Users/mhr/dl/audio/audiocasts 3 bbox33:audiocasts $ find .
- type f - name \*.rss 4 ./metadata/Cc_zwei.rss 5 ./metadata/Elrep.rss 6 ./metadata/Security_now_.rss
7 ./metadata/Technometria.rss 8 ./metadata/This_week_in_tech.rss
9 ./metadata/Windows_weekly.rss
Opening remarks
Unfortunately , the documentation of Erlang ’s XML parsing library is pretty scant and — apart from the xmerl User ’s Guide — I could not find any tutorials on xmerl on the web .
Again , a language aspiring to widespread adoption should have more material covering these kinds of basics .
There were a few choices as to how to go about the parsing business :
using xmerl_scan with or without customization functions .
with or without customization functions .
using xmerl_scan together with xmerl_xpath ( an XPath 1.0 implementation ) .
I chose the first approach because it was better documented .
Only after finishing the first cut of the parsing code did I find xmerl_xpath usage examples on a mailing list and played with it .
The Erlang code that finds the RSS files listed above and parses them is as follows :
1 - module ( xml2 ) . 2 - export ( [ main / 1 ] ) .
3 - include _ lib ( " xmerl/include/xmerl.hrl " ) . 4 5 parseAll( D ) ->
6 % find all RSS files underneath D 7 FL = filelib : fold _ files ( D , " .+.rss $ " , true , fun ( F , L ) -> [ F|L ] end , [ ] ) , 8 [ parse ( F ) || F <- FL ] . 9 10 parse ( FName ) ->
11 % parses a single RSS file 12 {R , _ } = xmerl _ scan : file ( FName ) , 13 % extract episode titles , publication dates and MP3 URLs 14 L = lists : reverse ( extract ( R , [ ] ) ) , 15 % print channel title and data for first two episodes 16 io : format ( " ~n >>
~p~n " , [ element ( 1 , lists : split ( 3 , L ) ) ] ) , 17 L . 18 19 % handle ' xmlElement ' tags 20 extract ( R , L ) when is_record ( R , xmlElement ) -> 21 case R#xmlElement .
name of 22 enclosure -> 23 if element ( 1 , hd ( R#xmlElement . parents ) ) == item -> 24 FFunc = fun ( X ) -> X#xmlAttribute .
name == url end , 25 U = hd ( lists : filter ( FFunc , R#xmlElement . attributes ) ) , 26 [ {url , U#xmlAttribute .
value} | L ] ; 27 true -> L 28 end ; 29 channel -> 30 lists : foldl ( fun extract / 2 , L , R#xmlElement . content ) ; 31 item -> 32 ItemData = lists : foldl ( fun extract / 2 , [ ] , R#xmlElement . content ) , 33 [ ItemData | L ] ; 34 _ -> % for any other XML elements , simply iterate over children 35 lists : foldl ( fun extract / 2 , L , R#xmlElement . content ) 36 end ; 37 38 extract ( #xmlText{parents = [ {title , _ } , {channel , 2 } , _ ] , value = V} , L ) -> 39 [ {channel , V}|L ] ; % extract channel / audiocast title 40 41 extract ( #xmlText{parents = [ {title , _ } , {item , _ } , _ , _ ] , value = V} , L ) -> 42 [ {title , V}|L ] ; % extract episode title 43 44 extract ( #xmlText {parents = [{ link , _ } , {item , _ } , _ , _ ] , value = V} , L ) -> 45 [ { link , V}|L ] ; % extract episode link 46 47 extract ( #xmlText{parents = [ {pubDate , _ } , {item , _ } , _ , _ ] , value = V} , L ) -> 48 [ {pubDate , V}|L ] ; % extract episode publication date ( ' pubDate ' tag ) 49 50 extract ( #xmlText {parents = [ { ' dc:date ' , _ } , {item , _ } , _ , _ ] , value = V} , L ) -> 51 [ {pubDate , V}|L ] ; % extract episode publication date ( ' dc:date ' tag ) 52 53 extract ( #xmlText{} , L ) -> L . % ignore any other text data 54 55 % ' main ' function ( invoked from shell , receives command line arguments ) 56 main ( A ) ->
57 D = atom_to_list ( hd ( A ) ) , 58 parseAll ( D ) .
Conclusion
Erlang ’s filelib : fold_files ( ) function is cool and a good example of how easy things should be .
On the other hand :
it took quite a bit of time and effort to write the code above ( perhaps due to my lack of experience in functional programming ) and it was not fun 😦
beauty is in the eye of the beholder as they say and the promise of being able to write clean and attractive code is a major reason to pick up a new programming language .
Again , maybe it ’s just me but I did not find the resulting Erlang code to be particularly attractive .
the XML parser chokes reproducibly on XML files with non-ASCII character sets ( try the code e.g. with the following RSS file ( containing german characters ) )
The XPath implementation appears to be incomplete : I could not use the | operator in an XPath expression to select several paths for example .
Anyway , that ’s just my $ 0.02 on XML parsing with Erlang .
I am not an expert by any stretch of the imagination so feel free to point to anything I may have missed .
One of the advantages of duplicity is that it provides for integrated encryption of backup files .
We 'll need two gpg keys for our backups ; an " encryption key " and a " signature key . "
Our encryption key is used to protect the data in the backup files from snooping on the backup server , while the signature key is used to ensure the integrity of the backup files .
Duplicity 's -- encrypt - key option allows a user to specify either a symmetric or public key with which to encrypt the backup archives .
Duplicity 's -- sign - key option specifies either a symmetric or public key with which to sign the backup archives .
If encryption is turned on , and the -- sign - key option is omitted , the - - encrypt - key key is also used to sign the archives .
Note that the private key for the signature key ( or the encryption key if -- sign - key is omitted ) must be available to duplicity when it runs .
Duplicity also requires the passphrase for the signing key be either entered manually or stored in an environment variable .
If our encryption key and signature key are the same , then a compromise of the server means a compromise of the backed up data as well .
We 'll therefore use separate encryption and signature keys .
Since the encryption key we 're about to generate is going to be used to protect important data ( passwords , email , documents ) the private key should itself be well protected .
Ideally , the keys should be stored on a secure drive that you keep on your person at all times , or failing that , a laptop that is well protected and not usually connected to a network .

First , we 'll generate the signature key , owned by root , with the passphrase " signtest " .

“ Our universe is not just described by mathematics — it is mathematics . ”
That ’s the conclusion of Max “ Peg Leg ” Tegmark , an astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
But he ai n’t nuts , even if he sounds as if he ’s a couple of planets short of a solar system .
His argument is actually kinda convincing .
In a paper that he says is a director ’s cut of an article that he wrote for New Scientist which in turn was based on an earlier paper of his called The Mathematical Universe , he starts with a question : if we accept that the universe has a reality independent of ourselves , then what sort of reality is it ?
Peg Leg Tegmark argues that it has to be free of any kinda of physical or cultural bias so that it is the same for all aliens wherever they may be in the universe .
The only logical system that fits this description is the one that underlies mathematics , he says .
Therefore the universe is mathematics .
Peg Leg Tegmark reckons that this line of thought leads to a number of curious predictions that are actually testable by observation .
F0r example , he says that a measurement of the distribution of dark energy within our universe would be a decent test .
Just how we might make that measurement and what exactly we would be looking for is harder to say .
Still we can hardly expect the trifling details behind the actual observation and measurement of the universe to trouble a thinker like Tegmark .
All in all , his paper makes a fine addition to the general framework of untestable philosophy cosmology .
Ref : arxiv.org/abs/0709.4024 : Shut Up and Calculate
In the year 2000 , a devastating blow was dealt to conservative ideology .
They were at long last given simultaneous control of all parts of government , and a chance to implement their philosophies .
The outcome proved , of course , to be a fiasco of monumental proportions .
From budget surpluses to record deficits ; unchecked pork ; a tide of corruption , both moral and legal , that thinned their ranks like smallpox ; mismanagement of even basic government tasks , such as emergency response capabilities ; a national economy constantly teetering between mere sluggishness and outright recession ; the entrance into a quagmire of a war , one with unclear initial purpose and even less clear strategies for exit .
And those are just the highlights .
It would be enough to drive even the most sane person to despair ; in fact , the more sane you are , the more likely you are to feel despair over any of these things .
With the agonizing lack of grace of a faceplanting pole vaulter , and in every realm -- economics , oversight , foreign policy , etc. -- conservatism unleashed into the real world met , once again , with abject and humiliating failure .
It seems there is no aspect of government that conservatism is actually good at , once the adherents are given any more responsibilities than being the besuited blowhards of Washington cocktail parties .
I thought it might be appropriate , at this point , to go over the five conservative stages of grief .
They are taken directly from Kubler - Ross , and so are solidly backed by the best psychological modeling .
In their moments of understandable despair over actually having finally been given the unfair and dastardly opportunity to put their signing pens where their mouths have been , as opposed the previous years of merely erupting , geyserlike , on Fox News every evening about what they could do if they were in charge , it is expected that most conservatives will at this point go through at least some of these stages of grief .
Since we are not ogres , here , we will simply wish them well and pray for their speedy recovery .
Stage 1 : John McCain .
In the McCain stage of grief , a conservative is mentally aware of their surroundings but unable to emotionally process the information .
The result is a mental short - circuit .
Sufferers are especially prone to thinking that the Iraq
War is going spectacularly well ; they may even wander open - air marketplaces in which they are protected by a hundred or more fully armed United States soldiers , with helicopter gunship support , and remark aloud at how normal and stable and safe their location obviously is .
Denial may also exist over the state of the economy , of their own party , or , especially , their own past actions .
The McCain stage of grief is known to last years or even decades .
Fortunately , the sufferer usually loses all concept of time , such that they cannot differentiate between any particular six month period , and will eventually declare them all to be " a hundred years " long .
Stage 2 : Rudy Giuliani .
The Giuliani stage of grief is marked by constant , seething anger .
Individuals may reduce their entire range of emotional responses to one , that of constant , self - righteous rage .
The stage is usually accompanied by Napoleonic fantasies , declaring the fearsome breadth of their own inner fury to be the only salvation not just of themselves , but of the entire world in which they live .
Every situation , every social interaction , and every problem is met with a frequently irrational and always militant response .
Long - term sufferers of the Giuliani stage may eventually suffer from a permanent bug - eyed expression and the onset of sociopathy .
They may sometimes be mistaken for necrophiliacs .
Stage 3 : Mitt Romney .
In the Romney stage , the full impact of the conservative situation begins to become clear to the individual , who then begins to attempt to extricate themselves from their predicament through the process of bargaining .
Sufferers may , upon recognizing the unpopularity of past positions , shift those positions wildly from one year to the next , one week to the next , or even during consecutive sentences .
They are driven by a need for popularity and acceptance , and are willing to tailor their speech , behavior , and even their thoughts to whatever may be necessary to obtain it .
Sufferers of the Romney stage of grief are aware of their surroundings and the negative situation they are in , and are even aware of how their behavior may have contributed to the failure , but lack the mental ability to then adapt their behaviors as a result of those past failures .
Instead , they flit haphazardly from idea to idea , from constituency to constituency , looking to empty sloganeering and focus group ideas to rebuild the trust that they have lost .
Stage 4 : Fred Thompson .
Eventually , sufferers of conservative grief may become distant and despondent , entering the Thompson stage .
Individuals may retreat into isolation , even if they are currently supposed to be running for President of the United States or something .
While they can sometimes be goaded into action , say , for an evening debate , they are more prone to minimalist activities , such as making a few phone calls , showing up at a county fair , or merely driving around in a truck .
Sufferers of the Thompson stage are fully aware of past conservative failures , but are unable to make even token attempts at new ideas or substantively critiquing the old ones .
They become stiff and emotionless , as if a writers ' strike is incapacitating them .
They may begin to age creepily and horribly .
Stage 5 : Mike Huckabee .
Finally , the Huckabee stage may be reached .
In this stage , the grief sufferer finally comes to term with the situation for himself and his fellow conservatives .
He realizes fully how he has been used ; he realizes fully how shallow and insincere conservative behavior has been ; he realizes that there is little way to change the situation .
He may surround himself with trivialities or attempts at obvious self - deprecation in order to make light of the situation ; for example , using elderly b- list television action stars as inexplicable campaign props .
Nonetheless , acceptance of the situation is achieved .
In the Huckabee stage , the individual no longer grieves for the losses of conservatism , but comes to accept them as the reality of the movement , and nothing that either can or should be changed .
Token apologies for past behavior may be issued , with the full internal knowledge that those transgressions will be repeated in the future .
Individuals that reach the Huckabethan stage of conservative grief may achieve serenity and spirituality ; the stage is frequently accompanied by the belief that no matter how bad the situation is , those tragedies and failures were preordained by God , who will return at any moment to kick the asses of all those that may now stand in your way .
These seemingly baseless assertions of preordained destiny and of imminent divine intervention on your personal behalf may not be emotionally rational , but it at least allows the individual a cognitive basis for continuing their conservatism even in the wake of obvious and dramatic movement - wide failures .
In this manner , a conservative can continue to remain conservative indefinitely , or at least until their conservatism results in another multi-fronted national crisis .
Federal Courts and the Imaginary Constitution
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
It ’s been a tough summer for social conservatives , thanks to our federal courts .
From gay rights to affirmative action to Boy Scouts to the Ten Commandments , federal courts recently have issued rulings that conflict with both the Constitution and overwhelming public sentiment .
Conservatives and libertarians who once viewed the judiciary as the final bulwark against government tyranny must now accept that no branch of government even remotely performs its constitutional role .
The practice of judicial activism — legislating from the bench — is now standard for many federal judges .
They dismiss the doctrine of strict construction as hopelessly outdated , instead treating the Constitution as fluid and malleable to create a desired outcome in any given case .
For judges who see themselves as social activists , their vision of justice is more important than the letter of the laws they are sworn to interpret and uphold .
With the federal judiciary focused more on promoting a social agenda than upholding the rule of law , Americans find themselves increasingly governed by men they did not elect and cannot remove from office .
Consider the Lawrence case decided by the Supreme Court in June .
The Court determined that Texas had no right to establish its own standards for private sexual conduct , because gay sodomy is somehow protected under the 14th amendment right to privacy . 
Ridiculous as sodomy laws may be , there clearly is no right to privacy nor sodomy found anywhere in the Constitution .
There are , however , states ’ rights — rights plainly affirmed in the Ninth and Tenth amendments .
Under those amendments , the State of Texas has the right to decide for itself how to regulate social matters like sex , using its own local standards .
But rather than applying the real Constitution and declining jurisdiction over a properly state matter , the Court decided to apply the imaginary Constitution and impose its vision on the people of Texas .
Similarly , a federal court judge in San Diego recently ordered that city to evict the Boy Scouts from a camp they have run in a city park since the 1950s .
A gay couple , with help from the ACLU , sued the city claiming the Scouts ’ presence was a violation of the separation of church and state . 
The judge agreed , ruling that the Scouts are in essence a religious organization because they mention God in their recited oath .
Never mind that the land , once privately owned , had been donated to the city for the express purpose of establishing a Scout camp .
Never mind that the Scouts have made millions of dollars worth of improvements to the land .
The real tragedy is that our founders did not intend a separation of church and state , and never envisioned a rigidly secular public life for America .
They simply wanted to prevent Congress from establishing a state religion , as England had .
The First amendment says  Congress shall make no law — a phrase that cannot possibly be interpreted to apply to the city of San Diego .
But the phony activist separation doctrine leads to perverse outcomes like the eviction of Boy Scouts from city parks .
These are but two recent examples .
There are many more , including the case of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore , who was ordered by a federal court to remove a Ten Commandments monument from Alabama courthouse property .
The political left increasingly uses the federal judiciary to do in court what it cannot do at the ballot box : advance an activist , secular , multicultural political agenda of which most Americans disapprove .
This is why federal legal precedents in so many areas do not reflect the consensus of either federal or state legislators .
Whether it ’s gun rights , abortion , taxes , racial quotas , environmental regulations , gay marriage , or religion , federal jurists are way out of touch with the American people .
As a society we should reconsider the wisdom of lifetime tenure for federal judges , while Congress and the President should remember that the Supreme Court is supreme only over other federal courts — not over the other branches of government .
It ’s time for the executive and legislative branches to show some backbone , appoint judges who follow the Constitution , and remove those who do not .
Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas .

The Best of Ron Paul
RIVERSIDE , Calif . -
Two teams of scientists , including three researchers from UC Riverside , report that traces of oxygen appeared in Earth 's atmosphere roughly 100 million years before the " Great Oxidation Event " 2.4 billion years ago .
The Great Oxidation Event is when most geoscientists think atmospheric oxygen rose sharply from very low levels and set the stage for animal life that followed almost two billion years later .
Analyzing layers of sedimentary rock in a kilometer - long core sample they retrieved in 2004 from the Hamersley Basin in Western Australia , the researchers found evidence for the presence of a small but significant amount of oxygen 2.5 billion years ago in the oceans and likely also in Earth 's atmosphere .
Because the core was recovered from deep underground , it contains materials untouched by the atmosphere for billions of years .
After retrieval , the scientists sliced the core longitudinally for analysis .
Study results appear in a pair of papers in tomorrow 's issue of Science .
The UCR contribution :
Geochemists Timothy Lyons , Steven Bates , and Clinton Scott of the UCR Department of Earth Sciences -- working with teams from Arizona State University and the universities of Maryland , Washington , and Alberta -- generated elemental and isotopic data that provide indirect , or proxy , evidence for the evolving atmosphere and its relationship to the early evolution of life .
" This is the earliest convincing record for an ephemeral accumulation of oxygen in the biosphere before its irreversible rise beginning 2.4 billion years ago , " said Lyons , a professor of biogeochemistry .
Scott , a graduate student working with Lyons , used metals in the ancient ocean - - now trapped in sedimentary rocks -- as proxies for the amount of oxygen in the early ocean and atmosphere .
His doctoral research provided a baseline for the Australian samples , showing that the 2.5 billion - year old rocks look more like those from younger times when oxygen was higher in the atmosphere .
These results revealed to the UCR geochemists and their colleagues at Arizona State University that oxygen increased significantly but briefly 100 million years before its permanent place in Earth 's atmosphere .
Working principally with colleagues at the University of Maryland , Bates , a research associate , and Lyons analyzed sulfur present in the Australian rocks as another fingerprint of oxygen concentrations at Earth 's surface .
Their analysis of the sulfur also confirmed that the world changed briefly but importantly 2.5 billion years ago , presaging the life - affirming oxygenation of the atmosphere 100 million years later .
" We were surprised to see evidence of increasing oxygen in rocks so old , " Lyons said .
" And the fact that two independent lines of evidence point in the same direction suggests that Earth 's most dramatic shift in atmospheric composition and its relationship to the evolution of life began earlier and was more complex than most imagined . "
###
Funds from the Astrobiology Drilling Program of the NASA Astrobiology Institute and the U.S. National Science Foundation supported the work .
The two research teams were led separately by Ariel Anbar of Arizona State University , Tempe , Ariz . ; and Alan Jay Kaufman of the University of Maryland , College Park , Md .
About Tim Lyons :
Lyons joined UCR's Department of Earth Sciences almost three years ago .
As a geochemist specializing in studies of how elements cycle in the ocean and atmosphere and their cause - and - effect relationships with the evolution of early life , he uses elemental and isotopic methods developed through studies of modern oxygen - poor settings , such as the Black Sea .
These geochemical tools are then turned toward fundamental questions about Earth 's early history recorded in the chemical properties of rocks formed many millions to billions of years ago .
The University of California , Riverside is a doctoral research university , a living laboratory for groundbreaking exploration of issues critical to Inland Southern California , the state and communities around the world .
Reflecting California 's diverse culture , UCR 's enrollment of about 17,000 is projected to grow to 21,000 students by 2010 .
The campus is planning a medical school and already has reached the heart of the Coachella Valley by way of the UCR Palm Desert Graduate Center .
With an annual statewide economic impact of nearly $ 1 billion , UCR is actively shaping the region 's future .

Son of fallen Bush aide suspected in Washington gay - bash Nick Langewis
Published : Saturday September 29 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This ( via PageOneQ ) -- A Georgetown University sophomore , implicated in a gay - bashing by a fellow student , has ties to the Bush Administration , RAW STORY has learned .
19 - year - old Philip Anderton Cooney , pictured here in the spring of 2005 , is the son of fallen Bush aide and American Petroleum Institute oil lobbyist Phil Cooney .
Phil Cooney was appointed chief of staff with the White House Council on Environmental Quality , suffering criticism for his lack of environmental experience .
After his resignation and subsequent hire to a position with ExxonMobil , it was found that Cooney had reportedly tampered with data to support the Bush line on climate change .
Philip Anderton Cooney was identified by the victim and reported to police thanks to his Facebook profile , which contained a photograph .
He is being charged with simple assault , which , as a hate crime , carries a jail sentence of up to 270 days , the Washington Post reports .
On the morning of September 9 , the victim says , he was attacked physically and verbally , including with anti-gay slurs , by Cooney while walking near 36th and O Streets in northwest Washington , DC .
According to a WRC report , including video , the victim made it a point to " etch the suspect 's face in his mind " with hopes of discovering his identity and reporting him to police .
After overhearing that a student was talking about the incident to others , a friend gave him the student 's initials , which were monogrammed on his bag , and the victim used them to narrow down his Facebook search .
" The police investigation was nothing , " argues Cooney 's attorney , Danny Onorato .
" You have a complaining witness who said he saw somebody who he think ( sic ) might have attacked him vis-a - vis the Web .
That 's the investigation .
Did they try to talk to Mr. Cooney before they arrested him ?
No .
Would you expect the police to do that ?
Yes . "
He wo n’t tell you this , though .
In fact , he wants you to believe he ’s here to help you , as part of the “ other ” America .
But in fact , when he fights against advertising for drugs that have passed FDA certification on “ safety ” grounds , he ’s implicitly telling you that he does n’t believe the FDA is certifying drug safety :
Can we give John Edwards a taste of his own medicine ?
One of the nostrums the Edwards presidential campaign proposes is a two - year ban on advertising for prescription drugs .
Even if a drug makes it through the FDA ’s hurdles , Edwards wants to prohibit the drug company from telling you about it for two more years .
Why this assault on First Amendment rights ?
Edwards says it ’s to “ prevent television ads from driving consumers to drugs that have n’t been proven safe . ”
I ’m sure my fellow libertarian bloggers will attack Edwards as being an opponent of freedom of speech , and generally willing to substitute his own opinion for ours .
In fact , I assume that if the healthcare plan Kevin posted about were to get passed , Edwards would personally determine what drugs you need to take and then hire federal marshals to forcibly administer them .
But that ’s just the kind - hearted sort of guy he is .
What I ’d rather focus on is his implicit acknowledgment of a fact that we are all painfully aware : the FDA is not exactly a foolproof gateway certifying drug safety .
Of course , expecting them to be foolproof is something only a fool would do .
Prescription drugs are all unsafe to various degrees .
But the FDA assumes that the power to determine exactly what level of danger is acceptable resides within their walls .
John Edwards is suggesting that drugs should be available to patients before they ’re proven safe , and those patients should be the guinea pigs of testing before the manufacturers are allowed to advertise the drugs .
If that ’s the case , what use is the FDA ?
If John Edwards believes the FDA does n’t do an adequate job of certifying drug safety , why do n’t we allow individuals to choose what level of danger they find personally acceptable ?
If taking away our freedom through the FDA is n’t actually keeping us safe , Edwards would never give us the freedom to determine for ourselves what is safe .
After all , he thinks we ’re simply sheep , being “ driven ” to pharmaceuticals because we saw them on TV .
You really want to know what Edwards thinks of you ?
I love the ads , ” a sarcastic Edwards told voters at a town hall meeting at Rundlett Middle School in Concord .
“ Buy their medicine , take it and the next day you and your spouse will be skipping through the fields . ”
The message is : “ you ’re too dumb to think for yourself , so let me do it for you ” .
It ’s a sad day when the candidate who actually has principles and ideas languishes in the polls , while the charlatans like Edwards who unabashedly pander to the lowest common denominator are polling at 23 % in Iowa .

This christmas my list includes what I 'd like for others to have , not because I am selfless and giving , but because if these people had what I wish for them , my life would be so much better .
So Santa , when you get this please keep in mind that i've been a very good girl this year - and by that I mean I have put up with a lot of crap from a lot of people so be generous and make everyone on this list 's christmas dreams come true :
The angry mullet girl in my office would really like a new haircut .
She would also like lithium , and to have her entire wardrobe set to flames .
The ex-Village People backup dancer from my spinning class would like some shorts that fit , and a shirt that covers his man-tits .
And if you 're feeing really generous , a membership to a new gym .
My ex-husband would like speech lessons .
If I hear that mother fucker say " odviously " one more time I 'm going to kill myself .
Thank you , public schools for producing such a genious .
The guy in my office who whines about having to make a pot of coffee needs a blow job .
His angry emails scream sexual frustration , and I 've seen / talked to his wife ergo I fully understand his plight .
But really , for everyones sake can you please find someone to help him out ?
He 's not that bad looking .... The guy who I 'm dating * wants a new alarm clock .
One that does n't go off every 12 minutes randomly blaring buzzing and music , and it would probably be a good idea for someone to give said guy lessons on how to use that alarm clock , as most likely it is user - error causing the problems with the current one .
* please note the phrase " who i'm dating " is used with a bit of poetic license , as there has not specifically been a label put on our relationship just yet .
We do n't want to rush things , after all we 've only known eachother for close to 2 years ... but I digress ... My sister - in - law needs a life .... something to distract her from constantly sending me emails about everything wrong with everyone else in my family .
What part of disfunctional did n't you understand when you married my brother ?
The pot -smoking , lesbian , train - wreck sister ( not me , the other one ) was not something he sprung on you after the wedding - so why do you act like its such a surprise now ?
Tha above sister in law would also like a tube of lipstick and a hairbrush .
Oh what the hell , throw in some new overalls to replace the ones she 's worn every day since she was pregnant with my now 9 year old neice .
Please bring my neighbors a divorce .
The scream at eachother for 4 hours every sunday night like clockwork , and frankly the people at my office do n't appreciate what I look like on Mondays after getting only 2 hours of sleep .
My daughter 's karate instructor would like some duct tape .
That is because he needs to put it over his mouth before he throws another sales pitch at my child about signing up for some new karate related nonsense that will cost me more money .
In case you did n't realize it asshole , my kid does n't have a job so all of her extra curricular activities are funded by yours truly and if you think for ten seconds you can convince me to give you more than the $ 150 a month you have already bilked me out of , you are sorely mistaken .
The only reason I 'm willing to throw the cash at you in the first place is that you are quite hot and I like seeing that part of your chest that the uniform does n't cover .
Perhaps if you'd be willing to teach the class shirtless and in shorts we could talk ... but until then , my checkbook is closed .
The old guy I used to date on wednesdays would like a new cell phone , one that does not contain my number .
Perhaps you could also find a way to explain to him that in retrospect , I realize that I only went out with him due to some self esteem issues I was having at the time and now the thought of him touching me makes my skin crawl .
Maybe tell him I said thanks for teaching me that even lots of money can't make an unattractive , mean spirited person any more appealing .
The hot , tall , younger , black soul mate who broke my heart this summer during the cooling - off period with alarm clock guy above would like an STD - either that or some sort of disfiguring disease or injury .
Ok now I 'll throw in the basics : world peace and an end to war and poverty would really be swell .
Lets face it though , if the good folks in the Bush administration can't fix that stuff you sure as hell can't .
So do n't worry your chubby little head about that and focus on my list .
And get rid of the elves - those dudes freak me out .
Keeping up with the Django
Thanks to a couple big projects at work that I ’m trying to finish up in time to devote my full weekend to the sprint , I do n’t have anything directly code - related to throw out today .
Fortunately , there are plenty of things people ask about Django which have nothing whatsoever to do with code , and I can deal with one of them today : how do you keep up with Django development ?
Every so often , people pop up on the mailing lists , or on IRC , after doing an svn up of their Django tree and wondering why something ’s suddenly not working the way it used to , or in search of official development roadmaps / timelines / Gantt charts / etc .
This inevitably leads into a discussion of the best way to keep up with what ’s happening in Django development , and so I ’d like to pause and point out just how easy that is .
Official resources
If you ’re interested in what ’s going on with Django , or if you ’re running from a trunk checkout and plan to update regularly , there are three primary sources of information you ’ll want to keep up with .
The django - developers mailing list ( and please note that if you ’re trying to figure out how to do something , you should not post your question there ; that ’s what the django - users list is for ) is where public discussion of Django ’s development takes place , and typically any suitably large new feature which lands in trunk will have a back story on the developers ’ list which you can read through at your leisure .
The Django Trac instance is the other thing you ’ll want to keep an eye on ; the Trac timeline tirelessly records every single little thing that happens in the Django repository and wiki .
Speaking of the wiki , that ’s where we keep the list of backwards - incompatible changes between releases ; when we do a release and someone ( technically me ) has to write up notes on what ’s changed , the list on the wiki is where we go to get that information .
Changes are recorded there as soon as they happen , and include the changeset ( so you can back up to one revision prior to the change if you need to ) , the date and an explanation of what changed and how it works now .
If you ’d rather not visit the Trac timeline several times a day , it also has a feed you can subscribe to , and tickets and changesets are also automatically sent out to a read - only mailing list if you ’d prefer to get that information in your inbox ( this means , by the way , that if you open a new ticket you do n’t need to post to the django - developers list to notify people ; between the timeline web page , the feed and the automatic email , the core team will have seen it already ) .
Finally , there ’s the official Django weblog , which includes periodic “ roundups ” of useful resources as well as announcements of releases , sprint dates and other interesting news .
Unofficial resources
The Django community aggregrator keeps track of blogs of people who write about Django ( and if you ’re starting a blog or starting to write about Django on your blog , you can get listed there ) , and has a feed which will send all the latest and greatest Django news your way .
Several of Django ’s core developers maintain blogs , and those are syndicated by the community aggregator , and some have even been known to publicly post notes listing what they ’re working on or plan to be working on .
I also subscribe to feeds of items tagged with “ django ” on del.icio.us and ma.gnolia , which often turn up things I would n’t have seen otherwise ; there are other places which offer similarly - categorized feeds ( e.g. , you could subscribe to a Technorati tag ) , but those two will do a pretty thorough job of keeping you up to date on what ’s happening in the Django community .
If you ’re a developer who ’s available for projects involving Django , there ’s a wiki page where you should feel free to list yourself , and a corresponding page where employers can list positions they ’d like to fill .
There ’s also an unofficial developers / jobs listing site you might want to check out .
What else ?
These are just the major resources you ’ll probably want to keep track of ; there are plenty more out there , and if you know of one , you should post a comment and let the rest of the world know about it too ;)
Citigroup Inc. has barred investors in one of its hedge funds from withdrawing their money , another black eye for the financial behemoth 's troubled foray into new types of investments .
Citigroup suspended redemptions in CSO Partners , a fund specializing in corporate debt , after investors tried to yank more than 30 % of the fund 's roughly $ 500 million in assets .
To stabilize the fund , which had an 11 % loss last year , Citigroup last month injected $ 100 million .
The fund 's longtime manager , John Pickett , has left , following a bitter dispute with Citigroup executives and complaints from investors that he put too much money into a single investment that went bad .
Alternative - investment products such as hedge funds are a relatively small business for Citigroup , which has about $ 2.4 trillion in assets .
Citigroup 's more than 80 alternative products held $ 61.9 billion in assets as of Sept. 30 , of which about $ 11.5 billion represented Citigroup 's own capital .
Still , the turmoil at CSO Partners is an embarrassment as Citigroup tries to dig out from billions of dollars of losses on mortgage - related investments .
Citigroup 's new chief executive , Vikram Pandit , briefly ran the alternative - investments group , and some of the funds he oversaw have been struggling .
A large Citigroup hedge fund called Falcon Strategies suffered a 30 % decline last year as its bets on the credit markets backfired .
Old Lane Partners , a hedge fund now run by Citigroup that was founded by Mr. Pandit and other former Morgan Stanley executives , has shown lackluster performance , posting a 1.8 % loss in January .

Why did Walter Cronkite give his name to these awards , some twenty years ago ?
He was troubled by the falling attention to campaign issues , and the rising tide of money for campaign ads .
He was worried by the demise of civics in our schools .
He was alarmed by the leaders that under - informed voters might elect .
Watch this year ’s awards ceremony and see how the 2019 winners honor his legacy .
Paul McJones alerts us that the ACM posted PDF versions of some books in its Classic Books Series , which are available to anyone who creates a free ACM Web Account .
Among the currently available books , LtU readers are likely to be particularly interested in Hoare and Jones 's Essays in computing science , Adele Goldberg and David Robson 's Smalltalk - 80 : the language and its implementation , and Dahl , Dijkstra , and Hoare 's Structured programming .
Long time readers will also know that I highly recommend Papert 's Mindstorms : children , computers , and powerful ideas to anyone interested with the effect computers might have on education .
Papert 's Logo remains to this day the best children oriented programming language , but even if you disagree with me about this , his book is a must read .
日本の調査捕鯨船団が環境保護団体に「体当たり攻撃」される姿は、お茶の間のお馴染みになった。ところが、07年11月18日の船団出港とともに始動した南極海での調査捕鯨では、豪州の軍隊にまで翻弄されるかもしれないというのだ。環境保護団体の体当たり攻撃も激しさを増しており、船団関係者は頭を痛めている。
水産庁 「 まっとうな国ならありえない 」
調査捕鯨のため出港した日新丸 調査捕鯨のため出港した日新丸
調査捕鯨関係者にとって衝撃的なニュースが、2007年11月15日に飛び込んできた。同日付毎日新聞の記事によると、豪州の最大野党である労働党が、日本の調査捕鯨監視のため偵察機派遣など軍隊を出動させたいとの考えを示したというのだ。野党といっても、24日の総選挙で、11年ぶりに政権を執る可能性が高くなっている。まもなく軍出動は現実のものになるかもしれないのだ。
毎日によると、同党では5月、軍艦を送って捕鯨船に対する臨検や拿捕を行う計画まで明らかにした。現ハワード内閣の閣僚からは「海賊行為のようなもの」との批判が出ているが、労働党は強硬な姿勢を崩していない。
「 まっとうな国であれば、普通はありえないんじゃないですか。我々の調査捕鯨は、国際捕鯨取締条約に基づく100％合法的な活動です。臨検や拿捕となれば、国際的な問題になると思います。政権を執れば、政府として責任ある行動を取られると考えたいですが…」
水産庁遠洋課の担当者は、現時点で政府見解は一切述べられないとしながらも、苦渋の様子でこう語った。
同課によると、臨検や拿捕ができるのは明らかに違法操業の場合だけ。それも、捕鯨船の母国政府に通報してOKが出て初めて実力行使できるという。
欧米では、日本の調査捕鯨への批判は多いが、特に、豪州の風当たりが強い。寿司屋を訪れた日本人男性が銛で串刺しになる過激なビール会社のCMが作られたり、ユーチューブに捕鯨の残酷さを訴える動画がいくつも投稿されたりしている。
11月12日には、英テレグラフ紙が、豪州人は「ミガル」と呼ばれる世界でただ一頭の全身が真っ白いザトウクジラが捕獲されるのを恐れていると報じた。ホエールウォッチングなどの船に慣れているミガルが、捕鯨船に近づくのではないかというのだ。人々は、ミガルが豪州東海岸に沿って移動してくるのを毎年熱い思いで心待ちにしているという。
これに対し、遠洋課では、 「調査のためザトウクジラのランダムサンプリングは必要だが、50頭だけなので遭遇する確率は低い。近寄って来ることもありえない話で、感情的に騒いでいるだけではないか」と話している。
The first thing to know , said Dr. Benjamin Levine , an exercise researcher and a cardiology professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , is that no one really knows what limits human performance .
There ’s the ability of the heart to pump blood to the muscles , there ’s the ability of the muscles to contract and respond , there ’s the question of muscle fuel , and then , of course , there is the mind .
“ How does the brain interact with the skeletal muscles and the circulation ? ” Dr. Levine said .
“ How much of this is voluntary and how much is involuntary ?
We just do n’t know . ”
But since most people can do better , no matter how good their performance , the challenge is to find a safe way to push a little harder .
Many ordinary athletes , as well as elites , use a technique known as dissociation .
Dr. Morgan , who tested the method in research studies , said he was inspired by a story , reported by an anthropologist that , he suspects , is apocryphal .
It involves Tibetan monks who reportedly ran 300 miles in 30 hours , an average pace of six minutes a mile .
Their mental trick was to fixate on a distant object , like a mountain peak , and put their breathing in synchrony with their locomotion .
Every time a foot hit the ground they would also repeat a mantra .
So Dr. Morgan and his colleagues instructed runners to say “ down ” to themselves every time a foot went down .
They were also to choose an object and stare at it while running on a treadmill and to breathe in sync with their steps .
The result , Dr. Morgan said , was that the runners using the monks ’ strategy had a statistically significant increase in endurance , doing much better than members of a control group who ran in their usual way .
That , in a sense , is the trick that Paula Radcliffe said she uses .
Ms. Radcliffe , the winner of this year ’s New York City Marathon , said in a recent interview that she counts her steps when she struggles in a race .
“ When I count to 100 three times , it ’s a mile , ” she said .
“ It helps me focus on the moment and not think about how many miles I have to go .
I concentrate on breathing and striding , and I go within myself . ”
Without realizing what I was doing , I dissociated a few months ago , in the middle of a long , fast bike ride .
I ’d become so tired that I could not hold the pace going up hills .
Then I hit upon a method 
I focused only on the seat of the rider in front of me and did not look at the hill or what was to come .
And I concentrated on my cadence , counting pedal strokes , thinking of nothing else .
It worked .
Now I know why .
It ’s a lazy Wednesday afternoon and I ’m watching Fox Business Network ( FBN ) .
The biggest business news of the day , apparently , is President Bush ’s meeting with the Dalai Lama .
I ’ve barely had a chance to puzzle over how this is a business story when FBN brings in megapastor Joel Osteen , the mild - mannered author of the “ inspirational ” ( if not inspired ) Your Best Life Now book series to provide expert commentary on the implications of the historic meeting .
I ’m surprised that the network producers think Osteen would be an appropriate analyst .
Even more surprised is Osteen himself , who flashes the interviewer an “ Are you kidding me ? ” look , then stammers that the Dalai Lama is , in his experience , a good guy , but notes that they do n’t share the same faith .
This is rather emblematic of FBN ’s programming :
The stories of the day are mostly political happenings masquerading as business news .
It ’s as if the men and women behind the curtain are hoping to drag the formidable audience of its big brother , Fox News , into the business category by making more of the same .
Is that really necessary ?
Is straight busi­ness news too boring to sustain a cable channel ?
The sustainability of Fox ’s competitors , CNBC and Bloomberg News , would seem to indicate not .
They , of course , do have their own dubious quirks .
Rarely a CNBC segment passes that does n’t involve an awkward analyst struggling to articulate the implications of a market move , anchors ad - libbing painfully bad jokes and then laughing at them , or an out - of - nowhere lifestyle story whose only relevance is its attractiveness to the advertising department .
( The loss of those 10 minutes you wasted absorbing the virtues of the newest midmarket sedan would have been less regrettable if the sequence were an actual commercial . )
The problem is not that straight business news is too boring to work on TV ; it ’s that the channels perceive it to be too complex for the notoriously dumbed - down medium and its presumably dumb audience .
On the Fox Business Web site , featured articles include “ What Is Wall Street ? ” and “ Dating to Meet Your Match and Your Budget ” –online counterparts to the channel ’s service - oriented on - air stories that , for instance , tell you how to avoid foreclosure if you default on your mortgage payments .
From this we can deduce that the channel ’s producers imagine its typical viewer to be someone tightly budgeted and single , so ignorant of the business world that “ Wall Street ” is nearly if not completely unintelligible , and on the verge of having his or her house repossessed .
CNBC and Bloomberg seem to think a bit more highly of their audiences , but their content still consists overwhelmingly of dry digests of market news and analysis generalized to the point of meaninglessness .
In the process , something important is lost .
In bending over backward to make business relevant to viewers and assuming that they are n’t sophisticated enough to understand or want anything beyond a rehash of whatever ran in the morning ’s Wall Street Journal , televised business news misses an opportunity to really examine the influence of private - sector power in modern society .
That said , the new Fox channel has some potential .
It knows how to be provocative , and its anchors are happy to argue with interviewees .
It does n’t eschew debate .
( If we ’ve learned anything from Jim Cramer ’s Mad Money , it ’s that more on - air yelling makes for better ratings . )
We can always hope that in the process of having a couple of talking heads argue with each other at top volume , a dialogue will emerge and someone will say something interesting and informative — even if only by accident .
Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer except , of course , for the pigs and the dogs .
 George Orwell , Animal Farm
The beginning of political wisdom is the realization that despite everything youve always been taught , the government is not really on your side ; indeed , it is out to get you .
Sometimes government functionaries and their private - sector supporters want simply to bully you , to dictate what you must do and what you must not do , regardless of whether anybody benefits from your compliance with these senseless , malicious directives .
The drug laws are the best current example , among many others , of the government as bully .
Our rulers presently enforce a host of laws that combine the worst aspects of puritanical priggishness and the invasive , pseudo - scientific , therapeutic state .
They tolerate our pursuit of happiness only so long as we pursue it exclusively in officially approved ways : gin , yes ; weed , no .
Notwithstanding the great delight that our rulers take in tormenting us with their absurdly inconsistent nanny - state commands , they generally have bigger fish to fry .
Above all , the government and its special - interest backers want to take our money .
If these people ran a store , they might aptly call it Robberies R Us .
Their credo is simple and brazen :  you have money , and we want it . 
Unlike the sincere street criminal , however , the robber in official guise rarely puts his proposition to you in the blunt form of your money or your life ,  however much he intends to relate to you on precisely such terms .
( If you doubt my characterization of these intentions , test what happens if you steadfastly resist at every step as the brigands escalate their threats : first ordering you to pay , then billing you for unpaid balances plus penalties and interest , sending you a summons , and ultimately beating you into submission or killing you for resisting arrest .
Your sustained , open resistance always ends in the states use of violence against you , in either your forcible imprisonment or your removal from the land of the living , after which your memory will be defamed by your designation as a criminal governments never settle for mere brutality , but always supplement it with unabashed presumptuousness . )
When I say rarely ,  I do not mean that the authorities never carry out their plunder blatantly .
Throughout the land , for example , criminal courts , acting as de facto muggers , strip people of great sums of money in the aggregate by fining them for conduct that ought never to have been criminalized in the first place drug - law violations , prostitution , gambling , antitrust - law violations , traffic infractions , reporting violations , doing business without a license , and innumerable other victimless crimes . 
The predatory judges and their police henchmen care no more about justice than I care to live on a diet of pig pancreas and boiled dandelions .
They are simply taking peoples money because its there to be taken with minimal effort .
In this manifestation , government amounts to a gigantic speed trap .
The more common way for government officials to rob you , however , involves their seizure of so - called taxes , which take countless forms , all of which are purported to be collected in order to finance mirabile dictubenefits for you .
Such a deal !
Youd have to be a real ingrate to complain about the governments snatching your money for the express purpose of making your world a better place .
Sometimes the political exchange into which you are hauled kicking and screaming rests on such a ludicrous foundation , however , that honesty compels us to classify it , too , as a mugging .
I have in mind such compassionately conservative policies as stripping taxpayers of hundreds of billions of dollars and handing the money over , for the most part , to rich people engaged in large - scale agribusiness and , sometimes , to landowners who dont even bother to represent themselves as farmers .
The apologies that the agribusiness whores in Congress make for this daylight robbery are so patently stupid and immoral that the whole shameless affair resembles nothing so much as the schoolyard bullys grabbing the little kids  lunch money and then taunting them aggressively ,  If you dont like it , why dont you do something about it ? 
Every five years , when the farm - subsidy law expires and a new one is enacted , a few members of Congress pose as reformers of this piracy , but truly serious reforms never occur , and even the minor ones that come along from time to time prove unavailing , as the farm - booty interests invariably suck up emergency relief payments from the public treasury later on to make up for any shortfalls from the main subsidy programs .
Government sneak thieves , in contrast , fear that they may occupy more vulnerable positions than the agribusiness gang and similarly impudent special - interest groups cum legislators , so they dare not taunt the little kids so flagrantly .
Instead , they specialize in legislative riders , budgetary add - ons and earmarks , logrolling , omnibus  Christmas tree bills , and other gimmicks designed to conceal the size , the beneficiaries , and sometimes even the existence of their theft .
At the end of the day , the taxpayers find theres nothing left in the till , but they have little or no idea where all of their money went .
Finding out by reading an appropriations act is next to impossible , inasmuch as these statutes are almost incomprehensible to everyone but the legislative insiders and their staff members who devise them and write them down in a combination of Greek , Latin , and Sanskrit .
For example , for many years , a single congressman from northeastern Pennsylvania first Dan Flood and then Joe McDade substantially enriched the anthracite coal interests of that region by inserting a brief , one - paragraph limitation rider in the annual appropriations act for the Department of Defense .
The upshot of this obscure provision was that Pennsylvania anthracite was transported to Germany to provide heating fuel for U.S. military bases that could have been heated more cheaply by using local resources .
This coals - to - Newcastle shenanigan was a classic sneak - thief gambit , a thing of legislative beauty , but every years budget contains thousands of schemes that operate with similar effect , if not in an equally audacious manner .
Unlike the government sneak thieves , the government con men openly advertiseindeed , expect to receive great credit for certain uses of the taxpayers  money that are represented as bringing great benefits to the general public or a substantial segment of it .
Surely the best example of the con mans art is so - called national defense , a bottomless pit into which the government now dumps , in various forms ( many of them not officially classified as  defense ) , approximately a trillion dollars of the taxpayers  money each year .
The government stoutly maintains , of course , that all ordinary Americans are constantly in grave danger of attack by foreigners nowadays , by Islamic terrorists , in particular and that these voracious wolves can be kept from the door only by the maintenance and active deployment of large armed forces equipped with ultra-sophisticated ( and correspondingly expensive ) equipment and stationed at bases in more than a hundred countries and on ships at sea around the globe .
Without dismissing the alleged dangers entirely , a sensible person quickly appreciates that the threat is slight just do the math , using reasonable probability coefficients whereas the cost of ( purportedly ) dealing with it is colossal .
In short , as General Smedley Butler informed us more than seventy years ago , the modern military establishment , along with most of its blessed wars , is for the most part nothing but a racket .
Worse , because of the way it engages and co-opts powerful elements of the private sector , it gives rise to a costly and dangerous form of military - economic fascism .
Lately , the classic military - industrial - congressional complex has been supplemented by an even more menacing ( to our liberties ) security - industrial - congressional complex , whose aim is to enrich its participants by equipping the government for more effectively spying on us and invading our privacy in ways great and small .
Worst of all , despite everything that is claimed for the militarys protective powers , its operation and deployment overseas leave us ordinary Americans facing greater , not lesser , risk than we would otherwise face , because of the many enemies it cultivates who would have left us alone , if the U.S. military had only left them alone .
( Yes , Virginia , they are over here because were over there . )
The president routinely declares that the hugely increased expenditures and overseas deployments for military purposes since 2001 have reduced the threat of terrorism , but , in fact , terrorist incidents and deaths have increased , not decreased .
Although privileged elements of the political class gain from militarism and neo- imperialist wars , the rest of us invariably lose economic well - being , real security , and all too often life itself .
In 2004 , people who said that security against terrorism was their top concern voted disproportionately , by an almost 7 - to - 1 margin , for George W. Bush .
They had been conned .
Although the mugger , the sneak thief , and the con man are not the only types of government operatives , they make up a large proportion of the leading figures in government today .
The lower ranks , especially in the various police agencies , have a disproportionate share of the bullies .
No attempt to understand government can succeed without a clear understanding of these ideal types and each ones characteristic modus operandi .
With this understanding firmly in mind , you will remain permanently immune to the infectious swindle ,  Im from the government , and I m here to help . 
The truth , of course , is the exact opposite : I say again , the government this vile assemblage of bullies , muggers , sneak thieves , and con menis not really on your side ; indeed , it is out to get you .
Tucson porn-proprietor Tyrone
Henry wants you to know that blowing your load on the faces of blindfolded , underage girls who think they 're participating in a facial cream marketing study is not fraud or any other crime , no matter what the Arizona Court of Appeals said last month .
He also wants you to know he was framed .
Whether he did it or not , he 's serving a seven - year sentence because of the creative legal work of a Pima County prosecutor , Brad Roach
In the summer of 2000 , Roach was assigned to prosecute Tyrone Henry after two teenage girls said he lured them to his home to try out a product called " White Dew " facial cream he was developing .
Instead of exfoliation , they said they got ejaculation .
The girls , 15 and 16 years old at the time , said Henry showed them examples of women with " clumpy " white cream on their faces and then blindfolded them .
The girls said they heard heavy breathing and Henry say , " It 's coming , " and then felt a thick , warm substance applied to their faces .
They said he took photos , paid them $ 10 a piece and convinced them to make follow - up appointments .
Thinking about it later , they realized they 'd been hoodwinked and called the police .
Roach admits the hardest part of the case was figuring out what charge he could hang on Henry .
It was n't sexual assault because he did n't touch the girls sexually , and they did n't touch him .
And it was n't indecent exposure because the girls were blindfolded .
" It was fascinating , " Roach said .
" I do n't want to say it was a once - in - a - lifetime case , but it 's only once in awhile do you get something this bizarre . "
In the end , the only charge Roach could get to stick was " fraudulent scheme and artifice . "
The Division II of the Arizona Court of Appeals concluded that Roach had made the right decision , knocking down Henry 's appeal .
" It was a huge loophole , " Roach said .
" No one in the Legislature had ever thought of it .
It 's not the sort of crime that had come up before . "
A 30 - YEAR - OLD WITH
A degree in political science and one of the first black columnists for the Arizona Daily Wildcat , Henry defended himself in court , arguing that it could n't be fraud since he did n't cheat them out of money or property .
The court disagreed , finding that he duped them in order to obtain " sexual gratification , " which could be considered a fraudulent " benefit " under state law .
" I was incredulous , absolutely incredulous , " Henry said recently in a phone interview from the Arizona State Prison Complex in Florence .
" We 've all been in night clubs .
You know how guys lay it on thick to lure girls back to their rooms .
Under this ruling , that would be illegal because they achieve some sort of sexual gratification based on lies . "
Henry said he will appeal next to the Arizona Supreme Court .
According to Roach , Henry will probably keep the state appeals attorneys ' hands full .
Henry and his mother , Raye Stiles , he said , are bulldog litigators .
" The thing to understand about Tyrone and his mother is that they 're very active in weeding out people they perceive to be treating them unfairly , " Roach said .
" How that 's played out is that they 've filed complaints against nearly everyone in the Pima County Attorney 's Office , the trial court , the appeals court , the clerk of the court and the court reporters .
I did n't even know you could file a complaint against court reporters . "
In person , Stiles does n't have much hard edge .
She 's a lady in all senses of the word , and it makes discussing pornography with her difficult .
A year before , Tyrone was brought up on charges of child porn possession .
Shortly after , Stiles , who did n't even know it was called " lobbying " at the time , successfully convinced the Arizona Legislature to loosen the state 's illegal Internet porn statutes .
At the time , she claimed Pima County was prosecuting innocent folk for possessing illegal material that had been sent to their e-mail accounts as spam .
Although she was dismayed when she learned her son was running a porn site , she believes in his innocence .
Henry claims there was no scam .
True , he was operating the " WhiteDewOriginalFacials.comWhiteDewOriginalFacials.com "
Web site , but that was just his perfectly legal shot at the American Dream .
ADULT WEB SITES cater to a wide variety of specific fetishes .
The culmination of oral sex -- the cumshot -- is where Henry said he found his niche .
He went online in January 2000 .
In the first month , he only took in $ 800 , but by June , he was pulling in $ 1,200 a month .
If he was still in operation , he believes he'd be making between $ 15,000 and $ 20,000 a month .
Henry advertised for models in the Wildcat and hung fliers in campus laundry rooms .
When potential models called , he said he would explain what his Web site was about , show them examples , and they 'd sign two contracts : one for terms of compensation and the other a photo release .
He had previously dealt with about 10 models , each of whom earned between $ 100 and $ 200 an hour .
Henry says the two teenagers knew exactly what they were getting into and they wanted the money .
" Once they got to my home , I figured out in the course of speaking with them that they were not adults and seized everything , " Henry said .
" They created a ruse to get that money for very little work .
I think they got mad at me because I busted them . "
The girls also testified that while blindfolded , they saw a camera flash several times .
Henry 's side of the story is that the girls gave him a " sob story " about how they needed the money , so he snapped a headshot of one of the girls and paid them $ 20 .
Henry 's story is corroborated by the prosecution 's evidence .
When the police searched his home , they found between 300 and 500 photos of women in various stages of getting cum on their faces .
However , the only photo of the girls upturned was a single , nonsexual frame on an undeveloped roll of film .
In order to compensate for this weakness in the state 's argument , Roach supplied the jury other " facial " images from Henry 's Web site gallery .
Henry protested this in his appeal .
( In a separate , unpublished ruling , the Appeals Court denied hearing the complaint on procedural grounds . )
In all , the sole material evidence in the case was a globule of his sperm found on one girl 's sweater .
Henry claims the girls were playing with everything in his apartment , including his laundry basket .
" I'm a red - blooded American man and I operate an adult site ; if you look through my clothes , you 're going to find semen , " Henry says .
It 's more or less a game of " he - said they - said " - - except what " they said " fit with Henry 's MO .
The girls ' testimony matched that of several UA students who told the police a year before they 'd been conned by Henry .
Stiles points to foul play .
She said it 's no coincidence that police arrested her son in the White Dew case the day after she threatened to file a complaint against the prosecuting attorney in the child porn offense .
Raye also says the prosecution may have had racist motives .
" Frankly , I did n't even know he was black until months into the case , " Roach said .
Roach says there are people -- in his own office -- who find it hard to believe that these girls could possibly be so stupid .
" I 've got to come out on ( the girls ' ) defense , " he said .
" We as a society do n't teach girls to be as assertive as they should .
Teenage girls especially are in a position of low self - esteem ....
" Tyrone 's a good con man .
He 's good at what he did , and he 's very smart .
It 's easy for us not being in their place to say they 're stupid .
I do n't really believe they deserve blame . "

The textile and clothing industry , one of the engines China used to fuel its own economic expansion in the 1980s , has been particularly hard hit in Africa .
For decades , African countries exported large quantities of clothes and textiles to developed countries under a trade agreement intended to protect European and American markets from competition from China and others , while encouraging exports from the world ’s poorest nations .
But the trade provision , the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing , expired in January 2005 , putting these countries in direct export competition with China .
Africa found itself once again on the losing end of globalization .
If copper is Zambia ’s bread and butter , manufacturing should have been its main meal — just as many economies across the globe have progressed from producers of raw materials to low - tech manufacturing and beyond , a well - trod path to development .
Ms. Zimba , 40 , a quality - control worker at the plant here who asked to be identified only by her common last name because she feared losing her termination benefits , first got a job at the factory in 1989 , after moving to Kabwe from the depressed eastern region of the country with her brother .
She earned a little less than $ 100 a month , as well as free health care and a pension , and a little three - room house in the workers ’ compound .
But since she lost her job , her family ’s standard of living has plummeted .
The water was turned off , and Ms. Zimba does not know where she will come up with next semester ’s tuition for her 20 - year - old daughter ’s trade school .
“ We will see what God brings me , ” Ms. Zimba said .
For Ms. Zimba , the transition from salaried work to selling goods for pocket change in the market is a devastating setback to a grim fate she thought she had escaped — her mother was widowed when Ms. Zimba was 15 and reduced to selling in the market as well .
“ I am right back where I started , ” Ms. Zimba said .
As for the Chinese , she bitterly refers to them as “ briefcase investors . ”
Angelina Jolie Glowing at Critics Choice Awards ( Photos )
We 've got some great photos showingand her partnerat last night 's Critics Choice Awards .
The common theme among all of the photos is that Angelina is beaming .
Not only does she look radiantly happy , but she is also looking a little rounder and healthier .
We can't say what has come over the normally pensive Hollywood actress but we 're happy to see that she has apparently turned a corner and is in a better place right now .
Angelina lost her mother , Marcheline Bertrand , just one year ago and grew thin and drawn looking .
A year has passed and Jolie is said to have recently reconciled with her father , actor Jon Voight .
The celebrity father and daughter had been estranged for five years .
We 've got the photo below .
Our pictures show Brad and Angelina looking quite cozy together .
The couple , parents to four young children , recently went home to visit Brad 's family and enjoyed a holiday pizza party with the entire crew .
Check out all of last nights photos on the next page .

I am a political fuzzy bear .
I ’m lovable and huggable and consistently bandied about by ideologues from both extremes while I grumble and snort my way around the middle of most political maelstroms with a gimbaled neck .
My head tilts and turns and rotates , looking at many sides of issues , top and bottom , through the pertinent peep holes , using others as mirrors to gauge effect and after - effect .
But that is way more than enough about me .
Well no .
There is a bit more .
I am supporting Ron Paul for president , even though many of his views are too extreme to fit into my regular political comfort zone .
He is clearly and strongly for things I think people should not be clearly and strongly for .
Many of these are issues the Right would call me a “ Lefty Lunatic ” over , which is something I ’ve grown accustomed to .
I do n’t think government should dictate morality when it comes to birth control issues .
Yes , that means abortion as well .
That ’s my view .
I think the moral issue remains within the mind of the person making the choice .
I also think that the reason the issue has been contentious for so long , is because it is a moral dilemma .
Moral dilemmas tend to abrogate easy answers .
When that happens , I think it best that government get simply out of the way .
So Ron Paul ’s stance on abortion bothers me ( although , I must say , knowing he was an OBGYN , makes me have compassion and understanding for why he takes that stance ) .
As do a few other things I ’ve heard him take stances on .
“ No student Visas for terrorist nations . ”
There is one that I ca n’t go along with .
Who gets to decide what a terrorist nation is ?
And is n’t the point of student exchanges to promote understanding between people ’s of the world ?
Is it not better to continue to promote tolerance by being tolerant , understanding by being understanding ?
I do n’t understand this position at all .
It seems contradictory to the grander , broader stances Ron Paul takes .
So I deliberate .
In one pile I place the cons .
Another the pros .
I do a bit of eyes closed mind wandering and I come back with my choice .
Ron Paul ’s biggest issue is the one that weighs the most , and it sits firmly in the pro pile .
Less federal government .
That ’s the one painted in gold .
That ’s the ticket that gets me into Ron Paul ’s encampment .
I hold it tightly in my hand and I proffer it at the entrance .
I want in .
Yes .
I want to belong to the political group that wants to remove power from a centralized monstrosity .
I want my local government to have more of my money .
I want my State to have more control of my surroundings .
All of the other issues tossed around this election cycle are pale tokens compared to this one idea .
And it is the reason I will vote Republican for the first time ever , and vote for Ron Paul .
I have always started the web with MyYahoo , at least since MyYahoo was launced in the mid 90s .
I 've got my " daily reads " there now via RSS and I still grab a fair bit of news there and of course the weather and my stocks .
So I do n't think I am going to leave MyYahoo , but there is one thing I am absolutely going to do and that is put at least one and possibly several " discovery pages " right at the top of MyYahoo and start every morning with them .
Discovery pages are web services that showcase the most interesting stuff on the web right now .
There are three and a half that I am considering .
I will describe them and then I 'll ask for suggestions of others from the readers .
First , the " half " .
Memeorandum is a great service .
Currently you can choose two views , tech and politics .
I visit the tech page at least once a day and possibly many more times .
I do n't know whether to call Memeorandum a " discovery page " or not because its really very narrow and you do n't see stuff about completely random things .
The blogs it culls from are a tight set and it tends to generate " group think " which I am not a fan of when I want discovery .
So while Memorandum is a must read for me every day , I think I 'll leave it out of my " discovery page " list .
That leaves three candidates .
Delicious ' Popular Page -
The grandaddy of the " discovery pages " .
And a huge part of delicious ' popularity .
Though I find the stories often a bit too techy for my taste , the ability to post / copy to my delicious account is a huge plus .
And filtering the popular page by tag is a great feature that they ought to make easier over time .
Digg -
Along with delicious , Digg is the current favorite of the digerati .
One look at this Alexa chart shows how these two services have grown in lockstep over the past six months .
Digg has a " cleaner interface " and uses votes / diggs to determine what 's interesting to the users .
I have used Digg a lot over the past year , but have n't completely warmed up to it and its not an every day experience for me , at least yet .
Reddit - Considered by many to be a Digg clone , Reddit is interesting to me on several levels .
First the user interface is more like delicious than digg and frankly I am used to that and prefer it .
Second it uses the votes that each user makes to build a personalized version of Reddit over time for each user .
I like that idea in principal and am going to see how it works for me .
My plan is to put at least one and possibly several of these " discovery pages " at the top of MyYahoo and start my day with them .
Right now I may go with all three of these and possibly whittle it down to one or two over time .
If you have another one I should consider , please let me know in the comments and I will check it out .
Hopefully , you are all

The Economist
What really frustrates economists is the debate over trade and national policy is always framed as “ exports are good , imports are bad ” ; the best policy is the one that allows Americans to dump as much of their production on foreigners as possible , while keeping as much of those foreigners ’ things out of our country as possible .
That is called mercantilism , and it does n’t work .
As you know , healthy exports are only half the equation .
Imports provide much of trade ’s benefit – which is , indeed , why people import things .
If you think buying from China is bad for our economy , ask yourself how many people your company would have to lay off if it had to pay twice as much for every piece of electronic gear in the office — all those computers , fax machines , copiers , telephones — because they were Made In The U.S.A .
's Robert Lane Greene is debating trade ( albeit in very agreeable fashion , so far ) with Jonathan Jacoby of the Center for American Progress .
Mr Greene opens splendidly :
I thought of this as I followed a link from Mark Thoma to this story , on the bartering habits of chimpanzees .
It seems that our closest relatives are more than happy to exchange fiat money ( tokens , provided by researchers ) for goods , and they gladly trade services in the wild .
But while they can be trained to barter goods in laboratories , they are unwilling to do so on their own , or in their natural habitat .
This reluctance prevents chimps from developing a true ( if primitive ) economy based on specialisation and gains from trade .
Said one of the lead researchers on the study , " They ’re perfectly capable of barter , but they do n’t do so in a way which will maximize their outcomes . "
Fascinatingly , it appears that chimps have not evolved trade in goods due to their inability to develop enforceable property rights :
The observed chimpanzee behavior could be reasonable because chimpanzees lack social systems to enforce deals and , as a society , punish an individual that cheats its trading partner by running off with both commodities .
Also because of their lack of property ownership norms , chimpanzees in nature do not store property and thus would have little opportunity to trade commodities .
Nevertheless , as prior research has demonstrated , they do possess highly active service economies .
In their natural environment , only current possessions are “ owned , ” and the threat of losing what one has is very high , so chimpanzees frequently possess nothing to trade .
At the risk of treading well outside my area of expertise , I 'd suggest that this implies not that humans have evolved some sense of the rightness of trade , but merely the means to develop and enforce contracts ( among other things ) .
Back at CFR , Mr Jacoby notes that many people support various trade restrictions , but these same individuals happily and routinely fork over money for goods which have clearly been produced , wholly or in part , in other countries .
Mr Jacoby appears to suggest that the enforcement of labour and environmental standards would assuage concerns regarding trade , but I 'm not so sure .
For one thing , it 's hardly clear that responses to questions on whether or not one supports such measures are at all meaningful .
Absent detailed knowledge of trade policy , who would ever be against labour and environmental standards ?
What Americans and others fear is uncertainty , and increased labour and environmental standards would do little to eliminate that .
Jobs would still be lost for a variety of reasons , and trade would still be a ready scapegoat for ambitious politicians .
The processes which lead to import / export imbalances and migrating jobs sit beyond the reach of the familiar and secure rules that govern daily transactions .
As such , the possibility of satisfying , for once and for all , consumers ' trade concerns is likely to remain slim .
So while there may be cause to invest in cleaner and safer technologies in developing nations , or to create domestic programs to improve the efficiency with which displaced workers find new and appropriate jobs , no one should be under the false impression that new trade restrictions will eliminate trade doubts .
Instead , leaders should note the zeal with which their constituents seize upon the fruits of free exchange and recognise the extent to which that exchange has generated magnificent improvements in global welfare .
It is n't just contract enforcement that sets us apart from our simian ancestors .
It 's also our ability to discover , through reason and experience , that our mercantilist instincts are best ignored .

DES MOINES ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton may have shot herself in the foot trying to get Iowa voters to pledge support to her -- she is encouraging them to caucus on January 14 , 11 days too late .
At a rally featuring her husband , former President Bill Clinton on Saturday , campaign workers asked supporters to sign and mail cards that said “ Yes ! I ’m an Iowan for Hillary ” with their contact information as well as other supportive friends .
One small problem .
In the upper right - hand corner of the card , it says “ I , _____ , pledge to support Hillary Clinton at my precinct caucus on January 14 , 2008 . ”
Unfortunately , that ’s 11 days too late .
The Iowa caucuses are January 3 and organization is key to getting voters to go to the events and support their preferred candidate .
The Politico.com , an Internet site that specializes in politics and first reported the mistake , said at Bill Clinton ’s second event on Saturday the cards had the wrong date crossed out and replaced with the correct date .
Bahais , whose headquarters are in Haifa , are seen as heretics in Iran
They were convicted for propaganda against the system in the southern city of Shiraz , a judiciary spokesman said , without giving details .
The Bahai faith is viewed as heresy by Iran 's religious authorities .
The spokesman said the 51 suspended sentences were conditional on attending courses by state propaganda officials .
The defendants were arrested early last year , according to officials .
The authorities said they were proselytising in the southern city of Shiraz under the cover of helping the poor .
Speaking at his regular news conference , spokesman Ali Reza Jamshidi said the 51 had already been freed .
Iran 's constitution recognises only Islam , Christianity , Judaism and Zoroastrianism as legitimate religions .
Corrupt official hanged
At the same briefing , Mr Jamshidi announced that a customs broker had been executed for corruption and bribery .
Three other customs officials were condemned to death in the same case - involving a bribe of 10bn rials ( $ 1 m or £ 0.5 m ) - but they had appealed for their sentences to be reduced to life imprisonment .
Mr Jamshidi admitted it was " rare " for the death sentence in Iran to be handed down for financial crimes and may have been the first such case .
Iran is one of the world 's heaviest users of the death penalty , most frequently for violent crime and sex offences .
Media reports put the number of convicts executed this month at 28 .
About 300 were executed last year .
PORT WASHINGTON , N.Y. ( MarketWatch ) --
Whether the Federal Reserve realizes it or not , the United States economy is reeling from a one - two punch of plunging real estate values and a full - blown credit crunch that might not be alleviated with additional rate cuts .
While the Fed might have had a role in creating what has come to be known as the subprime mess , because of the way it has evolved , the Fed 's ability to deal with it is rather limited .
There are a number of reasons for this .
First and foremost is the fact that , on the real estate side , the damage has already been done .
Because short - term interest rates today are well above the 45 - year lows plumbed from the middle of 2003 through mid-2004 , those mortgages with adjustable rates have -- or will -- reset to much higher rates even if the Fed decides to lower rates by a quarter of a point or even more .
As a consequence , there will likely be more delinquencies and foreclosures , which , besides causing pain for those homeowners , will result in more homes on the market , thereby depressing their prices .
In turn , this will affect other homeowners -- even those with fixed rate mortgages and who and are current with their payments .
They will likely be unable to use their homes as ATMs , tapping the equity to supplement their incomes .
They can't turn to savings , either , since , collectively , the nation 's homeowners have been spending more than they have been earning for the past two years .
The last time this happened was at the bottom of the Great Depression .
This alone is why consumers are reducing their outlays on all kinds of goods and services -- luxuries and necessities alike .
Indeed , you know there 's a problem out there when Starbucks SBUX , - 1.47 % reports a decline in traffic in response to -- among other reasons -- a 9 cent hike in the price of a cup of coffee .
Another reason why the Fed alone will not be able to ameliorate this crisis is that its main jurisdiction is over the banks -- and the problem is now centered in the financial markets .
This is because the banks no longer have these loans on their books , having turned them into securities and sold them to others .
In turn , these mortgage - backed securities were used as collateral for the issuance of debt , whose value , as you know , is far lower than originally thought .
This has caused massive write downs by holders of these securities , cutting into their profits -- but , more important , depleting confidence in the financial system .
And this reduction in confidence is spreading beyond the financial markets and residential real estate to commercial real estate as well .
To the extent the banks are involved ( by holding on to some of these securities ) , their capital is being reduced and thus their ability to make new loans .
I need not remind you that the ability to borrow money is the lifeblood of not just business -- but consumers , too .
Not surprisingly , the combination of lower real estate values and reduced availability of funding is beginning to reduce business spending on new plants and equipment .
This is overwhelming the positive effect that the lower - valued dollar is having on our exports .
So while the Fed is preoccupied with communications and forecasting , the financial markets remain frozen while the economy is melting down .
Talk about fiddling while Rome burns .

SANTIAGO .-
More than 4000 motorcyclists gathered today in a long caravan to protest against the so - called " tag " , an electronic billing device , that has become an icon of the discontent caused by the urban highway operators ' intentions of implementing unfair and abusive charges for motorcycles .
Their demands included a tiered pricing scheme for motorcycles , free delivery of the tag , highway emergency services that take motorcycles into account , the use of non-slip road markings and the re-design of impact barriers , currently posing a lethal risk to motorcyclists involved in an accident .
This last point echoes that of mass demonstrations in other countries , such as Spain .
The caravan 's meeting point was the parking lot of the Lider supercenter , at the intersection of the General Velásquez and Américo Vespucio urban highways .
Under police supervision , motorcyclists began their journey going north on Américo Vespucio Norte .
The caravan stopped several times , completely blocking the passage of other vehicles .
Carabineros motorcyclists forcefully freed the left lane in some segments to allow cars and trucks to pass .
Upon reaching the La Pirámide sector , they stopped again , under the curious gaze of the workers constructing the tunnel that will soon cross Cerro San Cristóbal from side to side .
The motorcyclists continued up Autopista Costanera Norte , creating kilometres of backed up traffic in the underground sections .
They then emerged to the surface , passed the Centro Cultural Estación Mapocho , and entered the Autopista Central , headed south .
It was here , near the Toesca exit , that all traffic was completely paralyzed for approximately 25 minutes .
Once the stop was over , they continued South once more , eventually reaching their starting point .

A few years ago , construction and operation rights for new urban highways in Santiago were handed over to a few corporations .
The promise to all was that traffic congestion would be reduced , travel times would be slashed down to mere minutes versus large parts of an hour , and that safety on the road would increase .
Fast forward to the present , and Santiago now sports four new , urban highways : A telepay scheme was crafted , and radiofrequency billing tags were handed out for free to car owners .
Portals were set up along the highway , and users were charged according to the number of portals they crossed , the pricing of each segment , and the time of day .
The highways are indeed a pleasure to drive and ride on .
They have a proper team of emergency services , emergency phones every certain distance , clear markings and ( for the most part ) a good design .
When the concession was granted by the government , no one thought to mention motorcycles .
This is one of those typical oversights that rear their head a few years down the road when someone realises that this oversight is actually potential income .
The highway operators started making noises about charging motorcycles for using the highways .
In the following weeks , a lot of FUD was spouted to eager and unquestioning news reporters about the " illegality " of bikes not paying for using the highways .
Us , we just watched it from a distance .
A few forum posts here and there trying to spurr us to action were met with apathy and a " meh , it 'll blow over , like everything else " attitude .
Well , it did n't .
The operators began testing smaller electronic tags for motorcycle use , all the while repeating the line that " motorcycles must pay the same amount as cars " .
This was the key point : while most of us found the idea of paying for the highways appropriate , it was the amount we were being required to pay that we disagreed with .
First , because not a single driver in Santiago is happy with the pricing scheme used on the autopistas urbanas .
They are extremely expensive , are often the only way to get from point A to point B , a considerable number of citizens cannot avoid them when leaving or returning to their home , and there is no way of entering or leaving Santiago without paying .
This applies to vehicles coming from other cities , who must buy a " day pass " or face stiff fines for not carrying an electronic tag .
On top of that , we were being asked to pay the same as a car , something unheard of in Chile .
The only logic under which it was understandable was that in which milking administrative oversights for your own profits is a priority .
And to add insult to injury , we were being asked to pay for the device .
So what did we do ?
We got mad .
And took to the streets .
A grey , grey day , and air quality indicators nearly off the scale .
This is where we met ( clicky clicky ) .
There were many bikes yet to come .
There was good organization : all bikes were segregated according to style .
Jano and Kary went to get some food in the , so Camilo and I re-decorated his bike .
Everyone had covered their license plates , most using black electrical tape or the very flyers that were being handed out .
This , however , is probably the most original method I saw that day .
This is where we stopped .
It was havoc back there .
The Panamerican Highway was choked off for nearly half an hour .
People looked down from street level , and said hi .
Camilo .
A Goldwing and Casi's 100 cc Hero Honda Passion .
Let us hope this achieves something .

The US is waiting for Pyongyang to account for all its nuclear activities North Korea has pledged to strengthen its " war deterrent " , days after it missed a year - end deadline for declaring its nuclear activities .
The move was a response to US military modernisation and aggression , party daily Rodong Sinmun said .
North Korea has made similar statements before , and the remarks often coincide with differences over the ongoing nuclear disarmament process .
Under a 2007 deal , Pyongyang pledged to go nuclear - free in exchange for aid .
It has already begun the process of disabling its Yongbyon nuclear reactor .
But it failed to produce a full declaration of all its nuclear activities by year - end - and as yet has not explained why .
Scepticism " Our republic will continue to harden its war deterrent further in response to the US stepping up its nuclear war moves , " the daily newspaper said .
FEBRUARY DEAL N Korea to " shut down and seal " Yongbyon reactor , then disable all nuclear facilities
In return , it will be given 1 m tons of heavy fuel oil Under an earlier 2005 deal , N Korea agreed to end nuclear programme and return to non-proliferation treaty N Korea 's demand for a light water reactor to be discussed at an " appropriate time "
Q&A : N Korea stand - off
The phrase " war deterrent " is seen by many as a reference to Pyongyang 's nuclear arsenal .
A second state daily , Minju Joson , linked delays in the disablement process at Yongbyon to slow provision of international aid , echoing comments by an official last week .
" It is fully up to the US and related countries whether the goal of denuclearising the Korean peninsula would be attained or not , " the daily said .
Yongbyon was due to be disabled by the end of this year , but there has been a delay , reportedly due to technical reasons .
However , it is the lack of a written declaration providing a complete account of all Pyongyang 's nuclear activities that is of more concern to the international community .
In particular , the US wants to know how much plutonium has been produced by North Korea , and also see evidence that there is no secret programme for uranium enrichment for weapons purposes .
On Monday , a Chinese spokesman played down concern over the missed deadline , but a US official recently expressed scepticism that a declaration would ever be forthcoming .
US envoy Christopher Hill is due back in the region on Monday in a bid to move negotiations forward .

Video : Romney whisper during debate sets off firestorm David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday January 25 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This UPDATE : MSNBC tells RAW ' audio issues ' behind overheard whisper Did Mitt Romney have someone whispering sweet nothings in his ear about Ronald Reagan 's tax policy during Thursday night 's Republican Debate ?
That 's the question plenty of viewers are asking after the MSNBC broadcast .
Moderator Tim Russert asked Romney if he would " do what Ronald Reagan did in 1983 " to fix Social Security .
Immediately after Russert 's question , someone can be heard whispering , " He raised taxes . "
It 's unclear whether Romney heard the voice , but he quickly answered , " I 'm not going to raise taxes . "
Romney 's campaign did not immediately respond to RAW STORY 's request for clarification on the mysterious voice , but an MSNBC spokesman said " audio issues " were the source of the trouble .
" We had some audio issues and Gov. Romney 's mike was n't working momentarily .
Simple as that , " MSNBC VP for Communications Jeremy Gaines said in a one - line e-mail response to questions about overheard whisper .
The response leaves some questions unanswered , such as , Whose voice did viewers hear , and why did MSNBC apparently scrub a reference to the Whisper from its
Web site ?
RAW STORY has sent a follow up request for this information .
but some bloggers are accusing the former Massachusetts Governor of shenanigans .
" Some have speculated that the whisper is a prompt for Russert to add on the rest of the question , " raised taxes , " to what Russert said about Reagan , but listen to how incredibly fast the whisper comes after Russert finishes his sentence .
Seems mighty fast to have been someone trying to get Russert to finish the question - how does the whisperer know that Russert is done ?
It sounds much more like a prompt for Mitt , " wrote blogger Steward Rhodes .
The incident reminded Rhodes and others of a 2004 debate in which President Bush appeared to have some sort of transmitter or other device underneath his suit jacket .
Commenters on MNSBC's First Read blog also noticed the incident , although the network apparently removed a post referencing the whisper from its
Web site .
RAW STORY enhanced the audio in the following video to make the whisper easier to hear .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad skirted a question about the treatment of homosexuals in Iran on Monday , saying in a speech at a top US university that there were no gays in Iran .
" In Iran we do n't have homosexuals like in your country , " Ahmadinejad said to howls and boos among the Columbia University audience .
" In Iran we do not have this phenomenon , I do n't know who has told you that we have it , " he said .
Ahmadinejad was challenged during his appearance on Amnesty International figures that suggested that 200 people had been executed in Iran so far this year , among them homosexuals .
" Do n't you have capital punishment in the United States ?
You do too .
In Iran there is capital punishment , " he said .

Back in April 2007 , a lawsuit was filed in the US District Court accusing Microsoft of unfairly and incorrectly labeling machines as " Windows Vista Capable . "
The PCs with the small sticker on them ( pictured below ) could indeed run Vista , but they only performed well with the most bare - bones edition : Vista Home Basic .
In other words , there would be no Aero Glass , no Flip3D , no Media Center–no features that Vista was and is widely advertised to offer .
Many customers felt like the company had ripped them off .
Microsoft argued that it provided detailed information on the sticker program and that it was the customers ' fault for not educating themselves before purchasing their new computers .
At a hearing before U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman in Seattle on Friday , lawyers debated whether the lawsuit should be expanded into a class action .
During their presentation , the plaintiffs ' lawyers made much of the fact that some internal Microsoft e-mails voiced the doubts of senior - level Microsoft employees over the program 's viability .
The goal of Microsoft 's campaign was to maintain sales of Windows XP computers during the 2006 holiday shopping season after Windows Vista was delayed to January .
The idea was to reassure customers that the XP machines they were purchasing could run Vista when it came out .
But the company 's marketing campaign also used the phrase " Premium Ready " to indicate when a computer was able to run more than just the Home Basic edition .
Soon after the suit was filed , the company attempted to clarify what exactly it meant by " Windows Vista Capable " and how it differed from " Premium Ready . "
The fact that it had to do this just showed how confusing the whole situation had become , and it was bad enough that even top Microsoft executives apparently got burned .
While the contents of the internal Microsoft e-mails remain sealed , Seattle Post - Intelligencer reporter Joseph Tartakoff attended the hearing and recorded some of them .
Mike Nash , currently a corporate vice president for Windows product management , wrote in an e-mail , " I PERSONALLY got burnt .
...
Are we seeing this from a lot of customers ?
... I now have a $ 2,100 e-mail machine . "
Jim Allchin , then the co-president of Microsoft 's Platforms and Services Division , wrote in another e-mail , " We really botched this .
...
You guys have to do a better job with our customers . "
Microsoft downplayed the quotes .
" The e-mails cited in today 's hearing are isolated , and in many instances , outdated and really just snippets of a broad and thorough review that took place during the development of the Windows Vista Capable program , " a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement .
" Throughout this review , Microsoft employees raised concerns and addressed issues with the aim of making this program better for our partners and more valuable for consumers .
In the end , we believe we achieved both objectives . "
During the presentation , Microsoft 's attorneys argued against granting the case class - action status .
since each customer who bought a " Windows Vista Capable " computer had different information at the time of the purchase .
Plaintiffs ' attorney Jeffrey Thomas countered that all such individuals were united in that " each person in our class did not get what they paid for . "
During his presentation , Stephen Rummage , a lawyer with Davis Wright Tremaine who represented Microsoft , argued that the case did not merit class - action status , citing the uniqueness of the time - of - purchase data of each customer buying a " Windows Vista Capable " PC .
One thing is certain : the choice to have many editions of Vista differentiated sometimes by key features is causing Microsoft quite a bit of trouble .
Had Microsoft enabled or disabled features like Aero Glass based on a machine 's capabilities rather than the version of the OS in use , this suit would have likely been avoided .
U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman is expected to rule on the class - action status in about a week .
The Naked Rambler left by Edinburgh Sheriff Court 's backdoor
Stephen Gough , 48 , was allowed to walk free from court after 20 months in prison for a series of breach of the peace offences related to nudity .
The sheriff said he was giving him the chance to end his " vicious circle " .
He warned Gough he would be re-arrested if he failed to cover up .
He was arrested six steps from the court .
Gough , of Eastleigh in Hampshire , emerged at 1445 GMT wearing just a rucksack and an untidy beard .
The original charges against Gough relate to his naked walk from Land 's End to John O'Groats which began in June 2005 .
Gough completed that trek for the second time in February 2006 .
But the nine months it took him to complete the journey were interrupted by numerous arrests and spells in custody .
' Solitary confinement '
Gough has been in Saughton Prison , Edinburgh , almost without a break of more than a few minutes , since May 2006 after refusing to wear clothes in court when answering charges relating to the naked ramble .
In November last year , Sheriff Kenneth Maciver found Gough guilty of committing a breach of the peace by walking in St Leonard 's Hill in the city without clothes on , after his release from a police station .
Sentence had been deferred for a psychiatric assessment and to give Gough the opportunity to reconsider his position .
When the case was called on Friday , the sheriff was told that Gough was still refusing to dress .
The only person who can bring this to an end is Mr Gough himself
Sheriff Kenneth Maciver
Edinburgh Sheriff Court
Sheriff Maciver said the view of court , including the High Court , was that members of the public should not have to tolerate completely naked persons in full view on public streets .
The sheriff said : " Mr Gough 's position is that he is entitled and has the legal and moral right to be naked in public and the public have no reason to be concerned about his nakedness .
" He takes the view that the courts are wrong " .
Gough , he pointed out , was kept in solitary confinement in prison because he refused to wear clothes .
This was not good for the prison authorities in terms of management and not good for him in terms of his general health , the sheriff said .
' Free choice '
" I am trying to bring this vicious circle to an end " said the sheriff .
" The only person who can bring this to an end is Mr Gough himself .
" He can end this by simply making his own free choice to put on his clothes like the rest of the population and to go home , or to go back to prison . "
Sheriff Maciver deferred sentenced on Gough until 16 April to be of good behaviour and ordained him to appear .
He added : " He will be completely clear of the justice system and free to make the choice about his future . "
If Gough had been in no further trouble at the end of the three month period , Sheriff Maciver said he would deal with the matter without Gough having to come to court , but if he carried on with his conduct of not wearing clothes , he would have to accept the consequences .
Less than two hours later , Gough emerged from the rear of the court building , still naked , to be met by police officers and the press .
He was arrested , and before being placed in a police van , was asked if he had any comment to make .
He said : " You have taken me by surprise .
Where is the freedom ? "

In 1934 , Hermann Goering , then head of the Reich Forestry Office , gave permission for the release of a pair of common American raccoons ( Procyon lotor ) into the German wilderness to enrich the fauna .
It has resulted in today ’s furry blitzkrieg .
Due to the recent discussions here of raccoons in the Yucatan and escaped pet raccoons taking over Japan , I share revelant historical and contemporary highlights from a Deutsche Welle article about “ Nazi ” raccoons .
The link to the complete news item is at the end of this detailed overview of this alien invasion .
They ’re actually American but feel right at home in Kassel , Germany , which has become the European raccoon capital since the animals were introduced here under the Third Reich .
The story begins in 1934 , when a breeder asked the Reich Forestry Office , then led by future top Hitler aide Hermann Göring , for permission to release the masked - faced mammals to “ enrich the local fauna ” outside Kassel , a small city north of Frankfurt .
“ Raccoon pelts were a popular trophy for hunters back then , ” biologist Ulf Hohmann said .
“ They were also raised for their fur at special farms ” after they were imported from North America early last century .
Seventy years on , the furry critters are now as populous in some areas of Germany as in the major urban centers of North America — a whopping one per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) , Hohmann said .
A raccoon ’s urban paradise Somewhere between 100,000 and one million raccoons are estimated to live in Germany , making them prime targets for hunters .
Some 20,000 were shot during the last season , according to official statistics .
But unfortunately for the denizens of a growing number of European capitals , they like cities .
Furry blitzkrieg ?
Hundreds of thousands have fanned out to Belgium , Luxembourg , the Czech Republic and France .
The news caught the ire of Britain ’s Sun tabloid , which warned its readers that “ Nazi raccoons ” were “ just across the Channel ” and “ on the warpath … in a furry blitzkrieg ” .
[ … snip … ]
Since their introduction during the Third Reich , raccoons can trace their gradual conquest of Europe back to two other moments in history .
As Allied bombs rained over Berlin at the end of World War II , one struck a fur breeding farm , giving the raccoons there the opportunity to escape into the wild .
They never looked back .
And in the 1960s , NATO soldiers freed the raccoons they used as mascots after leaving their base in France , setting off a baby boom .

Re : Massive ( 500 ) Internal Server Error.outage started 35 minutes ago Posted by : mmc41nick Posted on : Feb 16 , 2008 2:10 AM in response to : Kathrin@AWS Reply
Thanks for the update .
As to your longer - term plans to handle this , your plan to provide a " service health dashboard " is a particular good idea !!
However to provide a truly excellent service health solution , Amazon need to provide machine - readable management data that we can integrate in our infrastrucure so that we in turn can tell our customers what is going on !
Besides machine - readable info , aws blog - updates , RSS feeds and email notifications of major service health issues is a must !
In addition customers like us need to be able to setup a error page redirect for if EC2 is down ( so that users trying to access a web server hosted on EC2 will get a decent error if your normal EC2 < span style = " font - size : 12pt ; font - family : " Times New Roman " " > infrastructure </ span > is down ) .
BTW : Our company 's biggest complaint is not that your servers where down but that we had to do quite some detective work to find out why ( an error on our own servers ? , a recent code update we did ?
or the amazon aws itself ? ) .
In this case lack of information from Amazon cost us more trouble / money that the actually outage .
It is simply NOT good enough that you require your customers to browse through forum threads to find out what is wrong .
There was NO info you your front page , no email notifications , no updates on your blog .
Before the invention of money ( long long ago , in a galaxy not so far away ) , people used barter in order to get the things they did n't have enough of .
This became quite cumbersome , so they agreed on a representative unit of wealth .
Rather than having to carry around anvils , or fish , or wool whenever you had to buy something , they instead carried around this unit of currency - in many cases , it was gold ( today , it might be dollar s ) .
At some point in the history of banking , this unit of currency was no longer used , but was instead replaced by the writing of paper checks from one bank account to another .
However the gold remained in the bank , even though it was no longer used - this was an attempt to give some legitimacy to the new paper notes being used - the gold standard .
The problem with this idea is that it is similar to the creation of a " dollar standard " - creating a new currency to use , while holding a reserve of dollars in the bank to give the new currency some legitimacy .
The problem is that the commodity held in reserve was merely a unit of exchange and derives its value mainly from its previous use as currency .
The original backing of the currency is lost .
The Sumerians , as part of their development of a standard of weights and measures , placed the royal stamp on each piece of gold to guarantee that it was the same amount as every other similarly stamped gold piece .
They simply agreed that this was worth a bushel of wheat - the value was never in the gold .
For each amount of gold issued by the king , a certain amount of wheat is kept in reserve in order to ensure that gold has some value .
This ensures that the value of the gold with respect to wheat did not change - no inflation .
When the gold is returned to the king , it is redeemed with the wheat that it represented .
This , in effect , is a " wheat standard " .
( Thanks to Gritchka for help . )
These are extracts from a press release by Friends of the Earth .
So what ?
Well it was published on December 11 - I mean to say , December 11 1997 .
The US had just put a wrecking ball through the Kyoto protocol .
George Bush was innocent ; he was busy executing prisoners in Texas .
Its climate negotiators were led by Albert Arnold Gore .
The European Union had asked for greenhouse gas cuts of 15 % by 2010 .
Gore 's team drove them down to 5.2 % by 2012 .
Then the Americans did something worse : they destroyed the whole agreement .
Most of the other governments insisted that the cuts be made at home .
But Gore demanded a series of loopholes big enough to drive a Hummer through .
The rich nations , he said , should be allowed to buy their cuts from other countries .
When he won , the protocol created an exuberant global market in fake emissions cuts .
The western nations could buy " hot air " from the former Soviet Union .
Because the cuts were made against emissions in 1990 , and because industry in that bloc had subsequently collapsed , the former Soviet Union countries would pass well below the bar .
Gore 's scam allowed them to sell the gases they were n't producing to other nations .
He also insisted that rich nations could buy nominal cuts from poor ones .
Entrepreneurs in India and China have made billions by building factories whose primary purpose is to produce greenhouse gases , so that carbon traders in the rich world will pay to clean them up .
The result of this sabotage is that the market for low - carbon technologies has remained moribund .
Without an assured high value for carbon cuts , without any certainty that government policies will be sustained , companies have continued to invest in the safe commercial prospects offered by fossil fuels rather than gamble on a market without an obvious floor .
By ensuring that the rich nations would not make real cuts , Gore also guaranteed that the poor ones scoffed when we asked them to do as we do n't .
When George Bush announced , in 2001 , that he would not ratify the Kyoto protocol , the world cursed and stamped its foot .
But his intransigence affected only the US .
Gore 's team ruined it for everyone .
The destructive power of the American delegation is not the only thing that has n't changed .
After the Kyoto protocol was agreed , the then British environment secretary , John Prescott , announced : " This is a truly historic deal which will help curb the problems of climate change .
For the first time it commits developed countries to make legally binding cuts in their emissions . "
Ten years later , the current environment secretary , Hilary Benn , told us that " this is an historic breakthrough and a huge step forward .
For the first time ever , all the world 's nations have agreed to negotiate on a deal to tackle dangerous climate change . "
Do these people have a chip inserted ?
In both cases , the US demanded terms that appeared impossible for the other nations to accept .
Before Kyoto , the other negotiators flatly rejected Gore 's proposals for emissions trading .
So his team threatened to sink the talks .
The other nations capitulated , but the US still held out on technicalities until the very last moment , when it suddenly appeared to concede .
In 1997 and in 2007 it got the best of both worlds : it wrecked the treaty and was praised for saving it .
Hilary Benn is an idiot .
Our diplomats are suckers .
American negotiators have pulled the same trick twice , and for the second time our governments have fallen for it .
There are still two years to go , but so far the new agreement is even worse than the Kyoto protocol .
It contains no targets and no dates .
A new set of guidelines also agreed at Bali extend and strengthen the worst of Gore 's trading scams , the clean development mechanism .
Benn and the other dupes are cheering and waving their hats as the train leaves the station at last , having failed to notice that it is travelling in the wrong direction .
Although Gore does a better job of governing now he is out of office , he was no George Bush .
He wanted a strong , binding and meaningful protocol , but American politics had made it impossible .
In July 1997 , the Senate had voted 95 - 0 to sink any treaty which failed to treat developing countries in the same way as it treated the rich ones .
Though they knew this was impossible for developing countries to accept , all the Democrats lined up with all the Republicans .
The Clinton administration had proposed a compromise : instead of binding commitments for the developing nations , Gore would demand emissions trading .
But even when he succeeded , he announced that " we will not submit this agreement for ratification [ in the Senate ] until key developing nations participate " .
Clinton could thus avoid an unwinnable war .
So why , regardless of the character of its leaders , does the US act this way ?
Because , like several other modern democracies , it is subject to two great corrupting forces .
I have written before about the role of the corporate media - particularly in the US - in downplaying the threat of climate change and demonising anyone who tries to address it .
I wo n't bore you with it again , except to remark that at 3 pm eastern standard time on Saturday , there were 20 news items on the front page of the Fox News website .
The climate deal came 20th , after " Bikini - wearing stewardesses sell calendar for charity " and " Florida store sells ' Santa Hates You ' T - shirt " .
Let us consider instead the other great source of corruption : campaign finance .
The Senate rejects effective action on climate change because its members are bought and bound by the companies that stand to lose .
When you study the tables showing who gives what to whom , you are struck by two things .
One is the quantity .
Since 1990 , the energy and natural resources sector - mostly coal , oil , gas , logging and agribusiness - has given $ 418 m to federal politicians in the US .
Transport companies have given $ 355 m .
The other is the width : the undiscriminating nature of this munificence .
The big polluters favour the Republicans , but most of them also fund Democrats .
During the 2000 presidential campaign , oil and gas companies lavished money on Bush , but they also gave Gore $ 142,000 , while transport companies gave him $ 347,000 .
The whole US political system is in hock to people who put their profits ahead of the biosphere .
So do n't believe all this nonsense about waiting for the next president to sort it out .
This is a much bigger problem than George Bush .
Yes , he is viscerally opposed to tackling climate change .
But viscera do n't have much to do with it .
Until the American people confront their political funding system , their politicians will keep speaking from the pocket , not the gut .

今日は午後からKDDIの工事が入るので、出かけるのもままならず、家で待機していた。この家を建てた時に加入した東京電力の「TEPCOひかり」は、今ではKDDIに買われてしまっているのだが、このたびその移管作業が正式に行われるらしい。
……と、今日まではそう信じていたんだが、どうも違うっぽいのである。
最初に 「なんか変だな」と感じたのは、あらかじめKDDIから送りつけられてきた荷物を開けてみたときである。中に入っていたやたらと巨大な機器は「ホームゲイトウェイ」というものだと言うのだが、どうみてもNECのブロードバンドルータである。もっともただのルータではなく、電話やTV視聴用セットトップボックスへの出力端子がついている。説明書を読んで理解したところでは、「ひかりone」ではインターネットだけでなく、電話やTVも扱えるそうなので、こういう特殊なルータが必要なのだろう。もっとも我が家はケーブルTV(J-COM)の電話やTVを入れているので、こんなサービスは不要である。
おまけに説明書には、ONU にこのホームゲイトウェイを接続する方法しか書いておらず、普通のルータが使えるのかどうかもわからない。にもかかわらず、WiFiを使うには有料のオプションカードを買わなければいけないという。なにこれ。話にならないじゃん!
そもそも、先月( 2007年12月)14日に、KDDIの営業が直接訪ねてきて、(平日の日中なので)かみさんが対応したときから、なんだか怪しい話だった。営業氏の説明(と、それに対するかみさんの対応など)を列挙すると:
「 TEPCO ひかり 」 が「 ひかりone 」にな る →これはまぁ、わからんでもない。かみさんも会社が替わったことは知っていたので理解。
TEPCO では100 Mbpsの専用回線だったが、oneでは共有回線になる → 「 遅くなるじゃないか」とかみさんはツッコんだそうだが、「そうならないように回線を増強します」と説明されたとのこと。あまり筋の通った話とも思えないが。
電話やTVも使えるようになります →かみさんは、どちらもJ-COMのサービスを使っていて乗り換える気はないと説明。
回線が変わるので、工事が入る。ONUを交換して、「ホームゲイトウェイ」というものを挟んでもらうことになる
「ホームゲイトウェイ」とやらがなんなのか説明なし。既存のルータを置き換える必要も説明なし。
他に選択肢がないかのような口ぶりで、有無を言わさず契約書にサインさせた。
で、今日がその工事日。業者の人(おそらくKDDIの下請けだろう)が来たので、「今使っているWiFi対応ルータがそのまま使えないと困る」と説明したら、ホームゲイトウェイしか使えないのでそれはできないとのこと。それでは話にならないので、とりあえずお引取り願った。たぶん彼らには何の非もないので、申し訳ないことをした。
その後、@nifty ( うちの契約プロバイダ ) に電話して 状況を説明すると、どうも話がかみ合わない。@niftyのオペレータにすれば「( TEPCOから引き継いだ)今の環境で不満がないのに、なんでわざわざひかりoneに乗り換えるのか」とでも言いたそうなんである。
よくよく聞いてみると 、TEPCOひかりのユーザはひかりone
Tシリーズというサービスに自動的に移行しており、これは今までどおり利用できる。工事もホームゲイトウェイもいらない。一方、今回乗り換えることになっているひかりoneは、電話やTVが付加されるが、共有回線になるので工事が必要、と。
「 じゃあ、乗り換えなくていいんですか」と聞いたら、「そうだ」と言う。つまりKDDIの営業は、会社が変わったから回線も切り替えないといけないかのように振舞って、客が望んでもいないサービスへの切り替えを迫ったということである。これじゃまるで詐欺だ 。
だまされたっぽいことが判明したので、@niftyにはその場で契約変更のキャンセルを申し入れ、受理された。もしホームゲイトウェイにWiFiカードが付属していたら、このことに気づかないまま条件の悪いサービスを受け入れさせられるところだったぜ。
その後、KDDIのサポートに電話して、どういうことかちゃんと説明しろと迫った。←いまここ。
この記事 が 「(1)」になっているのは、連休明けに営業氏から言い訳の電話を入れるように要請したからである。今日の話は、基本的にかみさんからの一方的な情報しかないのでバランスが悪い。いちおう先方の言い分も聞いておかないとフェアではないので 、火曜に連絡があったら 「 ( 2 ) 」を書くつもり。
WH e-mails missing on key days in court battle over Cheney 's energy task force Nick Juliano
Published : Monday January 21 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Although the Supreme Court eventually sided with the White House in its quest to keep secret the proceedings of Dick Cheney 's energy task force , a new report released this weekend shows some dates on which staff members in the vice president 's office allegedly destroyed internal communications correlate with court decisions regarding the task force .
Historical archives of White House e-mails are missing for at least 473 days of Bush 's presidency .
A report compiled this weekend by a group suing the administration shows Cheney 's underlings apparently deleted their e-mails on days that the courts contradicted their quests to keep internal proceedings private .
On Sept. 11 , 2003 , a federal appeals court rejected the administration 's argument that Cheney 's Energy Task Force documents should remain secret .
The next day , records show there are missing e-mails from Cheney 's office , according to the report from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington .
A few weeks later , the administration took its case to the Supreme Court , repeating its arguments that task force deliberations should remain secret .
On Oct. 1 , 2003 , the day after that argument , and for the next four days e-mails again went missing from Cheney 's office .
The Bush administration prevailed in the end and the courts upheld its claims to secrecy in a lawsuit that was brought by conservative watchdog Judicial Watch and the environmental group the Sierra Club .
The Washington Post eventually revealed the extent of the energy industry 's involvement in the task force .
The missing e-mail saga has played out in court in recent months and the House Oversight Committee is set to examine the matter at a hearing next month .
CREW 's report documents several other potentially damning correlations between the days when e-mail went missing and controversial events within the Bush administration .
Among the sixteen days for which email are missing from Vice President Cheney 's office is Sept. 30 , 2003 , the same day the day the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced they were investigating who outed former CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson .
That morning , then - White House counsel Alberto Gonzales ordered the president and the vice president 's staff to " preserve all materials that might be relevant " to an inchoate Justice Department probe .
Cheney 's office also is missing e-mails from Oct. 4 , 2003 , when the Justice Department demanded that the White House turn over " all documents that relate in any way " to the leak of Plame 's identity .
a day that will live in infamy .
The great city of Boston was brought to its knees by the appearance of unexpected L.E.D. placards in places where they did n't belong .
Alert to potential connections between terror and anything a wee bit unusual , stout citizens and government officials alike in the land of the free and the home of the brave peed their metaphoric pants .
The L.E.D. character was described in a CNN report as " a Mooninite , an outer - space delinquent … greeting passersby with an upraised middle finger . "
Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley was quoted in the same piece as saying , " It had a very sinister appearance . "
The horror .
The horror .
A pair of young Bostonians were arrested for perpetrating this dastardly act as hired guns in a guerrilla marketing campaign to promote the upcoming movie , Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie .
The two lads , Peter Berdovsky and Sean Stevens were charged with " placing a hoax device in a way that results in panic , " a felony , and disorderly conduct .
At a news conference , Berdovsky and Stevens refused to talk about the case but expressed a willingness to opine at length on ' 70s hairstyles .
They were not taken up on their generous offer by the gathered media .
Berdovsky , known popularly as Zebbler , has plenty of hair to think about – long dreadlocks down to his waist .
He also has a reputation in Boston — and increasingly around the world — as a popular VJ , video artist , performance artist and painter .
Sentenced to 80 hours community service for his crime , he made the most of it , painting a delightfully trippy mural for Spaulding ( physical ) Rehabilitation Center .
He was also recently voted the # 12 VJ in the world by London - based DJ Magazine and was named Boston 's Best Artist by Improper Bostonian Magazine .
Zebbler also recently appeared in Berkeley , Caliifornia where his surround sound HD projection set was part of the opening reception for RIP .
MIX .
BURN .BAM .PFA at the Pacific Film Archives — an exhibit that " celebrates the cultural and artistic practice of remix .
" Meanwhile , the film that brought down the city , Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie was , undeservedly , a commercial flop .
( Maybe if they 'd shut down more cities , people would have noticed . )
But it is now out on DVD , so do n't wait to discover what happens when Carl gets strapped into the insane - o- flex .
Like the cartoon , the movie is , at times : ridiculous , stupid , hilarious , clever , and – of course – composed of cheesy bad animation .
Rent it .
You can't go wrong .
I interviewed Berdovsky aka Zebbler by email .
Most people who read this will probably just know you as the guy with the long dreads who got caught up in the big Aqua Teen Terrorist scare of 2007 .
Were you in any way prepared to get caught up in anything that absurd ?
Well it depends .
I never expected anyone to freak out over the L.E.D. placards .
However , I recognize people 's perceptions of me .
I behaved in a manner that was consistent with my knowledge of how I am perceived , although there were definitely a few unknowns .
I have never seen a guy with long dreadlocks in a situation like mine .
People 's reactions were pleasantly positive .
On the streets , in airports , stores , events — people who recognize me are generally very positive and curious .
I 've known a couple of people who have wound up in situations with Homeland Security basically around technologies that were not understood .
They found themselves facing a veritable platoon of armed agents and various other types of hostility .
How was your treatment at the hands of law enforcement , homeland security and so forth ?
Did anybody on that team say or do anything particularly bizarre or interesting ?
Yeah , there were lots of interesting statements from them .
My interrogator gave me nothing but carrots to eat .
I cooperated fully — since I had nothing to hide — but at times it was uncanny as to how convincing he was .
He made me want to tell him my deepest secrets — a genuinely weird feeling .
I had to snap out of it a few times .
He promised to give me back all of the mooninites they have confiscated from me .
It was a lie and I knew it as he was saying it .
The biggest surprise was from one of the older state police person .
On the way out of the holding cell where we were held in overnight , there were whispers about us being famous as a result of what happened .
One of the higher - ups came up to me as I was being led away in shackles and said : " My daughter is a huge fan of you .
She watches the show and knows all about what happened .
She was so excited that I get to see you . "
He paused for a second and added : " So ... did you really mean to blow up Boston ? "
I think I just growled with disbelief after that statement and walked out to face the press staking out the holding cell in the bitterly cold morning .
You 're a pretty well known video artist and VJ .
What do you try to do with the medium and tell us about a few high points in your career ?
I am moving more and more in the direction of solo surround sound custom HD video performances .
I have spent several years creating custom psychedelic content in my resolution .
To my mild surprise , it 's starting to be recognized by the fine art community .
I recently performed solo at Berkeley Museum of Art ( California ) as part of their RIP .
MIX .
BURN .BAM .PFA .
There are also talks about performing for the Anchorage Film Festival ( AK ) .
I tend to get physical in my performances .
I am known for wearing costumes and masks during performances and potentially more than other VJs I have been mistaken for DJs during many shows .
Right after graduating from Mass College of Art , I went on a major US tour providing custom video projection performances for Ozric Tentacles .
That was pretty great .
A lot of work ( 25 shows in 30 days all over US ) — but a great introduction to the industry and craft of live performance in big venues .
You also worked recently with Alex Grey , the painter who is much known and admired in psychedelic circles .
How have psychedelics influenced your work ... and do you think your experiences helped you maintain your sense of humor throughout the whole Aqua Teen Terror crisis ?
You guys were pretty gracious and disarming when you went on Fox with Geraldo .
Mmm ... that 's a big question .
Psychedelics were a major part of my inspiration to create art .
As a teen , I read a lot about human psychology and heard about the sensory deprivation experiments , where people are faced with nothing but their inner world .
It inspired me to seek similar experiences .
Probably , it was my desire to seek the unexplained , the otherworldly .
It was a yearning to prove to myself that there 's something outside the box .
I have since learned to differentiate between genuine revelations and delusional mind tricks .
I am not as intensely into mental experimentation these days — instead I 'm trying to recreate a lot of the feelings , concepts and sensations through my art .
A life - changing psychedelic experience is an honest slap in the face with a realization of our own arbitrary position in the universe .
Regular societal roles become unglued .
Personal impulses reveal their egotism .
It did not seem to offer a path to salvation , just a widening of perspective .
One does n't need psychedelics to achieve those kinds of realizations however .
While it helped my sense of humor to a degree — I think ultimately it's my personality that 's responsible for my sensations and behavior during the Aqua Teen Boston Bomb Scare .
When I am faced with an uncontrollable situation , I let go of trying to control what 's beyond reach , and focus on what I can change .
Both Sean and I did n't want this case to intimidate or frighten people .
We were sick of media spinning stories to make them scarier .
So we came up with a way to disarm the media — first with our press conference .
Tell us about your video show , " I Wash My TV in Fear " It was my reaction to seeing so many fear - inducing messages constantly on our TV screens .
Since the news became a business , they realized that fear creates the need to watch .
The TVs at my performance were literally awash in fear .
I recorded a day or two of television news and selected the most frightening messages to create a hyper saturated barrage of FEAR that I then perform live on multiple screens with custom music / edits / animations .
So what did you think of the Aqua Teen movie ?
I thought it was pretty hilarious nonsense but you may disagree .
And do you think it 's weird that all the publicity did n't create any curiosity for the flick ?
I thought it held up strong with a hilarious start and beginning / middle .
But , ultimately I was hoping for a more intelligent ending .
Instead , it all just went to hell .
But so be it — I had a good time .
And it was a little strange that it did n't get that much attention .
I attribute some of it to the execs freaking out and backing off from the promotional opportunity that this event gave them .
Turkish troops have been amassed on the Iraqi border
The lightly - armed soldiers moved up to three kilometres ( 1.9 miles ) inside Iraq , an Iraqi Kurdish official said .
It is believed to be the first major Turkish troop deployment in Iraq since the cabinet backed the move last month to hunt PKK rebels based there .
Separately , Turkish police have held the leader of Turkey 's main Kurdish party for using false documents .
Nurettin Demirtas , the head of the Democratic Society Party ( DTP ) , was detained on Monday evening at Ankara 's airport on his return from Germany .
He is accused of submitting a fake health report to avoid military service , his party said .
The DTP has 20 members of parliament and seeks autonomy for mainly Kurdish south - eastern Turkey .
It denies any links to the rebels from the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) .
' Limited ' operation
A spokesman for the Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga security forces told the BBC that the Turkish troops entered Iraq overnight in an area called Seeda Kan - in the triangle between Iraq , Iran and Turkey
He said it was a mountainous area with very difficult terrain .
Iraqi forces also reported hearing small arms fire from the area .
A senior Iraqi military source told Reuters that the operation appeared to be limited and was unlikely to expand .
The Turkish army accuses PKK rebels of using bases inside Iraq to launch attacks on Turkey .
The Iraqi Kurdish regional authorities condemned the incursion .
" Turkey wants to transfer the problem onto the territory of Iraqi Kurdistan , " said Fouad Hussein , a senior official in the office of Kurdish regional President Massoud Barzani said .
Unnamed Turkish officials later confirmed the raid .
Turkish President Abdullah Gul was quoted by Turkish media as saying the army was doing " what is necessary " .
He declined to give any further details .
Weekend air raids
The troops move came after Turkish warplanes bombed suspected PKK bases in northern Iraq over the weekend .
MOUNTING BORDER TENSION 7
Oct PKK rebels kill 13 Turkish troops near Iraqi border 17 Oct - Turkish MPs allow military operations in Iraq 21 Oct - 12 Turkish troops die in PKK ambush near Iraqi border 30 Nov - Turkish cabinet backs PKK pursuits in Iraq 13 Nov - Turkey shells PKK targets in Iraq , Baghdad says 1 Dec - Turkish army targets rebels in Iraq , inflicting " heavy losses " 16 Dec - Turkish jets bomb PKK targets in Iraq for the first time
Iraqi officials have said bombs hit 10 villages , killing one woman , while the PKK has reported seven deaths .
In October , Turkey 's parliament voted to allow the military to launch operations into Iraq to combat the PKK , which had stepped up attacks in Turkey .
Ankara has massed up to 100,000 troops near the mountainous border with northern Iraq , backed by tanks , artillery and warplanes .
But Iraq and the US have urged Turkey not to carry out its threat .
As many as 3,000 PKK members are believed to be based inside northern Iraq .
Turkey has accused the local Kurdish authorities of supporting them .
Gliese 581 - The " Red Dwarf "
And implications for its " earthlike " planet Gliese 581c
It has been news in the first half of 2007 that a " somewhat earthlike " planet appears to exist in orbit around the star Gliese 581 , at a distance from that star that may favor temperatures suitable for liquid water and life .
UPDATE 1/2/2011 : Since 2007 , additional planets that may have temperatures suitable for liquid water and life have been found to orbit Gliese 581 .
Now , what would life be like there with a " red dwarf " as a sun ?

Photometrics
The " red dwarf " Gliese 581 is widely said to have light output about .002 times that of Earth 's sun .
Keep in mind that Gliese 581's planet C is only 7 % as far from that star as earth is from its sun .
Using inverse square law , illumination at Gliese 581c would be about 41 % as bright as that of sunlight on Earth .
Furthermore , this is based on " visual magnitude " , which is determined with instruments having a spectral response more favorable to shorter wavelengths and less favorable to longer wavelengths than human photopic vision has .
This is reasonable for approximating perceived brightness of stars in the nighttime sky , when human vision relies in significant part on scotopic vision .
However , visual magnitude underestimates the photopic - defined photometrics of stars of color like that of Gliese 581 .
Gliese 581's " photometric sunpower " is more than .002 times that of the sun - more like .0045 .
This is based on the absolute balometric magnitude of each star ( Gliese 581 has .013 times as much " bolometric luminosity " as the sun has ) , and the luminous efficacies of 5780 K ( sun , 92 lumens / watt ) and 3350 K ( Gliese 581 , see below , 32.2 lumens / watt ) blackbody radiators .
As a result , illumination by Gliese 581 at a distance of .07 A.U. is photometrically to human vision about 90 % of that by the sun at 1 A.U. ( earth orbit radius ) .
This is reduced slightly to 84.5 % if the sun 's luminous efficacy is the 98 lumens / watt mentioned by Wikipedia .
UPDATE 1/2/2011 : Although I am basing what I say here on Gliese 581 having a surface temperature of 3350 K , Wikipedia says that star has a higher surface temperature of 3480 +/- 48 K .
Color
Based on interpolation between Barnard 's Star ( spectral class M4 ) and the sun from an assumed logarhythmic relation between effective surface temperature and B - V color index , Gliese 581 has an effective surface temperature of approx .
3350 K .
Keep in mind that the filaments of photographic and projection lamps are typically in the range of 3200 - 3500 K ( updated 11/28/2019 ) .
The color here is not an ember - like reddish color , but somewhat whiter than that of most incandescent lamps .
Even after passing through Earth 's atmosphere , the color of direct starlight from Gliese 581 would be incandescent - like .
The earth 's atmosphere typically shifts direct sunlight from 5780 K to around 4500 K .
This is a " mired shift " of about 50 micro reciprocal degrees .
Although the principle of " mired shift " is only approximate , it predicts 3350 K being shifted by the same atmosphere to 2870 K correlated color temperature .
This is slightly on the whitish side of most incandescent lamps .
UPDATE 1/2/2011 : Even the most extremely small and cool red dwarf stars are now thought to have surface temperature of approx .
2600 K . One example is the star VB 10 .
( Spectral class of VB 10 is mentioned as being M8 , while borderline between " red dwarf " and " brown dwarf " has also been mentioned as M6.5 . )
Even after light of 2600 K color temp .
passes through Earth 's atmosphere , on average its color temperature would be around 2300 K . Most 120V incandescent nightlights of 4 to 7.5 watts achieve around 2300 K .
Then again , Gliese 581 C may have a very different atmosphere , and the color of " direct sunlight " there may be significantly different .
Planet Surface Temperature
One published estimate for average surface temperature of Gliese 581 C is 40 degrees C. I suspect this is for without an atmosphere containing much water vapor , CO2 or other greenhouse gases .
Assuming " 4th root law " applied to Earth , average surface temperature in Kelvin would be Earth 's 288 K times the fourth root of 2.65 , which is 367 K , which works out to 94 degrees C! ( Corrected 11/28/2019 )
Size Appearance of the Star
On the planet Gliese 581 C which is only 7 % as far from its star as the Earth is from its sun , Gliese 581 would appear about 4.8 times as large in the sky of its planet C as the sun appears in Earth 's sky .
( Make that only 4.5 times as large if Gliese 581 has surface temperature of 3480 K. )
Ultraviolet and Blue Light and Photosynthesis Issues - ozone , plant growth , related issues
As things turn out , given Gliese 581 providing 2.65 times as much radiation to its planet C as the Sun provides to Earth :
One set of assumptions :
" Average Daylight " on Earth has a color temperature of 5500 K and the Sun is 5780 K , and the " mired shift " of that is 8.8 " mireds " ( micro reciprocal degrees ) .
Apply the same 8.8 mired shift to 3350 K and so if Gliese 581 C has an Earth - like atmosphere , then " average daylight " there would have a color temperature of about 3250 K .
Red visible light - which chlorophyll utilizes well , and chlorophyll even has a major utilization peak in the " mid-red " region of the spectrum , for both the A and B types of chlorophyll .
Ratio of mid-red to total radiation ( I select 640 nm as a " representative example " ) is about 69 % as great at 3250 K as at 5500 K .
Multiply this by Gliese 581 C getting 2.65 times as much radiation as Earth does , and mid-red irradiation is increased by 83 % .
Blue Visible Light - which chlorophyll utilizes well and has a major utilization peak at , also needed for proper flowering and fruiting of some plants .
Ratio of mid-blue to total radiation ( I select 455 nm as a " representative example " ) for 3250 K is about 26 % of that of 5500 K .
Multiply that by the 2.65 factor of Gliese 581 C getting more radiation than Earth gets , and Gliese 581 C gets about 68 % as much of this wavelength as Earth gets .
Violet Blue - for live coral ! -
I select 430 nm as a " representative wavelength " .
Ratio of radiation content at this wavelength to total radiation is 23 % as great at 3250 K as it is at 5500 K .
Multiply this by the 2.65 ratio of total radiation intensity onto Gliese 581 C to that onto Earth , and the result is that any Earth - like live coral on Gliese 581 C gets about 61 % as much violet - blue light there as such coral would get on Earth ( assuming optically similar atmospheres ) .
Erythemal ultraviolet - which some animals have some need for .
Erythemal UV is longer wavelength UVC , UVB , and shorter wavelength UVA .
This I would represent with 310 nm , a longish UVB wavelength .
Shorter UVB wavelengths and UVC wavelengths are largely blocked by Earth 's ozone layer .
Many reptiles have a need for this .
Humans without intake of dietary Vitamin D or supplements thereof have some need for this .
However , humans tend to do best with exposure to such UV content in sunlight to an extent less than is available in the tropics due to sunburn , skin aging , and skin cancer that erythemal ultraviolet can cause .
Now for intenisty of 310 nm UV radiated towards Gliese 581 planet C , relative to such intensity radiated towards Earth :
Ratio of Gliese 581's content of this to that of the Sun is fairly low , roughly 4 % .
Multiply by the 2.65 ratio of total radiation intensity onto Gliese 581 C to that of earth , and this means 11 % as much intensity of that wavelength on Gliese 581 C as on Earth .
I try again at 320 nm , borderline - barely UVA , longish wavelength erythemal ultraviolet : Gliese 581 C may get 13 - 14 % as much erythemal UV as Earth gets , assuming atmosphere having same filtering effect at this wavelength that Earth 's atmosphere has .
Ozone - producing UV : Here , I see ratio of this wavelength range ( below 200 nm ) to total radiation ( using 5780 and 3350 K as opposed to 5500 and 3250 K for surface - reaching radiation ) to be about .06 % as great at 3350 K as at 5780 K .
If wavelengths a little longer than 200 nm significantly contribute to stratospheric ozone formation , this increases - I suspect this ratio gets to more like .2 % .
Adjust for the 2.65 factor of more radiation at Gliese 581 C than at Earth , and this may mean Gliese 581 C gets about .5-.6 % as much ozone - forming UV in its upper atmosphere as Earth does .
I do n't expect Gliese 581 C to have much of a stratospheric ozone layer .
As for UVC being worse due to lack of an ozone layer : Back to 3250 K vs. 5500 K for analysis at what occurs at the surface , assuming optically similar atmospheres on both planets : Gliese 581 C would have only about 2.1 % as much UVC at its surface as Earth would have without a stratospheric ozone layer , despite total " solar radiation intensity " being 2.65 times as great on Gliese 581 C as on earth .

Congress is on the verge of passing legislation mandating that health plans cover mental health ( MH ) and substance abuse treatment to the same extent that they cover other medical and surgical treatment .
In a study published December 18 on the Health Affairs Web site , researchers say that passage of either the Senate or House version of this legislation would constitute a major improvement over the current 1996 Mental Health Parity Act , which only guaranteed equal annual and lifetime payment limits .
However , the authors also warn that parity legislation could actually reduce access to MH treatment for some patients if it does not facilitate treatment by providers outside insurers ’ networks .
The study finds that , in 2005 , only a minority of mental health providers in the national capital area participated in networks affiliated with the Federal Employees Health Benefit ( FEHB ) program , Medicare , Medicaid , or private insurance coverage .
Only 38 to 49 percent of the area ’s psychiatrists , psychologists , and social workers were members of any network .
Participation in FEHB networks was limited to approximately one - third of clinicians , and only 44 percent of FEHB patients received MH care from network clinicians .
" Our study shows that even in an area relatively rich in mental health resources such as Washington , D.C. , and its surroundings , plan networks are not equipped to meet the full need for mental health treatment , ” said lead author Darrel Regier , executive director of the American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education ( APIRE ) .
“ Maintaining the out - of - network option is essential to ensuring access to treatment . ”
The version of parity legislation passed by the Senate would allow plans to vary the types of mental disorders covered under parity and to drop out - of - network MH coverage altogether if they decide that offering such benefits is not in their best interest , Regier and his colleagues say .
In contrast , the parity bill moving through the House would require plans to cover all mental disorders and to cover out - of - network MH treatment at the same levels as other out - of - network treatment .
Rails Associations are powerful tools , but sometimes they can be a bit over - reaching .
Let ’s examine a hypothetical has_many association and how it would traditionally be managed .
Checking in luggage can incur extra costs
Firms are charging extra fees for items such as luggage check - in adding as much as £ 28 to ticket prices , Which ?
found .
Ryanair said charges were discretionary and largely avoidable , while Easyjet said the consumer group misunderstood the business model of budget airlines .
Ryanair reported passenger numbers up 18 % in December on a year ago , while rival Easyjet saw numbers climb 9.9 % .
However , shares in Easyjet were trading 13 % lower in late afternoon trade at 466 p after its load factor - which denotes the number of seats sold as a proportion of total seats available - fell to 78.9 % in December , down from 81.2 % a year earlier .
Ryanair shares dropped 5 % to 3.88 euros .
Its latest update , released on Friday , had shown its load factor dropping to 79 % in December from 81 % the year before .
Misleading ?
Budget airlines have been increasingly charging for services that in the past have been included in the price of a ticket , Which ? said .
According to Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) rules , airlines must include taxes and other compulsory charges in their headline prices .
" If these costs are genuinely optional then we would not generally object to them being displayed separately , provided they are clear to consumers , " said the OFT .
We think Ryanair 's charge to use its check - in desk is unfair .
You can only avoid it if you do n't check luggage into the hold
Which ?
magazine
But the watchdog said if any of these charges were not optional and airlines advertised flights as " free " ( or used a similar statement ) or implied that consumers did not have to pay any extra charges then " this is likely to be misleading " .
Ryanair was seen to charge the highest extra costs , by adding a £ 4 fee for checking in at the desk instead of online , and £ 20 for checking a bag into the hold .
Priority boarding cost an extra £ 2 per flight - it was only free for passengers who checked in online and had no bags for the hold .
Ryanair said it wanted to encourage passengers to travel with hand luggage only and to check in online .
The survey said overall total extra costs , including credit card charges , could be as much as £ 32 in Ryanair 's case , just under £ 30 for Easyjet and just under £ 25 for BMIbaby .
Monarch Airlines , which in November was the latest firm to start charging for checking in baggage by setting a £ 3.99 fee per item , was seen to charge as much as £ 23.50 on top , while Flybe 's total extras totalled were around £ 23 .
Which ?
said it had spoken to the Air Users Transport Council which said nothing stops airlines from adding extra costs but that it would look into the issue .
" We think Ryanair 's charge to use its check - in desk is unfair .
You can only avoid it if you do n't check luggage into the hold , " Which ? said .
Analyst Howard Wheeldon of BGC partners said " it looks as if the EasyJet trick of attempting to add revenue charging for checked luggage may not have gone down that well " .
He added that if EasyJet needed to raise revenue and it could n't do so " in the conventional competitive way " then it would have to raise ticket prices .
Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI ?
This question is difficult to answer , but here ’s a try :
One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain .
A human brain has about 1015 synapses which operate at about 102 per second implying about 1017 bit ops per second .
A modern computer runs at 109 cycles / second and operates on 102 bits per cycle implying 1011 bits processed per second .
The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude , which can be plausibly surpassed via cluster machines .
For example , the BlueGene / L operates 105 nodes ( one order of magnitude short ) .
It ’s peak recorded performance is about 0.5* 1015 FLOPS which translates to about 1016 bit ops per second , which is nearly 1017 .
There are many criticisms ( both positive and negative ) for this argument .
Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail .
Perhaps an additional 102 is required per neuron .
We may not need to simulate a human brain to achieve AI .
There are certainly many examples where we have been able to design systems that work much better than evolved systems .
The internet can be viewed as a supercluster with 109 or so CPUs , easily satisfying the computational requirements .
Satisfying the computational requirement is not enough — bandwidth and latency requirements must also be satisfied .
These sorts of order - of - magnitude calculations appear sloppy , but they work out a remarkable number of times when tested elsewhere .
I would n’t be surprised to see it work out here .
Even with sufficient harrdware , we are missing a vital ingredient : knowing how to do things .

HOUSTON  Ijeoma
Onye awoke one day last month short of breath , her head pounding .
Her daughter , Ebere Hawkins , drove her 45 minutes from Katy , Texas , to Ben Taub General Hospital , where people without health insurance pay little or nothing for treatment .
Onye , 62 , waited four hours to be seen .
Still , going to the emergency room was faster than getting an appointment .
For that , " you have to wait months , " Hawkins says .
Ben Taub is the hub of the Harris County Hospital District , a network of hospitals and care centers serving the Houston area 's 1.1 million uninsured residents and hundreds of thousands more with little coverage .
Here , the national statistic of 45 million uninsured people is more than a number .
It 's a crisis .
Nationally , more than 15 % are uninsured .
In Texas it 's nearly 24 % , the Census Bureau says , the highest percentage among the states .
Here in Harris County , it 's 30 % , according to state figures , the highest rate among the nation 's top 10 metropolitan areas .
As the Houston area struggles to deal with a rising tide of uninsured , it offers a lesson for the nation :
Let the problem get out of hand — to a point where nearly 1 in 3 people have no coverage — and you wo n't just have a less healthy population .
You 'll have an overwhelmed health care system .
" Texas is the case study for system implosion , " says neurosurgeon Guy Clifton , founder of the Houston - area group Save Our ERs .
The problems here , as elsewhere , are many .
Small employers are dropping health coverage .
Federal and state subsidies do n't make up the difference .
Illegal immigrants represent 21 % of the county 's public caseload , even though they represent only about 6 % of the area 's population .
Compounding the problem , insurers are slashing hospitals ' reimbursement rates , often leading the hospitals to reduce unprofitable services such as emergency rooms .
The huge number of uninsured residents here means that health officials must make tough decisions every day about who gets treated and when .
" Does this mean rationing ?
You bet it does , " says Kenneth Mattox , chief of staff at Ben Taub , the Houston area 's pre-eminent trauma care facility .
Some states are trying to tackle the problem .
The broadest solutions have been advanced in Massachusetts , Vermont and Maine .
California , Illinois and Pennsylvania may not be far behind .
Still more states are trying to insure all children as a first step toward insuring all residents .
In most of those states , proposals range from increasing government subsidies to mandating that either employers offer or consumers buy coverage .
Then there 's Texas , where the insurance crisis has multiple causes : • Small businesses dominate the economy , but only 31 % of those with 50 or fewer employees offer insurance in Texas , compared with 43 % nationally .
As a result , 48 % of Texans are covered by employers , compared with 53 % nationally .
• Income limits to qualify for Medicaid , the federal - state health insurance program for the poor and disabled , are among the lowest in the nation here .
Texas has set a limit of $ 4,822 per year for a family of three , compared with nearly $ 10,000 in Florida , $ 18,000 in California and $ 25,000 in New York .
Texas has no subsidized health insurance program for childless adults ; 19 states and the District of Columbia offer some coverage .
• The state has forfeited more than $ 900 million in federal money under the Children 's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) during the past six years because it would n't put up 28 cents for each 72 cents in federal aid .
Restrictions put in place in 2003 cut about 200,000 children from the program in a state with the highest percentage of uninsured children , nearly twice the national average .
" It 's a horrible scandal , " says Jeffrey Starke , chief of pediatrics at Ben Taub .
State officials say the biggest problem in Texas is a surging population : about 23.5 million in 2006 , up 12.7 % from 2000 , about twice the national growth rate .
Texas ' increase has continued to be fueled by immigrants who cross the nation 's longest border with Mexico .
" We have tremendous population growth , and we have to try to keep up with that , " says Nora Belcher , senior health adviser to Gov. Rick Perry .
The state 's Medicaid program has doubled in cost in 10 years despite its low income limits , Belcher says .
CHIP money was left on the table because the program started late and could not be fully funded during a 2003 budget shortfall .
" Others would call us cheap , " she says .
" We think we 're prudent . "
' This system is broken '
The growth of the nation 's uninsured population has stretched hospital emergency departments to the breaking point .
Nationally , ER visits rose from 93 million to 110 million from 1994 to 2004 , an 18 % jump , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Texas experienced a 33 % increase ; in the Houston area , it was more than 50 % , according to the Texas Hospital Association .
The number of hospital emergency departments dropped by more than 12 % in the USA in the same period .
Emergency rooms here are routinely overcrowded .
" When I came in this morning , there were people waiting from yesterday , " says Kellie Manger , a triage nurse at Ben Taub , on a recent weekday .
About half of the people going to emergency rooms here just need primary care , a percentage that 's similar elsewhere .
" We see lots of patients here who have n't seen a doctor in years , " says Katherine King - Casas , an emergency room physician at Ben Taub .
Packed emergency rooms also are caused by overcrowded hospitals in general .
At Ben Taub , Mattox gets calls from area business leaders and politicians seeking to " sneak in the back door a maid , a nanny . "
Doctors , frustrated by long delays for surgeries , try getting patients admitted to the hospital to move them ahead in line .
" Safety - net facilities were never designed to handle one - third of a population , " says George Masi , Ben Taub 's chief operating officer .
" I do n't think this is unique to Texas .
Something 's got to be done .
This system is broken . "
Crowding leads hospitals to send patients elsewhere .
In the Houston area , hospitals divert patients about 20 % of the time , says Charles Begley of the University of Texas School of Public Health .
Ambulances pile up outside emergency rooms , often waiting an hour or two to get their patients in for treatment .
David Persse , the Houston Fire Department 's medical director , says the area record is six hours .
The situation is so bad that patients have called 911 from one ER to get to another .
Doctors here cite horror stories , such as the patient who died after being diverted by helicopter from a Houston hospital to one in Austin .
" Diversion kills you , " Clifton says .
Long waits , packed corridors
The greatest demand for health care is n't in emergency rooms .
It 's at the clinics and health centers designed to relieve them .
Maria Gutierrez came to Ben Taub 's orthopedics clinic one day last month to have her ankle checked after surgery and to fill some prescriptions .
The visit took 8 ½ hours .
A week later she was back , in a corridor where as many as 350 people with specialty clinic appointments wait for hours .
" Sometimes you do n't want to be in the hospital all day , " she says .
Bartolome Martinez arrived at the Strawberry Health Center in Pasadena , just outside Houston , at 4 one recent morning to be first in line for the few walk - in slots allotted .
The 70 - year - old native of Cuba waited outside until the center opened at 7:30 and was still waiting inside at 9 to have the pain in his side analyzed .
Still , he says , that was better than waiting three months for an appointment .
Joyce Heifner , 54 , discovered the San Jose Clinic , the nation 's oldest charity care clinic , five years ago after struggling for about 15 years with the effects of polio she contracted as a child .
The clinic , booked like all the others , is a 70 - mile drive for her from Livingston , Texas , which has no public hospitals or clinics for the uninsured .
San Jose tries to fill the gap between primary and hospital care with its own specialists , but the wait can take months .
" We have one rheumatologist who comes here , " says Rosanne Popp , a primary care physician .
" There 's not an appointment until next year . "
For the working poor , waiting for treatment means less time on the job .
Angel Martinez , 20 , broke his ankle last month and was taken to a private hospital , which put on a cast and billed him $ 4,500 .
" That 's money that I do n't have , " he says .
He had surgery at Ben Taub and is eager to get his stitches out so he can go back to work as a driver .
" This is the foot I use for the gas and the brakes , " he says .
The large numbers of uninsured and overburdened health care system have consequences :
Studies done during the past 25 years indicate that being uninsured is hazardous to your health .
The uninsured are more likely to have high infant mortality rates .
They are more likely to develop high blood pressure and hypertension .
They are less likely to get treatment for trauma .
They are less likely to receive timely cancer diagnoses .
They are more likely to die from heart attacks .
' They die sooner '
Among the states , Texas has the highest percentage of uninsured adults — 27.6 % — who say they are in poor or fair health , rather than good or excellent health , the American Hospital Association says .
Even when the uninsured see doctors , they often can't afford drugs .
" You prescribe , you send them home , they do n't get well , " says Efrain Garcia , a cardiologist who volunteers at San Jose .
" They die sooner .
They have more complications .
They are more disabled . "
Cora Sylvester , 50 , of La Porte , about 25 miles east of Houston , waited about a year after noticing a lump on her breast because she was poor , uninsured — and busy .
Eventually she came to The Rose , a women 's diagnostic center .
She has since had chemotherapy , surgery and radiation , but her long - term prognosis is questionable .
" It 's always an issue to not have any type of insurance , " she says .
" You feel like you just fell in a hole . "
Faced with the onslaught of uninsured patients , Texas is taking steps to rework some of its policies .
Late last month , the Legislature changed its rules to add more than 127,000 children to the 300,000 now covered by the Children 's Health Insurance Program .
Asset tests were eased , enrollment periods extended and waiting periods eliminated for many clients .
The Legislature also paved the way for a new program that will subsidize insurance for 200,000 adults .
' We make a little dent ' Still , there is nothing being proposed on the scale of Massachusetts ' fledgling program to insure all residents .
" There is not going to be a Massachusetts - mandate , one - size - fits - all solution for Texas .
We 're just too big , " Belcher says .
To do that here , says Camille Miller , president of the Texas Health Institute , would cost $ 6 billion .
In the meantime , Houston 's health care system is doing what it can .
The Harris County Hospital District is educating patients about when to use clinics , not emergency rooms .
The Harris County health care Alliance is trying to develop less costly insurance products , especially for small employers .
" Gateway to Care " navigators help uninsured people find primary or specialty care at area clinics .
" We 're touching thousands of people , but there are a million people without insurance , " says Sandy Steigerwald , patient care coordination manager for Gateway to Care .
An " Ask Your Nurse " program offers phone advice to ease the burden on emergency rooms .
" We make a little dent , " says the nursing program 's Titiana Grossley - Brown .
For all their efforts , Houston - area health officials have been unable to reduce the numbers of uninsured .
" Our problems are horrible and embarrassing , but everybody 's aware of them , " Begley says .
" What we 're struggling with is what can we do about them . "

Directly influencing Swedish authorities to intervene in this specific case , is considered illegal in Sweden ( the term is “ minister rule ” ) .
The letter is signed by several copyright protection organizations , and was sent to the Swedish minister of communications .
Noticeably upset they write : “ We believe that , given the Pirate Bay ’s cult popularity , this is a key opportunity for one country to educate the global internet community about the need for respect of copyright and the importance of intellectual property . ”
Brokep from The Pirate Bay responded to this letter on his blog writing : ” They seem to think that TPB is actually illegal and are very concerned about this !
But I can reassure you , the site is not illegal so there ’s no reason to be alarmed .
It ’s recognized worldwide as legal and helpful for the normal people around the globe that have something to share with each other .
And we all do want to share ! ”
One of the people who signed the letter to the Swedish government is John Kennedy , Chairman of the IFPI .
The IFPI is also fighting with The Pirate Bay over the IFPI.com domain name which the IFPI forgot to renew – and there ’s more .
Last month we revealed a leaked email where the IFPI planned to request confidential information from the Swedish police on an ongoing investigation into The Pirate Bay .

Spender wrote a letter people can send to the Swedish minister of communications to show their support for The Pirate Bay .
A Brussels think - tank has accused the US government of reneging on commitments made to the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) over internet gaming .
Panellists at a trade forum levelled harsh criticism at the US , focusing on a burgeoning trade clash between the US and Europe over internet gaming .
The forum believes that the US could be liable for up to US $ 100 billion in trade concessions to European industries after placing illegal discriminatory trade restrictions on European gaming operators .
The disputed concessions arise from Antigua 's victory earlier this year when the WTO ruled that the US violated its treaty obligations by excluding online Antiguan gaming operators , while allowing domestic operators to offer various forms of online gaming .
Instead of complying with the ruling , the Bush administration withdrew the sizeable gambling industry from its free trade commitments .
As a result , all 151 WTO members are considering seeking compensation for the withdrawal equal to the size of the entire US land - based and online gaming market , estimated at nearly US $ 100 billion .
The European Union , along with India and five other countries , has filed notice that it intends to seek compensation .
" The US decision is a major threat to a rules - based international trading system , " said Nao Matsukata , former director of policy planning for the Office of the US Trade Representative .
" If more countries follow the US lead and do the same thing , the entire WTO system could implode and that would be extremely dangerous for US economic interests and for free trade generally .
" Part of what makes the US such a formidable opponent in international negotiations is its credibility .
That credibility is now at stake for the US government not just in the trade area but in foreign relations generally . "
Lode Van Den Hende , a trade lawyer at Herbert Smith in Brussels , criticised the US for prosecuting foreign online gaming companies while letting domestic online gaming interests operate with impunity .
" This is absolute discrimination against foreign operators that the WTO has found to be illegal , " he said .
" It is exactly the kind of practice that the WTO was set up to eliminate , and now the US is violating this very basic principle that it fought hard to put in place at the inception of the organisation . "

BBC News , eastern DR Congo
Pakistan is the biggest contributor to the UN peacekeeping effort
These militia groups were guilty of some of the worst human rights abuses during the Democratic Republic of Congo 's long civil war .
The trading went on in 2005 .
A UN investigative team sent to gather evidence was obstructed and threatened .
The team 's report was buried by the UN itself to " avoid political fallout " .
These events took place in and around the mining town of Mongbwalu , in north - eastern Democratic Republic of Congo .
The Pakistani battalion of the UN peacekeeping mission deployed there two years ago and helped bring peace to an area that had previously seen bitter fighting between the Lendu and Hema ethnic groups .
Locals welcomed them , but the lure of the rich alluvial gold mines proved too much to resist for some , recalls the head of the miners ' association , Liki Likambo .
" I saw a UN Pakistani soldier who came to buy gold from one of the gold negotiators here in Mongbwalu .
I was there in the shop .
I saw it with my own eyes . "
Deals
Soon the Pakistani officers were doing deals directly with the FNI militia .
The gold from mines run by militias went to Pakistani peacekeepers
Evarista Anjasubu - a local businessman said he had known of transactions between Pakistani officers and two of the most notorious militia leaders called Kung Fu and Dragon who controlled the gold mines .
" They were already friends .
I knew well .
It was gold that was the basis of their friendship .
So the gold extracted from the mines went directly to the Pakistanis .
They used to meet in the UN camp in Mongbwalu , in a thatched house . "
As the trade developed the Pakistani officers brought in the Congolese army and then Indian traders from Kenya .
Richard Ndilu , in charge of immigration at Mongbwalu airstrip , became suspicious in late 2005 when an Indian businessman arrived there and went to stay at the camp of the Pakistani peacekeepers .
Scandal
Alerted to this illegal trade by her officials , the District Commissioner of Ituri , Petronille Vaweka , went to Bunia airport to intercept a plane from Mongbwalu .
I was there in the shop .
I saw it with my own eyes
Miners ' association head Liki Likambo
She said her way was blocked by Congolese army officers , who refused to allow her to inspect the cargo .
" I knew they had gold because the price of gold increased when the Indians went to Mongwalu , " she said .
" When we wanted to verify what was inside the plane the pilot refused to allow us to enter the plane - me who was the chief , he refused !
It was a big scandal . "
When the UN was alerted to the allegations of gold trading by Human Rights Watch in late 2005 , they instituted a major investigation by the Office for Internal Oversight Services .
What they uncovered was even more explosive .
Rearming
This is from a witness statement given to the UN by a Congolese officer engaged in the disarming of the militia in the nearby town of Nizi :
The battle for mining concessions has cost countless lives
" The officer expressed his regrets over the malpractices of a Pakistani battalion under the auspices of Major Zanfar .
He revealed the arms surrendered by ex-combatants were secretly returned to them by Major Zanfar thereby compromising the work they had collectively done earlier .
" Repeatedly he saw militia who had been disarmed one day , but the next day would become re-armed again .
The information he could obtain was always the same , that it would be the Pakistani battalion giving arms back to the militia . "
This evidence was backed up by an interpreter working with the Pakistani battalion at Mongbwalu .
On arriving at the Officer 's Mess , the interpreter found two militia leaders - known as Kung Fu and Dragon .
The interpreter said that the first question from Major Ali was to Kung Fu - asking him : ' What about the weapons I gave you ?
What about the weapons Monuc gave you ?'
Stand - off
A UN investigation team arrived in Mongbwalu in August 2006 .
At first the Pakistani battalion there cooperated with them .
But when they attempted to seize a computer with apparently incriminating documents on it a stand - off ensued .
The UN - found weapons were returned to militias in Mongbwalu
The Pakistanis surrounded the UN police accompanying the investigators with barbed wire and put two armoured personnel carriers outside their living quarters at a nearby Christian mission .
Thoroughly intimidated , the investigators were airlifted out of Mongbwalu .
The Pakistani troops are replaced every six months and the BBC investigation concerns events that took place prior to the deployment of the current Pakistani battalion .
When we put the allegations of weapons trading to the head of the UN in Congo , Ambassador William Swing , he denied emphatically that peacekeepers had been rearming the militia .
" This I can categorically deny .
What we have done is just the opposite .
We have demobilised more than 20,000 .
We have taken in caches of arms .
We have destroyed arms .
We have done public burnings of these arms .
And there is absolutely nothing to that allegation . "
He says that the investigation into gold trading has yet to be completed .
A UN official connected with the inquiry told the BBC there seems to have been a plan to bury it , to avoid alienating Pakistan - the largest contributor of troops to the UN .
The UN in New York has refused to explain what took place or why , nearly two years after the allegations first surfaced , the Congolese people have no idea what action - if any - has been taken to discipline the Pakistani soldiers concerned .
Pakistan 's foreign ministry said the UN had informed it of the allegations only on Tuesday , and they would be looked into .

It seems the older I am , the harder time I am having .
I ’m starting to feel like a broken record about this but , I am still REALLY struggling with getting back into ketosis and getting this extra weight off .
I use to think that women in their 50’s and in menopause were just making up another lame excuse and that losing weight could n’t be that much harder for them .
( not that should ever point fingers at excuse making lol I wrote the book on that ) .
I ’m debating whether it is because of my age or because of the fact that I quit smoking in January but it seems like eating a healthy keto diet is just NOT having the same result as it did back in 2015 when I did it the first time .
To be Honest … .
I ’m getting REALLY PISSED OFF AT MYSELF !!

Almost five years on from " Operation Iraqi Freedom , " the neocon dreams of imperial conquest have hit the buffers .
Despite the lies about the " surge " being a great success , Iraq remains in chaos : in the first week of February alone over 200 people have been killed in the violence .
In Afghanistan the situation from the neocons ’ viewpoint , is even worse .
" There is no doubt that armed resistance to foreign occupation is growing and spreading .
NATO forces ’ own figures show that attacks on western and Afghan troops were up by almost a third last year , to more than 9,000 " significant actions , " writes Seumas Milne in the Guardian .
The neocons had another setback late last year when the Joint Intelligence Report stated that there was no evidence that Iran was developing nuclear weapons  thus removing their favored casus belli for military aggression against the Islamic Republic .
Most normal people when faced with defeat and humiliation on such a monumental scale would admit the game is up and make their exit from the political arena .
But neocons , as surely the whole world knows by now , are not normal people .
Five years ago , Donald Rumsfeld arrogantly stated that the US , would , if necessary , go it alone in Iraq and attacked " Old Europe " for its opposition to the illegal war .
But now , the empire builders realize they urgently need European support .
With its own military forces overstretched and its economy heading into recession , the US desperately needs the EU to fall into line , and for European troops to be sent  in their thousands  to die on the front line .
That ’s why Condoleezza Rice spent last week scurrying frantically around Europe ’s capitals .
The opposition of most of the EU to the Iraq war still irks the neocons and they are determined to do all they can to ensure that Europe ’s governments are much more pliant in the future .
The regime change last May in France , in which Jacques Chirac , who had opposed the Iraq war , was replaced by the staunch Atlanticist Nicolas Sarkozy was warmly welcomed in Washington .
And Sarkozy ’s choice of the " liberal interventionist " and Bilderberger Bernard Kouchner as Foreign Minister could not have been more to the neocons ’ liking .
Kouchner was the only prominent member of the French Socialist Party who supported the Iraq war .
Elevation to the grandeur of Quai D’Orsay was n’t a bad reward for being proved wrong .
Already a shift in French foreign policy can be seen , with Sarkozy taking a much more hawkish line on Iran and saying he would like France to return to NATO ’s military command .
Charles De Gaulle must be turning in his grave .
Other recent elections in Europe have also gone the neocons ’ way .
In Poland , the new government of Donald Tusk announced last week that it had agreed to the United States plans to install a missile defense system on Polish territory .
The foreign minister in the Polish government and the man who announced the controversial decision , is Radek Sikorski , a former Executive Director of the " New Atlantic Initiative , " a part of the notoriously neocon American Enterprise Institute .
Sikorski is married to the über neoconservative Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum , who once said that France and Germany would " risk being completely disqualified as serious members of the international community " when Iraq ’s WMDs turned up .
With Sikorski steering Poland ’s foreign policy we can expect the country to play an even more aggressive role in undermining the democratically elected socialist government in neighboring Belarus  a country where the US State Department would love to engineer a regime change .
In his excellent new book The Last Soviet Republic , Stewart Parker chronicles the way Poland , with US backing , has interfered in the domestic political situation in its neighbor .
Back in 2004 , Sikorski himself opened a conference held in the offices of the American Enterprise Institute , entitled " Axis of Evil : Belarus  the Missing Link , " which featured leaders of the Belarusian opposition and various US officials .
Sikorski certainly has n’t wasted time in pleasing his former colleagues in Washington ; in addition to announcing the missile shield agreement , he also said that Poland supported the expansion of NATO to include Georgia and Ukraine .
As welcome as recent developments in France and Poland are to the neocons , what the serial warmongers require most is to have control of the EU itself .
Which is where a certain former British Prime Minister comes in .
The appointment of Tony Blair as President of the European Council , with extended powers in the sphere of defense and trade would be the culmination of the neocon dream : to fully neuter Europe as alternative source of global power .
While the election of Sarkozy has already neutered France , traditionally the main European source of opposition to Pax Americana ; the appointment of Blair as EU President would be the final piece of the jigsaw .
But while Blair ’s appointment would be a dream come true for the Empire builders of the Project for the New American Century , for the rest of the world , it would be a nightmare , making European involvement in US illegal wars of aggression far more likely .
Will the neocons succeed in their aims ?
Whether they do or not depends on us , the people of Europe .
Already a pan-European petition has been launched to stop Blair from being EU President , it can be signed at the Stop Blair website .
Of course , signing petitions on its own wo n’t be enough .
The people of Europe need to wake up to what ’s going on and withdraw their support from any leaders or political parties who favor closer military ties with Washington .
If the US neocons want more wars , let them do what Donald Rumsfeld boasted of five years ago , and fight them on their own .
Europe , " Old " or " New , " should have nothing whatsoever to do with them .

Cigarette - sized unmanned aircraft , utilizing plasma thrusters for power , may sound like something out of the pits of science fiction 's B - rate movie bin to us , but we are n't DARPA .
That 's right the guys at DARPA are actually working with boffins at Oklahoma State University to make the vision a reality .

The technology will rely on a cutting - edge propulsion system , which will be powered by plasma thrusters , eliminating any moving parts .
Check out the above diagram for a basic schematic of what elements will be included in the micro-scaled aircraft .

The energy created will be enough to power micro and nano unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV ) , measuring anywhere between 6 - 12 - inches in length .
It is hoped soldiers will be able to carry a pack of six such vehicles , which could then be thrown up in the air to carry out intelligence collection operations .

Mr Rumsfeld has served on the Hoover Institution 's board
He will join the Hoover Institution as a distinguished visiting fellow .
In an online petition , protesters described the decision as incompatible with Stanford 's ethical values .
Mr Rumsfeld resigned from government in November 2006 after the Democrats won control of Congress amid growing dissatisfaction with the war in Iraq .
He was a key architect of US strategy in its global " war on terror " and in Iraq after the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington .
More than 2,200 people have so far signed the petition , which describes the appointment as " fundamentally incompatible with the ethical values of truthfulness , tolerance , disinterested enquiry , respect for national and international laws and care for the ... lives of others to which Stanford is inalienably committed " .
' Marketplace of ideas '
Mr Rumsfeld will join a task force on ideology and terror , the conservative research centre announced earlier this month .
" I appointed him because he has three decades of experience , of incredible public service , especially in recent years as it relates to this question of ideology and terror , " Hoover director John Raisian told the New York Times newspaper .
The Hoover Institution on War , Revolution and Peace is engaged in the advanced study of politics , economics and international affairs , according to a statement on its website .
It describes itself as a " prominent contributor to the world marketplace of ideas defining a free society " .
Mr Rumsfeld has been involved with the centre since 1989 and has served on its board .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is also a Hoover fellow .
Ms Rice has said she intends to return to Stanford - where she was also the first female and non-white provost - in 2009 .
WASHINGTON  Telecommunications companies won a skirmish in the Senate on Monday as a bill to protect them from lawsuits for cooperating with the Bush administration ’s eavesdropping programs easily overcame a procedural hurdle .
By 76 to 10 , with Democrats divided , the Senate voted to advance the bill for consideration .
A measure to block it , which was led by Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut fell short , as those who wanted the bill to reach the floor got 16 votes more than the 60 needed to achieve that goal .
What happens next is not immediately clear .
A different bill , which would not grant immunity to the companies , was also expected to be introduced by Senator Patrick J. Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee .
And whatever bill emerges from the Senate may have to be reconciled with a House version that does not include immunity .
The measures are meant to renew the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , legislation that has deeply divided the White House and Capitol Hill and members of the House and Senate .
Some action is necessary fairly soon , because the current FISA law expires in February .
CRAWFORD , Texas ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush , faced with growing calls to start withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq , pleaded with Americans on Saturday for patience and cited progress in the past two months .

Bush , faced with growing calls to start withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq , pleaded with Americans on Saturday for patience and cited progress in the past two months .
REUTERS / Jim Young
“ The success of the past couple of months have shown that conditions on the ground can change -- and they are changing , ” he said in his weekly radio address .
“ We can not expect the new strategy we are carrying out to bring success overnight . ”
Bush is facing mounting pressure from Democrats and a senior Republican lawmaker to begin pulling U.S. forces out of Iraq to show the government there that the American commitment is not open - ended .
Earlier this week , Bush drew parallels to the Vietnam War , raising the example of the emergence of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and violence in Vietnam after U.S. troops pulled out to warn of the consequences of leaving Iraq .
But , he acknowledged that despite increasing the number of troops in Iraq to tamp down the unrelenting violence , there was growing frustration that the government had not made much progress on political goals .
Still , Bush argued that young men were signing up for the Iraqi military , police were patrolling the streets and more operations with both U.S. - led troops and Iraqi forces were being conducted .
On Thursday , he suffered a setback when Sen. John Warner of Virginia , an influential congressional voice on military affairs in Bush ’s Republican Party , urged for an initial pullout of 5,000 troops who would be home by December .
Warner declined to back setting a withdrawal timetable but Democrats are expected next month to ratchet up pressure to do just that .
In about three weeks , Congress will receive a pivotal report on the state of war in Iraq by the U.S. commander on the ground in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , and the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , Ryan Crocker , which could trigger a change in Iraq policy .
Democrats argued the failures of the Vietnam War should not be ignored as the United States tries to chart its future course in Iraq but that U.S. soldiers could no longer bear the brunt of the failures by the Iraqi government .
“ We ca n’t expect our soldiers to continue to risk their lives especially when the Iraqi leaders themselves show no interest in achieving a peaceful political solution , ” Max Cleland , a former Democratic senator from Georgia and a Vietnam veteran , said in his party ’s weekly radio address .
Bush on Tuesday will try to build his case further for remaining in Iraq when he speaks to the American Legion annual convention in Reno , Nevada , the second of two such speeches .
“ I will focus on the Middle East and why the rise of a free and democratic Iraq is critical to the future of this vital region and to our Nation ’s security , ” Bush said .

Geeks everywhere got excited recently when they heard that SimpleDB might be based on Erlang .
Why ?
Is Erlang the next big thing ?
Probably not — it ’s a 20 - year - old language that some programmers find weird .
But the model Erlang offers for parallel programming — distributing computing instructions across multiple processors such as are found in multicore computers or clouds of servers linked together — does represent something radically new to many programmers , even though it ’s two decades old .
Parallel programming too difficult and buggy ?
Programming for multiple processing units — also known as concurrent programming or parallel programming — is not easy , especially with programming languages designed mainly for situations in which instructions are executed one at a time , in a predictable order .
Languages like C++ and Java work mainly by using sequential processing .
They have the capability to run multiple pathways of execution at the same time — allowing computer instructions to run in parallel — but in order to do so , they usually use something called “ shared memory . ”
With shared memory , different paths of execution ( called “ threads ” ) access different bits of data at different times .
Your program needs to control access to that data and ensure that no matter what order in which the instructions arrive , the data is in the state you what it to be .
Edward Lee , a professor in UC Berkeley ’s EE / CS department , calls threads harmful , citing the indeterminate results you get with multiple threads reading and writing shared data in parallel .
Indeed , programs using shared memory can be subject to unpredictable bugs .
Erlang dispenses with shared memory
Erlang was created by Ericsson in 1987 to use in the development of fault - tolerant telecom applications running across many processors .
It approaches the problem of program parallelization differently than do C++ or Java or other so - called sequential languages :
It uses very lightweight processes that do n’t share memory but rather pass messages asynchronously .
Asynchronous message passing , as opposed to shared memory usage , removes the possibility of deadlock and race conditions , two bugs that sometimes occur in shared memory parallel programs .
But making an effective and efficient concurrent program still requires plenty of work on the part of a developer and Erlang ’s approach does n’t work for every situation .
Erlang too old and too weird ?
As Sun Distinguished Engineer and Director of Web Technologies Tim Bray has said of Erlang , “ It ’s too weird , and in my brief experiments , the implementation shows its age ; we have in fact learned some things about software since way back then . ”
Another engineer I talked to who ’s used Erlang chose the same adjective , telling me , “ The problem with Erlang is it ’s just too weird .
Too many programmers hate weird . ”
This fall , Bray launched his Wide Finder project , a programming exercise intended to see how Erlang could parallelize the processing of a large text file .
I asked him if his opinion had changed since getting to know Erlang better by way of that project .
He said it largely remains the same , but expressed a wish for Erlang ’s concurrency model — lightweight threads that use message passing instead of shared memory — to be incorporated into his favorite modern languages , such as Java and Ruby .
Erlang may not be entirely suited to general purpose parallel programming projects , even for SimpleDB maker Amazon .
Although Amazon would n’t comment on the technologies they use in SimpleDB , a source close to the company told me that while Erlang was indeed used in the SDS project ( which became SimpleDB ) , the engineers implemented their own inter-process communication instead of using Erlang ’s built - in distributed communications capability .
But even if Erlang is n’t the next big language , it could serve as a concurrent programming game - changer ( as could other languages that offer similar concurrent programming support ) .
By suggesting an alternative to shared memory concurrent programming , it can teach programmers one new way that concurrent programming can be done — even if it ’s two decades old .
Stacey Challoner , 20 , falsely claimed John Mullholland had attacked her in woodland before forcing her into intercourse .
Police later arrested Mr Mullholland , a 27 - year - old married father - of - two and he was given a grilling about the incident .
But officers began investigating Challoner herself after he insisted he had a fling with her and described fully the inside of her house .
Manchester Crown Court heard Challoner of Moorfield Avenue , Denton , had told her long - term boyfriend she had been raped by Mr Mullholland after he suspected she had been cheating on him .
The mother - of - three broke down and confessed she had made up the rape and has since claimed to have produced a child due to the encounter with the victim .
Mr Mullholland later told police he ’d been subjected to a hate campaign and considered killing himself .
He had been referred to as a rapist in the area and locals had spat at him in the street .
He has had to have CCTV fitted and he is considering moving away .
His marriage is now under threat .
Challoner admitted perverting the course of justice .
Passing sentence , Judge Iain Hamilton told Challoner : “ An allegation of rape is one which is very easy to make and can be difficult for anybody who is falsely accused to refute .
“ Rape is a very serious offence and those who are accused of rape are often vilified or shunned by friends or acquaintances within their community .
“ The reason that you made the allegation was to dispel any suspicion that your partner had that you had been unfaithful to him .
The allegation you made is of such seriousness that any person should be put off making such a false allegation .
“ Mr Mullholland is a married man with two children and the facts of the allegation created significant difficulties in his marriage .
“ According to his statement , he even reached a stage where he had considered suicide .
All these consequences came from the lie that you told . ”
Earlier , the prosecutor William Donnelly said the incident occurred in August last year after Challoner ’s boyfriend was freed from jail where he had been serving a sentence for an undisclosed offence .
“ Stacey Challoner says she came under pressure from him when he challenged her about what she might have been doing while he was away .
She says he is a man who has used violence against her and she was in fear of him .
“ On August 17 , a complaint was made to the police about a rape .
That report was not made by her but by her partner .
She says it was made in the course of an argument between them . ”
Challoner gave an hour - long formal statement by video telling of an incident when she went to her friend ’s house and had had rather too much to drink .
Mr Donnelly added : “ She said that she ’d had a full bottle of spirits .
She said that she wanted to go home and took steps to do so .
She went outside her friend ’s house and bumped into the man whom she later accused of rape .
“ She said that this man held her against a tree whilst he raped her .
“ She made it clear that she did n’t want anything to do with him , she hit him and then it stopped .
So she went into detail of where , when and how .
“ She says that after the rape , she pulled her clothes back on .
She told nobody about it and eventually felt pressure from her partner .
“ She says she did n’t expressly tell him that she ’d been raped but he must have assumed that from the distress she was in when she confessed her infidelity to him .
“ There is no question that an act of intercourse did take place between the two of them . ”
Mr Mullholland was asked to attend a police station and he believed it was in connection with a report he had filed saying two men – including Challoner ’s boyfriend – called him a rapist .
“ When he arrived at the police station , it was n’t anything to do with that and he described his shock at being arrested for a complaint of rape and was described as being extremely upset .
He said later on that he could n’t believe what was being alleged .
“ He was interviewed and told them about the intercourse that did happen between them but denies any act of rape .
“ The following day , August 22 , the police began to investigate the allegation further .
The police interviewed the woman whose house Stacey Challoner was at when she had too much to drink .
“ The police then went to see Stacey Challoner .
On August 23 , Stacey Challoner told the police that her complaint of rape was false and there was no truth in it .
In mitigation defence counsel Miss Carolyn Smith said : “ She was in a relationship with a man who is described by her mother as manipulative and a bully .
“ Stacey Challoner has three children and she says that her fourth child is the victim’s .
“ She was very much under the spell of her partner who is a violent man .
When he came out of custody in July of last year , he had suspected that Stacey Challoner had been unfaithful .
“ She admitted that she had had a sexual relationship with Mr Mulholland and they had an argument .
She was seriously injured as a result of that argument and fled to her mother ’s but she went back to him .
“ Having gone back to him , the arguments resumed of her infidelity .
Whenever the incident was brought up , she began to cry so he became suspicious and asked : ‘ Did he force himself on you ? ’ and she accepts that when that question was put she did n’t desist him from that .
“ He called the police despite her asking him not to .
She was too frightened to go back on the situation that she had created .
“ Her three children were taken away from her in November of last year .
She gave birth in November to her fourth child .
“ The defendant is maintaining that the son she gave birth to is Mr Mulholland ’s child .
She says that the only person she had sexual intercourse with whilst her partner was in prison was Mr Mulholland .
“ The other three children are with the paternal grandmother .
The court heard that Stacey Challoner does not now intend to get back with her partner who is the father of her three children .
In another forum I was just talking about a little technique that I came up with for securing a server that I want on the Internet , but to be hard for hackers to get into .
I 've done all the right things with firewalling and shutting down services so that only SSH is available .
But that still leaves port 22 sitting there open for someone to bang on .
So what I wanted was something like port knocking ( for an introduction to that you can read my DDJ article Practical Secure Port Knocking ) .
To avoid doing the classic port knocking where you have to knock the right way to open port 22 I came up with a different scheme which I call Cryptographically and Constantly Changing Port Opening or C3PO .
The server and any SSH client who wish to connect to it share a common secret .
In my case that 's just a long passphrase that we both know .
Both bits of software hash this secret with the current UTC time in minutes ( using SHA256 ) to get 256 bits of random data .
This data changes every minute .
The 256 bits gives me 16 words of random data .
Those 16 words can be interpreted as 16 different port numbers .
Once a minute the server reconfigures iptables to open those 16 ports forwarding one of them ( which corresponds to word [ 0 ] in the hash ) to SSH and the other 15 to a blacklist service .
At any one time 16 ports are open ( i.e. respond to a SYN ) with only one being SSH and the other 15 being a trap to be sprung by an attacker .
The 16 ports change once a minute .
Since both sides can compute the hash the client is able to compute where the SSH server is residing at that moment and contact it .
Once contact is established the connection remains open for the duration of the session .
New sessions , of course , will need to recompute the hash once a minute .
The blacklist service serves to tarpit an attacker .
Any connection attempt to one of the other 15 sockets causes the IP address of the attacker to be blacklisted ( again an iptables change ) which means that hitting any of the 15 ports causes the attacker to shut off their access to the SSH server for the next 15 minutes .
A casual NMAP of my machine gets your IP address blacklisted and shows up a random selection of open ports .
A real user connects to the SSH server first time because they know where it resides .
Of course , this does n't replace making sure that the SSH server is up to date , and that passwords are generated carefully , but it seriously frustrates a potential attacker .
If this is of interest to others I 'd be happy to release my code ( which is currently in Perl ) as a GPL2 project .

In a series of essays I am exploring the sociological reasons that the prosperous democracies with high levels of religiosity – the conservative and creationist USA most of all -- tend to have high levels of social dysfunction .
In the last essay we looked at marriage and divorce .
This time child rearing is the main focus .
Although Americans have a disturbingly high level of divorce – only Swedes split up as fast -- we also have exceptionally high rates of marriage by western standards .
Because in no other prosperous democracy do so many get hitched , more American kids are raised within a standard nuclear family than are those in western Europe , Canada , Australia and Japan .
Yet , as we have seen in my earlier posts , western youth are not suffering unduly relative to their American counterparts .
If anything they are doing better in key respects , including mortality , STD infections , abortion and pregnancy .
Nor are young Europeans prone to murderous violence on the street and in the schools to the same level as are ours .
In youth suicide there is comparatively little difference between 1st world nations .
Why are American children not doing a lot better than their foreign western counterparts ?
Because they are no longer constrained by religious dictates , the citizens of progressive democracies do not feel compelled to marry , so rates of long - term cohabitation and adult out of wedlock childbirth are up to 60 % higher than in America .
But as T. R. Reid noted four years ago in The United States of Europe , rates of parental separation are actually lower on the continent than they are in the USA , where almost half of marriages fail .
The ironic result is that more nonAmerican western children enjoy the benefits of living with both parents for their entire childhood .
As much as Americans claim to be pro-child , in terms of practical assistance the kids and their parents are left pretty on their own .
Guaranteed maternal leave and aid are minimal by western standards .
So much so that American mothers who live in Europe and get used to the high level of support from the government and employers following official regulations , can find returning to the USA to be an unpleasant return to the American reality .
Of the European countries France is perhaps the most child friendly .
The government began to promote child rearing as a means of countering the rise of fecund Germany when the two nations were at odds , and the arrangement has never ended .
French aid to parents includes three year paid parental leave with job protection , subsidized day care until age three and full time preschool after , and monthly child care allowances , all adjusted for income ( this is one reason why fertility rates are nearly as high as in America ) .
Other western nations except ours tend to have generous parental aid programs .
Childhood bullying was long assumed to be a normal part of growing up .
Exactly why harrassment and violence was seen as tolerable when it was between vulnerable kids , while comparable activity between adults was considered out of bounds is not clear .
In any case , as social research piles up the evidence showing that abuse and violence in the formative years is a major contributing factor to the same in teens and adults , western countries have instituted anti-bullying policies that appear to be more successful outside America .
This may be a factor behind the lower levels of lethal school in Europe .
The Bible warns parents not to spare the rod , and the American social and religious right have taken this instruction to heart .
Conservative texts and websites on parenting at length praise the benefits of physical punishment for the tykes if they are to grow up to be God- fearing members of society in good standing .
Heaven knows what they will develop into lacking the occasional whack on the hand or behind .
Social investigations suggest that the violence of corporal punishment instead backfires by contributing to later violence .
America lags behind other advanced nations in suppressing corporal punishment .
Here physical chastisement is practiced in some schools , in some other western countries it is illegal even in the home .
The religious right promotes the Bible as the ideal “ Good Book ” for instructing young Americans on how to be moral citizens .
It is often said that the Bible contains a lot of violence , but few are aware of just how bad the text – which was written by unenlightened Bronze and Iron Age peoples – actually is .
Traditionalists cite the Ten Commandments as the moral code par excellence .
When Moses came down to the Israelites bearing the order to not kill , he immediately followed instructions from above and ordered his troops to kill those who had been worshipping the Golden Calf .
Later Moses follows the creator ’s orders to eliminate entire nations down to the last child .
Psalms 137 indicates that dashing the infants of the enemies of Israel on rocks is a good thing .
In Exodus 21 God fearing slave masters are warned not to beat their slaves to death , but if the slave survives the punishment this is acceptable because the slave is his property .
Jesus in Luke 12 explains that the innocently errant slave should be beaten but not too severely , the deliberately disobedient slave should be thoroughly thrashed , and the egregiously way word slave should be cut to pieces .
In Matthew 10 Jesus says he has not come to bring peace to earth , but the sword , and he arrives at Jerusalem as part of an armed party according to Luke 22 .
The side notes in a conservative Bible explain that his sudden assault upon the temple shows how violence is sometimes necessary as a form of social protest .
Perhaps it follows that the USA is the western nation with the highest level of Bible literalism , and the highest level of murder .
Over in Europe , where homicide rates are at a historical low , the general absence of Bible literacy seems to be doing the population little harm – if not some good .
The same folks who promote the Bible as an ethical guide for young and old alike also denounce Darwin ’s scientific theory as leading to moral decay and societal chaos .
Yet the much higher levels of popular acceptance of evolution in Europe are associated with lower levels of lethal violence and other societal dysfunction .
So much for looking at specific issues and causes .
In the next post we will examine the big picture of why the secular , pro-evolution democracies are enjoying greater social success than the ones that retain high levels belief in a creator being .
It is a fascinating and complex tale that has only recently been revealed through sociological research .

Viking women 's clothing consisted of a single piece of fabric with a train , an opening in front , and clasps that accentuated the breasts .
The apparel is on display at Museum Gustavianum , Uppsala University .
A runway fashion show in Viking times would have spotlighted women cloaked in imported colored - silk gowns adorned with metallic breast coverings and long trains .
This surprising claim is the result of a new analysis of remnants from a woman 's wardrobe discovered in a grave dating back to the 10th century in Russia , painting a picture of Viking panache before Christianity was established that runs counter to previous ideas about buttoned - up , prudish looking Norsewomen .
" Now we can say the pre-Christian dress code was very rich , " textiles researcher Annika Larsson of Uppsala University in Sweden told LiveScience .
" When Christianity came , the dress was more like that of nuns .
There was a big difference . "
The fashion findings go beyond apparel , revealing that the Viking Age from 750 A.D. to 1050 A.D. was not uniform and might even have been sort of sexy .
( The findings here apply to the Swedish Vikings , who mostly traveled east into modern - day Russia and further on to Byzantium and beyond , rather than the Danish / Norwegian Vikings who went westward ) .
" Textile research can tell us more about the state of society than research into traditions .
Old rituals can live on long after society has changed , but when trade routes are cut off , there 's an immediate impact on clothing fashions , " Larsson said .
Larsson discovered a blue silk dress and associated ornaments in a grave in the Russian region of Pskov , close to Novgorod and the eastern trade routes then plied by Vikings from Sweden .
She said the dress was positioned in the grave as a gift likely to be worn in an afterlife .
Until now , anthropological evidence showed a Viking woman wearing an apron on top of a linen robe .
The apron consisted of two rectangular pieces of cloth , in which strings on the back panel attached to the front with brooches .
The outfit was completed with an outer woolen shawl or sweater .
The new finding reveals instead that a Viking woman 's dress consisted of a single piece of fabric with an opening in the front .
A pair of brooches , or clasps , was situated on top of the breasts to accentuate the wearer 's figure .
" It 's easy to imagine that the Christian church had certain reservations about clothing that accentuated the breasts in this way and , what 's more , exposed the under shift in front , " Larsson said .
" It 's also possible that this clothing was associated with pre-Christian rituals and was therefore forbidden " once Christianity became established .
The changes in clothes over time indicate that medieval Christian fashions hit Sweden as early as the late 900s , a time when new trade routes came into use , Larsson said .
Overall , Oriental features in clothing disappeared when Christianity came and the Vikings started to trade with the Christian Byzantine and Western Europe , she said .
Philosophy Strange But True : Public Goods Promote Liberty By Ryan McGreal
Published December 14 , 2007
Libertarians like to argue that public services like universal health care reduce freedom by forcing people to contribute to the program through taxes .
People should be allowed to opt in or out , and in any case , whatever the government can do , markets can do better .
I 've been asked many times to defend the idea of universal public education or universal public health care in the context of individual liberty .
On the face of it , this seems like a tricky proposition .
However , the answer depends on what you mean by ' liberty ' .
The freedom to die , penniless , from an easily treatable disease is no kind of freedom at all .
It seems to me that anyone who would insist liberty can only mean freedom from rather than freedom to in the face of this is either hopelessly dogmatic or else psychopathic .
Reductio ad Absurdum
Anti-government ideology is a reductio ad absurdum .
If my employer refuses to provide a safe workplace , I should n't expect the government to enforce workplace safety standards - I should just find a job somewhere else .
If I do n't have the skills to do another job , I should have gone to school .
If my parents could n't afford to send me to school ( since public school is ' anti- liberty ' ) , maybe someone will volunteer to donate some money so I can go to a charity school .
In any case , my parents were free to work 18 hours a day and skip eating if they thought it was that important for me to get an education .
And hey , if I decide to punch you in the mouth and take your wallet , why should the government be allowed to stop me ?
If you do n't want to be punched , you should get martial arts training or buy a handgun to protect yourself .
It 's clear that a society based on the idea that social services are ' anti- liberty ' would quickly devolve into a barbaric mess of casual violence , warlords and appalling crimes .
Most people who are n't psychopaths recognize that this would be a lousy way to live , so we agree to some enforceable ground rules to make sure our society is reasonably safe and that people have opportunities to educate themselves , take care of themselves and reach their potential .
Results , Not Ideology
At this point , the discussion is no longer based on ideology but on identifiable results .
Of course , it 's important to have principles to follow so we can decide what our goals ought to be .
I favour liberal democracy in a messy world - finding the most effective combination of protecting individual liberties and promoting the public weal .
Note that this is not a straight trade - off between freedom and security .
Acting to promote the public weal ( through universal public education and health care , for example ) can itself protect and enhance individual liberty by giving people more opportunities and more choices than they would otherwise have , so they are not simply free do die penniless of a treatable illness .
If a large majority of people believe a public service should be a basic right - like the right to an education or the right to health care - and they 're prepared to pay for it , then it 's incumbent on the government to establish and defend those basic rights .
That 's democracy - government working for its citizens instead of against its citizens .
Of course , some people will argue that governments cannot do anything right .
In fact , a steadfast belief in this tenet can be self - fulfilling , as we see from looking across the border .
However , the evidence is clear that while markets generally do a good job of promoting allocative efficiency ( allocating capital to where it can generate the most profit ) , government can perform other services very well - in some cases , much better than markets .
Public Goods Promote Liberty
Countries that press their governments to work for their citizens produce a better quality of life by a variety of measures ; higher levels of public approval and support ; less socioeconomic inequality ( and corollary problems with public health and crime ) ; more upward mobility ( the US is about the least economically mobile country in the OECD ) ; more personal choice ; safer , healthier and more vibrant communities ; and more freedom - oriented legal frameworks for personal activities .
Which countries have the most choices for political representation and the most proportionately representative governments ?
Which countries have the highest standards of government accountability and transparency ?
Which countries have balanced government budgets ?
Which countries have the highest rates of postsecondary education ?
Which countries have the highest median incomes ?
Which countries have the longest life expectancies , the lowest mortality rates , the lowest morbidity rates ?
Which countries allow the most personal choice in lifestyles , family arrangements , working arrangements , and so on ?
Which countries have the most liberal social policies ?
Which countries have the lowest rates of crime and incarceration ?
Which countries are the best places to raise a child ?
It 's no coincidence and should come as little surprise that expansive civil liberties tend to go together with treating essential public services like education and health care as inalienable rights .
This affords citizens a baseline level of civility , protection and sheer humaneness to establish and defend more positive , more liberal , and more free societies .
Good for Business
Ultimately , market forces cannot produce the preconditions conditions under which markets function most effectively .
As Robert Kuttner argued forcefully in his book Everything For Sale : The Virtues and Limits of Markets , " The goals , values , habits , and institutions of a good society may include an essentially market economy , but must be set by extra-market processes and forces . "
In fact , trying to redefine public , non-market values in market terms tends to erode them and undermine the basis of commerce .
Perhaps counterintuitively , the elements of a humane society can actually increase overall productivity growth , since well - fed , well - educated , healthy people tend to be better thinkers and workers .
Countries like Switzerland , Finland , and Sweden have managed to do this without stifling profitable investment or producing a ' welfare culture ' of dependency and entitlement .
More locally , Toyota decided in 2005 to build a manufacturing plant in Ontario instead of the southern US , even though the US states offered large tax incentives and subsidies .
Toyota explained that their workers in Ontario are far more productive thanks to Ontario 's public education and health care systems .
That is , workers in Ontario are faster and easier to train , perform better work , and payroll taxes are lower ( though corporate taxes are around the same ) .
This is not a matter of capitalism versus socialism , or freedom versus coercion , or any of the other abstract metaphors used to prevent clear thinking about functioning democracy .
Stripped of ideology , it 's nothing more than people in communities working together where it makes sense to establish a baseline of civility and compassion in which everyone has a chance to enjoy a humane life .

The sighting of a rare penguin has excited researchers near Mawson Huts in Antarctica .
An adult , unpigmented Adelie penguin was photographed near Granholm Hut on Sunday .
Penguins lacking pigmentation are referred to as " leucistic " and do not usually survive until adulthood because they attract predators and do n't breed .
Australian Antarctic Division biologist , Rhonda Pike , says only one penguin with the genetic defect has been detected over a number of breeding seasons in a population of 4,000 Adelies .
" We have a population of tagged birds out there and we 've never tagged any of the leucistic birds , " said Ms Pike .
" So we do n't know if it 's the same one coming back year after year , but yeah , one out of 4,000 . "
In the rare instance an inferior product does slip out of Hollywood , producers have plenty of tricks to convince you to see it anyway .
Here are the five most shameless :
Movie studios rarely worry whether the film they 're producing is " good " or " bad " or " technically pornography . "
There 's only one driving motivation , and if you can't guess what it is , there 's a good chance this is the first time you 've heard of the economic system referred to as capitalism .
5 The Genre Bait & Switch
Sometimes , even movies with expensive stars and famous directors are hard to market .
Maybe the film 's plot can't be explained in eight words or less .
Maybe it 's a bit heavy on " themes " and " character development " and too light on the important things like " low - cut shirts " and " explosions . "

Whatever the case , it 's nothing a little creative trailer editing can't fix .
Jarhead
The Movie : A deliberately - paced meditation on boredom and isolation set during the Gulf War .
Many have described it as " a war movie without the war , " a phrase that ranks up there with " deliberately - paced " and " meditation on boredom " among " Phrases Producers Really Don't Want To Hear . "
Lucky for producers , the trailer puts the damn war back .
The featured battles and shenanigans falsely promise a film somewhere between Saving Private Ryan and Police Academy 8 : Drafted !
Of course , it 's all editing room smoke and mirrors .
Even a shot of Jake Gyllenhall dodging enemy fire at 1:22 turns out , in the film , to be nothing more than stray fireworks .

Sweeney Todd
Some people like musicals .
Some people like incredibly graphic horror films .
However , as the bloody yet melodious Sweeney Todd neared completion , producers made a tragic discovery :
Some creative trailer editing should solve that ...
Another delightfully wacky Johnny Depp character ?
Accents ?
Boats ?
Why , it 's Pirates of the Caribbean for the Hot Topic crowd !
Good Luck Chuck
In this 2007 film , lots of women want to sleep with Dane Cook for some contrived and difficult to explain reason .
The original trailer goes to great lengths to convince you that Dane Cook should be allowed to star in movies .

Producers eventually realized that not only was co-star Jessica Alba an actual celebrity , she was pretty damn easy on the eyes , too .
A new trailer was quickly cut :
Why , Dane Cook is barely in this film !
And the only time we hear him is when he 's uttering grunts of pain while being abused by an underwear - clad Jessica Alba !
To the box office , my good man !

This is not our recommended procedure for inflating a balloon but you can see the balloon is easy to fill , quick to fill �and holds up nicely to the handling .
You can see from the wrinkles in the balloon that it has been used previously , wrapped up , put back into the box and now being used again .
The wrinkles disappear when the balloon is totally inflated .

In exclusive interview , Alabama whistleblower says Rove trying to smear her Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Monday February 25 , 2008

Print This Email This Rove 's attorney says CBS should apologize for story After a CBS affiliate blacked out 60 Minutes in Alabama , Dana Jill Simpson , the Republican attorney from Alabama and a whistleblower in the Don Siegelman case , told RAW STORY Monday that the coordinated smear attack on her credibility by the state 's GOP and the American Spectator publication are being pushed by Karl Rove  the former senior aide to President Bush  in retaliation for her revelations of his role in the investigation and conviction of Don Siegelman .
Siegelman was convicted of corruption charges and sentenced to seven years in prison in 2006 .
A 60 Minutes piece Sunday , as well as several by RAW STORY and Harper 's Magazine , have raised questions about the circumstances of his conviction .
Over the weekend , a series of articles appeared in the Montgomery Independent and the American Spectator attacking both Simpson and Harpers reporter Scott Horton .
Karl Rove , through his attorney , declared that Simpsons allegations are false and the story foolish .
 60 Minutes owes Mr. Rove an apology for circulating this false and foolish story , " Rove attorney 's Robert Luskin said .
Simpson , however , points to the fact she testified to Congress under oath .
Though called to testify , Rove did not show up .
 Mr. Rove was subpoenaed to testify in front a Congressional committee ,  said Simpson this morning during a telephone interview .
 He would not testify .
He did not even appear in front of Congress , which is like not showing up for a court subpoena . 
 I testified under oath in front of Congress , " she added .
" He wont even show up .
Now you tell me who is lying ?
The American Spectator article , " The False and the Absurd , " written by Quin Hillyer , alleges that Ms. Simpsons story has changed .
 On Thursday , the 60 Minutes website began hawking a feature to run on its show this Sunday wherein an already discredited Alabama attorney will claim that Rove asked her to photograph Democratic former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman in " a compromising , sexual position with one of his aides . "
Nothing about her story even begins to stand up to scrutiny ; indeed all of it spectacularly fails every basic test of common sense .
A former Democratic Alabama Supreme Court justice ( and sometime Siegelman adversary ) who represented a co-defendant and close ally of Siegelman's in the trial that convicted Siegelman of federal bribery and obstruction charges said that the previous incarnations of the woman 's oft - changing allegations " must have been created by a drunk fiction writer . "
Hillyer goes on to claim that this is the first time Ms. Simpson has alleged that Karl Rove had directly asked her to be involved in finding dirt on Governor Siegelman .
This allegation , however , is not true .
This reporter was aware months ago of this allegation as was Scott Horton of Harpers who provided his own account of what Simpson told him , also months ago .
In addition , Hillyer cites Toby Roth as a  Republican activist who claims to have never heard of Simpson before .
 For one thing , Simpson consistently has made claims of being a longtime , and fairly high - level , Republican activist in Alabama .
But my Republican sources in Alabama say they either do n't even know her or barely remember her having done some rather low - level volunteer work .
On Friday , longtime activist Toby Roth said of the 2002 campaign ( around which most of her allegations revolve ) : " I was the campaign director [ for now - Gov. Bob Riley , who challenged Siegelman ] .
I did not know her .
Never met the lady . "
His only contact with her , he said , came four years later when she faxed him letters demanding that one of her clients be awarded a state contract to clean up a tire dump .
The contract went to somebody else , and Roth says her bizarre allegations began surfacing only after her client lost the business . 
Earlier this month , this reporter interviewed Republican party members who have known Ms. Simpson for a very long time in Alabama .
Documents regarding business contracts also indicate that Ms. Simpson worked closely with Governor Bob Rileys son , Rob Riley Jr. In addition , the Spectator fails to mention that Mr. Roth is a lobbyist for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and had close business dealings with Michael Scanlon , the lobbyist who has plead guilty to bribery and money laundering charges and Jack Abramoff , also a lobbyist and Mr. Scanlons mentor , who is now serving time also for money laundering and bribery charges .
Both Mr. Scanlon and Mr. Abramoff have admitted to moving Choctaw casino funds into political campaigns .
Alabama GOP launch mass mailings
Yet despite these conflicts of interest , the Alabama GOP - via state representative Mike Hubbard -- issued a series of emails citing the American Spectator article in order to criticize Simpson .
Simpson came forward last year to testify in front of House Judiciary Committee about what she alleges was Karl Roves involvement in the Don Siegelman prosecution .
As reported by Raw Story in the first part of an ongoing investigation into the Don Siegelman case , the Permanent Republican Majority , Simpson testified that she was on a conference call that discussed how Governor Siegelman would be hanged . 
It would take a Riley campaign attorney -- long - time Alabama Republican Dana Jill Simpson -- to finally blow the whistle on the Republican governor .
In a 2007 affidavit and sworn testimony , Simpson stated unequivocally that dirty tricks had sealed her bosss victory in the 2002 election , and she named Karl Rove and the US Department of Justice as conspirators in the case .
Simpson had worked for the Riley campaign in 2002 as an opposition researcher , digging up dirt on then - Governor Siegelman .
According to Simpson 's May 2007 affidavit , Siegelman was pressured to concede the 2002 election because the Riley camp threatened to make public a set of photographs of one of Siegelman 's supporters planting Riley campaign signs at a Ku Klux Klan rally .
Simpson also stated that Canary had indicated that  Karl -- by which she had no doubt he meant Karl Rove -- had taken a personal interest in the matter .
...
In this additional testimony , Simpson described a conference call among Bill Canary , Governor Riley 's son Rob and other Riley campaign aides , which she said took place on November 18 , 2002 -- the same day Don Siegelman conceded the election .
Simpson alleged that Canary had said that  Rove had spoken with the Department of Justice about pursuing 
Siegelman and had also advised Riley 's staff not to worry about Don Siegelman because his girls  would take care of the governor .
The girls  allegedly referenced by Bill Canary were his wife , Leura Canary -- who was appointed by George W. Bush in 2001 as the US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama -- and Alice Martin , another 2001 Bush appointee as the US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama .
Simpson added that she was told by Rob Riley that Judge Mark Fuller was deliberately chosen when the Siegelman case was prosecuted in 2005 , and that Fuller would hang Siegelman . 
Just prior to Simpsons Congressional testimony , her house was burned down and she was once driven off the road in Alabama .
 I dont feel safe ,  Simpson added this morning .
Correction : Due to an editing error , Hillyer was incorrectly identified as a lobbyist in the first edition of this article .
He says he is not affiliated with the National Center for Public Policy Research , which wrote about a conference that he moderated in 2006 .
The Center is not defunct .
Congress ’ approval Wednesday of $ 70 billion more for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan mean the twin conflicts are now more costly to American taxpayers than the war in Vietnam .
According to a study by the Washington - based Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation , Congress has now approved nearly $ 700 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Using inflation - adjusted dollars , the total cost of those wars has now surpassed the total cost of the Vietnam war ( which ran to $ 670 billion ) , " the group ’s Travis Sharp told OneWorld .
" It ’s also more than seven times larger than the Persian Gulf War ( $ 94 billion ) and more than twice the cost of the Korean war ( $ 295 billion ) . "
As a result of Wednesday ’s vote , Sharp said , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will become the second costliest conflict in American history , trailing only World War II .
" But that was a time when 12 million Americans served , as compared with 1.42 million active duty soldiers and just over one million National Guard and reservists today , " Sharp added .
Much of the money approved by Congress will go to buy expensive new military equipment : $ 922 million is earmarked for purchase or alteration of 41 new Blackhawk , Apache , and Chinook Helicopters ; $ 813 million will be spent on new Bradley Fighting Vehicles ; $ 455 million for new Humvees ; $ 427 million on new Heavy Tactical Vehicles ; and $ 425 million for M1 Abrams Tanks .
" I think what you ’re seeing from Democrats is a resignation to the fact that they ’re going to have to wait for the Bush Administration to leave office before they see any serious change in the country ’s war policy , " Sharp said .
" The Democrats just want to play out the clock on this one . "
But " playing out the clock " comes with a severe cost for essential services at home .
Even before the new $ 70 billion dollars was approved Wednesday , the Massachusetts - based National Priorities Project had estimated that the average American household has already spent $ 4,100 on the Iraq war .
This year alone , US taxpayers spent $ 137.6 billion on the Iraq war .
For the same amount of money , the government could have provided more than 39 million people with health care , built one million units of affordable housing , or outfitted 142 million homes with renewable electricity sources .
" We want to help people comprehend the magnitude of these numbers , " said the group ’s Pamela Schwartz .
" Surely , ultimately , we ’d hope that our priorities would shift so that significantly less money is going to war with more money going to programs like heath care , Headstart , and education . "
" We want to help people understand that choices are being made here , " she added .
To that end , the National Priorities Project has set up a web - site , Costofwar.com , where taxpayers can learn what the cost of the Iraq war has meant to their community .
Visitors to the website can search by state , city , or congressional district and find out how much money the Iraq war has taken out of their community and where the money could have gone instead .
For example , taxpayers in Chicago have spent $ 4.8 billion on the war in Iraq  money that could have been used to build 567 new elementary schools or build 35,000 units of affordable housing .
In smaller places like George W. Bush ’s hometown of Crawford , Texas , war spending has also had a strong impact .
Crawford ’s taxpayers have spent $ 1.3 million on the war in Iraq  money that could have been used to provide 180 full scholarships for university students , or hire 30 additional police and sheriff ’s deputies .
" The Democrats were elected last year with a certain set of priorities , but President Bush drew a line in the sand , " Schwartz told OneWorld .
" Rather than drawing their own line , Democrats respected Bush ’s line .
They met President Bush ’s spending limits on domestic programs and gave him a blank check for the Iraq war .
That ’s the choice they made . "

Did you know that nearly half the sugar we bake those heart - shaped cookies with comes not from sugar cane , but sugar beets ?
Additionally , by next year , much of that beet sugar could be from genetically - engineered beets ?
The new beet seed was created by Monsanto to be able to withstand direct application of the herbicide Roundup , which has the active ingredient glyphosate .
The Environmental Protection Agency has enabled Monsanto in releasing the new GE crop by increasing the allowable residue of the herbicide by FIVE THOUSAND percent .
Beets , being a root vegetable , are especially susceptible to retaining chemical residue .
The Center for Food Safety has a petition you can sign that will urge some leading food manufacturers not to use the GE beet sugar .
You can sign the petition and get more information on the issue at their site .
Because sugar , like corn and soy , is a common ingredient in processed foods , it is very likely that consumers will be eating yet another additional genetically - engineered ingredient without any warning or labeling .
The Center for Food Safety and the Sierra Club along with two organic seed groups have also filed a lawsuit to block the USDA approval of the GE sugar beet .
Specific points in the suit state that the wind - pollinated biotech sugar beets will cross-pollinate and contaminate other crops such as conventional sugar beets , organic chard and table beet crop .
Additionally , the GE variety could contribute to the increase of weeds resistant to herbicide , a phenomenon which has been reported on 2.4 million acres of U.S. cropland .

Recently someone asked in the comments to one of my posts why I seem to be down on the WS -* family of technologies ( XSD , WSDL , SOAP , etc ) when just a few years ago I worked on Microsoft ’s implementations of some of these technologies and used to blog about them extensively .
I was composing a response when I stumbled on James Snell ’s notes on the recent QCon conference that captures the spirit of my “ conversion ” if you want to call it that .
He wrote
Those who are familiar with my history with IBM should know that I was once a * major* proponent of the WS -* approach .
I was one of the original members of the IBM Emerging Technologies Toolkit team , I wrote so many articles on the subject during my first year with IBM that I was able to pay a down payment on my house without touching a dime of savings or regular paycheck , and I was involved in most of the internal efforts to design and prototype nearly all of the WS -* specifications .
However , over the last two years I have n’t written a single line of code that has anything to do with WS -*.
The reason for this change is simple : when I was working on WS -* , I never once worked on an application that solved a real business need .
Everything I wrote back then were demos .
Now that I ’m working for IBM ’s WebAhead group , building and supporting applications that are being used by tens of thousands of my fellow IBMers , I have n’t come across a single use case where WS -* would be a suitable fit .
In contrast , during that same period of time , I ’ve implemented no fewer than 10 Atom Publishing Protocol implementations , have helped a number of IBM products implement Atom and Atompub support , published thousands of Atom feeds within the firewall , etc .
In every application we ’re working on , there is an obvious need to apply the fundamental principles of the REST architectural style .
The applications I build today are fundamentally based on HTTP , XML , Atom , JSON and XHTML .
My movement towards embracing building RESTful Web services from being a WS -* advocate is based on my experiences as someone who worked on the fundamental building blocks of these technologies and then as someone who became a user of these technologies when I moved to MSN Windows Live .
The seeds were probably sown when I found myself writing code to convert Microsoft ’s GetTopDownloads
Web service to an RSS feed because the SOAP Web service was more complicated to deal with and less useful than an RSS feed .
Later on I realized that RSS was the quintessential RESTful Web service and just asking people “ How many RSS feeds does Microsoft produce ? ” versus how many SOAP endpoints does Microsoft expose is illuminating in itself .
Since then we ’ve reached a world where thousands of applications being utilized by millions of end users are built on RESTful Web services on the public internet .
My favorite example of the moment is the Facebook developer platform and before that it was Flickr and Amazon S3 .
Compare that with the number of SOAP and WS -* interfaces that are being used to build real developer platforms that benefit end users on the Web today .
Earlier today , I was contemplating Don Box ’s recent post where he complained about the diversity of authentication schemes of various RESTful Web services from the “ J. Random Facebook / Flickr / GData ” services on the Web today .
Don seems to hint that WS - Security / WS - Trust would somehow solve this problem which is rightfully debunked by Sam Ruby who points out that all those technologies do is give you a more complicated version of the extensible authentication story that is available in HTTP .
So the only real issue here is that there are actually enough RESTful Web services on the Internet for Don Box to complain about the diversity that comes from having a flexible authentication model for Web services .
On the other hand , there are so few useful public WS -* Web services on the Web ( read : zero ) that Don Box had n’t encountered the same problem with WS - Security / WS - Trust since no one is actually using them .
At this point I realize I ’m flogging a dead horse .
The folks I know from across the industry who have to build large scale Web services on the Web today at Google , Yahoo ! , Facebook , Windows Live , Amazon , etc are using RESTful Web services .
The only times I encounter someone with good things to say about WS -* is if it is their job to pimp these technologies or they have already “ invested ” in WS -* and want to defend that investment .
At the end of the day , my job is to enable successful developer platforms that enrich our users ’ lives not pimp a particular technology .
So if you are one of my readers and were wondering what was behind my shift from thinking that WS -* related technologies were the cat ’s pajamas and my current RESTful Web services / APP / GData / Web3S bent , now you know .
Enjoy .

Pat Buchanan : Democrats will fall in line with ' popular ' war on Iran David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday August 27 , 2007
Print This Email This Former Congressman Joe Scarborough discussed the possibility of an American attack on Iran with guest Pat Buchanan , an old - line conservative who has often been skeptical of Bush administration policies , on his MSNBC program Monday .
Both men agreed that an attack on Iranian Revolutionary Guard camps was not only likely but would be generally popular with the American people .
Buchanan pointed to recent claims by the US military that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard ( al - Quds ) is the source of explosive devices that are killing American soldiers in Iraq , saying , " They 're laying down a predicate for military strikes on the al - Quds camps inside Iran .
...
And I think then they 'd go for the nuclear sites .
" Buchanan believes that an attack on Iran would be well received by Americans and that the Democratic Party would not offer any meaningful opposition .
" My guess would be that Barack Obama and Miss Hillary and the others would be in a state of paralysis , " he stated , " because it might be a very popular initial move and elements of the Democratic Party would support .
You take Joe Liberman , would cheer his head off . "
" I think if you took polls of the American people , they would put Iran right up at the top of America 's enemies list , " Buchanan continued .
" So I think in the Democratic Party , of course , you 've got the -- with due respect , you 've got the Israeli Lobby and Israel , and you 've got the hardline like Lieberman , and you 've got the Neoconservatives , and you 've got a lot of evangelical Christians and others who think this is a real menace and you ought to hit them . "
Buchanan has often been accused of anti-Semitism , a charge which he denies , and has regularly stated that American involvement in the Middle East has more to do with Israel 's interests than its own .
Blogger Ana Marie Cox , who is cohosting Scarborough 's show this week , objected to Buchanan 's argument , stating , " You said that Americans backed , you know , the invasion of Iraq because they thought Iraq was responsible for 9/11 .
So you 're saying , like , if the president lies to the American people -- again -- then it would be popular ... "
Buchanan replied , " I do n't see politicians in this city standing up and saying , ' That was an outrageous thing to do , Mr. President . ' ...
I think the initial reaction would be ' the president 's the leader and we 're at war . ' "
" That 's the classic script , " insisted Cox .
" I think the Democrats may have learned something ... "
Scarborough broke out in laughter at this , saying , " No , the Democrats have n't learned anything .
...
Their own base is upset because they wo n't stand up to George Bush .
...
They not standing up to Bush on Iraq .
...
They 're afraid to be taking a stand because they do n't want to be seen as weak on defense . "
The following video is from MSNBC's Morning Joe , broadcast on August 27 .
A note about the author :
Rodrigo L. Arcaya is a 36 - year - old Venezuelan who owns a web development company in Caracas .
He is an iconoclastic , anti-authoritarian opponent of excess state power .
The love affair has taken increasingly bad turns .
Now , he is the media .
As the world now knows , Chavez shut down Venezuela ’s respected 53 - year - old TV station RCTV , accusing it of " subversive activities . "
Out in the streets of Caracas , and in many other cities , people have been taking to the street — particularly the high school and college students .
This has caused incredible traffic jams here in Caracas , as the most common form of protest is to close the streets , leaving only one lane for the cars .
Many of the drivers that have been trapped in these traffic jams show their support for the dissenters by keeping their emergency lights on , shouting slogans against the government and even stopping their own cars on the only open lane .
But why are people here so upset ?
Because Chavez is clearly making a play to control the national TV media as a mouthpiece for his government .
He is doing this using a little - known law that resembles the U.S. 's Emergency Broadcast System .
Some background on the relationship between Chavez and the Venezuelan TV media is needed .
In Venezuela , we have four TV channels that have national coverage , and about twelve local ones .
Of the four national channels , we have RCTV ( whose license was just revoked ) , Venevision and Televen , which are privately owned , and VTV , which is owned by the government .
At the local level , the most important is Globovision ( which Chavez is threatening ) , a 24 hour news channel .
It has coverage in all major cities ( it 's pretty spotty in rural areas ) .
It 's also worth mentioning the Asamblea Nacional channel ( think C - Span , owned by the government ) , and TeleSur , a 24 hour news channel that is co-owned by the governments of Venezuela , Brazil , Argentina and other Latin American countries .
We do n’t really have many local cable channels .
Most cable channels are Spanish language versions of U.S. networks ( FOX — the entertainment channel , and MTV .
We also get the U.S. versions of Fox News and CNN in English ) or channels oriented toward Latin America as a whole .
Venezuela has an odd little law that most international analysts do n’t comment on .
But the law plays an important role in this narrative .
It allows the president to order all TV ( including local stations going through cable ) and radio station to transmit the same signal that is being transmitted through the government channel .
The idea is that the president can have a way to talk to all the country in an emergency .
In theory , it is not much different from the U.S. Emergency Broadcast System , but it 's centralized through the presidency .
We call it a “ chain ” — as all the signals are chained to one .
However , the idea is not the same as the application , as we will see in a moment .
Hugo Chavez is truly a Media Phenomenon .
He entered Venezuela 's collective psyche when he led an unsuccessful coup against Carlos Andres Perez in the year ’ 92 , while he was an active officer in the Venezuelan army .
After he was captured , some of his army accomplices did not put down arms , so the government put him on camera to prove that they actually had him in custody .
He was shoved in front of live news cameras , and he said , “ Comrades , I assume all the blame for the failure of our operation .
We have been defeated .
For now ... ” With those words , people fell in love with him .
Not only had he assumed responsibility for his failure ( an uncommon trait among political leaders everywhere ) , but even in his defeat , he had the courage to see a future where he would be victorious .
And if the people fell for him , the private TV channels positively swooned .
The private TV networks were instrumental in getting the idea out that Chavez and his people were not actually traitors to their oath to protect Venezuela .
In fact , they were young idealists who — by following that oath to its last consequence — had to rid Venezuela of its corrupt ruling government .
In that climate , Chavez and his co-conspirators were pardoned by then President Caldera .
The love affair was not surprising .
Since the end of the ’ 80 , most of the private media had turned really critical of the government .
Fueled by this media frenzy , Chavez created his party MVR , and against all prognostics , managed to win the ’ 99 election .
For the first two years , the relationship between private media and Chavez can only be described as a honeymoon .
The happy marriage started to fray when , after having a new constitution approved , Chavez started to demand “ legislative powers . ”
The idea was that the presidency could draft up new laws and get them approved , bypassing congress .
Private media was critical of the move , but Chavez had a convenient way to retaliate .
Every time he wanted to tell his side of the story , he just ordered a “ chain ” and started talking through all the TV and radio channels .
Things quickly became quite surreal .
One time , I was driving to work and turned on the radio .
The only thing I could hear was a “ thump - thump - thump ” noise .
I flipped to the next station , and the next one , and the next one .
" Thump - thump - thump . "
Was my radio broken ?
Had aliens attacked , jamming all the radio waves ?
I got to my office , turned on the TV , and found that the president had decided to “ chain ” a live broadcast about the inauguration of the construction of a tunnel where Chavez worked on a hydraulic hammer for about half an hour .
" Thump - thump - thump .
" This brings to mind the strangeness of the April 11 , 2002 " coup . "
I ’m not even going to try to explain that Gordian knot of surrealism in this dispatch — but let me introduce a few basic facts .
On that morning , quite a few people in Caracas took to the streets ( the numbers range from the Government estimate of 20,000 to over a million claimed by the opposition — judge for yourself from this picture or this one . )
This throng of dissenters had decided to march to Miraflores ( think the White House ) to show the President that they were real .
( You see , Chavez ' government had claimed that there were only a few people at previous protest marches .
They claimed that the TV channels were using special effects and most of the protesters were actually “ virtual people . ” )
The crowd on April 11 got a little out of hand .
In fact , it was a bit of a riot , but the demonstrators were essentially unarmed .
( Venezuela is a bit like Texas , so we have to assume that some folks may have had guns ) .
Just as the march was approaching Miraflores , Chavez “ chained ” the broadcast , and started giving a speech .
He told the people that the situation , which people had been watching on their TVs , had been calmed .
He appealed to the few " misguided people " that were coming to Miraflores to think twice .
At the same time , open warfare had come to the streets of Caracas .
People on both sides were dying .
A group of Chavez supporters that were “ guarding ” Miraflores opened fire on the march .
The police and some people on the march started firing back .
Or , maybe the government narrative was correct and the marchers started shooting the government supporters first .
Either way , el Presidente was on live TV saying everything was under control while , less than 6 blocks away , people were firing guns at other people .
At this point , all the TV stations came to a decision :
They would respect the spirit of the law , and keep the president ’s feed , including the audio .
But they split the screen , so that people could see what was actually going on at the same time .
This is the main reason the government now says that RCTV was behind the coup .
You see , if those images had n’t been broadcast , people would not have started rioting all over the country .
Of course , RCTV , Venevision , Televen and Globovision all did this .
So why did Chavez single out RCTV ?
This one is a no brainer : over the last two years , there has been talk about the end of the concession to RCTV , Televen and Venevision .
And in these last two years , both Televen and Venevision have been letting go of their hard - hitting journalists .
They have stopped reporting things that the government does n't like .
This self - censorship has n't been at all covert .
Everybody here knows .
It is telling that the ratings of Televen and Venevision have dropped , while RCTV ’s ratings climbed to over 40 % .
It is also telling that cable subscriptions have jumped to 60 % in urban areas and is rapidly increasing .
The concessions for Televen and Venevision have been renewed for five years .
And , as everyone now knows , RCTV – Venezuaela 's first network — stopped broadcasting this Sunday , May 27 .
Many naïve , foreign “ Chavistas ” seem to believe that the government “ only ” stopped a concession , and that they did not interfere with a private , independent media company .
That is false .
This is particularly illustrated by what followed .
On Thursday , May 24 , a group of “ concerned citizens ” entered a plea with the Supreme Court .
They claimed that shutting down the RCTV signal was unconstitutional , because RCTV was the channel with the greatest coverage in the country .
The litigants claimed that if their signal was to disappear , a lot of people were going to be left without TV .
The intention of this suit was devious .
On Friday ( less than 24 hours later — it usually takes a year to get a case before the court ) the Supreme Court ruled that , in defense of the citizen ’s rights , RCTV had to give , without payment of any kind , all their broadcast equipment to the new government channel that was to operate in their old frequency .
So the government has a brand new channel .
This is not about a concession .
This is about a Government taking control of a private media company .
They claim they 're doing this to “ increase the free speech in the country . ”
Here 's the logic : before Sunday , we had two strongly critical networks ( RCTV and Globovision , which is local ) , two uncritical but indifferent networks ( Televen and Venevision ) , and one strong Chavez supporter ( VTV ) .
With RCTV out of the picture , the number of strong opposition messages are reduced .
According to government spokespeople , these voices are somehow replaced by something they call community messages : “ Messages produced by The People , for The People ” , as they say .
Thus , of course , there will be more free speech .
( I ’m not making this stuff up .
These are actual arguments used by government spokespeople . ) .
Of course , when you realize that one of the principal party slogans of the government is “ Chavez is The People , ” this message turns even more sinister .
As of today , there are still people who refuse to give up .
They are willing to keep the protest going for as long as it takes to bring RCTV back .
Meanwhile , a YouTube channel , created by the news crew of RCTV , continues to post news content , including footage of protests that no other TV channel here is showing .
It has had more than 71,000 views in just two days — an enormous number when you consider that Internet penetration here is below 15 % .
As of this writing , it is number two on YouTube 's " Channels " listing for new subscribers .
It looks like things will get worse .
The President is talking about shutting down Globovision for — and I swear that I 'm not making this up — " subliminal association . "
His evidence : during a talk show with the head of RCTV last Friday , every time that they cut to commercials they showed a little clip of the most important news events that have been covered by their news department : the first landing on the moon , the return of democracy to Venezuela in 1958 , and so on .
During one of these segments they showed the Pope 's assassination attempt , while playing Ruben Blades song that says , “ Everything comes to an end ” as music background .
The regime claims that they were subliminally inciting people to kill President Chavez .
Yesterday the General Attorney announced that both the General Director of Globovision , and the anchor of the talk show have been summoned to be “ interviewed ” regarding this “ plot ” .
Hugo Chavez is a world - class authoritarian .
Those of us who are anti-authoritarian and who have seen it up close , tend to know more than those beyond our borders , about what he has done and how he has done it in his almost 8 years of government .
It seems that there is a sort of racism underlying some of the sympathies and excuses made by American and European dissidents ( who should know better ) for the Chavez regime .
They imagine that Latin American people are backwards and need an authoritarian government .
In fact , most educated Latin Americans are quite accustomed to free speech and basic human rights .
We do n't really need the paternalism … but thanks anyway .
Of course , this regime is no ordinary Autocracy .
If it were , probably most of the people in Venezuela ( and in the rest of the world ) would have wised up and recognized it as one .
What we are living now down here can only be described as a Surreal Autocracy .
Frankly , I 've kind of enjoyed this government .
Its comedic moves have provided daily amusements .
If I was n’t aware of the really terrible consequences of continuing down this road , I ’d be trying to prop up this regime and find it an agent in the entertainment industry .
If people outside the country really knew what is going on here , they could make an astounding reality show and sell it on pay - per-view .
We have members of the Congress who claim they have discovered that the DirectTV set - top boxes have bi-directional communication capabilities and that they had cameras and microphones that transmit , by satellite , to the central headquarters of the CIA .
( Actually , I guess some American conspiracy freaks would n't find this claim the least bit nutty . )
Then there was the very serious announcement from Chavez about how the government managed to stop a plot to kill the president .
You see , they found this bazooka in an empty lot that lies kind of near the flight path of Venezuela 's biggest commercial airport .
And — ohmygod ! — it 's the very same airport that the presidential plane uses .
They also found a picture of Chavez .
Aha !
This was a plan to hit the presidential plane — the picture of the president was for “ obvious identification purposes . "
No one was ever arrested for this clever and devious plot .
These sorts of things happen here at least on a weekly basis .
Indeed , I 've developed a morbid obsession with the entertainment value of this government .
But now , I think it 's time for a new show .
Suharto ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for three decades
Archive footage
He died at 1310 ( 0610 GMT ) after slipping into a coma , doctors said .
During his 32 - years in power , the economy thrived , but thousands were killed in the provinces of Papua and Aceh and in East Timor invaded in 1975 .
Suharto left office in 1998 amid mass protests over corruption and the human rights abuses , but did not stand trial on health grounds .
No -one has been punished for the killings .
Father of development ?
" Indonesia 's second President Haji Muhammad Suharto has passed away at about 1310 , " senior police officer Major Dicky Sondani told reporters at the Pertamina Hospital in Jakarta .
RISE AND FALL OF SUHARTO Born in Java , June 1921 Comes to power in 1965 after alleged Communist coup attempt Formally replaces Sukarno as president in March 1967 Modernisation programmes in the 70s and 80s raise living standards East Timor invaded in late 1975 Asian economic crisis of the 1990s hits Indonesian economy Spiralling prices and discontent force him to resign in May 1998 Judges rule he is unfit to stand trial for corruption in 2000 Transparency International says he tops the world all - time corruption table in March 2004
Suharto's obituary Suharto's lasting legacy Battle with charges
All six of his children were at the hospital .
Soldiers and police had to force back crowds of Suharto supporters to allow the ambulance with his body to leave the hospital on his way to his home in central Jakarta , before it is taken to Solo in central Java for the funeral .
The government has announced a week of national mourning .
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono led a televised prayer .
" I invite all the people of Indonesia to pray that may the deceased 's good deeds and dedication to the nation be accepted by Allah the almighty , " he said .
" Mr Suharto has done a great service to the nation . "
Suharto was rushed to hospital on 4 January suffering from various heart , lung and kidney problems .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Though there are people who blame him for unemployment and poverty , Suharto was the man who gave Indonesia stability Harley Hart , Jakarta
Although he was accused of embezzling huge sums from state funds during his three decades in power , his lawyers always successfully pleaded that his failing health meant he should not stand trial .
Suharto's rule was marked by rapid economic growth and political stability .
Some Indonesians fondly call him the " father of development " .
But many often found it difficult to pin down what they felt about the man who had towered over their lives for so long , says the BBC 's Jonathan Head .
We ask that if he had any faults , please forgive them
Suharto's daughter
In pictures : Indonesia reacts
They certainly feared him , our correspondent says .
After all , the bloodshed which accompanied his rise to power , after a mysterious coup attempt in 1965 which he blamed on Indonesia 's then - powerful Communist Party , was on a scale matched only in Cambodia in this region , he says .
Within the space of a few months at least half a million people were slaughtered in anti-communist pogroms that , at the very least , Suharto and the military tacitly encouraged says our correspondent .
The trauma of that period scars Indonesia to this day , and was a key tool in Suharto 's armoury .
After his death was announced , Suharto 's eldest daughter , Siti Hariyanti Rukmana , told reporters : " We ask that if he had any faults , please forgive them ... may he be absolved of all his mistakes . "
