The US Securities and Exchange Commission have said it would lift its temporary order banning short selling of financial shares next Thursday .
The SEC said it took the action after the enactment of a $ US700 billion financial rescue package aimed at stabilising fragile markets .
" The Commission 's emergency order that prohibits persons from selling short the securities of financial institutions will expire at 11.59 pm ( eastern time ) on Wednesday , October 8 , 2008 , " the statement said .
On September 19 , the SEC said it took the action in concert with its British counterpart , the Financial Services Authority , which announced a wider ban on short sales .
The move covered 799 financial institutions and was made " to protect the integrity and quality of the securities market and strengthen investor confidence " amid turmoil on world financial markets .

MEMORANDUM

Re : Responding the October 30 , 2009 Huffington Post article by Rep. Anna Eshoo , “ Setting the Record Straight on Our Health Care Legislation ”
Date : November 1 , 2009
Below are some of the key assertions made by Rep.
Eshoo in her recent blog post , followed by our responses to them .
Eshoo : Biotechnology products cost billions of dollars to develop , test and bring to market , and in order to ensure that competitors are n’t immediately allowed to free - ride on the costly safety and efficacy data produced by innovators , some period of ‘ data exclusivity ’ is necessary to allow some period of time to recoup the investment in developing the drug .
The House and Senate health care bills include a data exclusivity period of 12 years , which is the same amount of time that all drugs enjoy on the market under patent protection , which prevents any competition .
I believe the 12 - year data exclusivity period preserves the existing incentives for investment in these life - saving products . ”
And
Without such a ‘ data exclusivity ’ period , there would be no reason to invest in new biologics .
We would see the flow of research funds going to traditional pharmaceuticals , medical devices , semiconductors , green technology or other more promising innovations .
Response :
The brand - name pharmaceutical industry ’s own numbers show that research and development costs for biologics and conventional drugs are comparable , and that about the same amount of time is required .
Eshoo ’s approach would grant 12 - years of market exclusivity to brand - name biologics — an extra 7 years of monopoly protection — more than double the five years conventional drugs receive .
Moreover , the evergreening loopholes in the Eshoo - Barton approach adopted in the House health committee ( which is identical to the Senate health committee ’s adopted approach championed by Sens.
Hatch , Enzi and Hagan ) could make monopoly protection for many products indefinite .
This approach does n’t make sense given the numbers .
Sources for the above :
In its own document , PhRMA ( the brand - name pharmaceutical industry ’s association ) notes that the development costs for biologics ( $ 1.2 billion ) are actually less than for conventional drugs ( $ 1.318 billion ) .
See : http://www.phrma.org/files/PhRMA%202009%20Profile%20FINAL.pdf
Similarly , three studies authored or co-authored by Tufts University economist Henry Grabowski note little difference in development costs and approval times ( 97.7 months and $ 1.2 Billion for biologics vs. 90.3 months and $ 1.3 billion for traditional drugs ) .
One of these studies can be found at : http://www.aei.org/docLib/20070607_GrabowskiWorkingPaper.pdf
Prof .
Grabowski ’s findings are notable because his work is also frequently funded by the brand - name industry .
See the following recent article from Time Magazine , which mentions Prof. Grabowski ’s industry ties .
More importantly , this article discusses how the pharmaceutical industry lobbyists got their way on health care using the Eshoo - Hatch biogenerics proposal as an example :
http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1931595-2,00.html
There are many experts who are concerned about the 12 years of data exclusivity offered to branded biologic drugs by the Eshoo approach .
For example , a June 2009 study by the independent Federal Trade Commission concluded that biologics would be well protected from generic competition even in the absence of data exclusivity .
They recommended these products be given zero years of data exclusivity and indicated that giving biologics any period of exclusivity – but particularly the 12 years that the brand - name industry seeks and that Rep.
Eshoo ’s approach gives them – would in fact likely stifle innovation .
This amount of exclusivity , in the FTC ’s view , would merely encourage firms to tinker with what they have rather than drive them toward “ new inventions to address unmet medical needs . ”
This is contrary to Rep.
Eshoo ’s comment that 12 years of market exclusivity is absolutely necessary to ensure future biologic development .
An October 2009 article in the New England Journal of Medicine argues that biogenerics approach adopted by the Senate and House committees this summer puts so many barriers to generic biologics that the pathway will seldom be used .
http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMp0908496v1
Also note that Patricia Danzon , a Wharton professor who regularly consults for pharmaceutical companies , argues that giving biologics more data exclusivity than conventional drugs could have the undesirable effect of promoting biologic research at the expense of investment into developing more traditional drugs .
“ Having five years of exclusivity for chefdamical drugs and 12 years for … biologics would be very different .
We may be creating a situation where the return on investment is lower for developing chemical drugs compared to biologics and that would be a big mistake . ” ( http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Checking-In-With/Biologics.aspx).
For all of these reasons and more , we believe that data exclusivity for biologics should not exceed the five ( 5 ) years proposed by Rep Waxman ( HR 1427 ) and Sens Schumer , Brown , Collins , Vitter et al ( S. 726 ) , which is the same amount of protection that conventional drugs receive .
Eshoo :
It ’s important to note that today there is absolutely no restriction on data exclusivity — it ’s effectively infinite .
Competitors are never permitted to use the data produced by a brand - name biologic manufacturer .
The Kennedy - Eshoo legislation brings this exclusivity down from forever to 12 years , in essence laying the groundwork for the creation of the biosimilar industry , new competition for the biotechnology industry , and reduced prices for patients .
Response :
It is true that there is currently no pathway to make generic biologics .
However , we need a pathway that will work , not one that will introduce so many barriers that the pathway will seldom be used .
Eshoo :
Let me individually address the patently false statements in Ms. Hamsher ’s post .
“ … thanks to Representatives Anna Eshoo and Joe Barton , there will be no generic versions of these drugs .
At least not for 12 years … ”
The 12 - year data exclusivity period in the Kennedy - Eshoo legislation begins from the time of FDA approval .
Since the vast majority of the most popular biologics treatments were approved at least 12 years ago , this means that they would have virtually no data exclusivity protection .
The important cancer and anemia treatments that millions of patients rely on will be subject to biosimilar competition as quickly as the FDA can process the follow - on manufacturers ’ applications .
( For example , under my amendment Herceptin ’s data exclusivity period will expire in September 2010 . )
Response :
It is true that for older biologics there is the potential for biosimilars to start coming on the market shortly after an FDA approval pathway is adopted .
However , under Rep. Eshoo ’s proposal it will be possible for brand companies to make relatively simple and inexpensive tweaks to the older biologics , and obtain a new 12 - year protection period for the modified product .
Then , based on the experience with conventional drugs , there is very strong reason to believe that brand - name companies will be able to exert their marketing acumen to transition patients ( and doctors ) to the modified product , and away from cheaper , generic versions of the old product .
Indeed , it is quite likely that in many or most cases this prospect will deter generic manufacturers from entering the biogenerics market at all .
This practice is called evergreening .
A classic example of how the evergreening process works involves the acid-reflux drugs Prilosec and Nexium .
With its best - selling Prilosec facing generic competition , AstraZeneca introduced Nexium , a slight chemical variant of Prilosec .
AstraZeneca studies showed the new drug to have the slightest improved performance from Prilosec , not for heartburn , but for “ erosive esophagitis , ” where burped - up stomach acid injures the esophagus .
That slightly improved result enabled the company to launch a full - court press to get consumers to switch from the drug going off patent to the one just coming on .
Nexium sells for about 5 times the price of Prilosec .
Annual revenues for Nexium , on a global basis , top $ 5 billion . [ 1 ]
Troublingly , under Eshoo - Barton and Senate health committee approaches , evergreening will be easier and more effective for biologics than it is for conventional drugs .
First , in many or most cases , generic versions of biologics will not be identical with the brand - name product .
In these cases , the generic product will be treated as “ biosimilar ” and not “ interchangeable , ” and will only be available to a patient upon specific prescription by a doctor .
There will thus be a built - in bias in the system against switching to generic products — and make it easier for the brand - name company to direct patients to their modified , monopoly - protected products .
Secondly , conventional drug evergreening involves efforts to obtain new patent protection .
Patent protection is much less robust than data exclusivity ; this is especially true for patents on modifications to products .
Generic firms are commonly able to challenge successfully or work around modification patents .
By contrast , while the bar for attaining data exclusivity is lower than obtaining patent protection ( which requires a new , useful and non-obvious invention ) , the data monopoly is absolute : it is granted automatically upon FDA marketing approval and is not subject to workarounds .
Moreover , with biologics expected to make up half of all the newly approved drugs in just a few years , we have to be concerned about accessibility to newer and better treatments that will continue to come on the market .
Rep.
Eshoo ’s proposal will give these as yet undeveloped products an unjustified 12 - year marketing monopoly , and , more troublingly , the evergreening loophole will also be available to them .
This means that the Eshoo - Barton and Senate health committee approaches will offer only the illusion of urgently needed price - lowering generic competition for biologics .
These approaches will torpedo the objective of healthcare cost containment so crucial to current healthcare reform efforts , and severely limit patient access to these important and exceptionally high - priced medicines for conditions like cancer , arthritis and diabetes .
This means Medicare and other federal programs will find their budgets increasingly strained by growing biologic drug costs .
Employers will continue to struggle to provide affordable health insurance to their employees .
Americans with insurance will find it even more difficult to pay for their already sky - high prescription drug co-payments .
And the uninsured may have to go without crucial lifesaving biologics .
Eshoo : “ And because of an ‘ evergreening ’ clause that grants drug companies a continued monopoly if they make slight changes to the drug ( like creating a once - a - day dose where the original product was three times per day ) , they will never become generics . ”
“ There is no ‘ evergreening ’ clause in my legislation .
There is in fact an ‘ anti- evergreening ’ clause which explicitly provides no new exclusivity period would be granted for “ a change ( not including a modification to the structure of the biological product ) that results in a new indication , route of administration , dosing schedule , dosage form , delivery system , delivery device , or strength . ”
My amendment prohibits by its plain language exactly what Ms. Hamsher alleges it would encourage . ”
Response :
The short answer is that the language highlighted by Rep .
Eshoo does exactly the opposite of what she says it does : it preserves an evergreening option so long as there is a structural modification made to the biologic , which in the bill is an easy standard to meet .
By contrast , Rep. Waxman and Sen. Schumer ’s bills show what you ’d do if you were trying to avoid evergreening .
The longer rebuttal follows :
The clause Representative Eshoo refers to does appear on its face to exclude changes that result in a new indication , route of administration , dosing schedule , dosage form , delivery system , delivery device , or strength from being eligible for a new 12 - year exclusivity period .
Unfortunately , her understanding of how the language operates is incorrect .
The existence of the language in the bracket “ ( not including a modification to the structure of the biological product ) ” — actually does create a huge evergreening loophole .
If you look closely at the tricky language of the sentence you will see that changes to biologics that result in new indications , routes , dosing schedules , delivery systems , strengths , etc. , are ineligible for another 12 - year exclusivity period under the Eshoo approach only if they come about without a modification to the structure of the product .
In other words , if a company makes a modification to the structure of the already approved biologic that results in a new indication or any of the other items listed , they will be eligible for a brand new 12 - year exclusivity period .
Unfortunately , because the term “ structural modifications ” is not defined , interpretation is open to a very wide range of possible changes that will qualify for a brand new 12 - year monopoly , many of which are relatively simple and inexpensive to do , and which do not change a drug in any material way .
Of course , these modifications may offer small or significant patient benefits .
But because they are typically easy and inexpensive to design , brand - name firms do not need the lure of protracted monopolies to make these minor modifications .
A key example of the types of modifications that would qualify for a new 12 - year monopoly under the Eshoo approach is a process called PEGylaton , which will result in increased safety or a new dosing schedule , route , form , or delivery system .
PEGylating a protein is a relatively inexpensive and easily performed structural modification ( compared to changing the underlying amino acid structure of the biologic ) .
Example : Oncaspar is a PEGylated from of L - asparaginase used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
It is used in patients who are hypersensitive to the un-PEGylated form of L - aparaginase .
The PEGylated product Oncaspar is now is being encouraged by the company for first line use instead of the older , un -PEGylated versions . [ 2 ]
It should also be noted that the Eshoo language does not require a change to the amino acid structure of the biologic — the scientific definition of a truly new medicine — in order to allow a brand product to obtain a new 12 - year monopoly .
For your convenience , I have reproduced below the language of the relevant provision from the Eshoo - Barton - Inslee Biologics Amendment adopted by the House Energy & Commerce Committee in their healthcare reform bill in July 2009 in its entirety .
( Note that this amendment is identical to that which was adopted by the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions committee as part of its healthcare reform bill in July 2009 )
Section 7 ( C ) : Products not eligible for 12 years exclusivity and filing moratorium .
“ 7( A ) and ( B ) shall not apply to a license for or approval of -
i. a supplement for the biological product that is the reference product ; or
ii .
a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product that is the reference product ) or a licensor , predecessor in interest , or other related entity ) for
( I ) a change ( not including a modification to the structure of the biological product ) that results in a new indication , route of administration , dosing schedule , dosage form , delivery system , delivery device , or strength ; or
( II ) a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety , purity or potency . ”
Translation : Subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer are eligible for 12 years market exclusivity and filing moratorium for products that have a structural modification that results in either :
II ) A new indication , route , dosing schedule , form , delivery system , delivery device , or strength ; or
II ) Improved safety , purity , or potency .
Only if the changes that result in the items listed in point I or II are not accompanied by a change to the structural modification are they ineligible for the 12 - year exclusivity period .
As explained above , it will be very easy for brand companies to make simple and inexpensive structural modifications to many biologics that result in new dosage forms , strength , etc .
Thus Eshoo ’s understanding of her own amendment ’s language is incorrect .
Eshoo : I ’m proud to have this legislation endorsed by : The AIDS Institute , ALS Association , Alliance for Aging Research , American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association , Association of American Universities , Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation , former Vermont Governor Howard Dean , M.D. , Immune Deficiency Foundation , the National Alliance on Mental Illness and many other patient advocacy groups .
Response :
The vast majority of non-industry affiliated consumer , health and patient groups who have weighed in on this issue , plus a huge number of businesses , HMO ’s and unions support the approach of Representatives Waxman and Deal and Senators Schumer , Brown , Collins et al , and oppose the approach of Representatives Eshoo , Barton and Inslee and Senators Hatch , Enzi and Hagan .
A long list of consumer , health , patient and industry groups supporting the Waxman - Schumer approach and concerned about the Eshoo - Barton and Enzi-Hatch - Hagan approach ( along with links to a few specific pieces of correspondence and key WebPages ) can be found below .
This list may be incomplete .
It also is worth noting that Eshoo - Hatch approach supporter Dr. Howard Dean has recently worked for BIO ( the Biotechnology Industry Association ) , that the universities represented by the Association of American Universities stand to reap larger royalty payments from the patents they hold on biologic medicines for longer monopoly periods , and that the National Alliance on Mental Illness receives three - quarters of its operating budget from brand - name drug makers , according to a recent New York Times article , available at http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/health/22nami.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=advocacy%20group&st=cse
If you do some research , you will likely find that many if not all of the patient groups that back Rep .
Eshoo ’s approach have significant ties to the brand - name industry , as this is a common practice of Pharma to fund patient and health groups .
Very few ( probably only two , but possibly a couple more ) of the consumer , health and patient groups that oppose Eshoo ’s approach take money from the either the brand - name or the generic biopharmaceutical industry .
You could search the database created by Essential Action at http://www.pharmafiles.net/
to see if any of the other patient and health groups Rep. Eshoo ( or this memo ) mentions as supporters have industry connections .
FYI , the absence of a mention does n’t mean that the groups do n’t have industry ties : the database is a work in progress and there are literally thousands of pharma - funded patient and health groups .

Hypersensitivity reactions to L - asparaginase do not impact on the remission duration of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
Leukemia .
1998 May;12(5):660-5 .
I checked the transcript this morning and the biggest bombshell in this campaign so far , in my opinion , is the following section of Bush 's speech :
John McCain 's life is a story of service above self .
Forty years ago , in an enemy prison camp , Lieutenant Commander McCain was offered release ahead of others who had been held longer .
His wounds were so severe that anyone would have understood if he had accepted .
John refused .
For that selfless decision , he suffered nearly five more years of beatings and isolation .
When he was released , his arms had been broken , but not his honor .
Fellow citizens , if the Hanoi Hilton could not break John McCain 's resolve to do what is best for his country , you can be sure the angry left never will .
Now have you ever heard someone recount what was done to John McCain in the Hanoi Hilton and not use the word " torture " ?
I have n't .
" Beatings and isolation " is a bizarre phrase to use to describe the torture that was done to John McCain .
I 'm sure McCain thinks so .
Am I being persnickety ?
As with the Trig story , there 's a very easy way to find out - if the press will simply do its job .
A White House reporter needs to ask the president , quite simply , if he believes that John McCain was tortured in Vietnam .
Just ask .
Use that specific word .
See if he can answer .
The reason he put it this way , I infer , is that if he describes what was done to McCain as torture , he has incriminated himself for war crimes .
I repeat :
The reason he put it this way is that if he describes what was done to McCain as torture , he has incriminated himself for war crimes .
Now prove me wrong .

Apple 's history has had more moments of truth than that of any other tech company .
Maybe any other company , period .
Discuss .
Everybody has two businesses , the old saying goes : their own business , and show business .
It ’s the same with technology , except everybody ’s two business are their own business … and Apple ’s .
No other tech company on the planet is followed as avidly , nor is any so routinely second - guessed .
And if anything , controversy over Apple ’s decisions and dramas intensifies with time : I would n’t be the least bit surprised if someone , somewhere , still contends that Jobs and Wozniak should have slashed the $ 666.66 pricetag of 1976 ’s Apple I to better compete with the $ 495 Altair .
Apple ’s long history is rife with defining moments … and , therefore , with roads not traveled that might have led to radically different places .
I call the twenty - five items in this story “ unanswerable questions ” because none of them have right answers :
Nobody knows what would have happened if things had turned out differently .
All you can do is speculate .
Which is what I do , briefly , for all of the questions below .
But mostly , I ’m curious what you think .
These questions may be unanswerable , but it ’s still a blast to try and answer them anyhow , as I hope you ’ll do in the comments …
Let ’s start at the beginning , shall we ?
After the jump , that is …
1. What if Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had never met ?
Today ’s Apple may be a company dominated by a single mind , but at the start , there were two geniuses behind it .
Steve Wozniak gave the Apple II sexy color graphics , slots for future expansion , and other impressive features ; Steve Jobs put it in a case that was anything but clunky , and marketed it like a master .
The skills of the two founders were astoundingly complimentary , but they might never have partnered up at all if their mutual buddy Bill Fernandez had n’t introduced them to each other in 1971 .
Harry ’s guess :
It ’s hard to imagine any scenario in which Steve Jobs never became a big deal doing something , or in which Steve Wozniak was n’t a major figure of early personal computing history .
But if Apple had lacked either Jobs ’s packaging and marketing gifts or Woz ’s technical chops , it might not have made it into the 1980s , let along lived on into the next century .
2 . What if Steve Jobs had n’t visited Apple PARC ?
In 1979 , way before Apple released the Mac or the proto -Mac known as the Lisa , Steve Jobs talked his way into a guided tour of Xerox ’s PARC , the fabled research facility that spawned graphical user interfaces , the laser printer , Ethernet , and other breakthroughs that just about everyone except Xerox went on to turn into successful products .
Jobs and other Apple staffers visited PARC twice , and came away dazzled by its Alto user interface .
And who would n’t be ?
In the days of command - line interfaces , its icons , menus , fancy fonts , and mouse - driven design were literally a preview of computing ’s future .
Apple cheerfully borrowed Xerox ’s concepts for the pricey and unsuccessful Lisa , then reused them for the Macintosh , the first computer to bring a rich graphical interface to the masses .
Harry ’s guess :
The Jobs visit to PARC is the stuff of legend ; it ’s tempting to riff on the idea that if it had n’t happened , we ’d all be banging out DOS commands on our keyboards today .
Or , alternatively , that Xerox would have released a Mac - like computer that changed the computing world forever .
Um , no : GUIs were such a good idea that they would have dominated no matter what .
And Steve Jobs was so persistent that he would have turned Xerox ’s good ideas ( as well as numerous ones not seen in Alto ) into Apple products one way or another .
As for Xerox , it did commercialize the Alto interface in its Star workstation .
Used one lately ?
3 . What if Woz had n’t crashed his plane ?
Steve Wozniak ’s brilliant engineering was just as important to Apple ’s early success as Steve Jobs ’ marketing wizardry .
But in 1981 , Woz totalled his Beechwood Bonanza , doing severe damage to his memory .
He recovered from his bout of amnesia , and did some engineering work for Apple thereafter .
But only a little work , and mostly on the Apple II , which was in the process of being eclipsed by the Mac .
Otherwise , he filled out the 1980s by returning to school , becoming a teacher , bankrolling the US Festivals , and founding an unsuccessful universal remote control company called CL 9 .
He also continued on the Apple payroll , but the two - Steve era was over .
Harry ’s guess :
Woz was a virtuoso , which made him the most important figure of the first period of personal computer design .
But it also makes it less likely that he would have continued to thrive in the more corporate , team - oriented era that followed .
My guess is that he would have put aside engineering in favor of all his other pursuits , from educating kids to Segway polo , no matter what .
And I ca n’t blame him .
4 , What if the Lisa had been a hit ?
In January 1983 , Apple released the Lisa .
The innovative and well - equipped machine sported a revolutionary user interface , a mouse , 5.25 ″ inch floppy drives , and a whopping 1MB of RAM –and a $ 9,995 pricetag that made it an unsuccessful , out - of - reach oddity in an era when many businesses were n’t sure they wanted computers at any price .
By April 1985 , the Lisa line was dead .
That was n’t a tragedy for anyone concerned , since the similar and far more affordable ( if underpowered )
Mac had debuted more than a year earlier .
Harry ’s guess :
This one ’s easy .
The only scenario in which the Lisa would have wound up a success would have involved it keeping all its good stuff but getting a lot cheaper–evolving , in other words , into something almost exactly like the Macs of the later 1980s .
That did n’t happen in part because the Mac itself came along .
But if the Lisa had gotten affordable and flourished , it might have been the Apple computer that continued on to the present day .
The biggest real difference might have been the nameplate on the case .
Oh , and Apple would have presumably had to hire someone other than Justin Long for its “ I ’m a Lisa ” ads .
5 . What if Apple had licensed the Mac OS in the mid-1980s ?
From almost the moment that the Mac arrived in 1984 , folks were telling Apple that its strategy –selling its own software on its own boxes –was all wrong .
Among the naysayers was a guy who knew a thing or two about selling software on other companies ’ boxes : Bill Gates .
In a famous memo from July 1985 , he recommended that Apple license the Mac OS to other manufacturers , and suggested three in particular : Northern Telecom , Motorola , and AT&T .
Apple gave Bill ’s advice serious consideration , then declined to pursue it .
( unless you count a different Apple administration ’s brief licensing of clones a decade later ) .
For the most part , it ’s stuck with its initial software - and - hardware strategy through good times and bad , and taken it into new realms such as music players and phones .
The idea is core–pun unavoidable –to what makes Apple Apple .
But when Gates wrote his memo , it was n’t clear that the Mac was going to make it , Steve Jobs had lost his power struggle with Apple CEO John Sculley ( although he had n’t quite resigned yet ) , and Windows had n’t shipped .
More than most times in its history , 1985 was a time when the company might have decided to license its OS .
Harry ’s guess :
It ’s always a mistake to claim that Apple would have essentially been Microsoft if only it had deigned to license the Mac OS – the move would have been so contrary to its instincts that it probably would have screwed it up .
And Windows , unlike the Mac OS , had the advantage of being an extension of DOS , the dominant computing platform of its time .
I think it ’s possible that a licensed Mac OS might have been quite successful ; I also think it ’s just as likely that Windows would have come to dominate the market from a sales standpoint anyhow .
6 . What if Steve Jobs had n’t left Apple in 1985 ?
In 1983 , Steve Jobs hired Pepsi president John Sculley to help him run Apple .
In 1985 , Sculley forced Jobs to resign on the grounds , basically , that he was impossible to deal with .
Thus began twelve years of Apple history that were nowhere near as exciting as Jobs ’ first reign at the company or his current one .
Harry ’s guess :
It ’s beyond debate that an Apple that had kept Jobs on the payroll would have had a different history than the one that limped along for more than a decade without him .
How it would have been different is tough to say , though .
Almost anyone would come to the conclusion that being fired was good for Steve Jobs :
He went away and founded NeXT ( which built the operating system that serves as the Mac OS to this day ) and Pixar ( one of the most influential and profitable entertainment companies ever ) .
And he eventually returned to Apple as a vastly more seasoned , disciplined person .
If he had n’t spent the years in exile , it ’s possible that Apple would have boomed in the 1990s and the iMac , iPod , and iPhone would have come along just as they did .
But I think it ’s just as likely that Jobs would have been a different , less successful sort of entrepreneur , and Apple a different , less successful sort of company .
7 . What if NeXT had succeeded ?
Jobs ’ second computer startup made an extremely cool workstation that was a decade or more ahead of its time .
It just turned out that there was n’t much of a market for it .
The company drifted from business model to business model and received infusions of cash from outsiders such as Ross Perot and Canon for a decade ; its life as an independent venture ended when Apple bought it in 1996 , acquiring its Unix - based OS and bringing Steve Jobs back into the fold .
Harry ’s guess .
It ’s not hard to come up with alternate scenarios in which NeXT would have been more viable .
But they all involve it making products for use by big enterprises , programmers , and / or scientific and academic types–not friendly little computers , music players , and cell phones for consumers .
If NeXT had thrived , Steve Jobs might well have been prosperous , respected , and happy ; nobody , however , would have regarded him as a god , or even a household name .
And I almost certainly would n’t be writing this article .

The angry , vocal protests by gays and lesbians heartbroken by the passage of Proposition 8 recall a time 30 years ago when grief stricken groups took to the streets in San Francisco after the assassination of Harvey Milk , one of the nation ’s first openly gay elected official .
But in the history of modern gay rights , the seminal setbacks — the Stonewall riots , Milk , AIDS — were catalysts for political movements that historians say advanced gay rights to a place unimaginable during Milk ’s time .
That ’s easy to forget in the new grief about Proposition 8 .
“ I know that some people see gay marriage as a big defeat , ” historian and author John D’Emilio said .
“ But gay is in the news and in the culture .
Who can really know what Harvey would think about what we have today .
But I think he ’d look in wonder at what had been achieved . ”
Today , as the community remembers the 30th anniversary of Milk ’s death , there are hundreds of openly gay elected officials across the country , from city councils to Congress .
Thousands of high schools have formed alliances between gay students and their straight friends .
Gay and lesbian studies is part of university curriculums , said D’Emilio , professor of gender and women ’s studies and history at the University of Illinois - Chicago .
It is a testament to the changed times that Hollywood is releasing a movie about Milk and today the U.S. public is well - versed in the cultural lexicon of gay history , mileposts of the past three decades of a community ’s struggle to become part of society ’s fabric : AIDS , ACT UP , Rep .
Barney Frank , domestic partnership , “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” Ellen , “ Will & Grace , ” San Francisco weddings and Proposition 8 .
Just five years ago , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down state sodomy laws which ended the criminalization of sex between consenting same - sex adults .
None of these were on Milk ’s political agenda when he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 .
Paul Boneberg was a senior at San Jose State University then and president of the gay student union .
“ I remember meeting other students who thought then that they were the only gay person , ” said Boneberg , now executive director of the Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual Transgender Historical Society in San Francisco .
“ We ’re living in the community he created . ”
When Milk pleaded with gay doctors and attorneys and teachers to publicly identify themselves as such — to show they were already part of people ’s lives and neighborhoods — he issued a simple but powerful strategy for political change that reverberates today .
“ His call to action was to come out so we can win the hearts and minds of people , ” said Campbell City Councilman Evan Low , 25 , who came out when he was in college .
Just a year after Milk ’s death , about 100,000 gays and lesbians , seeming to heed his call , thronged in Washington , D.C. , in the nation ’s largest gay rights march .
The AIDS epidemic that ushered the 1980s “ was the single most important agent of change ” for the country ’s gay and lesbian community , D’Emilio said .
AIDS decimated a third of the gay men living in the Castro , the neighborhood that Milk represented .
Across the country , thousands more were dying while America was gripped by fear and homophobia .
“ The epidemic moved countless people to take heroic action .
They came out of the closet .
They built organizations .
They lobbied , ” D’Emilio said .
Anger against the government ’s seeming lack of care spawned a new protest culture .
ACT UP , a controversial and in - your - face group of gays and lesbians , frequently confronted the government to push for funds for AIDS care and national research .
“ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” the government policy that denied gays and lesbians entry into military service defined the decade of the 1990s .
That too , historians say , was seen as a defeat , but it began forcing a public discussion about the role of gays and lesbians .
Gays and lesbians had moved out of the closet to demanding a place in society .
That struggle “ to be a full and equal participant ” in society played out in recent years in the fight for same - sex marriage .
Hawaii put the discussion on the map but Massachusetts and San Francisco performed weddings .
“ I hope we fight same - sex marriage on the federal level next , ” said Megan Thompson , 21 , a senior studying clinical psychology at SJSU .
She is chair of the campus gay and lesbian student organization , Queers Thoughtfully Interrupting Prejudice .
“ That would be a monumental battle , ” said Thompson , who married in October .
“ That would require a shift in thinking across the country . ”
It may take many decades to fully assess the impact of Proposition 8 on gay rights , but just as Milk ushered a new kind of politics for gays and lesbians , some see gay marriage as a new milestone .
“ In many ways , we were exhausted after AIDS , ” said Rafael Mandelman , the 35 - year - old president of the Harvey Milk Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender Democratic Club , the group Milk founded .
“ People were turned a little bit inward , not as focused on the collective struggle , ” he said .
“ There ’s a rediscovery of civil rights , the culture of protest .
People have gotten engaged . ”

Lingerie maker Lucia Iorio says her new design targets the modern , techno - savvy woman , but the GPS - equipped " Find Me If You Can " line has raised the hackles of feminists who call it a 21st - century chastity belt .
The lingerie combo consists of lace bodice , bikini bottom and faux pearl collar , with the GPS device visibly nestled in the see - through part of the bodice next to the waist .
" This collection ... is a wink to women and a challenge to men because , even if she gives him the password to her GPS , she can always turn it off , " Iorio told AFP .

In recent elections , the Republican hate word has been “ liberal , ” or “ Massachusetts , ” or “ Gore . ”
In this election , it has increasingly been “ words . ”
Barack Obama has been denounced again and again as a privileged wordsmith , a man of mere words who has “ authored ” two books ( to use Sarah Palin ’s verb ) , and done little else .
The leathery extremist Phyllis Schlafly had this to say , at the Republican Convention , about Palin : “ I like her because she ’s a woman who ’s worked with her hands , which Barack Obama never did , he was just an élitist who worked with words . ”
The fresher - faced extremist Rick Santorum , a former Republican senator , called Obama “ just a person of words , ” adding , “ Words are everything to him . ”
The once bipartisan campaign adviser Dick Morris and his wife and co-writer , Eileen McGann , argue that the McCain camp , in true Rovian fashion , is “ using the Democrat ’s articulateness against him ” ( along with his education , his popularity , his intelligence , his wife — pretty much everything but his height , though it may come to that ) .
John McCain ’s threatened cancellation of the first Presidential debate was the ultimate defiance , by action , of words ; sure enough , afterward conservatives manfully disdained Barack Obama ’s “ book knowledge . ”
To have seen the mountains of Waziristan with one ’s own eyes — that is everything .

Does n’t this reflect a deep suspicion of language itself ?
It ’s as if Republican practitioners saw words the way Captain Ahab saw “ all visible objects ” — as “ pasteboard masks , ” concealing acts and deeds and things — and , like Ahab , were bent on striking through those masks .
The Melvillean atmosphere may not be accidental , since , beyond the familiar American anti-intellectualism — to work with words is not to work at all — there ’s a residual Puritanism .
The letter killeth , as St. Paul has it , but the spirit giveth life .
( In that first debate , McCain twice charged his opponent with the misdeed of “ parsing words . ” )
In this vision , there is something Pharisaical about words .
They confuse , they corrupt ; they get in the way of Jesus .
But we all need words , and both campaigns wrestle every day over them .
Words are up for grabs : just follow the lipstick traces .
For days , the McCain camp accused Obama of likening Governor Palin to a pig , because he likened a retooled political message to a pig with lipstick .
Eventually , McCain ( who had previously described Senator Hillary Clinton ’s health - care plan as a pig with lipstick ) was forced to fudge .
No , he conceded , Senator Obama had not called Governor Palin a pig , “ but I know he chooses his words carefully , and it was the wrong thing to say . ”
This was instructive , not least because it sounded like implicit praise : maybe I do n’t choose my words very carefully , but he does , so he should have chosen them more carefully .
Meanwhile , the campaign that claims to loathe “ just words ” has proved expert at their manipulation , from reversals of policy to the outright lies of some of its attack ads ( “ comprehensive sex education ” ) and the subtle racial innuendo of a phrase like “ how disrespectful ” ( used to accuse Obama of making uppity attacks on Palin ) .
Karl Rove — along with predecessors like Lee Atwater and protégés like Steve Schmidt — long ago showed the Republicans that language is slippery , fluid , a river into which you can dump anything at all as long as your opponent is the one downstream .
And , to be fair , those who affect to despise words have been more skillful than their opponents not just at amoral manipulation but at the creation of what Orwell called “ a fresh , vivid , home - made turn of speech . ”
Pit bulls and lipstick stuck for good reason .
Or take McCain ’s slogan “ The Original Maverick , ” now attached to many of the campaign ’s ads .
It cynically stipulates that politics is just merchandise , by sounding as close to a logo or a brand name as possible .
But it also understands that consumers trust brands that sound like “ quality . ”
Thus “ Original , ” which has the reassuring solidity of something like “ Serving Americans of discernment since 1851 , ” or , indeed , “ Levi ’s 501 : Original Jeans . ”
In such formulations , “ Original ” means eccentric , strange , unusual , and also first , best , belatedly copied by others .
Better still , the phrase sounds like the tagline from a movie poster ; not for nothing has McCain taken to announcing that “ change is coming soon , to a district near you . ”
If Obama is the letter ( words , fancy diplomas , “ authored ” books ) , then the latest representative of the spirit is Sarah Palin .
Literary theorists used to say that their most abstruse prose was “ writing the difficulty ” — that the sentences were tortuous because there was no briskly commonsensical way of representing a complex issue .
Sarah Palin , alas , talks the difficulty .
She may claim , as she did in last Thursday ’s Vice - Presidential debate , that “ Americans are cravin ’ that straight talk , ” but they are sure not going to get it from the Governor — not with her peculiar habit of speaking only half a sentence and then moving on to another for spoliation , that strange , ghostly drifting through the haziest phrases , as if she were cruelly condemned to search endlessly for her linguistic home : “ I do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that seems to be espoused by you . ”
And words do matter , after all : it matters that our Vice - Presidential candidate says , as she did to Gwen Ifill , that “ nuclear weaponry , of course , would be the be - all - end - all of just too many people in too many parts of our planet . ”
Hearing her being interviewed by Sean Hannity , on Fox News , almost made one wish for a Republican victory in November , so that her bizarre locutions might be available a bit longer to delve into .
At times , even Hannity looked taken aback ; his eyes , slightly too close to each other , like the headlamps on an Army jeep , went blank , as if registering the abyss we are teetering above .
Or perhaps he just could n’t follow .
The most revealing moment happened earlier , when she was asked about Obama ’s attack on McCain ’s claim that the fundamentals of the economy are sound .
“ Well , ” Palin said , “ it was an unfair attack on the verbage that Senator McCain chose to use , because the fundamentals , as he was having to explain afterwards , he means our workforce , he means the ingenuity of the American people .
And of course that is strong , and that is the foundation of our economy .
So that was an unfair attack there , again , based on verbage that John McCain used . ”
This is certainly doing rather than mere talking , and what is being done is the coinage of “ verbage . ”
It would be hard to find a better example of the Republican disdain for words than that remarkable term , so close to garbage , so far from language . ♦
Awesomeness for the masses
git_remote_branch 0.3 has been released !
Previous releases were pretty much only usable by rubyists on OS X .
No more .
This release is mostly focused on making sure git_remote_branch works on a broader range of platforms .
A few actual features squeaked in , but nothing big like introducing new commands .
If you do n’t care about the details just type the following at your command - line .
sudo gem install git_remote_branch
And check the help
grb -- help
If you encounter installation problems , refer to the readme .
Platforms
git_remote_branch 0.3 has been tested with the following configurations :
OS X Leopard / Ruby 1.8.6 / Git 1.5.4.3 and 1.6.0.2
OS X Leopard / Ruby 1.9.1 / Git 1.5.4.3 and 1.6.0.2
Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex / Ruby 1.8.7 / Git 1.5.6.3
Windows XP / Ruby 1.8.6 / Git 1.6.0.2 ( the msys version )
Features
Better track
Track now works even if you already have a local branch of the same name .
It uses git config instead of branch — track in that case .
The subtlety can be observed by running ( from a git repository ) :
grb explain track master grb explain track non_existent_branch
Force the use of a specific git executable
Set the environment variable GRB_GIT to point to it and grb will use this one for all its operations .
Documentation
I ’ve also worked quite a bit on the actual documentation .
I used to be ashamed at the quality and availability of the documentation of git_remote_branch .
At last I ’ll be able to sleep at night :-)
git_remote_branch in a nutshell
I ’ve rewritten the intro of the readme to be ( hopefully ) a bit clearer .
git_remote_branch is a simple command - line tool that makes it very easy to manipulate branches published in shared repositories .
It achieves this goal by sticking to a few principles : keep grb ’s commands extremely regular ( they all look alike )
support aliases for commands
print all commands it runs on your behalf in red , so you eventually learn them Another nice thing about git_remote_branch is that it can simply explain a command ( print out all the corresponding git commands ) instead of running them on your behalf .
Note : git_remote_branch assumes that the local and remote branches have the same name .
Multiple remote repositories ( or origins ) are supported .
Documentation availability
The main readme is now available on the main grb page on rubyforge .
Documentation quality
I ’ve added clearer information on getting grb to run in different kinds of situation , due to helpful feedback from Axelson and Glenn Rempe .
I ’ve also added some information for playing with the code for git_remote_branch ( test dependencies and so on ) .
See the end of the readme .
Finally , I ’ve updated the links section quite a bit :
Documentation http://grb.rubyforge.org
News / category/git/git_remote_branch / Bug tracker Lighthouse Code http://github.com/webmat/git_remote_branch
Mailing list http://groups.google.com/group/git_remote_branch
Dare
I dare you to find a platform on which git_remote_branch does n’t work :-)
If you do , please send me feedback through GitHub or via email .
I ’m using gmail and , as usual , I go by the handle of webmat .
Last note : the git_remote_branch gem on GitHub
Excerpt from the readme :
Note that the only stable version of the gem you should trust is the one from Rubyforge .
The GitHub gem is a development gem .
The GitHub gem WILL be rebuilt with the same version number , and other horrible things like that .
If you use the GitHub version of git_remote_branch , children will die !
You ’ve been warned .
After a lot of speculation earlier , The UK ’s Times Online is reporting that Microsoft is in talks to acquire Yahoo ’s online search business for $ 20 billion and install Jon Miller and Ross Levinsohn to run the company .
The whole thing may sound very reasonable to you , but the price sounds really ridiculous as Yahoo ’s whole market cap right now is only about $ 15 billion .
Times Writes :
The proposal forms the centrepiece of a complex transaction that would see Microsoft support a new management team to take control of Yahoo .
But there is no intention of Microsoft tabling another takeover bid for the web giant , after its aborted $ 47.5 billion offer this summer .
It is thought that Jonathan Miller , ex-chairman and chief executive of AOL , and Ross Levinsohn , a former president of Fox Interactive Media , have been lined up to lead the new management team .
Senior directors at Microsoft and Yahoo are understood to have agreed the broad terms of a deal , but there is no guarantee that it will succeed .
Kara Swisher at AllThingsD reports :
A report in the Times of London in which Microsoft would buy Yahoo ’s search business in a convoluted $ 20 billion deal that would include well - known Internet execs Jon Miller and Ross Levinsohn , is –in the words of one key player – ” total fiction . ”
Actually , that ’s Levinsohn speaking , on the record .
But that ’s also the essential word from all key players regarding the Times ’ report .
BoomTown has spoken to top sources at Yahoo ( YHOO ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) too and all scoff at such a deal now taking place or that either side has been in any such discussions of late .
As you can see one of the key player of this mysterious rumor – Ross Levinsohn has called it – ” total fiction . ”
But how can this be another stupid rumor when Times is reporting the deal in such detail as below :
Under the terms of the proposed transaction , Microsoft would provide a $ 5 billion facility to the Miller and Levinsohn management team .
The duo would raise an additional $ 5 billion from external investors .
This cash would be used to buy convertible preference shares and warrants which would give it a holding in excess of 30 % of Yahoo .
The external investors would also have the right to appoint three of Yahoo ’s 11 board directors .
The talks with Yahoo involve Microsoft obtaining a 10 - year operating agreement to manage the search business .
It would also receive a two - year call option to buy the search business for $ 20 billion .
That would leave Yahoo to run its own e-mail , messaging , and content services .
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer has said repeatedly that they are not interested in buying Yahoo , although he has not completely ruled out a search deal of some sort .
But sources at Microsoft has said that they have been waiting for Yahoo to get another CEO in place , after Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang recently announced that he will be stepping down from his position for good .
But some folks at Yahoo has also said recently that it is not currently engaged in any kind of talks with Microsoft , even about a more likely search deal .
So Is this whole thing another rumor ?
Who Knows … .
Only time will tell !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. auto executives warned Congress on Tuesday that their industry was teetering on the brink of disaster as they pleaded for a $ 25 billion aid package despite political opposition to another multibillion - dollar government bailout .
The hearings come as government and business officials around the globe decide if , and how , they should commit billions of taxpayer dollars to bolster struggling automakers .
Rick Wagoner , the head of General Motors Corp , bluntly told the Senate Banking Committee why the executives were there .
“ This is about much more than just Detroit , ” Wagoner said in his testimony .
“ It ’s about saving the U.S. economy from a catastrophic collapse . ”
The hearings came a day after Senate Democrats proposed to bail out the ailing industry with $ 25 billion in government - backed loans .
The weakened economy and global credit crisis pushed the U.S. government into bailing out companies including insurer American International Group Inc ; investment bank Bear Stearns ; and mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Wagoner ; Robert Nardelli , head of Chrysler LLC ; Alan Mulally , CEO of Ford Motor Co ; and Ron Gettelfinger , head of the United Auto Workers union all testified on Tuesday .
“ While the domestic auto industry has made mistakes in the past , the current problems have been exacerbated by one of the worst economies in nearly three decades , ” Mulally said .
“ We are hopeful that we have enough liquidity based on current economic planning assumptions and planned cash improvement actions , but we know that we live in tumultuous economic times . ”
The reception from legislators was somewhat less cordial than the well - paid executives are used to .
Sen .
Richard Shelby , an Alabama Republican and a member of the committee , has called the automakers “ failed models ” and said they should file for bankruptcy .
Criticizing the bailout , Kentucky Republican Sen. Jim Bunning said , “ The proposal coming before the Senate tomorrow is not a serious one . ”
PRESSURES AT HOME AND ABROAD
Both GM and Ford shares fell again on Tuesday .
In the past 12 months , GM shares have lost more than 90 percent of their value and Ford is down more than 80 percent .
The auto industry in Europe is also under pressure .
The EU is studying support for its carmakers , and industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen signaled support for a German offer to help the Opel unit of GM .
But others insisted there could be no special treatment for the industry , and the future of Opel is unclear .
“ You cannot compare the car sector with the financial sector , ” Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said , referring to the mass bailouts by EU governments last month of key banks because of the financial crisis .
While joining the chorus in support of a car industry bailout , Bank of America Corp ’s top official said that not all of Detroit ’s Big Three should survive .
“ The first thing would be that ( the U.S. automakers ) acknowledge that there is one too many auto companies and that consolidation needs to take place , ” Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said at a Detroit Economic Club event .
The most likely victim could be Chrysler , owned by private equity firm Cerberus LLC .
“ We are willing to provide full financial transparency , and welcome the government as a stakeholder -- including as an equity holder , ” Robert Nardelli , the head of Chrysler , said in his testimony .
He said that without immediate financial help , the company may lack sufficient capital to continue operating .
The company also announced a plan to restructure its Canadian operations this year and next in order to preserve cash .
THE U.S. PLAN
Legislation under consideration by U.S. lawmakers would provide funding on top of $ 25 billion of loans approved earlier this year for the companies to improve their technologies and create a line of more fuel - efficient vehicles .

Auto executives were set to take their case for a $ 25 billion industry bailout to Congress on Tuesday as they hope to overcome political opposition from influential congressional Republicans and the White House .
REUTERS / Composite / Files
The part of the plan that seems to have gained the least traction is the idea of using a portion of the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) for the automakers .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said during a House Financial Services Committee hearing that while it would not be a good thing to let an automaker fail , the $ 700 billion fund should not be used to prevent such a failure .
A major question of the bailout is how the companies will deal with its union workforce .
Gettelfinger said at the hearing the situation facing GM , Ford and Chrysler is dire .
“ If the government does not act to provide immediate assistance , GM , Ford and Chrysler could be forced to liquidate , ” the union head said .
“ If one of these companies was to go into bankruptcy , I would almost bet it would take ( down ) two of them or possibly all three , ” Gettelfinger added .
With the year ’s congressional calendar down to a few days , lawmakers and the Bush administration have sparred over the best way to extend help to the automakers .
The Senate bill would impose conditions on the industry , but it is unclear whether those conditions would be enough to satisfy critics .
“ The Detroit Three are rapidly running out of cash and face filing for Chapter 11 reorganization , ” Peter Morici , economist at the University of Maryland , testified .
“ It would be better to let them go through that process and re-emerge with new labor agreements , reduced debt and strengthened management . ”
The government would take warrants for shares in exchange for aid , which would come with limits on executive compensation and a prohibition on the payment of dividends .
Automakers would also have to submit plans on how they intend to remain competitive .
RAISING CASH
The congressional proposal came as the automakers announced some immediate steps to improve their liquidity .
Ford said on Tuesday it would sell a 20 percent stake in Japanese automaker Mazda Motor Corp .
Ford will raise more than $ 538 million from the sale and remain Mazda ’s top shareholder with a stake of just over 13 percent .
For its part , GM said on Monday it would delay incentive payments to its U.S. dealers by two weeks .
The payments for dealer incentives , which are made weekly , will be delayed from November 28 until December 11 , a spokesman said .
There is also a question whether the automakers would continue their sponsorship of sporting events and whether they would rein in spending on advertising .
MARKET FEARS
The auto companies argue a bailout is justified because one in 10 U.S. jobs depends on them .
GM , Chrysler and Ford employ close to 250,000 people in the United States and supporters claim they touch more than 4 million other jobs at suppliers , dealers , car haulers and rental companies .
But the breadth of the automakers ’ impact is not limited to the United States .
Failure of even the smallest Detroit automaker would result in the loss of as many as 70,000 jobs in Canada alone , Canadian Auto Workers union Ken Lewenza said .
“ I am hopeful that Washington politicians will recognize the importance of the auto industry to the economy , and that ’s not just the U.S. economy but the North American economy , ” he said .
It is anticipated that funds from the new bailout would be doled out according to immediate need .
“ Applicants would receive priority based on their magnitude on the overall economy as measured by employment , manufacturing , components and dealerships , ” wrote Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli in a note .
“ Based on this , we roughly estimate Detroit 3 eligibility as follows : GM ( $ 11 billion ) , Ford ( $ 7 billion ) and Chrysler ( $ 6 billion ) . ”
Other analysts also saw GM as the biggest beneficiary from the new bill .
“ The bill favors GM over smaller competitors , as it prioritizes on the basis of impact on the US economy , ” said Brian Johnson , Barclay ’s autos analyst wrote on Tuesday .
GM shares closed down 2.8 percent at $ 3.09 , and Ford shares were down 2.3 percent at $ 1.68 .

A sales representative for Wrangler , he wonders whether the small shop owners who buy his jeans will be able to hang on if the economy deteriorates .
The flux in the stock market has not hurt him as much as it has some , but he can no longer bear to look at his 401 ( k ) .
Saenz , originally from Texas and a lifelong Republican , said he is voting for Democrat Barack Obama this year .
" I think you see disaster going on financially , " he said .
" We need a change .
That 's it , plain and simple .
He may not have the best experience , but this country needs a change . "
Last week , as the economy slipped further toward recession , the momentum seemed to be shifting in places such as Nevada , a swing state that went for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and has been seen as promising turf for Senator John McCain for months .
With the highest foreclosure rate in the nation , a tourism industry damaged by rising food and energy prices , and an unemployment rate at a 23 - year high , Nevada is , according to polls , edging Obama 's way .
The Real Clear Politics average of national polls showed the Illinois senator up by 1.8 percent .
In interviews around the Reno area last week , voters expressed a mix of disgust and relief about the $ 700 billion bailout package - and a good deal of bafflement about what it would do and whether it would work .
They said they saw little daylight between the candidates ' positions on the financial crisis , and many were not convinced that Obama is an ideal candidate .
But voter after voter said that in this economy , they were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt .
" He 's younger , he 's more in tune with what 's going on in America , he 's got young kids , " said Darcie Arnold , a 53 - year - old lifelong Republican who recently switched her party registration to Democrat .
The race in Nevada seems destined to be close .
Thanks to exponential population growth , this land of desert , mountains , and blinking casino strips has become politically unpredictable in the last generation .
Bill Clinton won here twice , before the two narrow Bush wins this decade .
As a Westerner , veteran , and self - styled maverick , McCain fits the state 's traditional sensibility , as does his running mate , Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska .
Ed Rogers , a 65 - year - old Republican from Reno who speaks casually about catching errant rattlesnakes on his property with a stick , depositing them in a small cooler , and setting them free in the hills , is especially fired up about her .
Seven Counties Where Challenges Are Occurring All ' Democratic Strongholds ' ...

No time to go into detail on this story , before what --- I promise --- will be a very lively appearance during my weekly 5 pm PT ( 8 pm ET ) appearance on The Peter B. Collins Show today , where we 'll have a very special guest joining us , and before Guest Hosting the Malloy Show from 6 p - 9 p PT ( 9 p - Midnight ET ) , so lemme just get this out here breifly and let you click for more details .
As reported yesterday by The Missoulian , and denounced today by Project Vote ...
[ T ]he Republican Party of Montana is challenging the eligibility to vote of at least 6,000 residents of that state — mostly in key Democratic strongholds — based solely on the fact that the residents have filed change - of - address cards with the U.S. Postal Service .
While state GOP executive director Jacob Eaton claims the challenges are an attempt to protect “ the integrity of the voting process , ” such massive challenges at this late date threaten to overwhelm election officials , suppress turnout of eligible voters , and create chaos at the polls .
As noted in the Missoulan 's lede graf , the 6,000 challenged were voters are " in seven counties historically considered Democratic strongholds . "
They also report that , " Only twice in the past 15 years has [ the ] Missoula County election administrator [ where 3,422 of the challenges are ] had anyone try to challenge another voter 's eligibility . "
The Republican War on Democracy continues .
UPDATE 10/4/08 : James Sample at HuffPo reports that one of those 6,000 challenged voters who may lose their right to vote is a former MT State Rep , and an Army Reservist , currently in New Jersey because he 's about to leave for Iraq .
Again .
He wo n't be able to go to Montana to confirm his authenticity , unfortunately .
First Lieutenant Kevin Furey ( seen at right ) has released this statement :
It is ironic that at the same time I am about to return to Iraq to help build a democracy that my own right to vote is being challenged at home for partisan purposes .
These challenges are a blatant and offensive attempt to suppress the rights of voters .
Once again , Republicans continue to show that they hate both democracy and the troops !
That 'll be $ 2 .
Buh - bye .

AIG subsidiary parties in style in OC , two weeks after bailout
Orange County Register ^ | October 2nd , 2008 | Teri Sforza
Posted on by george76
Financial crisis ?
What financial crisis ?
Less than two weeks after Uncle Sam gave American International Group ( AIG ) an $ 85 billion loan - staving off financial collapse - execs from one of its insurance subsidiaries , AIG American General , gathered for a conference at the uber - swank St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort , billed as  Californias only Mobil Travel Guide Five - Star Resort ,  where ocean - view rooms start at $ 565 a night and world class luxury  is the rule .
On Friday , before the presidential debate got under way , caterers for the St. Regis were setting up dozens of tables on the grounds of Mission San Juan Capistrano for AIG American Generals sumptuous off - site dinner .
 The inappropriateness and the excessiveness just blew us away ,  said the Outraged Taxpayer , who went to the Mission Friday to pray in the chapel .
 It s outrageous .
In very poor taste .
Over the top .

AIG American General - a subsidiary of parent AIG - is in much , much better financial shape than AIG itself .
 It s one of our viable businesses ,  said AIG spokesman Joseph Norton .
 They re fully capitalized .
They re fine .
It wasnt a corporate kind of thing . 
Ah , that makes it all hunky - dory .
I guess it 's asking too much for subsidiaries to help pay for the bailout of the parent .

Tables were draped with soft Tuscan - gold tablecloths that cascaded to the grass ; elegant fresh flower centerpiece graced each table ; and what appeared to be fine crystal stemware , at least from a distance , glistened in the fading light .
Workers set up a lengthy bar stocked with bottles of liquor .

I ’m not sure what really happened , but normally conferences like this are for the insurance sales people to reward them for meeting sales goals .
They are not for “ executives ” , although the marketing execs will attend .
Such conferences are paid for months , sometimes years in advance , and are non-refundable .
AIG American General is up for sale , and is a separate legal entity from the AIG parent .
The parent cannot take funds from the insurance companies due to state regulation and the insurance companies have their own set of books that are healthy .
Based on my knowledge of the insurance industry , no taxpayer “ bailout ” funds were used for this conference .

Did you check how much surrender charge you are paying ?
You are likely taking a hit for rolling over the annuity , and someone at Fidelity is earning another commission off your money .
That ’s why the insurance commissioners have been saying it is illegal for other insurance companies to try to replace AIG ’s business .
The consumer is the one who loses .
The insurance subsidiaries of AIG have nothing to do with the stupid investment decisions of AIG Financial Products .
Insurance companies by state regulation are not allowed to mess around with risky junk investments .

Getting stuck at a red light that wo n't change sucks .
It 's even worse when you 're on a bicycle because you 'll never see green until a car rolls up and trips the sensor .
That 's never seemed fair to Ed Richley , so he 's invented a gadget that tricks red lights into turning green .
" About 10 years ago , when I lived in California , a colleague told me about a particularly obstinate ( light ) on his commute , and asked me to build something to force a detection , " Richley told Wired.com .
What he 's built is a gadget he calls a Traffic Loop Sensor Activator , and it does exactly what the name suggests — it trips the sensor that tells signal lights traffic is waiting .
The bike commuter and engineer from Maryland has patented ( . pdf ) the device and is looking for someone to mass produce it .
It does n't look like much — in fact , it 's pretty clunky , and the gram - conscious crowd will recoil in horror at its size — but Richley swears it works .
Traffic loop sensors embedded in intersections are the bane of cyclists and motorcyclists everywhere because two - wheelers lack the mass needed to trigger the inductive sensors .
A lot of cyclists resort to using magnets to do the job , but Richley says he has n't seen any scientific evidence suggesting that actually works .
So what makes his solution better ?
Like Ahab pursuing his white whale , Richley spent a decade lugging an oscilloscope to intersections , measuring the signal voltages to determine what kind of signal the loop sensors used .
He discovered that they vary , " so I came up with a technique that scans for frequency and accommodates the pulsed mode of modern sensors , " Richley told us .
Push a button and Richley 's gadget creates a brief , but strong , magnetic field that simulates the presence of a much larger conductor — say , the body of a car — and triggers the inductive sensor that lets the light know a vehicle is waiting .
Richley says it works , and you can get more info about how here .
But is it legal ?
“ I 've asked traffic departments about this and they universally think it 's a great idea , ” Richley says .
He noted that in some states , including Maryland , the law prohibits “ interfering ” with traffic signals .
So the question is , does his gadget interfere ?
Richley says it does n't , and we 're inclined to agree .
It does n't interfere , it , um , helps .
And if radar detectors are generally legal …
Besides , anyone who 's been stuck at a red light for more than , say , two minutes knows the natural reaction is to just run it .
We ’d argue Richley 's gadget promotes respect for the law .
Richley notes that the problem he 's solved is so ubiquitous that some states are exploring legislative solutions to what could be considered an engineering flaw .
South Carolina passed a controversial law this year that allows drivers of motorcycles , mopeds and bikes to run any red after waiting two minutes or more .
But in most states , all you can do at an endless red is wait .
So far Richley 's gadget is nothing more than a prototype .
He 's trying to line up partners to manufacture it , so it 's anyone 's guess how long it 'll be before you can get one .

Photos of the Traffic Loop Sensor Activator by Ed Richley .
This is the original design :
Richley has since refined the design to use the bike 's frame as the coupling loop , moving the bulk of the electronics to the top tube and increasing ground clearance :
You 're at some dull tech conference and somebody want to give you yet another business card .
Only this time , you actually want to keep their details and you know that if you accept the dead - tree token it 'll end up in your wallet , only to be seen again when you 're sitting at a particularly wobbly restaurant table .
But if you have Handshake , a new , free iPhone application , you can quickly and easily swap your contact details with them .
Like any app of this type , it needs both parties to be running it , but with that caveat , Handshake looks like a very easy way to network :
The iPhones do n't connect directly to each other – instead the connection goes via Handshake 's server , so unless you have good Wi - Fi then this is pretty useless for the iPod Touch ( although it will run ) .
According to the FAQ , no details are retained on the server after the transfer has taken place .
You can also choose not to sync the " notes " field in your contact info , although you should n't really have your ATM PIN in there anyway .
The free version is ad - supported , and you can pay $ 3 for an ad - free upgrade .
One tip – it might be a good idea to set your iPhone to put all contacts created on the phone into a special address book group ( you can do this in iTunes ) .
That way it will be easy to delete the details of the dull , dandruff - scattering company rep you just could n't say no to .
Right now , there is a problem if you have more than 300 contacts in your adress book : the app will not launch .
The fix has already been posted , and is trickling through the Apple approval process .
As Chairman Gruber says over at Daring Fireball , this " Should be a built - in iPhone feature " .

“ In the near future , a soldier who needs a quick look over the next hill will be able to aim his rifle skyward , fire a grenade - sized reconnaissance device and instantly receive imagery on his pocket computer , ” writes Defense News ’ Barbara Opall - Rome .
“ No special training or adaptation equipment is necessary ” to fire the Firefly , from Israel ’s Rafael Armament Development Authority , or Israel Military Industry ’s Reconnaissance Rifle Grenade .
Grunts just fire the disposable “ ballistic cameras ” from “ standard - issue M203 grenade launchers attached to M16 or other assault rifles , ” and then wait for the pictures to come back , 8 seconds and 600 meters later .
In this way , the ballisitc cameras a lot like the pint - sized drones which have become so popular among American company commanders in Iraq .
In 2002 , the U.S. Army had 25 year - long Raven unmanned mini-planes ; today , company and platoon chiefs are using about 800 in combat .
“ Why the boom ? ” I asked in Wired a few months back .
Eyes in the sky keep soldiers from getting killed .
“ The way you used to get intel on the battlefield was you fought for it , sending your squad into a building , forcing your way in , ” says former Army captain Phillip Carter .
Now company commanders can see around corners and over hills — a God ’s - eye perspective that once was the domain of generals , with their Predators , manned spy planes , and satellites .
The Ravens are simple to use — one of the best - known operators is a cook .
But , with no guidance system to operate , the ballistic cameras would be easier still : “ point and shoot , ” to use a cliche .
Which means the ability to see a battlezone from above could shift from a general to a captain to a buck private , rifle in hand .

Today ( or tomorrow , if you ’re not in the United States ) is Buy Nothing Day , a tradition ( not a meme ; there are no memes ) from the folks at Adbusters .
The idea is pretty simple : you ’re not supposed to buy anything today .
This is supposed to be an action against consumerism .
As it turns out , I made a completely unnecessary purchase today : a ticket to see The Incredibles for the third time , a big greasy bag of popcorn , and a big brand name Frozen Coke .
Delicious , but ought n’t I feel guilty ?
No .
I do n’t feel guilty and I should n’t , because Buy Nothing Day is , in fact , a collosally misanthropic and subtly reactionary waste of time .
Now , I could n’t care less about the Adbusters crew , but there are people I respect ( e.g. , Elayne Riggs ( 2004 - 11 - 26 ) , Mark Dilley ( 2004 - 11-19 ) ) who support Buy Nothing Day and similar anti-consumerist actions such as the Great Holiday Boycott .
I can understand why good people think there is a good idea here : anti-consumerist sentiments latch onto a real problem .
But I dissent .
Anti-consumerist doctrine , from Marcuse to Adbusters , distorts the nature of the problem , analyses it in terms that are subtly ( or sometimes not - so - subtly ) misogynistic and classist , and offers solutions that systematically miss the point .
Buy Nothing
Day is as nice of an example of anti-consumerist theory and practice as you could hope for .
The problem is over - consumption of corporate - made goods ; its source is consumers duped into mindless binging by clever ad - men ; its solution is waking up and making the choice to opt out of the madness .
( Here ’s Adbusters : For 24 hours , millions of people around the world do not participate — in the doomsday economy , the marketing mind - games , and the frantic consumer - binge that ’s become our culture .
We pause .
We make a small choice not to shop . )
You make the decision to opt out , and to chide others into opting out too–by shuffling around stores in a zombie costume or harassing retail workers , for example ; that is the road to enlightenment , and enlightenment means liberation .
This attack on consumer culture is packaged as resistance to the bourgeoisie ; thus , anti-consumerism is sold as Leftist populism .
The problem is that this is wrong on nearly every count .
Stop for a moment to just look at what the theory of consumerism says about the origin of social problems –the delusions that the unwashed masses are allegedly duped into–and what it recommends as the solution –Gnostic liberation from the dirty material world .
This is not Leftist critique ; it is Romantic misanthropy .
Look at how it is cashed out in action : ridiculing ordinary people going about their business by portraying them as mindless zombies , pigs , sheep , or cattle ; harassing workers who have done nothing worse than show up for their jobs .
This is not Leftist politics ; it ’s empty lifestylism and a display of personal purity .
What it expresses is contempt and what it does is attack ordinary people –workers and women in particular .
More on that in a moment .
( I do n’t want to suggest that everyone who recommends Buy Nothing Day or expresses anti-consumerist sentiments is some kind of slimy reactionary misanthrope .
They are n’t ; lots of decent and sensible people are involved .
But I think those decent and sensible people are making an understandable mistake , and going along with a reactionary program without realizing it . )
Ellen Willis had it right in Women and the Myth of Consumerism ( 1969 ) :
If white radicals are serious about revolution , they are going to have to discard a lot of bullshit ideology created by and for educated white middle - class males .
A good example of what has to go is the popular theory of consumerism .
As expounded by many leftist thinkers , notably Marcuse , this theory maintains that consumers are psychically manipulated by the mass media to crave more and more consumer goods , and thus power an economy that depends on constantly expanding sales .
…
First of all , there is nothing inherently wrong with consumption .
Shopping and consuming are enjoyable human activities and the marketplace has been a center of social life for thousands of years .
The locus of the oppression resides in the production function : people have no control over which commodities are produced ( or services performed ) , in what amounts , under what conditions , or how these commodities are distributed .
Corporations make these decisions and base them solely on profit potential .
As it is , the profusion of commodities is a genuine and powerful compensation for oppression .
It is a bribe , but like all bribes it offers concrete benefits –in the average American ’s case , a degree of physical comfort unparalleled in history .
Under present conditions , people are preoccupied with consumer goods not because they are brainwashed but because buying is the one pleasurable activity not only permitted but actively encouraged by our rulers .
The pleasure of eating an ice cream cone may be minor compared to the pleasure of meaningful , autonomous work , but the former is easily available and the latter is not .
A poor family would undoubtedly rather have a decent apartment than a new TV , but since they are unlikely to get the apartment , what is to be gained by not buying the TV ?
That ’s not all , either .
Misanthropy is always easiest to take out on the people who are least powerful and most widely denigrated ; it should n’t be surprising that anti-consumerist misanthropy is so often cashed out in backhanded attacks on poor workers , and especially on women :
The theory is said to be particularly applicable to women , for women do most of the actual buying , their buying is often directly related to their oppression ( e.g. makeup , soap flakes ) , and they are a special target of advertisers .
According to this view , the society defines women as consumers , and the purpose of the prevailing media image of women as passive sexual objects is to sell products .
It follows that the beneficiaries of this depreciation of women are not men but the corporate power structure . …
The confusion between cause and effect is particularly apparent in the consumerist analysis of women ’s oppression .
Women are not manipulated by the media into being domestic servants and mindless sexual decorations , the better to sell soap and hair spray .
Rather , the image reflects women as they are forced by men in a sexist society to behave .
Male supremacy is the oldest and most basic form of class exploitation ; it was not invented by a smart ad man . …
For women , buying and wearing clothes and beauty aids is not so much consumption as work .
One of a woman ’s jobs in this society is to be an attractive sexual object , and clothes and make up are tools of the trade .
Similarly , buying food and household furnishings is a domestic task ; it is the wife ’s chore to pick out the commodities that will be consumed by the whole family .
Appliances and cleaning materials are tools that faciliate her domestic function .
When a woman spends a lot of money and time decorating her home or herself , or hunting down the latest in vacuum cleaners , it is not idle self - indulgence ( let alone the result of psychic manipulation ) but a healthy attempt to find outlets for her creative energies within her circumscribed role .
…
Consumerism as applied to women is blatantly sexist .
The pervasive image of the empty - headed female consumer constantly trying her husband ’s patience with her extravagant purchases contributes to the myth of male superiority : we are incapable of spending money rationally : all we need to make us happy is a new hat now and then .
( There is an analogous racial stereotype–the black with his Cadillac and magenta shirts . )
Furthermore , the consumerism line allows Movement men to avoid recognizing that they exploit women by attributing women ’s oppression solely to capitalism .
It fits neatly into already existing radical theory and concerns , saving the Movement the trouble of tackling the real problems of women ’s liberation .
And it retards the struggle against male supremacy by dividing women .
Just as in the male movement , the belief in consumerism encourages radical women to patronize and put down other women for trying to survive as best they can , and maintains individualist illusions .
In the past 35 years , we unfortunately have n’t come a long way .
( Watch as women and girls are glibly portrayed as empty - headed , narcissistic , and shallow ; marvel as unconsumer boys thoughtlessly objectify liberated women to pimp their project . )
So what must we do ?
Hey , it ’s the holidays ; let ’s enjoy ourselves–even , yes , buy something , if we feel like it–and ignore or ridicule guilt - tripping anti-consumerists who have n’t got anything better to do than hector us .
And when we get back to work , should n’t we remember that we ’re all in this together , and that that the answer is to empower people instead of berating them ?
Here ’s Ellen Willis again , sounding ( alas ! ) eerily like she was writing about Buy Nothing Day itself , instead of the movement 35 years ago :

Nearly 7,000 rape - kits sit on LAPD freezer shelves awaiting testing with at least 217 of those past the statute of limitations , rendering them useless even if a rapist is identified by the DNA collected .
" It is beyond disturbing that the thousands of victims who have undergone the invasive ordeal of these 4 - 6 hour tests do not even know that their evidence is still untested " wrote City Controller Laura Chick in an audit of the police department 's rape - kit testing program .
" One of the audit 's findings calls out a Penal Code provision that requires the LAPD to make this notification to victims ; the LAPD does not do that now . "

For Vancouver city council candidate Chris Shaw , the enormous tumble of the TSX spells good news for the planet .
Shaw , who is running with the Work Less Party , is not a stupid man .
In fact , he ’s a UBC neuroscientist who is studying suspected origins of Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s diseases .
“ The sooner people realize they need to start changing things , the better , ” Shaw told the Straight .
“ It ’s [ the recession ] obviously bad news for a lot of people .... We ’re sensitive to that .
On the other hand , we believe the economy needs to shrink , and we need to get out of a consumer economy and into a more sustainable economy that does n’t depend on endless consuming .
So , in some ways , it ’s an educational device , as painful as it is . ”
Shaw called B.C. ’s economy a “ monoculture ” that ’s based on a pre-Olympic real - estate boom .
Now that the boom is over , he said , the province is waking up to the idea that there ’s little sustainable industry left .
Forestry and fishing are both dead due to a lack of government investment and there ’s also been little investment in alternative energy or biotechnology , Shaw explained .
As for individuals , Shaw gives them credit for biking more and changing to reusable bags .
However , he said , the recession demonstrates it ’s time for bigger changes .
“ We need to , in a much more deliberate manner , begin to move towards localization , ” he said .
So the recession , coincidentally , acts as a beacon pointing to the Work Less Party ’s civic election platform , which starts with the fundamental idea that people need to “ work less , consume and waste less , and live more ” .
Greater localization of consumables and decision - making , zero waste , and investment in public transportation over cars are a few key Work Less platform points .
In other words , the Work Less Party is calling for Vancouverites to voluntarily make some of the changes that a full - blown economic calamity could ultimately force on us .
Let ’s face it .
Churches , mega - types or not , have gone so far beyond being houses of faith and worship that it ’s time to declare them political arms , property owners and businesses and take away their tax - exempt status .
According to the Associated Press , church parking lots became election focal points yesterday -- the final Sunday before election day .
Approximately 15,000 volunteers from both campaigns swarmed churches in contested states over the past three weekends , passing out literature and busing people to the polls for early voting .
It ’s one thing to use church parking lots as staging areas to transport people en masse to polling stations , but it ’s quite another to leave piles of campaign literature inside churches and hand it out on church grounds , too .
There are definite IRS rules that prohibit churches from spouting political dogma and advice from the pulpit and environs BUT …
Shocker , in the past eight years the IRS has only gone after churches accused of supporting Democrats .
Hmmmm .
Sounds just like other dirty Republican dirty tactics that involve caging and the scandal at the Department of Justice and canning DOJ attorneys who refused to go after Democrats on specious charges .
Churches and political campaigns are behaving like unruly children , pushing the limits whenever and wherever they can , because they know that 99 our of a 100 times the IRS is acting like a lax parent and not enforcing its own rules .
Churches probably never should have been given tax - exempt status , and now they are abusing the privilege to the point where it should be taken away from them permanently .
An argument I hear often in defense of Capitalism is how there is no more class struggle anymore and thus Communism has proven obsolete .
How Capitalism has been shown to work and has only minor malfunctions .
This line of argumentation seems to strike immediately true to anyone living in a developed , or first - world nation .
Are n’t we really , with some exceptions , living better than ever ?
Many of us work just 8 hours and then can go home and play with our playstation for the whole afternoon .
We get at least 20 days of vacation per year and have enough money to travel the world .
Even our poor can survive somewhat decently due to social security .
Is n’t this really the proof that Capitalism does work ?
Well , no .
What such a view of the world misses , is the amazing privilege the developed nations have .
We are the minority who gets to enjoy the wealth of the whole world while living the easy & good life .
The vast majority of the world lives in abject poverty and constant struggle .
It is the citizens of 3rd world countries who are forced to do all the labour , with maybe a subsistence wage , so that we can get cheap goods .
In effect , we have turned the majority of our 1st world population into the bourgeoisie .
Certainly we ’re not all the same .
We have also petty bourgeoisie and urban haute bourgeoisie and a minority of actual proletariat .
The rest of them we have outsourced .
We are a nation of haves .
We find it easy to have more .
Our minimum wages can feed indian families for months .
We are born into middle class and it ’s almost impossible to fall below it .
And like the original bourgeois , we wield all the power .
We have sent our corporations far and wide to mine the labour power of other nations so that we may reap the results .
If those countries decide to attempt socialism and kick our exploiting corporations out , either we send in our armies , or we fund dictators to take them down and give us back our stuff .
Oh , and we consider ourselves magnanimous as well .
For if we never went there , those people would be living even worse !
At least our corporations pay them 9 cents an hour instead of 4 .
Nevermind that those nations are mostly poor because our ancestors robbed them blind during the age of imperialism .
Now it ’s different .
We ’re doing them a favour .
And this is who we are .
There is no class division in our society because we are a society of bourgeois .
We have turned the struggle of people into a struggle of nations , with our own nations firmly at the top .
And thus , Capitalism seems just fine and dandy and anyone who says otherwise is simply someone living in the past .
But like the aristocracy of old , we can not see our own privilege .
We are born and raised on the assumption that we deserve everything we have .
Have n’t I laboured hard to get as much money as others make in a year ?
Do n’t I deserve this pair of Nike shoes a 11 - year old girl made in exchange for a loaf of bread ?
Do n’t I work my necessary 8 hours a day while others work 16 ?
Of course I did .
We deserve everything we make do n’t we ?
Well , no .
Does the slave owner deserve to live in wealth , even if he occasionally buys gifts to his property ?
( hint : We call it humanitarian aid )
Does the artistocrat deserve to live in wealth while living from the work of his feud ?
If you answered these questions in the negative , perhaps you can see why Capitalism does not actually work as well as you might have thought .
In the same way that Aristocracy does not work as well as the aristocrat throught and slavery as well as the slave - owner thought .
But even if you do not see the inherent unfairness in this system , do not worry , like all exploiters our time will come unless we recognise and change what we ’ve become .
Sooner or later , the proletariat we have outsourced will massively revolt and denounce our rule .
It will claim our factories and farms within their own land and then we ’ll figure out that we ca n’t eat “ services ” .
And when this happens , I assure you , the “ humanitarian ” and “ liberal ” majority who suddenly discovers the other side of the coin of the revolution will demand army intervention to get back our property .
And then the true face of the bourgeois will reveal itself in it ’s most ugly form .
So next time , before you declare Communism obsolete , look around and attempt to see who ’s the exploiter .
If you ca n’t tell , it ’s you .

A new type of drug could alleviate pain in a similar way to cannabis without affecting the brain , according to a new study .
The research demonstrates for the first time that cannabinoid receptors called CB2 , which can be activated by cannabis use , are present in human sensory nerves in the peripheral nervous system , but are not present in a normal human brain .
Drugs which activate the CB2 receptors are able to block pain by stopping pain signals being transmitted in human sensory nerves , according to the study , led by researchers from Imperial College London .
Previous studies have mainly focused on the other receptor activated by cannabis use , known as CB1 , which was believed to be the primary receptor involved in pain relief .
However , as CB1 receptors are found in the brain , taking drugs which activate these receptors can lead to side - effects , such as drowsiness , dependence and psychosis , and also recreational abuse .
The new research indicates that drugs targeting CB2 receptors offer a new way of treating pain in clinical conditions where there are currently few effective or safe treatments , such as chronic pain caused by osteoarthritis and pain from nerve damage .
It could also provide an alternative treatment for acute pain , such as that experienced following surgical operations .
The new study showed that CB2 receptors work to block pain with a mechanism similar to the one which opiate receptors use when activated by the powerful painkilling drug morphine .
They hope that drugs which target CB2 might provide an alternative to morphine , which can have serious side effects such as dependency , nausea and vomiting .
Praveen Anand , Professor of Clinical Neurology and Principal Investigator of the study from the Division of Neurosciences and Mental Health at Imperial College London , said : ” Although cannabis is probably best known as an illegal recreational drug , people have used it for medicinal purposes for centuries .
Queen Victoria used it in tea to help with her period pains , and people with a variety of conditions say that it helps alleviate their symptoms .
“ Our new study is very promising because it suggests that we could alleviate pain by targeting the cannabinoid receptor CB2 without causing the kinds of side - effects we associate with people using cannabis itself . ”
The researchers reached their conclusions after studying human sensory nerve cells in culture with CB2 receptor compounds provided by GlaxoSmithKline , and also injured nerves from patients with chronic pain .
The researchers are now planning to conduct clinical trials of drugs which target CB2 in patients with chronic pain at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust , which has integrated with Imperial College London to form the UK 's first Academic Health Science Centre .

A new version of AmigaOS
Introduction
From its very inception , the Amiga has been about defying conventional wisdom .
In the early 1980s , everyone knew that personal computers were n't powerful enough to multitask , but the Amiga proved the naysayers wrong .
In the 1990s it was accepted that PCs could n't possibly edit production - ready video , but the Amiga 's Video Toaster add - on changed that and revolutionized the industry .
Sadly , these days the Amiga is no longer breaking new ground technologically .
However , the platform continues to defy conventional wisdom by its stubborn refusal to fade into the digital night .
Long after most people had given it up for dead , companies such as Hyperion Entertainment Inc. are hard at work improving and enhancing the operating system .
I had a chance to look at a preview copy of the latest release , AmigaOS 4.1 , and it is an impressive piece of work .
Hardware requirements
At the time of writing , AmigaOS 4.1 is only supported on existing AmigaOne SE , XE , and AmigaOne Micro computers .
As such , it is primarily an upgrade for existing AmigaOne owners .
However , a recent announcement by ACube Systems SRL has confirmed an OEM agreement that will allow owners of the SAM440 to install and run OS 4.1 .
Minimum requirements are a PowerPC processor running at 400MHz or higher , 256 megabytes of RAM , 100 megabytes of hard drive space , and a Radeon 7000 video card .
A Radeon 9250 is recommended , however , as AmigaOS 4.1 contains a new graphics subsystem that — like Windows Vista and Macintosh OSX — uses the card 's 3D features for a graphics compositing layer .
The elephant in the room
At the time of writing , Hyperion is still in the middle of a lawsuit brought by the company that contracted the development of the OS , Amiga Incorporated .
The lawsuit hinges on the original OS4 development contract , signed in the wake of the dotcom crash of 2001 , when Amiga Inc. had lost its funding and did not appear to be financially viable going forward .
The deal specified that if Amiga Inc. were to declare bankruptcy , Hyperion Entertainment ( which prior to the development of OS4 specialized primarily in porting games from Windows to the Mac , Amiga , and Linux ) would gain full control of the rights to the OS .
Amiga Incorporated survived , but only through some sleight of hand that involved being purchased by a shell entity known as KMOS , which acquired Amiga 's assets piecemeal and then changed its name to Amiga Incorporated ( Washington ) once the original Amiga Incorporated ( Delaware ) dissolved .
Now that we 're in the middle of the second dotcom boom , the new Amiga Inc. has additional funding sources and wants control of the OS back .
Hyperion , on the other hand , maintains that the " escape clause " should be in effect .
Making matters worse , the original hardware manufacturer , Eyetech , that produced the AmigaOne and AmigaOne Micro motherboards ran into trouble when a crucial chip manufacturer ( Taiwan - based MAI Logic ) went bankrupt .
No new AmigaOne boards are being produced , and while Amiga Inc. has announced that new , licensed , hardware for OS4 is underway , such announcements have been mere vapor so far .
Not giving up
Such a dismal situation would mean the end of most computer platforms , but Hyperion is not throwing in the towel .
Not all is doom and gloom : the OS is solid and evolving , and there are many places it could go .
The announcement of support for the SAM440 motherboards is just a start : there is a large existing base of PowerPC - based Macintoshes that could easily be made to run OS 4.1 , and the low RAM requirements of the OS would make it perfect for running on Sony 's PlayStation 3 or on any number of mobile platforms .
After all , hardware is typically the easier side of the platform equation : it 's the software side that takes the time .
OS 4.0 was already a quantum leap forward for the Amiga operating system , but 4.1 takes it to the next level .
A new partnership
OS 4.1 , while written by Hyperion Entertainment , is being marketed and distributed by the Italian company ACube , the makers of the Sam440 PowerPC motherboards .
As mentioned , ACube has entered into an OEM agreement with Hyperion to bundle OS 4.1 with these machines .
ACube also wrote the manual and created the box art for OS 4.1 .
A congressionally mandated scientific panel has concluded that Gulf War syndrome is real and still afflicts nearly a quarter of the 700,000 U.S. troops who served in the 1991 conflict , according to a report released Monday .
The report broke with most earlier studies by concluding that two chemical exposures were direct causes of the disorder : the drug pyridostigmine bromide , given to troops to protect against nerve gas , and pesticides that were widely used -- and often overused -- to protect against sand flies and other pests .
“ The extensive body of scientific research now available consistently indicates that Gulf War illness is real , that it is a result of neurotoxic exposures during Gulf War deployment , and that few veterans have recovered or substantially improved with time , ” according to the 450 - page report presented to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake .
The report bolstered the hopes of thousands of U.S. and allied veterans who have struggled to have their varied neurological symptoms , including memory loss , concentration problems , rashes and widespread pain , recognized by the government .

“ I ’ve had vets go to the VA and be turned away and told that this is something that does n’t exist , ” said John Schwertfager , vice president of the National Gulf War Resource Center , a veterans advocacy group .
But some scientists were not convinced that the new report had found the long - sought smoking gun .
“ Even though we know that the Department of Defense did ship pesticides , it does n’t mean that the people who were exposed to them were the ones who ended up having symptoms , ” said Dr. Lynn Goldman , a professor of environmental health sciences at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who has worked on previous reports on the illness .
“ We felt that there needed to be better records of where people were , what they were exposed to and their prior health status going in . ”
The new report is the product of the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans ’ Illnesses , which was chartered by Congress because many members thought that veterans were not receiving adequate care .
On the 15 - member committee appointed in 2002 , scientists made up about two - thirds and the rest were veterans .

Several reports had already been issued by the prestigious Institute of Medicine , an arm of the National Academy of Sciences , blaming stress and other unknown causes for the soldiers ’ symptoms .
“ There ’s something about going to the Gulf and serving in the Gulf that has caused something bad and persistent and real , but we have not found any evidence for a specific cause , ” said Dr. Harold C. Sox , chairman of a 2000 institute study and editor of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine .
Veterans blame the institute ’s reports for the difficulties they ’ve faced in getting treatment for their problems .
“ Everyone quotes the Institute of Medicine documents as meaning nothing ’s going on here , ” said Roberta F. White , associate dean of research at the Boston University School of Public Health and the congressional panel ’s scientific director .
“ Some people feel that the IOM reports have been permission to ignore these guys . ”
Advertisement
The new report cites dozens of research studies that have identified “ objective biological measures ” that distinguish veterans with the illness from healthy controls .
The major causes of the disorder appear to be self - inflicted .
Pyridostigmine bromide was given to as many as half of the troops in the fear that the Iraqis would unleash chemical warfare against them .
According to the report , at least 64 pesticides containing 37 active ingredients were used during the war .
They were sprayed not only around living and dining areas , but also on tents and uniforms , White said .
There was less evidence to support a link to the U.S. demolition of Iraqi munitions near Khamisiyah , which may have exposed about 100,000 troops to nerve gases stored at the facility , according to the panel .

The panel said it could not rule out a link between the illness and exposure to oil well fires and multiple vaccinations .
But it could find no evidence linking it to depleted uranium shells , anthrax vaccine and infectious diseases .
In addition to increased rates of memory loss , fatigue and pain , Gulf War veterans have higher rates of brain cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or Lou Gehrig ’s disease , the panel also noted .
The panel called on Congress to appropriate $ 60 million a year to conduct research into finding a cure for the disorder .
“ The tragedy here is that there are currently no treatments , ” said the panel ’s chairman , James H. Binns , a former principal deputy assistant secretary of Defense and a Vietnam veteran .

Binns emphasized that the report was not written to yield recriminations about past actions .
“ The importance . . . lies in what is done with it in the future , ” he said .
“ It ’s a blueprint for the new administration . ”

Here are few caricatures of the Hugh Laurie as Dr. House .
Those caricatures are done very well , i think that these are not from the same creator .
As you can see caricatures of Dr. House are interesting and strange as he is in the series too .
Real smooth , EA .
Some copies of Red Alert 3 appear to be missing characters in their installation codes , meaning of course that you can't install the game you just bought .
While this could be potentially frustrating , Electronic Arts has come up with an absolutely ingenious workaround -- guess the missing character .
" There is currently a work around that may allow you to bypass this issue .
Since you have the first 19 characters of the code already , you can basically try " guessing " the last character .
To do this , simply enter your existing code , and then for the last character , try the letters A - Z , and then the numbers 0 - 9 .
You should eventually get the right combination and be able to play the game . "
Wow .
Just basically guess .
I really wish I could add to that with sarcasm , but I think nobody could send that up better than the way it 's written .
So , let us just sit back and marvel at it , shall we ?
If you think the national debt is bad , the people who own the National Debt Clock are even more pessimistic :
They ’re planning on reformatting their Times Square - area ticker so it can keep track of a debt 100 times bigger than the current $ 10 trillion .
With the national debt now at $ 10.1 trillion , the late Seymour Durst ’s legendary National Debt Clock has run out of space .
To fix it , the Durst Organization plans to add places for two extra digits next year , a spokesman said .
By tomorrow , the digital dollar sign now on the clock will be switched to a number one – the “ 1 ” in $ 10 trillion – until the sign can be redone .
Durst , who died in 1995 , put the sign up in 1989 to call attention to the burgeoning national debt .
But less than a decade ago , the clock itself was turned off when the national debt decreased .
Three exoplanets orbiting the same star have been imaged directly
The first pictures of planets outside our Solar System have been taken , two groups report in the journal Science .
Visible and infrared images have been snapped of a planet orbiting a star 25 light - years away .
The planet is believed to be the coolest , lowest - mass object ever seen outside our own solar neighbourhood .
In a separate study , an exoplanetary system , comprising three planets , has been directly imaged , circling a star in the constellation Pegasus .
While several claims have been made to such direct detection before , they have later been proven wrong or await confirmation .
It 's a profound and overwhelming experience to lay eyes on a planet never before seen
Paul Kalas , University of California
The search for exoplanets has up to now depended on detecting either the wobble they induce in their parent star or , if their orbits are side - on to telescopes , watching them dim the star 's light as they pass in front of it .
Being able to directly detect the light from these planets will allow astronomers to study their composition and atmospheres in detail .
Ring cleaning
The difficulty for astronomers imaging exoplanets is that their parent star 's light swamps them - like trying to spot a match next to a floodlight at a distance of a mile .
The light from the star Fomalhaut was blocked to spot the planet
Enlarge Image
But advances in optics and image processing have allowed astronomers to effectively subtract the bright light from stars , leaving behind light from the planets .
That light can either come in the infrared , caused by the planets ' heat , or be reflected starlight .
Paul Kalas of the University of California , Berkeley , led an international group that used the Hubble Space Telescope to image the region around a star called Fomalhaut in the constellation Piscis Austrinus .
The star has a massive ring of dust surrounding it that appears to have a cleanly groomed inner edge .
That is in keeping with what is known as accretion theory - that young planets gather up dust and matter as they orbit - and prompted the team to begin looking for the suspected planet in 2005 .
The team estimates that the planet , designated Fomalhaut b , is some 18 billion kilometres ( 11 billion miles ) away from its star , about as massive as Jupiter and completes an orbit in about 870 years .
It may also have a ring around it .
" I nearly had a heart attack at the end of May when I confirmed that Fomalhaut b orbits its parent star , " Dr Kalas said .
" It 's a profound and overwhelming experience to lay eyes on a planet never before seen . "

Advertisement Christian Marois of the Herzberg Institute for Astrophysics , Canada , and his team used the Keck and Gemini telescopes in Hawaii to look near a star called HR 8799 , which is just visible to the naked eye .
The team studied light in the infrared part of the spectrum , hoping to spot planets that were still hot from their formation .
What they found in 2004 , and confirmed again this year , are three planets circling the star .
According to a theoretical model that accounts for the light coming from the planets , they range in size from five to 13 times the mass of Jupiter and are probably only about 60 million years old .
The trio have similarities with our own Solar System .
Their orbits are comparable in size to those of the outer planets , and the smaller planets are those closest to the Sun - again suggesting a system that formed through accretion .
Dr Marois points out that the current methods used in the exoplanet hunt are sensitive primarily to Jupiter - sized planets and larger .
" We thus do not have a full picture , " he told BBC News .
" The detection of the three planets around HR 8799 does not mean that no planets are orbiting at smaller separations .
Other gas giant or even rocky planets could reside there . "
A to - scale comparison of the HR 8799 system and our own
The study of the light directly from the planets will yield information about their atmospheres and surfaces that is impossible to collect from planets discovered indirectly .
Further , the current results will also support theories of how planets form from the grand discs of dust and material around stars , and lead to better estimates of how many Earth - like planets are likely to exist .
These latest claims are both based on observations that were well - spaced in time , allowing the researchers to apply a rigorous test for direct detection .
" You see an object next to a star and you might think it 's a planet , " commented Mark McCaughrean , an astrophysicist at the University of Exeter , UK .
" But you have to watch it for several years and make sure that it moves around the star and with the star as it moves across the sky .
Though I 've been very sceptical in the past , these ones all seem pretty real to me , " he told BBC News " It 's like a London bus - you 've been waiting for one for ages and suddenly four come along at once . "

The tragedy of Canada is they could have had British culture , French cooking , and American technology , but instead they got American culture , British cooking , and French technology .
That kind of fog is what Dr. Briggs and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine , with a budget of $ 122 million this year , are trying to eliminate .
Their trials tend to be longer and larger .
And if a treatment shows promise , the center extends the trials to many centers , further lowering the odds of false positives and investigator bias .
For instance , the center is conducting a large study to see if extracts from the ginkgo biloba tree can slow the progression of Alzheimer ’s disease .
The clinical trials involve centers in California , Maryland , North Carolina and Pennsylvania and recruited more than 3,000 patients , all of them over 75 .
The study is to end next year .

Another large study enrolled 570 participants to see if acupuncture provided pain relief and improved function for people with osteoarthritis of the knee .
In 2004 , it reported positive results .
Dr. Brian M. Berman , the study ’s director and a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland , said the inquiry “ establishes that acupuncture is an effective complement to conventional arthritis treatment . ”
In an interview , Dr. Briggs said another good way to improve clinical trials was to ensure product uniformity , especially on herbal treatments .
“ We feel we have really influenced the standards , ” she said .
Over the years , laboratories have found that up to 75 percent of the samples of ginkgo biloba failed to show the claimed levels of the active ingredient .
Scientists doing a clinical trial have a large incentive to fix that kind of inconsistency .
Dr. Briggs said such investments would be likely to pay off in the future by documenting real benefits from at least some of the unorthodox treatments .
“ I believe that as the sensitivities of our measures improve , we ’ll do a better job at detecting these modest but important effects ” for disease prevention and healing , she said .
Our goal with AstroTrac 360 was to do the impossible : engineer a full‑size experience into the smallest , lightest telescope mount possible .
And not only is it compact - it ’s more accurate than ever .
The new AstroTrac 360 ’s advanced friction drives and optical encoders deliver even better unguided tracking performance than the AstroTrac TT320X - AG .
Barack Obama 's longtime campaign photographer David Katz took 82 pictures of the soon - to - be first family on election night .
Later , Katz uploaded them to Yahoo's ( YHOO ) photo - sharing site , Flickr .

Tate puts it in perspective :
In some prior election year , the behind - the - scenes footage of a president - elect 's first moments might have been captured by a photographer for , say , Life , or at least distributed through a glossy magazine like that .
It must have been some small comfort to Barack Obama to be able to rely instead on a longtime photographer of his own , David Katz , at such an intimate moment , and at such a tender one , a day after the death of his grandmother .
As for distribution ?

" I think we will certainly see landfill mining in the UK .

Detecting building Archaeology
There are so many tools and methods today used in detecting building archaeology , although any archaeologist will tell you , the task never gets any easier .
Just like any other sector , innovations have also gotten better in archaeology , more reliable and effective tools are being used today to detect building archaeology .
So if by any chance you 're asking yourself , What does it take to detect building archaeology ?
Consider yourself lucky because that 's one of the questions I 'm going to be answering in this section .
If you 're not involved in detecting modern building archaeology , today is the day you get the ins and outs involved in this very important task , when buildings that have been forgotten are brought to the surface ( not literary of course ) .
Architectural expression in modern times
Architectural expression is one form of cultural identity .
So how do architects depict this art form in this allows evolving time period ?
The architecture produced in this era has taken on many forms , possibly more than any other in history .
Humans are more innovative and technology is the driving force of almost every emerging structure .
If you think about it , architectural expression in modern times may be harder than its ever been
But that 's only half of the story because with harder tasks comes human resilience and innovation .

The most prominent jihadi of them all – Osama bin Laden – is almost certainly hiding somewhere in the tribal region , but it is unlikely that he will ever fall victim to a predator .
He is thought to have survived for so long by being carefully guarded and by not making any phone calls or sending e-mails which could be tracked by the formidable US array of satellites and electronic surveillance equipment focused on the region .
Such restraint is not an option for the hands - on terrorists who are still operating in Waziristan , making them more vulnerable than bin Laden to discovery and attack .
NC Parking lot bans Obama supporters David Edwards and Andrew McLemore

If your fender says Change , do n't park here .
A parking lot owner in Gibsonville , NC , decided supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama are no longer welcome to use his property , WFMY 's Julia Bagg reported .
Lot owner Tim Henderson posted two identical signs that warned : ' no parking ' for Obama supporters or people with Obama bumper stickers . "
" I do n't expect to go after anybody with a baseball bat , " Henderson said .
" I would grin at them and laugh and ask them if they could read English . "
State workers who have used the parking lot for years complained that the new rule infringed on their rights .
Some had Obama / Biden stickers in their windows .
" It 's telling me because I have a sticker or I believe in something , I 'm not allowed to park here and this is where I park for work , I have to park here , " said Dave Dicke , an Obama supporter .
Henderson initially said the signs would stay up through the November election .
After a local news station reported the story , Mayor Lenny Williams made an agreement with Henderson for the removal of the signs .
" If he said Obama folks could park here , but McCain [ supporters ] could n't , I would n't like that either , " Mayor Williams said .
But an anti-Obama parking lot is not the only example of strong prejudice against the Democratic candidate .
Several stories in recent weeks have provoked public outrage about racism in the election .
Vendors at a Family Values Summit in September sold boxes of " Obama Waffles " with packaging that included a caricature of the senator in a turban and grinning with fat lips and bulging eyes .
The vendors were eventually asked to leave by the event organizers once media reported on the incident .
Last week , a Florida teacher faced disciplinary action after calling Obama a " nigger " to his 7th grade class .

( CNN ) --
The demand for unemployment benefits across the country has put a strain on state unemployment funds , with such funds in at least 10 states facing insolvency in 2009 , according to a policy group .
Lines form at a job fair in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , in August .
Nationwide , unemployment reached 6.1 percent , or roughly 9.1 million people , in August , up from 4.7 percent in 2007 , and is expected to continue rising .
The U.S. Department of Labor said that in August , claims for unemployment benefits reached their highest levels since 2001 , in large part because of hurricane activity on the Gulf Coast .
With a weekly average of 474,000 new applicants in August , in a system already looking after about 3.5 million people each week , the growing rate of recipients has nearly depleted unemployment funds in several states .
" There are some real serious problems with unemployment funding that need to be addressed , " said Andrew Stettner , deputy director of the National Employment Law Project , a policy group that advocates on behalf of unemployed and low - wage workers .
The group , which tracks legislation and activity related to state and federal unemployment benefits , says that California , Michigan , Missouri , New York , Ohio , South Carolina , Wisconsin , Indiana , Kentucky and Arkansas have less than six months ' worth of unemployment trust fund reserves , putting the funds at high risk of insolvency .
On Tuesday , California state officials told lawmakers in a hearing that their unemployment reserve fund was on track to run dry by March based on the state 's forecast unemployment rate , which hit 7.7 percent in August .
Last month , South Carolina Employment Security Commission chief Ted Halley said his state 's fund was also projected to run out by January .
As of August , the state 's unemployment rate was 7.6 percent .
Eight more are on the cusp , based on a formula that projects the amount of money the state would need in a recession .
" These states are not ready for a recession , and they 're going to see a big hit if we have a protracted job slump , " Stettner said .
" We 're going to see them seriously in the red , but they can take some action and not be swimming in red ink . "
Trust fund revenue comes from payroll taxes on employers , based on a tax system set at the state level .
But , as the amount paid out in unemployment claims has risen , the terms set to generate revenue largely have remained static , combining with the current economic downturn to create a climate that economists say many states are ill - equipped to bear .
Economists blame the situation on the failure of states to beef up their reserves when the economy was in better shape .
" When times were good , instead of putting money into a trust fund , lawmakers gave in to anti-tax fervor and refused to raise taxes to build up a healthy trust fund , " said Ross Eisenbrey , vice president of the Economic Policy Institute .
" Now , as payrolls decline and tax revenue declines , there is less money going into funds that were already running low . "
Eisenbrey said he expects the health of state trust funds to worsen before it improves .
" The economy has been hit hard the past year .
Housing deflation , oil price shocks and flat wages have been reducing consumer demand , and now the credit crisis is causing businesses to lay off more workers , so it 's kind of a negative loop that feeds back into the economy , " said Eisenbrey , pointing out that median household income has declined since 2000 , a first since the World War II era .
When reserves run dry , states can borrow from the federal government 's unemployment trust fund .
Typically , states have a year to repay the loan without accruing interest .
Michigan , which has the country 's highest unemployment rate , at 8.1 percent , is already borrowing from the federal government , even though it is not in the red just yet , according to a spokesman .
" We 've been attempting to borrow money and pay it back as soon as we can , " said Norm Isotalo , a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth .
He attributed rising unemployment claims to the embattled automotive industry and its ripple effect across the state .
" We want to be able to have enough money to cover our forecasts , " said Isotalo , adding that the state borrowed from the federal government in the mid-1990s for similar reasons .
But the forecast is not all doom and gloom , provided the states shore up their reserves , with the help of the federal government and through initiatives of their own , Stettner said .
Historically , first and fourth quarters are low periods for generating revenue that state trust funds so desperately need .
But Stettner 's group advocates an increase in the tax base that contributes to state trust funds , a move that could be a hard sell considering the timing .
The group has also pushed for legislation that would allow the federal government to transfer funds from its reserve to the states , provided they put programs into place that would loosen the requirements for unemployment benefits eligibility among low - wage workers and part - time workers .
" Many of the states facing solvency challenges could be going into red as early as 2009 , but it 's still early enough for them to get out of it , " he said .
" The trick is to make a system that 's self - financing . "
All About Unemployment Rate • National Economy • Economic Policy Institute
Beset by war on two fronts , a rapidly emptying national Treasury and the worst economic crisis in decades , Barack Obama and George Bush are trying to ensure that the transfer of power between them goes as smoothly as possible .
The President - elect and Mr Bush will begin substantive discussions on the handover today when the Obamas visit the White House .
While Laura Bush takes Michelle Obama on a tour of the first floor residential areas of her new home , Mr Bush will host his successor for talks in the Oval office .
Co-operation between the outgoing administration and the Obama team on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan , looming threats of terror attacks and economic mayhem are being described by aides as " unprecedented " .
Mr Bush said at the weekend that a seamless transition is " a top priority for the rest of my time in office " .
Though far from a backslapping relationship , both President Bush and Mr Obama are said to share a common desire for a smooth transition and for the new administration to hit the ground running before further problems pile up .
There are widespread expectations that the new President will be quickly tested abroad , either by acts of terrorism or direct challenges to United States interests by countries such as Iran or Russia .
The political talk shows on television yesterday morning provided evidence of the desire for co-operation , with Mr Obama 's Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel , urging Congress to adopt an economic stimulus package asked for by the Bush administration to ease the pain of recession .
But he made clear that the President - elect would not back away from tax cuts for 95 per cent of working families and would proceed with a tax hike for the wealthiest Americans , those earning more than $ 250,000 ( £ 160,000 ) a year , despite of the economic slowdown .
It is also obvious that the mood of co-operation may well snap before the 20 January inauguration as Mr Obama presses for access to confidential documents and lays out plans to reverse Mr Bush 's controversial legacy .
Public expectations for change are sky high , but the Obama team is trying to decide which of the expansive campaign promises it made over the past 21 months should take priority in the administration 's first 100 days .
The " big- bang " approach – pressing ahead on multiple fronts – seems to have been put on hold by his transition advisers .
John Podesta , the leader of the transition team , pointed yesterday to a more pragmatic " step - by - step " , or " hybrid " , start to the presidency .
In a radio address over the weekend Mr Obama he said his first priority is an economic recovery programme .
Now the debate is whether to tackle health care , climate change and energy independence all at once or to stagger them .
But his team is discouraging talk of a fast - paced 100 - day agenda .
Mr Obama has made clear for months , however , that he wants to scrap as many as 200 of the most controversial decisions of Mr Bush 's eight years in office .
A team of 48 advisers is already drawing up a list of measures they intend to undo , relating to torture , federal funding for stem cell research , reproductive rights and climate change .
As soon as he takes over Mr Obama is expected to issue an executive order declaring that CO2 emissions from factories are a danger to human welfare , a big leap forward in the battle to reverse the effects of climate change .
He will also reverse a decision to prevent California from regulating CO2 emissions from cars .
At the stroke of a pen Mr Obama is expected to wipe out many Bush - era policies that have caused angst abroad , including the global ban on US aid for family planning groups abroad that provide any advice on abortion .
Mr Obama and Mr Bush have met in the White House before .
On a visit with a group of newly elected senators in 2004 , Mr Obama relates in his memoir , The Audacity of Hope , the President called out " Obama ! " before taking him to one side and offering him the following , now rather prophetic - sounding , advice : " You 've got a bright future .
Very bright .
But I 've been in this town a while and let me tell you , it can be tough ...
Everybody will be waiting for ya to slip .
So watch yourself . "
Breaking down walls A history of racism at the White House
* When Barack and Michelle Obama walk through the White House today , they will be carrying with them the mixed emotions of generations of African - Americans .
There will be reminders of the length of time it has taken for black Americans to feel at home in a mansion built by slave labour and where for decades the only blacks welcome were servants .
It was not until 1973 , under Richard Nixon 's presidency , that Sammy Davis Jr and his wife became the first black guests to sleep over .
After Booker T. Washington dined there with Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 a newspaper called it " the most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen " .
Before the election Mr Obama referred to the powerful symbolism of his children , Malia and Sasha , scampering about the White House .
In 1801 Thomas Jefferson brought slaves with him to the White House , and for nearly fifty years they helped run it .
Amidst the struggles over slavery , the black abolitionist Frederick Douglass was the most prominent black visitor .
When Barack Obama 's hero Abraham Lincoln was president , he visited three times .
Belfast Telegraph
Police chief in the small town of Stockbridge Massachusetts , Officer William Obanhein was a typical small town sheriff .
He looked the part , acted the part , and he let everyone know who was running things .
Most famously , though , he arrested Arlo Guthrie for littering , an event which is forever immortalized in the Alice 's Restaurant Massacree .
Bill Obanhein was born on October 19 , 1924 in Stockbridge , Massachusetts , and grew to be the stereotypical small town police officer .
He was a heavyset , gruff - voiced man , who quickly developed a reputation as a somewhat fascistic police officer .
It 's said that he would handcuff persons for extremely minor infractions , harass the local youth , and generally cause a nuisance for people trying to have a good time .
Enter , Arlo Guthrie .
When Officer Obie arrested Guthrie in 1967 , Arlo was a struggling folk singer who had just dropped out of college , and was nowhere near making it big yet , and Obie was still a hot - shot young police officer .
The arrest was just another one in a string or arrests that Obie made , soon to be forgotten .
Until the Alice 's Restaurant movie was being produced .
Obie knew that the movie , and the portrayal of him as an Attila the Hun type of officer was going to cause him no end of grief .
So , he did what could be considered one of the greatest acts of self - deprecation .
He asked to play the role himself .
He was actually a fairly good actor , too .
After just a few days on the set , he was given the nickname of " One - Shot Obie " , after nailing several scenes on the first take .
He earned the respect of everyone on the set , and likewise , he respected those " young hippy punks " a lot more .
After shooting completed , Obie had gotten much more relaxed in his attitude towards the young people he used to harass .
On several occasions , he openly admitted that being with the people on the set of the movie made him realize that they were just ordinary people , trying to make it through life just as he was .
He was much less likely to handcuff and arrest people , and more likely to talk things over .
He had changed .
Most people who came in contact with the post - Arlo Obie say that he treated everyone with kindness , and dignity .
He would help motorists find the now - famous restaurant and church , showing respect even for the " long - haired hippy freaks " .
Everyone said he had a big heart , and that he was the " patron saint of every dog in town " , for his refusal to enforce the town 's leash laws .
Obie 's departure from police duty is marred with controversy .
An altercation with a fellow officer in 1985 and allegations of alcohol abuse led to his forced retirement from the police department .
On his retirement day , Arlo Guthrie , now friends with Obie , returned to the small town for a photo shoot in front of a red Volkswagen Microbus , a prominent feature in the song that made both of them famous .
Thus , Obie departed from public life .
Sadly , Officer William " Obie " Obanhein died on September 11 , 1994 , at the age of 69 of natural causes .
He was one of the truly good people in the world , as he was good - natured , and not afraid to laugh at himself .
He was truly a good , salt of the earth man .
GOP concerns about Palin grow
A growing number of Republicans are expressing concern about Sarah Palin ’s uneven — and sometimes downright awkward — performances in her limited media appearances .
Conservative columnist Kathleen Parker , a former Palin supporter , says the vice presidential nominee should step aside .
Kathryn Jean Lopez , writing for the conservative National Review , says “ that ’s not a crazy suggestion ” and that “ something ’s gotta change . ”

Tony Fabrizio , a GOP strategist , says Palin ’s recent CBS appearance is n’t disqualifying but is certainly alarming .
“ You ca n’t continue to have interviews like that and not take on water . ”
“ I have not been blown away by the interviews from her , but at the same time , I have n’t come away from them thinking she does n’t know s—t , ” said Chris Lacivita , a GOP strategist .
“ But she ai n’t Dick Cheney , nor Joe Biden and definitely not Hillary Clinton . ”
There is no doubt that Palin retains a tremendous amount of support among rank - and - file Republicans .
She draws huge crowds , continues to raise a lot of money for the McCain campaign , and state parties report she has sparked an uptick in the number of volunteers .
Asked about Palin 's performance in the CBS interview , a McCain official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity said : " She did fine .
She 's a tremendous asset and a fantastic candidate . "
But there is also no doubt many Republican insiders are worried she could blow next week ’s debate , based on her unexpectedly weak and unsteady media appearances , and hurt the Republican ticket if she does .
What follows is a viewer ’s guide to some of Palin ’s toughest moments on camera so far .
Speaking this week with CBS ’s Katie Couric , Palin seemed caught off - guard by a very predictable question about the status of McCain adviser Rick Davis ’ relationship with mortgage lender Freddie Mac .
Davis was accused by several news outlets of retaining ties — and profiting from — the companies despite his denials .
Where a more experienced politician might have been able to brush off Couric ’s follow - up question , Palin seemed genuinely stumped , repeating the same answer twice and resorting to boilerplate language about the “ undue influence of lobbyists . ”
These missteps could be attributed to inadequate preparation and do n’t necessarily reflect more deeply on Palin ’s ability to perform as vice president .
But when reporters have tried to probe Palin ’s thinking on subjects such as foreign policy , she ’s been similarly opaque .
In an interview with ABC ’s Charlie Gibson , Palin gave a muddled answer to a question about her opinion of the Bush Doctrine .
And given the chance to describe her foreign policy credentials more fully , Palin recited familiar talking points , telling Gibson that her experience with energy policy was sufficient preparation for dealing with national security issues .
In the same interview , Palin let Gibson lead her into saying it might be necessary to wage war on Russia — a suggestion that most candidates would have avoided making explicitly and that signaled her discomfort in discussing global affairs .
Then , asked this week by Couric to discuss her knowledge of foreign relations — in particular , her assertion that Alaska ’s proximity to Russia gave her international experience —
Palin tripped herself up explaining her interactions with Alaska ’s neighbor to the west .

On the economy , too , Palin has avoided taking clear stances .
In a largely friendly interview with Fox News Channel ’s Sean Hannity , Palin spoke in tangled generalities in response to a question about a possible Wall Street bailout — and even preempted her campaign by coming out against it .
On Thursday , Palin finally took questions from her traveling press — but shut things down quickly after Politico ’s Kenneth P. Vogel asked her whether she would support Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens , who has been indicted for corruption , and Rep. Don Young , who is under federal investigation , for reelection .
Unlike her other interviews , at least this time Palin had the option to walk away .
Thanksgiving morning , 1 am : When media shills for the Health Care Industry beginning spinning stories about how important it is to take up Health Care Reform as the first issue in Congress , you gotta wonder .
What 's going on here ?
.
Quietly and subtly , the idea is being planted .
Sounds like a dream come true for the Single - Payer folks , right ?
Finally , they get their moment in the sun , and all because of electing Obama !
.
But why would the Health Care Industry ASSIST in passing a National Health Care Plan ?
.
Well , they 're not .
They are looking for the best strategy to kill it .
Here 's the plan : With Obama in the White House and more Democrats in Congress , the possibility of National Single - Payer Healthcare is more likely than ever before .
Up to now , the billions they 've spent convincing the public that Health Care in Canada and Europe is rotten , has been sufficient to save the day for HMOs , Insurance Companies , Pill Pushers and rip - off Private Hospital Corporations .
They need to kill this idea again , just like they did when Hillary tried Reform after Bill was elected .
What they did then was hire Bill Novelli's PR firm to produce a very persuasive set of " Harry and Louise " lies as TV Ads to kill it .
The NeoCONs in Jackson Hole who invented HMOs had unlimited amounts of money to throw around to sink Hillary , and to bury any such idea for a decade .

Bill Novelli .
You know him .
He 's the CEO of AARP .
It was Novelli who prowled the Halls of Congressional Offices to propose a " compromise " plan for Medicare Reform .
His " compromise " Bill is why Medicare is a convoluted pieceOcrap , why it 's illegal to shop for cheaper meds in Canada , and why the government cannot do anything to help bring down the cost of prescription drugs .
AARP profits from Medigap Insurance , and all sorts of health care insurance and financial investment products for the baby boom generation .
AARP is first and foremost an insurance company .
The slick AARP magazine is exactly like the warm and fuzzy propaganda all Insurance Companies use to divert attention from how much your health care cost spirals out of control , blaming the government , cost of research and development , or any other lie they can stuff down sick folks throats .
AARP has been a major advocate for keeping Private Enterprise HMOs and Insurance Companies in control , and in the money .
Anyone who thinks different should research how Bill Novelli has always been in there , running damage control for the Health Care Industry , which has grown richer and richer ripping off the American public .
________________________
For the Health Care Industry , their concept is simple but ingenious :
If the customer is a participant in the rip - off , then you can scare them with the notion that their Health Care will be less if the evil government takes it over .
So far , it 's worked like a charm .
Fear of the unknown is their primary weapon .
Promoting ignorance their best tactic .
But now , there 's a real threat that Single - Payer may actually be debated in Congress .
Prolonged debate is not good for Health Care Industry profits .
There 's actually a Bill in Congress that could be passed .
So , how to defeat it AND get the least effective Health Care Reform passed ?
Something will be passed .
Their goal is to help pass one that is least damaging to private Industry profits .
But how ?
Make sure Health Care Reform comes up first .
The longer it lingers , the more time folks have to think about it .
" We must attack Iraq NOW for what they did on 9/11 ! "
" If you do n't pass my 3 - page Bailout Plan RIGHT NOW , there will be rioting in the streets and Martial Law all across America ! "
Fear works .
Especially on Congress .
And the shorter the time , the easier it is to hype Congress into a heightened state of Fear , smothering Congress Critters with literally thousands of Industry lobbyists .
What HMOs , the Insurance Industry , Pill - Pushers and rip - off Private Hospital Corporations need is to shove through a " compromise " plan as quickly as possible .
You will be hearing media shills planting the fear that " we cannot afford National Health Care because of our weakened Economy ! "
" If you pass National Health Care , just look at all the people you 'll put out or work ! "
And , like McCain tried to drag out the old saw about " liberals " trying to take over , they will dust off every old claim that Canadian and European government - run Health Care is far inferior .
The faster a Bill can be shoved thru Congress , the sooner this " problem " for the Health Care Industry can be laid to rest for another decade .
And if another bad compromise Bill is passed , well , it 's the Democrat 's fault .
Watch AARP start publishing why Single - Payer cannot work .
Various national Ad Campaigns should start just after Christmas , when everyone is in a sugar - high - crash blue funk anyway .
A great time to unleash the next round of Fear on the American public .
If you have n't already , find a copy of the DVD " Sicko " .
It 's not perfect , but it 's the best and fastest way to understand lies we 've been told by billion dollar PR Campaigns of sociopaths who make their wealth from fleecing sick Americans .

VIDEO : Was crashing a truck into a wall at 56 mph REALLY such a bright idea , Mr Clarkson ?
He has a notorious appetite for destruction .
But after emerging in ' screaming agony ' from this latest horrifying escapade , perhaps Jeremy Clarkson has had his fill .
These spectacular pictures show how the presenter deliberately crashed a truck into a wall at high speed for his latest daredevil Top Gear stunt .
Scroll down to watch video
Moment of impact : Jeremy Clarkson smashes the lorry through a brick wall at 56mph
The cab crumpled as the lorry hit the brick wall at its maximum of 56 mph , leaving Clarkson with heavy bruising to his shin and back and an index finger like ' a burst sausage ' .
Describing the crash , he said : ' At the moment , teenagers see Bruce Willis driving his car into a helicopter and imagine that you can get out afterwards and still be well enough to punch a baddie in the face .
' This is n't accurate .
I emerged from my high speed head - on impact in what can only be described as screaming agony .
' I could n't walk .
I could n't talk .
I could n't think .
' Everyone should experience this before they are given a licence . '
Taking aim : Clarkson at the wheel of the lorry
He added : ' It would let them know that crashes really , really hurt and that it would be a good idea to not have one . '
Clarkson was in ' screaming agony ' after the stunt
Producers said that the stunt was staged to ' see how difficult it was to be a truck driver ' .
Clarkson and his co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May were each given a series of tasks to complete as truck drivers .
Clarkson was instructed to drive a Renault Magnum lorry through a wall at the vehicle 's maximum legal speed at a test track near Milton Keynes .
Clarkson described the smash as his first serious road accident for 31 years .
A Top Gear spokesman said the presenter was ' quite badly injured ' , although he has since made a good recovery .
However , the crash brought back memories of Hammond 's high - speed smash in 2006 .
The Hamster , as his co-presenters have nicknamed him , was badly hurt when the jet - powered car he was driving crashed during filming
He made a full recovery , but the BBC was criticised by the Health and Safety Executive for failings in its risk assessment procedures .
Speaking about the latest high - speed crash , a Top Gear spokesman said : ' Before the stunt was carried out a full heath and safety assessment was carried out . '

Naomi
Klein is author of
-- a
book that will help you understand what Bush and company have inflicted upon the US and many other nations .
Klein : Naomi Here .
Kall : Oh , Great .
And I just used the word " shock , " too .
Great to have you here , so much .
I was just talking about how Hank Paulson pulled together the leaders of the top banks in the country on Monday and they simply sat them down , told them how bad things were , handed them a document , then said , " This is what you 're going to agree to .
Did you see that article in the Wall Street Journal ?
Klein : I saw the article , but I think the way this is being spun is a little absurd .
Kall :
Well , tell me about it .
Klein :
Well , the spin is that Paulson was really tough with the banks and forced them to sign against their will ; I mean the terms of the deal are incredibly favorable to the banks ; they did n't have to negotiate , because they could n't have negotiated a better deal for themselves .
They get the money but the government is taking no power , there 's no voting right , so they 've just been handed free money in the midst of an economic crisis ; a lot of these banks , if they are not bailed out , they 're going down .
So this spin that Henry Paulson is so tough with the banks is absurd ; he 's the best thing that 's ever happened to them , and he 's one of them .
Kall : Now Ben Bernake studied the Depression and during the Depression , they did something like this but the government did have control , is n't that right ?
Klein : Exactly ; and even if we just compare what Paulson did to what Paul Brown did , just on the straight level of what taxpayers are going to get paid back Gordon Brown and British taxpayers are getting 12 % and American taxpayers are getting 5 % .
Kall : Woo !
Klein :
They could have gotten a much better deal , so no wonder the banks agreed to it so quickly .
Kall : I 'd love to hear more about what you 've been observing and what 's been going on the last couple of weeks .
The bailout , the consolidation of all these banks -- fewer and fewer .
Klein :
Well , it 's been an interesting couple of weeks ; I think that people need to take all this media reporting with a great deal of skepticism ; one of the real lessons , I think of this period , and you know this is a period of shock .
As you know , one of those moments where things start moving into " fast forward " ; there 's so much that happens in a week , you can't even keep track —
Kall :
Let 's just take one moment ; I introduced you before you got on , ' cause I did n't want to waste any time , but you 've written a book , The Shock Doctrine : Disaster Capitalism ; can you give just a few minutes to get us a quick overview of what it is and how that fits into what we 'll be talking about ?
Klein :
Yes , well , the thesis of the book is that if we want to understand how this radical " market fundamentalism " has swept the globe , the system that has imploded before our eyes , the de-regulated system that has been so profitable for the people at the top but something of a disaster for everyone else .
If we want to understand how this system has swept the globe from Latin America to Russia to this country , we need to understand the incredible " utility of crisis " to this project , because the great leaps forward for this project have taken place in the midst , during the immediate aftermath of some kind of a shock .

Yesterday , well , the evening that led into yesterday morning , I had a great idea .
I thought it would 've been perfect .
The well laid out plot for and eight panel comic here .
The problem ?
This happened about 3 in the morning as I was tossing and turning .
I reached over to find the pen I keep by the bedside , terrifying my wife in the process .
I grab the pen and press directly onto my palm the two words that would 've triggered my memory .
The morning comes .
The pen had run dry .
No note exists .
Oh well .
Like sands through the hourglass .
Or something .
I 'm really bummed about it , though , because I thought it had perfect pacing , a great punchline and a hilarious follow - through .
Of course , some of that might 've been having a couple drinks and a garbage plate with my friends the night before .

Constitutional Fundamentals 2
The Constitution seems to be a mystery for everyone .
It is actually a very simple document that has been made a mystery by those that want to confuse the governed .
Most of the constitution concerns itself with administration of government itself .
All the " duties " of this government are spelled out explicitly in Article I section 8 .
Here they are , and nothing more :
{ There is no mystery here .
There is nothing complicated here .
When this was written , the men toying with this idea knew well that a " government " of any kind is the most dangerous thing to man kind that has ever existed here on young planet Earth .
A Constitution is written for one purpose , and that is to LIMIT the power of a government -- period !
Iron workers have a nick name for a twenty pound sledge hammer .
They call it a Blue Monday .
This is your Blue Monday right here , Use it on government .
Ask them where they get the audacity to provide health care , or any thing else we did n't specifically specify for them , as a duty , to perform . }
Section 8 . The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ;
To borrow money on the credit of the United States ;
To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes ;
To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States ;
To coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures ;
To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States ;
To establish post offices and post roads ;
To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries ;
To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ;
To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ;
To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ;
To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ;
To provide and maintain a navy ;
To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ;
To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ;
To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ;
To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ;-- And
To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof .

What part of the Constitution limits / defines what our government can spend our tax dollars on ?

Mark Shuttleworth made headlines not too long ago when he called for the Linux desktop to surpass Mac OS X in both beauty and functionality .
While a lot of folks thought that was breathtaking and audacious , I think he 's aiming too low .
I think Linux should aspire to equal or better the AmigaOS .
I 'm not much of an Apple fan -- I do n't care for the Apple desktop , even though my first ever computer was a Macintosh LC II , and I 've had several Macs since then .
To me it feels itchy and galling , like a scritchy wool shirt on a warm day .
But that 's a question of preference , and for all I know Mr. Shuttleworth is on the right track .
But I think there is a better model to aspire to , and that is the AmigaOS .
What On Earth Is An Amiga ?
" The AmigaOS remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years , incorporating a small kernel and tremendous multitasking capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in OS / 2 and Windows NT .
The biggest difference is that the AmigaOS could operate fully and multitask in as little as 250 K of address space .
Even today , the OS is only about 1 MB in size . "
Amiga - the little computer that could is an excellent summary of the features that keep love for AmigaOS alive .
In summary : the human user is # 1 .
Not the developers , not the code , not talented but impractical designers and gobs of special effects -- the user .
What a concept -- a computer designed to make life for the user as efficient and pleasant as possible .
The main feature that wins my heart is user input is always given the highest priority .
You are not kept waiting while some slacker background process ambles its way to completion -- when you , the human , the one supposedly in charge , clicks the mouse or presses a key , Amiga instantly obeys .
Ever since I started using PCs the number one item on my wishlist is " Obey me first ! "
A wish that is still unfulfilled .
When some horribly - scripted Web page eats up my CPU cycles and brings everything to a screeching halt , when I fat - finger and accidentally run the wrong commands , I want an instant " go away now " key .
Why should I wait ?
Amiga does n't make you wait .
There has been a lot of work on the Linux kernel that addresses this issue , and Ubuntu ( for one ) supposedly tunes its desktop kernel to be more user - responsive .
If it is it 's a subtle difference .
Some other genuinely user - friendly features are a sensible , truly intuitive GUI ; fast on and instant off ; easily customizable in all kinds of ways ; intelligent localisation ; ordered window stacking ( I guarantee the first time you try this you 'll fall in love ) ; and an overall responsiveness and peppiness that will spoil you for any other operating system .
And as much as we like to boast of Linux 's friendliness to older , weaker hardware , AmigaOS is definitely the efficiency winner .
Though this efficiency comes at a significant cost -- Amiga , like the Mac OS , derives much of its efficiency from being closely tied to the hardware .
As I read " Amiga - the little computer that could " I kept thinking how much more it sounded like a good inspiration for Linux than Apple .
Most of the concepts are similar : power under the hood in easy reach , a shiny polished easily - customizable exterior , and an overall goal of putting the user in ultimate control .
Put Amiga 's friendliness on top of Linux 's raw power , flexibility , and openness -- now that would be a world - beater .

I was just forwarded this video by a far ring - wing message board I get updates from .
( I wonder how long whoever had this has been sitting on it . )
It ’s Obama from 1999 , interviewed on the Public Access channel of Chicago .
This is even worse than the recent Public Radio talk that the McCain camp and Drudge is reporting .
It ’s even making me very worried – it ’s pretty explicit in terms of large redistribution of wealth , talks about how socialism can’t have failed cause it ’s never been tried , blames white people for a lot of the world ’s problems .
It ’s only a matter of a few hours until this video gets to Fox News and Drudge – though it may not cost him the election , it certainly will make this a very close race .
And any honest liberal needs to consider how they should vote now that they know how foreign his views are – here is the video Transcript is forthcoming , but we should get in front of this ASAP as best we can .
And a President McCain wo n’t be the end of the world , remember .

Here are the 10 largest point gains for the Dow Jones industrial average since the index launched in 1896 : Date Point gain Percent gain Close Oct. 13 , 2008 936.42 11.08 % 9,387.61 March 16 , 2000 499.19 4.93 % 10,630.60 July 24 , 2002 488.95 6.35 % 8,191.29 Sept. 30 , 2000 485.21 4.68 % 10,850.66 July 29 , 2002 447.49 5.41 % 8,711.88 March 18 , 2008 420.41 3.51 % 12,392.66 March 11 , 2008 416.66 3.55 % 12,156.81 Sept. 18 , 2008 410.03 3.86 11,019.69 April 5 , 2001 402.63 4.23 % 9,918.05 April 18 , 2001 399.10 3.91 % 10,615.83
Stocks enjoyed a much - needed rally Monday with the Dow Jones industrial average soaring more than 900 points on optimism governments around the world can stabilize the financial system .
The Dow , Nasdaq composite index and Standard & Poor 's 500 indexes all soared more than 11 % as investors hoped the many efforts by central banks to strengthen banks would begin to kick in .
The rally in U.S. stocks snapped an eight - day sell - off and comes after strong showings in Asian and European markets as investors applauded the move toward a global coordinated response to the financial crisis .
The rally also comes just as investors ' nerves were seriously worn down by what had been the worst week for stocks in history .
Last week , the Dow fell 1874 points , or 18.2 % , the deepest loss in a one - week period in history .
Much of the rally came from strength in the financial and materials stocks .
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 936.42 , or 11.08 % , to 9,387.61 .
It was the Dow 's largest - ever point gain .
The previous record occurred March 16 , 2000 , during the waning days of the dot - com boom , when the blue chips closed up 499.19 , or 4.93 % .
Broader stock indicators also jumped Monday .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 index advanced 104.13 , or 11.58 % , to 1,003.35 , and the Nasdaq composite index rose 194.74 , or 11.81 % , to 1,844.25 .
About 2,900 stocks advanced on the New York Stock Exchange , while about 250 declined .
But the trading volume of 1.22 billion shares was lighter than it had been last week , suggesting there was less conviction in the buying than during last week 's selling .
Governments around the world have been taking unprecedented steps to calm investors and coax banks to lend .
Late Friday , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced plans for the U.S. government to inject capital into banks in exchange for partial ownership .
Officials from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve announced plans to meet later Monday with top executives from financial firms to work out details of the $ 700 billion plan aimed at thawing frozen bank lending that is stifling the economy .
President Bush acknowledged Monday that " people all over the world are understandably concerned " but said the United States and other nations are taking " responsible , decisive action " to rescue the global economy .
He said the United States will help banks gain access to capital and unfreeze credit markets .
" These are tough times for our economies , " Bush said after meeting with visiting Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi .
" Yet we can be confident that we can work our way through these challenges . "
Investors are also relieved Mitsubishi's UFJ Financial Group plans to invest $ 9 billion into Morgan Stanley .
While the bond market is closed for Columbus Day , LIBOR rates set in London this morning for 3 - month interbank loans improved a bit , with the rate falling 0.07 percentage points .
Traders say the markets were overdue for a bounce , considering the Dow had fallen 40.3 % from its record close last year on Oct.
9 . " Right now it 's a nice bounceback rally , " says Todd Leone , trader at Cowen & Co . " Everyone is crossing their fingers hoping it will last . "
Among the recent worldwide moves in the financial crisis : • The Bank of England , the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank jointly announced plans to work together to provide as much short - term funding as necessary to help revive lending .
The Bank of Japan said it was considering taking similar steps .
•
The Bank of England , for its part , said it will use up to $ 63 billion to help the three largest British banks shore up their balance sheets .
• U.S. authorities announced new moves to aid the crippled banking system , including plans by the Treasury to buy U.S. bank stocks to pump capital into the financial institutions .
•
The heads of the Group of Seven nations held a series of meetings in Washington to address the economic crisis .
•
The administration announced the selection of a team of interim managers , picked an outside firm to help run the program and tapped Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to head up the oversight board guarding against conflicts of interest .
Neel Kashkari , the assistant Treasury secretary who is interim head of the program , said officials were developing the guidelines that will govern the purchase of bad assets and had consulted with six specialist law firms on how the government will take partial ownership of banks .
A rebound in Asian markets Monday was quickly followed in Europe .
In Asia , Hong Kong 's Hang Seng index surged 10.2 % .
Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday .
In Europe , Britain 's FTSE 100 jumped 8.26 % , Germany 's DAX index rose 11.40 % , and France 's CAC - 40 surged 11.18 % .
Investors worried that banks ' reluctance to lend to one another would imperil economic activity by making it harder and more expensive for businesses and consumers to get a loan .
Even so , investors with properly diversified portfolios should remain calm even though there 's panic around them , says Mark Hebner of asset management firm Index Funds Advisors .
" The people that get hurt on a roller coaster are the ones that try to get off while it 's moving , " he says .
But there were signs Friday that some investors believed the market is near a bottom .
On Thursday , selling accelerated in the last hour of trading .
The Dow was down 221 points at 3 p.m. but closed down 679 points an hour later .
On Friday , the Dow was down 468 points at 3 but rocketed 790 points and was up 322 points just after 3:30 .
It then sold off but closed down only 128 .
" This kind of volatility in the market tells you that there are huge disagreements among investors about what the fundamentals are , about what the outlook is , " said Ethan Harris , managing director and chief U.S. economist at Barclays PLC .
Central banks around the world were forced to cut interest rates this week after continuing problems in the credit market triggered concerns that banks will run out of money .

Advertisement Thai anti-government protesters have opened fire on government supporters during clashes in Bangkok which left at least 11 people injured , officials say .
The incident came after the People 's Alliance for Democracy blocked the road to the city 's old airport in a renewed attempt to unseat the government .
The PAD said on Sunday it had begun a " final battle " to achieve the goal .
Meanwhile , PAD supporters have stormed Bangkok 's main international airport , leading it to suspend outgoing flights .
Witnesses said hundreds of yellow - shirted members of the group managed to break through police lines and enter the main terminal of Suvarnabhumi airport , to the bewilderment of passengers .
Anyone who wants to overthrow or resist the government is attempting a rebellion
Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat
In pictures : Bangkok clashes Q&A : Bangkok protests
The airport 's manager , Serirat Prasutanon , said the authorities had tried to negotiate with the protesters , " but to no avail " .
" For the safety of passengers , we have to stop flights out of the airport temporarily until the situation returns to normal , " he told the Associated Press .
Exactly what the protesters hope to do there is not clear , the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says , but they may be hoping to prevent Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat from returning from the Apec summit in Peru on Wednesday .
Mr Somchai told reporters in Lima : " Anyone who wants to overthrow or resist the government is attempting a rebellion . "
' Final battle ' Earlier , Thai TPBS television broadcast pictures of the violence on the main road to the capital 's old airport .
The footage showed shots being fired from a truck into crowds after rocks were thrown .
Thousands of people are taking part in anti-government protests
At least two handguns could be seen and people standing with the gunmen raised up a picture of the revered Thai king , whom the PAD claim to be supporting .
Protesters could be seen running across the empty multi-lane road and setting fire to a motorbike .
A man was also seized by pro-government supporters and what appeared to be a large knife was held to his throat .
TPBS said its cameraman had been threatened at the scene and that PAD personnel attempted to seize his tape .
On Monday , PAD protesters converged on Bangkok 's old Don Muang international airport , from where the cabinet has been operating since its offices were occupied three months ago .
Organisers say the protest is a " final battle " to bring down the government .
Our correspondent says the government appears to have followed a strategy of allowing PAD to attack government buildings while avoiding clashes , in the hope that it will wear the protesters down .
The government has so far resisted calling in the army .

Health experts say young people are contracting sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia in epidemic proportions because they are not practising safe sex .
University of New South Wales Professor of sexual health Dr Basil Donovan says national figures show that last year more than 50,000 young people tested positive for the infection .
But he says only a small proportion of people at risk actually get tested , so the real figure is probably five times that .
" You may be looking at over a quarter of a million new infections each year , " he said .
He says it affects both males and females , with implications for their future fertility if they are not treated .
Dr Donovan says there appears to be less and less adherence to safe sex among teenagers .
" One of the things about young people is they give most credence to what they hear from their friends and what they hear on television , " he said .
" Right now chlamydia is a problem , because most people have no symptoms and no obvious signs , so they do n't hear about it from their friends and they certainly do n't hear about it on television .
" The current generation that are most at risk of chlamydia were n't even born when the Grim Reaper campaign happened . "
He says health authorities must act on a public awareness campaign .
This girl is throwing a fit yelling and screaming at her Mother to take her to practice or else .
Spoiled little brat or what ?
Meanwhile Mom just sits there reading the paper and her brother being there with a video camera only makes matters worse .
These little creatures may look cute and cuddly .
Until they melt you with their nuclear venom or feast on , say , your bladder .
Snails , insects and other small animals often appear to be harmless , but many tiny creatures around the world are capable of delivering a deadly knock - out to the unsuspecting human who crosses their path , as if to compensate for their insignificant size .
Read on to be amazed – and consider yourself warned !
Candiru
Did you hear the one about the Amazonian fish who swam up a penis , took up residence in said penis owner ’s bladder , and could not be extracted due to its umbrella - like spines ?
It ate away at the man until he hemorrhaged .
Wait a minute , somebody check Snopes !
That ’s clearly an urban legend , right ?
Wrong .
The Candiru fish actually can swim into …ahem … southern apertures , although it ’s much more likely for women to be at risk than men for obvious reasons ( it would have to be an awfully determined fish and a rather drunk male ) .
Though evidence of candiru extraction surgeries are mostly secondhand , enough discussion exists in the scientific body of literature to confirm the dreadful possibility .
( Legends of penectomy are almost certainly false , however . )
The slick , slim , small Candiru frequently lodge themselves in larger fish and animals and are nearly impossible to remove .
( By the way , there are actually far more poisonous fish in the world than there are snakes .
Just something to think about . )
The moral of the story : do n’t pee in the Amazon .
Also , do n’t f*ck with fish .
Bullet Ant

The unimpressive - looking but accurately named bullet ant does n’t get much traction in the poisonous animal archives of the interwebs , but one of our staff has a first - hand account that is truly horrifying .
On a scientific expedition to Costa Rica , the professor warned the group of being bitten by the ubiquitous bullet ant which could allegedly knock out a grown man for hours from the intense , burning pain .
Days passed , fear subsided , and everyone forgot about the bullet ant .
Until a piercing howl echoed through the forest and into the small lab where the students were working .
“ Somebody just got a bullet , ” said the professor knowingly .
Next day , the group saw the unfortunate man : his hand was a red and brown mass of inflamed flesh .
Of course he lived to tell the tale , but it was n’t pretty .
Wikipedia confirms the agony that is the bite of the bullet ant .
Locals call it the 24 hour ant , owing to the fact that a single bite delivers a full day of tortuous , throbbing pain .
In some Central and South American cultures , young men are initiated into manhood by enduring up to 5 bullet ant stings at once .
Moving along …
Blue Ringed Octopus

One of the tiniest , cutest cephalopods on earth is also the last octopus you ever want to encounter .
When frightened or threatened , the blue ringed octopus – which measures just a few centimeters in size – brightens its blue rings and proffers a painless warning bite .
You skip away , thinking you ’re fine … until you ’re seized with paralysis and death in short order .
The blue ringed octopus , which graciously inhabits tide pools and shallow tropical waters , actually possesses a neurotoxic venom that is more violent than any land creature on earth .
Good times !
Cone Snail

The cone snail or cone shell looks like an innocuous , pretty sea shell .
But the cone snail , along with its 400 genetic cousins , can inject you with a painful dose of venom through its harpoon , as many a tourist has learned the hard way .
Conveniently , salt water makes the pain even more excruciating , and paralysis often results .
Soon after , respiration is no longer possible .
This means you die .
Poison Dart Frog

The poison dart frog is the only animal that can kill a human merely by being touched .
Indigenous Americans have long used the slime of the poison dart frog ’s skin on their arrows ( hence the name ) .
It ’s an effective slayer of monkeys and people alike .
The frogs ’ skin emits a violently potent toxin that causes paralysis , internal bleeding , organ failure and death .
According to Dark Roasted Blend , the tiny creatures ( usually just 1/2 inch in length ) can jump 50 times their length .
If humans had that kind of jumping capability , we ’d be able to clear Home Depot ’s parking lot in a single bound .
Poison dart frogs come in a range of brilliant combinations of intense colors but what they have in common is deadly cuteness .
Kind of like your last girlfriend .
Hooded Pitohui

Great , so from now on you ’ll be avoiding all bodies of water and forests .
You ’ll want to avoid birds , as well .
Yes , there are poisonous birds , so think twice before casting off your crumbs .
Scientists have learned only recently that many bird species contain venom in their feathers , skin and beaks .
The hooded pitohui is one of the most dangerous birds in this respect ; the people of Papau New Guinea call it the “ garbage bird ” due to its unpleasant smell and flesh .
Consumption of the flesh can make you very sick .
The hooded species of pitohui has a toxin known as batrachotoxin in its feathers and dander .
This toxin is most similar to one other creature on earth .
That would be our friend the poison dart frog .
i Phone - Optimized Google Search Results
On the desktop version of Safari , when you use the built - in Google search field , you get pretty much the same results page as when you go to google.com and enter your query the old - fashioned way .
The toolbar search field is just a more convenient way to get the same results .
But that ’s not the case on the iPhone .
On the iPhone , when you use the toolbar search field ( the one you get by tapping the magnifying glass button next to the location field ) , you get Google search results that look pretty much exactly like Google ’s default web presentation , shrunk down to fit on the iPhone screen :
In this initial state , the results are effectively illegible .
But if you start your search by loading the google .com home page , you get a results presentation that is specifically optimized for MobileSafari :
The text is perfectly sized , and the entire page layout is optimized for the iPhone display .
Admittedly , the un-optimized presentation you get via the toolbar button is n’t a big deal , because you can double - tap on the results column to zoom in :
But even then it ’s still not as nice as the version you get through the web site interface .
I do n’t understand why , if Google has an iPhone - optimized search results mode , this mode is n’t used for queries initiated via the iPhone ’s built - in Google search field .
It ’s not clear to me whether Apple should change MobileSafari to send a different query string to Google to trigger these iPhone - optimized results , or whether Google should just handle it on their end , the same way they already serve an iPhone - optimized version of their home page to iPhone users .
1
Update 1 : Looks like Google engineers Steve Kanefsky and Rob Stacey wrote about this last week for the Google Mobile Blog :
Over time , we intend to make the newly formatted results pages available through other search entry points on the iPhone , on additional devices , and in more language and country combinations .
Update 2 : I neglected to mention that if you change your default MobileSafari search engine from Google to Yahoo , the search results from Yahoo are iPhone optimized :
Right idea , but I do n’t care for Yahoo ’s presentation .
Each result is too big — you can only see the first two without scrolling , whereas with Google ’s iPhone display you can see four .
E-Voting Is n't Perfect , But It Takes Less Work to Corrupt Big Elections
from the O(1 ) dept
Thad Hall , a political scientist at Caltech , complains that e-voting critics rarely make apples - to - apples comparisons between electronic and paper voting systems .
They contend that if traditional paper voting systems were subjected to the same kind of close scrutiny that e-voting endures , security experts would find flaws — ballot tampering , ballot box stuffing , and so forth — at least as serious as the problems commonly identified in touch - screen voting machines .
Rice computer scientist Dan Wallach responds by pointing to a new paper he 's written proposing an elegant way to think about the security of voting systems .
Computer scientists use " big - O " notation to describe the complexity of algorithms .
He suggests a similar terminology to describe the effort required to compromise voting systems as a function of the size of the election .
A security flaw that can be compromised with an effort proportional to the number of voters N is said to be a O ( N ) flaw .
A flaw that can be exploited with an effort proportional to the number of polling places is an O ( P ) flaw .
A flaw that can be exploited with a constant amount of effort , regardless of the number of voters , is an O ( 1 ) flaw .
The last kind of attack is the most dangerous because it 's feasible for a small number of people — perhaps even a single individual — to do a lot of damage .
The reason paper - based elections tend to be better than touch - screen elections is n't that the former do n't have flaws .
The difference is that attacks against paper - based voting systems are far more likely to be O ( N ) or O ( P ) — that is , you have to tamper with a lot of ballots or corrupt a lot of poll workers .
In contrast , because they contain re-programmable computers at their hearts , touch - screen voting systems are far more susceptible to O ( 1 ) attacks such as a custom - developed virus or a corrupt employee at the e-voting vendor .
Because they allow a single individual to do extensive damage , they 're much more dangerous than other kinds of attacks , even if carrying them out takes relatively more skill or effort than other attacks with O ( P ) or O ( N ) cost .
The reason to prefer paper - based voting to touch - screen voting is n't that paper voting is flawless , but that the attacks against them are labor - intensive enough that it 's difficult to carry out large - scale attacks without getting caught .

PA — Day - Timers Inc. ( motto : “ Today is the first day of the rest of your calendar . ” ) has unveiled an ingenious new calendar designed to help the current global financial crisis by eliminating the chance for any more Black Mondays to occur .
Called the 2009 Happy Days Are Here Again Calendar , the new Day - Timer replaces Mondays with a 48 - hour version of Sunday called Someday .
“ I came up with the idea when Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said that someday this economic crisis will be over , ” says Day - Timer new product designer Julian Gregory .
“ Now we ’ll get credit for it ”
“ Black Monday ” has been used to describe the day of the week that many of the nation ’s worst stock market crashes have occurred , including October 28 , 1929 , October 19 , 1987 , January 21 , 2008 and most recently October 6th 2008 .
Day - Timer officials believe that eliminating Black Mondays will have a positive influence on Wall Street morale and assures customers that it will not affect Black History Month , Blackened Redfish Day or Lewis Black ’s birthday .
“ Someday ” will provide the added benefit of turning every weekend into a 3 - day weekend , thus eliminating the need for vacations , sick days and my - grandmother - died - again personal holdays .
The 2009 Happy Days Are Here Again Calendar comes in the popular 1 - page - per-day and 2 - page - per-day Day - Timer styles , along with the new 10 - page - per - day format for people who like having a few opportunities to start a bad day over .

Revela el alcalde Víctor Manuel Bautista López que el presidente del grupo Carso aportaría mil millones de dólares para la realización de la terminal que , de aprobarse , se ubicaría entre las tres más grandes del mundo
El ayuntamiento de Nezahualcóyotl , la Corte Internacional de Arbitraje y Conciliación Ambiental ( CIACC ) , además de ex pilotos del Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de México ( AICM ) , presentaron un proyecto para que se construya la nueva terminal área en terrenos federales del municipio , en la parte superior del relleno sanitario Bordo Poniente que está a punto de cerrarse .
El alcalde de ese municipio , Víctor Manuel Bautista López ; el secretario general de la CIACC , Ramón Ojeda Mestre ; y Alfredo Lezama Hernández , piloto jubilado e impulsor desde hace años de la propuesta ; expusieron que el denominado Aeropuerto del Lago sería la mejor opción porque permitiría conservar las operaciones del actual aeropuerto capitalino .
El edil López Bautista reveló que el principal inversionista de la nueva terminal área que se edificaría en 420 hectáreas , es el empresario mexicano Carlos Slim Helú , presidente del grupo Carso , quien aportaría mil millones de dólares para su realización .
Esta propuesta , aseguró el munícipe , " reduciría los costos de inversión si la terminal área se llevara a cabo en la región de Texcoco , en Hidalgo o en cualquier otro punto de la zona metropolitana de la ciudad de México " .
De acuerdo con el plan general , el nuevo aeropuerto constaría de " dos pistas paralelas que funcionarían de manera simultánea , pistas de apoyo y carreteo con las dimensiones y resistencia para recibir aeronaves de nueva generación como el Airbus A380 " .
Ojeda Mestre afirmó que desde el punto de vista social - económico - técnico - ambiental ésta es la mejor propuesta posible .
Otro atractivo del planteamiento , dijo , es que el saneamiento del Bordo Poniente una vez que se cierre , no lo haría el gobierno del Distrito Federal , sino el grupo Carso , como sucedió con la limpieza del tiradero Neza I , donde se construye actualmente Ciudad Jardín Bicentenario ; que lo efectúo la iniciativa privada .
El ex piloto Alfredo Lezama señaló que la operación del Aeropuerto del Lago , permitiría un ahorro de 4 mil 500 millones de dólares , que es lo que se perdería si se suspende la operación de la actual terminal aérea .
" Si se autorizara la edificación de otro proyecto que no fuera el de Nezahualcóyotl , la actividad del AICM se suspendería por completo " , afirmó .
La propuesta ya fue presentada al Consejo Consultivo del Aeropuerto Benito Juárez , así como a autoridades federales y del estado de México .
Si se aprobara el proyecto , ese aeropuerto se ubicaría entre los tres más grandes del mundo porque permitiría 900 mil operaciones aéreas anuales .
Actualmente sólo el de Atlanta , en Estados Unidos , funciona a ese ritmo .

Australia 's navy currently has around 2,000 vacancies Most of Australia 's navy is to be given two months off over Christmas as part of a new strategy to cope with crew shortages , the defence minister says .
Joel Fitzgibbon said the extended break was a way of encouraging sailors to stay in the service .
The number of sailors who stay aboard docked ships will be reduced , to make sailors ' duties more family - friendly .
Mr Fitzgibbon rejected claims by the opposition that the move would affect national security .
The opposition said the venture was an admission that the government had failed to recruit enough sailors .
' Innovative ways '
Mr Fitzgibbon said : " We 're doing a lot of work trying to find new and innovative ways both to retain skilled people and recruit new people . "
The stand - down will not impact operations
Rear Admiral Davyd Thomas But David Johnston , the opposition spokesman on defence issues , said the strategy amounted to an admission of government failure .
" I 've never seen a defence force charged with the protection of Australia saying we 're going to have six - to - eight weeks off over Christmas because we think it 's a good thing for the mums and dads , " he said .
Naval chiefs have said the move would not leave the country unprotected .
" The stand - down will not impact operations and is to ensure that our people who are not required on operations are able to take a meaningful period of time off and spend time with their families , " said Navy Deputy Chief Rear Admiral Davyd Thomas .
The navy has some 12,000 personnel in total - a shortfall of some 2,000 .

Iraq and the United States have finally agreed on a security pact which would mean that US forces would withdraw from Iraq by 2011 , American and Iraqi officials said yesterday .
The accord became a major test of strength between the Iraqi government and Washington since negotiations began in March with the Iraqi Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , pictured below , demanding US concessions on the date of the troop withdrawal and immunity for US troops .
The pact replaces the UN Security Council resolution enacted after the American invasion of 2003 .
The agreement still needs to be approved by the council of Iraqi leaders , the cabinet and the Iraqi parliament .
Mr Maliki saw the highly influential Shia religious leader , the Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , last week and was assured that he would not stand in the way of the pact if approved by parliament .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The accord has been on the verge of being signed several times in the past only for fresh objections to be made by the Iraqi government , which has become increasingly confident of its own strength .
A compromise has been reached on whether or not US troops can be tried by an Iraqi court if they commit crimes while not engaged in operations .
US troops are to withdraw from Iraqi towns and villages by the middle of next year and from Iraq entirely by the middle of 2011 said the government 's spokesman , Ali Dabbagh .
He said : " The withdrawal is to be achieved in three years .
In 2011 , the government at that time will determine whether it needs a new pact or not , and what type of pact will depend on the challenges it faces . "
The US administration will present the pact as a sign of its success in Iraq but in fact the accord is very different from originally envisaged by Washington which would largely have continued the occupation as before .
President Bush was opposed to timelines or dates for an American withdrawal and the US is still stressing that this is conditional on improved security in Iraq .
But it is unlikely that the Shia majority will want to share power with the US .
Iraqi politicians have always assumed that Washington 's insistence on signing a new accord before the presidential election was motivated by the White House 's hope that the accord would be seen as a sign that its Iraq policy had at last produced a success .
The Republican contender , Senator John McCain , started off his campaign by saying that US troops might stay for 100 years and there should be no date for their withdrawal .
The Democratic candidate , Senator Barack Obama , wants combat troops home by the middle of 2010 , which was also the date originally proposed by Mr Maliki .
Iraq has faded as an issue in the presidential election as the financial crisis worsened .
However , claims that the Republicans had won a victory in Iraq looked increasingly unreal as it became clear that a withdrawal date would be determined by Mr Maliki , and not by the US .
The US has given ground on crucial issues .
On the legal immunity of American troops Mr Dabbagh said : " Inside their bases , they will be under American law .
Iraqi judicial law will be implemented in case these forces commit a serious and deliberate felony outside their military bases and when off duty . "
Contractors , who have more men in Iraq than the US army , will no longer have immunity .
Update :
–
In Iceland the future may have played out in miniature .
That little country of 300,000 people has seen banks go bust , real estate values plunge , the currency trashed and the middle class crashed .
Iâ€™m told by someone who should know that food stocks are running low because grocery stores have no cash for inventory .
And as you may already be aware , the countryâ€™s three main banks were taken over by the government earlier this month , and that last Tuesday the stock market lost three - quarters of its value .
Why does this place matter ?
Only because in a mini-country like Iceland , which is an affluent , modern society , might we see in weeks what we could reasonably expect in months .
You have to admit , there ’s little to cheer about as we look out over the coming times .
The Canadian dollar , once soaring far above the Yankee greenback , has collapsed to 82 cents .
Oil has lost half its value , and if the slide continues the Albertan oil sands become uneconomical .
The Toronto stock market crashed another 400 points yesterday .
The Chrysler plant in Windsor is now going half - speed .
The Bank of Canada dropped interest rates again â€ “ the second cut in as many weeks â€ “ but not by enough .
The Sterling truck plant in St. Thomas is kaput for sure now .
And several mining operations in Northern Ontario are winding down , laying off people in communities where few other jobs exist .
In the States , the government ’s not only buying up Wall Street and half the countryâ€™s mortgages , but is now gobbling money market funds .
Banks are borrowing more than $ 400 billion a day from the Federal Reserve , and blue - chip companies like Caterpillar are having trouble borrowing enough money to survive .
Yahoo is laying off a big chunk of its workforce , and itâ€™s expected many retailers will close their doors before Christmas , since they canâ€™t borrow the money to buy holiday inventory .
Because the US economy may be in the process of collapsing , commodity prices have slumped world - wide .
As toxic US mortgage debt poisoned the global financial system , credit froze , banks teetered and suddenly money is hard to find , which has ironically made American greenbacks more valuable , further depressing commodities and the Canadian dollar .
Meanwhile , disastrous earnings reports of major American corporations are pulling down the stock market recovery that billions of government dollars were supposed to create .
Some say the Dow may lose another 35 - 50 % of its value .
Do I see a Black Swan ?
And , yes , there is real estate .
So far , the average house price has dropped by $ 30,000 in Toronto , $ 45,000 in Vancouver , $ 17,000 in Ottawa , $ 61,000 in Calgary and $ 64,000 in Edmonton .
At the same time , 0/40 mortgages are gone , mortgages are harder to get and rates are higher for those who do qualify .
There are more houses for sale than ever , and sellers are having to wait vastly longer times to find a buyer .
If they can .
And this has just started .
As I have said for a very long time now , the greatest threat to the wealth of middle class people everywhere , but especially in Canada , is a real estate melt .
And now it ’s happening .
When I published my book warning of this , back in April , organizations like the Canadian Real Estate Association said an absolute price decline was not in the cards .
Sadly for those recent buyers who heeded that advice , they are now under water .
All of the above brings us to a single conclusion :
This is an economy in decline , and the bottom has yet to be glimpsed .
Weâ€ ™re paying for a society which became dangerously addicted to debt and in which too many people wanted stuff they simply could not afford , yet bought anyway .
Shame on them .
More shame on those who gave them the money .
And letâ€™s heave special shame on experts , critics , analysts , economists , industry leaders and politicians who said there was nothing to worry about .
Fourteen days ago the Canadian prime minister was one of them .
But I canâ€™t go there .
Apparently Iâ€™m dead .
Coming soon : A survivor ’s check list .
1 Vesna Vulovic : The Stewardess Who Survived a terrorist attack at 33,000 feet
On January 26 , 1972 , a Yugoslav Airlines DC - 9 departed from Copenhagen for Belgrade ( via Zagreb ) with 28 passengers and crew .
At an altitude of 33,000 feet , a bomb in the cargo section , planted by the Ustashe Croatian separatist group , exploded .
The plane disintegrated and crashed on the mountains .
In what must be one of the greatest survival stories of all time , stewardess Vesna Vulovic survived the 33,000 foot descent sitting on the tail of the plane .
22 year old Vulovic was n’t even supposed to be on that plane .
As she later stated in an interview , it was another Vesna who was supposed to be on that flight , but she was happy with the mix - up as it allowed her to make her first trip to Denmark .
She ended up with a fractured skull , two broken legs , and three broken vertebrae – one of which was crushed and left her paralyzed from the waist down .
Vulovic spent several months in and out of hospitals ; operations allowed her to walk again .
She became a celebrity when the Guinness Book of World Records invited her to a ceremony in London with Paul McCartney .
She is listed for surviving the longest fall without a parachute .
Vulovic is now a national hero in Serbia and spent the late 90s marching in Belgrade against Slobodan Milosovic .
2 Frane Selak : Escaped from a derailed train , a door - less plane , a bus crash , a car into flames , another 2 car accidents … then won Million Dollar lottery !
Luck has always been on his side or vice versa for croatian music teacher Frane Selak ( born in 1929 ) , who is well known around the world for as many fatal accidents as spectacular escapes .
The first of his numerous near - death experiences began on a cold January day in 1962 , when Selak was on a train to Dubrovnik : it suddenly derailed into an icy river , killing 17 passengers .
He managed to escape with a broken arm , minor scratches and bruises .
A year later , Selak was flying , from Zagreb to Rijeka , when a door abruptly blew away from the cockpit of the plane , as he was blown off the plane .
The accident killed 19 people , however , Selak was lucky enough to land on a haystack , and wake up some days later in hospital , with minor injuries .
It was in 1966 that he met with the third misadventure while traveling on a bus that crashed and plunged into a river .
There were four people dead .
Astonishingly , Selak managed to escape unharmed again .
In 1970 , Selak was driving along when , all of a sudden , his car caught fire .
He was fortunate again to have left the car before the fuel tank exploded .
Three years later , another of Selak ’s car caught fire , blowing flames through the air vents .
To a greater dismay , Selak ’s lost most of his hair .
In 1995 , Selak was in Zagreb when he was hit by a bus , again leaving nothing but a few injuries .
The following year , while driving through a mountain road , Selak drove off a guardrail to escape an oncoming truck and landed on a tree to watch his car explode 300 feet below .
In a surprising turn of events in 2003 , Selak won the million - dollar Croatian lottery , turning the man into either the world ’s unluckiest man , or the world ’s luckiest one .
3 Andes Survivors : Crashed on the Andes Mountains , lasted 72 days
On Friday the 13th of October , 1972 , a Uruguayan Air Force twin turboprop Fairchild FH - 227D was flying over the Andes carrying Stella Maris College ’s “ Old Christians ” rugby union team from Montevideo , Uruguay , to play a match in Santiago , Chile .
When the plane was flying through the pass in the mountains , the pilot notified air controllers in Santiago that he was over Curicó , Chile , and was cleared to descend .
This would prove to be a fatal error .
Since the pass was covered by the clouds , the pilots had to rely on the usual time required to cross the pass ( dead reckoning ) .
However , they failed to take into account strong headwinds that ultimately slowed the plane and increased the time required to complete the crossing .
As a result , the turn and descent was initiated too soon , before the plane had passed through the mountains .
Dipping into the cloud cover while still over the mountains , the Fairchild soon crashed on an unnamed peak ( later called Glacier of Tears ) , located between Chile and Argentina .
Twelve people died in the crash .
Survivors not only had to withstand the hunger and the fearful Mountains , but also 30 degree - below - zero temperatures during the night .
They tried to survive with the scarce food reserves they had until being rescued , but they lost their hope when heard that the search had ceased on the radio .
Desperate owing to the lack of food and physically exhausted , they were forced to feed themselves on their death partners to keep on living .
Finally fed up with the extremely low temperatures and the avalanche threats , as well as anguished by the continuos deaths of their partners and the bad rescue prospects , two of them decided to cross the huge mountains to reach Chile .
On 22nd of December of 1972 , after being isolated for 72 days , the World found out and knew there were 16 survivors that beat Death in the Andes mountains .
4 Anatoli Bugorski : The Man Who Survived a Beam from a Particle Accelerator
As a researcher at the Institute for High Energy Physics in Protvino , Bugorski used to work with the largest Soviet particle accelerator , the Synchrotron U - 70 .
On July 13 , 1978 , Bugorski was checking a malfunctioning piece of equipment when an accident occurred due to failed safety mechanisms .
Bugorski was leaning over the piece of equipment when he stuck his head in the part through which the proton beam was running .
Reportedly , he saw a flash “ brighter than a thousand suns ” , but did not feel any pain .
The beam measured about 200,000 rads when it entered Bugorski ’s skull , and about 300,000 rads when it exited after colliding with the inside of his head .
The left half of Bugorski ’s face swelled up beyond recognition , and over the next several days started peeling off , showing the path that the proton beam ( moving near the speed of light ) had burned through parts of his face , his bone , and the brain tissue underneath .
As it was believed that about 500 to 600 rads is enough to kill a person , Bugorski was taken to a clinic in Moscow where the doctors could observe his expected demise .
However , Bugorski survived and even completed his Ph.D. .
There was virtually no damage to his intellectual capacity , but the fatigue of mental work increased markedly .
Bugroski completely lost hearing in the left ear and only a constant , unpleasant internal noise remained .
The left half of his face was frozen , due to the destruction of nerves , and does not age .
He is able to function perfectly well , save the fact that he has occasional petit mal seizures and very occasional grand mal seizures .
5 Roy Sullivan : Struck by Lightning 7 Times
In 1942 , the first lightning strike shot through Sullivan ’s leg and knocked his big toenail off .
In 1969 , a second strike burned off his eyebrows and knocked him unconscious .
In 1970 , another strike left his shoulder seared .
In 1972 , his hair was set on fire and Roy had to dump a bucket of water over his head to cool off .
On August 7 , 1973 , another bolt ripped through his hat and hit him on the head , set his hair on fire again , threw him out of his truck and knocked his left shoe off .
On June 5 , 1976 , a sixth strike in 1976 left him with an injured ankle .
On June 25th , 1977 , the last lightning bolt to hit Roy Sullivan sent him to the hospital with chest and stomach burns in 1977 .
His wife was also struck once , when a sudden storm welled up as she and her husband were out hanging wash on the back yard clothesline .
On September 28 , 1983 , Roy Sullivan died at age 71 , reportedly of a self - inflicted gunshot wound over troubles unrelated to lightning .
6 Joe Simpson : Conquered Siula Grande , dropped 100 ft into an Ice Crevasse , crawled 3 days Joe Simpson and Simon Yates were the first to scale the west peak of the Siula Grande , in the Peruvian Andes .
Disaster struck on the way down , and Yates was forced to let a badly wounded Simpson drop 100 feet into an ice crevasse .
Simpson survived the fall and spent three days crawling back to base camp .
7 Truman Duncan : Cut in Two by a Train Railroad switchman Truman Duncan fell off the front of a moving train car .
He was swept underneath and cut in two .
Despite losing both legs and a kidney , Duncan called the paramedics on his cell phone , survived a 45 - minute wait , and then persevered through 23 surgeries .
8 Aron Ralston : Amputated his lower right Arm to Survive the Mountains On May 2003 , while Aron Ralston was on a canyoneering trip in Blue John Canyon ( near Moab , Utah ) , a boulder fell and pinned his right forearm , crushing it .
After trying for five days to lift and break the boulder , desperation took him to great measures like carving his name , date of birth and date of death into the boulder , drinking his own urine because of lack of water and videotaping his last goodbyes to his family .
Finally , a dehydrated and delirious Ralston decided to bow his arm against a chockstone and snap the radius and ulna bones .
Using the dull blade on his multiuse tool , he cut the soft tissue around the break .
He then used the tool ’s pliers to tear at the tougher tendons .
After Ralston was rescued , his arm was retrieved by park authorities and removed from under the boulder .
It was cremated and given to Ralston .
He returned to the boulder and left the ashes there .
9 Robert Evans : Survived Being Hit by Car , Then Train Hours Later
“ He got two ambulance rides last night , ” said the police .
“ It ’s an extreme oddity that someone is hit by a car and a train on the same night .
I ca n’t imagine that this has ever happened before in Boulder .
” An early morning of September 2008 , 46 - year - old homeless man Robert Evans had a hit - and - run car accident , and while walking back from the hospital to his camp , he was knocked off a narrow railroad bridge into a creek by a train , surviving the second accident in seven hours .
Police said Evans was hit by the railing of a stairway on the side of the train .
The railroad bridge is only wide enough to accommodate the train tracks and is not intended for pedestrians or other traffic .
10 Mauro Prosperi : Survived 9 days in the Sahara Desert Prosperi , a keen endurance runner , took part in the 1994 Marathon des Sables ( Marathon of the Sands ) in Morocco .
Part way through the 6 - day 233 kilometre event a sandstorm caused Prosperi to lose his way .
He ended up disoriented and ran in the wrong direction , ultimately running several hundred kilometres into Algeria .
After 36 hours he ran out of food and water .
He survived by drinking his own urine and eating bats resident in an abandoned mosque and the occasional snake found in the desert .
Not wishing to die a long drawn out death , Prosperi attempted to commit suicide in the mosque by slitting his wrists with a pen knife he had with him .
The attempt failed – lack of water had caused Prosperi ’s blood to thicken and clotted the wound before he died .
After nine days alone in the desert he was found by a nomadic family and taken to an Algerian military camp and from there to a hospital .
He was 186 miles off route , and reportedly had lost between 30 and 40 pounds ( 18 kg ) in body weight .

Roy Sullivan was a Virginia Forest Ranger who had an incredible attraction to lightning … or rather lightning had an attraction to him .
Over his 36 - year career as a ranger , Sullivan was struck by lightning seven times – and survived each jolt , but not unscathed .
His seventh strike put him in the Guinness Book of World Records :

Oct. 29 , 2008 -- Asthma sufferers may be able to better control their breathing and improve their exercise performance with some training in tai chi , new research indicates .
Tai chi is a method of traditional Chinese exercise involving coordinated breathing and body movements .
Scientists in Thailand enrolled 17 adult patients ( average age 57 ) with persistent asthma in a six - week tai chi training program .
After the training period patients showed significant improvements in peak flow variability , asthma control , and quality - of - life measures , the researchers say .
Patients were more comfortable on a six - minute walk and increased their maximum work rate and maximum oxygen consumption after taking part in the exercises , the researchers say in a news release .
The researchers conclude that tai chi can help people control asthma and prove to be an effective , non-pharmacologic adjunctive therapy for people with persistent asthma .
The authors are on staff in the department of medicine at Ramathibodi Hospital in Thailand .
The 17 patients attended supervised exercise once per week , followed by daily home - based exercise assignments using an audio- visual guide .
This routine lasted six weeks .
The researchers measured such things as oxygen consumption and exercise endurance , concluding that tai chi improved both maximum and functional exercise capacities and improved exercise performance .
The research was presented at CHEST 2008 , the annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians , in Philadelphia .

What 's me up to ?
I 'm glad me asked .
Me've ( I 'm not doing that any more ) been working on a little show called Dollhouse .
Yes , perhaps you 've read about how it 's blazing an untrammeled path to surefire success , with nary a hitch or a hiccup , just pure blazing blazery , comet - like and meteoresque .
What 's that , you say ?
You 've read other things ?
Dark , Yog - Sothothy rumors about shutdowns and delays ?
Poppycock !
They �re true .
But I never pass up a chance to say " poppycock " .
( " Balderdash " is so '07 .
Let it go . )
I know there 's been a lot of concern , various fabulous hues of panic alert readiness .
So here 's the skinny .
Some of the names have been changed .
The show was ruined by Flim Flinear .
Okay , that 's another lie , and you 're probably close to giving up on this blog , so here we go .
Yes , we 've had to make adjustments .
Yes , it 's been hard and I 've been depressing to be around for awhile .
Basically , the Network and I had different ideas about what the tone of the show would be .
They bought something somewhat different than what I was selling them , which is not that uncommon in this business .
Their desires were not surprising : up the stakes , make the episodes more stand - alone , stop talking about relationships and cut to the chase .
Oh , and add a chase .
That you can cut to .
Nothing I had n't heard before on my other shows ( apparently my learning curve has no bendy part ) but frustrating as hell given our circumstances - a pilot shot , scripts written , everybody marching together / gainfully employed ... and then a shutdown .
Glad I was for the breathing room , but it 's hardly auspicious .
So back into the writer cave I went , wondering why I put up with this when I can make literally dozens of dollars making internet movies .
Why I do put up with this is divided into three parts .
One :
They 're not wrong .
Oh , we do n't see eye - to - eye on everything , but wanting the first episodes to be exciting and accessible is not exactly Satanic .
Being Satan is , but that 's in their free time and hey , there 's no judging in the Dollhouse .
This kind of back and forth has happened on every show I 've done , so if you liked those , chances are that was a part of why .
And the need to focus on the essentials of what makes this universe tick - and which wire to cut to make it stop - really does bring up our game .
So we as a staff have gone from blinking like unhoused moles to delving in with the same relish we had when we started .
The show is really coming together now , in a way that I believe excites us and satisfies the Network .
Of course , I have no idea if anybody else will like it , but I have the same faith in the staff , the crew and the remarkable cast that I always did .
More , in fact .
And what 's more crucial :
Two : Nothing essential has changed about the universe .
The ideas and relationships that intrigued me from the start are all there ( though some have shifted , more on that ) , and the progression of the first thirteen eps has me massively excited .
The episode we 're shooting now I wrote as fast as anything I have before , not because I had to ( although , funny side - note : I had to ) but because I could n't stop the words from coming .
Because I can feel the show talking to me ; delighting , scaring and occasionally even offending me .
It 's alive .
Alive !
Which is a far cry from how I felt a month ago .
It 's been hilarious trying to keep up with what 's in , what 's out , who 's met whom and when - we 've shot all of the first seven episodes out of airing order - but it 's come together in a pretty thrilling way .
My huge gratitude to our cast for their precision and patience .
Which also includes ...
Three : Eliza .
Watching her on the monitors at two o'clock this morning I was reminded forcibly how much I wished I were in bed � but also how strong , radiant and unmistakable her presence is .
She 's someone who could coast on talent and never ever does .
I love to watch her work .
In fact , I think I got myself into this mess for that very reason , and though I have this fall occasionally sworn never to eat lunch with an actor I like again , I �m pretty pleased and crazy proud .
So here 's me , slogging away on a show like days of old and not hating life .
Again , you guys will be the judge , jury and execu ... lawyer , but we do have something to show you .
Something , I 'm chuffed to say , still pretty damn strange .
As for what 's been changed , well , some things I obviously can't tell you .
Some I can , for the record :
The original pilot was in fact thrown out .
Again , at my behest .
Once it became clear what paradigm the Network was shooting for , it just did n't fit at all , even after I 'd reshot more than half of it ( see above re : despair ) .
To get a sense of how completely turned around I was during this process , you should know there was a scene with Eliza and the astonishing Ashley Johnson that I wrote and shot completely differently three different times , with different characters in different places ( actually I wrote it closer to eight times ) , and none of it will ever see air .
Which is as it should be ( though I 'm determined to get Ms. Johnson back in the future ) .
The scene just did n't belong anymore .
Similarly , the character of November has fallen out of the mix , because the show simply moves too fast now for me to do what I wanted with her .
Season three , anyone ...?
Happily , Miracle Laurie is still with us in a new role , playing against ( and pining for ) Tahmoh 's character , Paul Ballard .
Their chemistry is deeply nifty .
The only other major cast shift is that the Dollhouse head of security , Laurence Dominic ( played by Reed Diamond ) , who was written just for the now - defunct first ep , has stuck like fly - paper , and Reed is very much in the family for the present .
( Most of my problems seem to involve my actors making themselves indispensable .
This is the good problem kind . )
Apart from that , it 's all hush - hush : some things I 'd intended to hold back are laid out much sooner , and some are rolling out more slowly .
We 're still heading toward Tim 's intense two - part mind - blower - right before a thirteenth ep that may actually just be insane .
And finally , young Steve DeKnight , after writing and shooting an ep so cool it helped not only define the show but save its ass , is ending his consulting duties , the f#%&er .
I will be crying on the shoulder of Jane Espenson come Monday , so congratudolences are in order .
Excited for the Jane Flava .
And there you have it .
I 'll be writing more bulletins about " Cabin " and a certain DVD in the very near future , but I wanted to get you all some actual information for a change .
I can count on you guys not to tell anyone , right ?
What 's a blog ?

WASHINGTON : India���s democracy '' will prove far more resilient than the hateful ideology that led to these attacks '' in Mumbai , US President - elect Barack Obama said on Wednesday as the world reached out to India in sympathy and support over what American analysts described as �� �India���s 9/11.�� �
Both the incumbent Bush administration and Obama and his transition team sent out strong messages of condemnation of the attacks and their backing for India even as they coordinated their response in the transition phase in the United States .
President Bush phoned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from Camp David early on Thursday morning to offer support and US help in investigation .
Soon after , an FBI team from Los Angeles , consisting of bomb and forensic experts , left for Mumbai to help in the investigation .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice briefed Obama over the phone as the White House assembled its national security and intelligence chiefs for discussion and analysis and offered India any help it required .
From Chicago , Obama also spoke to India���s ambassador Ronen Sen , to convey that his thoughts and prayers with those affected by �� �this tragic situation��� and brief him about his conversations with Rice .
'' These coordinated attacks on innocent civilians demonstrate the grave and urgent threat of terrorism .
The US must continue to strengthen our partnerships with India and nations around the world to root out and destroy terrorist networks , '' Obama said in a statement issued through his national security spokesperson , Brooke Anderson .
In comments that extolled India���s institutional strength and was directed against the fundamentalist mindset in the neighbourhood , Obama also predicted the triumph of democracy over the sickening ideology of extremism even as terrorists / mujahideen earned universal disgust over the attack of Indian civilians and foreign nationals .
Audiences in the US remained glued to coverage of the Mumbai massacre more than 24 hours after the carnage began as it got wall - to - wall TV time on a long Thanksgiving holiday weekend .
For administration and security officials , that long weekend had already been disrupted by a mid-week security alert that spoke of possible terrorist attacks on New York���s Penn Station and other mass transit in the region ; but the bloodbath occurred 10,000 miles away in Mumbai���s most famous landmarks .
The involvement of westerners , including Americans , Britons and Israelis as victims and hostages in the ordeal also ensured greater coverage than usual with US experts trying to connect the dots and link the attack to Kashmir and al - Qaida , and its possible repercussions on United States .
In fact , there was little or no surprise over the attacks given both the alert in New York and the prediction by foreign policy experts , including vice - president elect Joe Biden , that Obama could be tested by terrorist attacks early in his presidency .
US analysts mulled over the larger implications of the attack that seemed to also target westerners while suggesting that this was not a localized attack arising from home - grown militancy .
���The apparent focus on killing or capturing foreign businesspeople , specifically US and UK nationals , has never occurred before , suggesting a wider global anti-Western agenda .
This stands in contrast to the national issues that appeared to motivate Indian Mujahideen , ��� Jane���s Intelligence , said in a brief update on the crisis .
In Washington , the US State Department put out a hotline number ( 1-888-407-4747 ) to enable US citizens concerned about the wellbeing of friends and family in India to get information and updates .
A travel advisory cautioning against travel to India was expected later in the day .
However , the Indian government did itself little credit with long periods of silence during a chaotic situation .
There were no Indian spokespersons available out of New Delhi or Mumbai for the world media is get a coherent account of what was happening even 24 hours after the crisis erupted .
CHAPPAQUA , N.Y .
IN the beginning , Brian and Jaclyn Rattner were focused on what their oldest child , Jarrett , could not do .
He could not talk , could not walk , did not play with toys , did not take to toilet training , missed most developmental milestones .
Hoping for a diagnosis and cure , they took him to research centers at Harvard and Yale .
Thinking it might be some rare genetic disorder like Tay - Sachs , which disproportionately affects Ashkenazi Jews , they had his blood shipped to Israel for analysis , and flew to England to meet with more specialists .
Ten years ago , at age 3 , he was given a diagnosis of Angelman syndrome , which is characterized by mental delays , jerky body motions and a good deal of smiling and laughing  Jarrett has a sweet disposition .
“ But then they undiagnosed him , ” Mr. Rattner said .
“ They did n’t know what it was , but it was n’t that . ”
And so the Rattners began focusing on who Jarrett was and what he could do .
When he wanted a ball , he would pound his chest until he got it .
“ Sometimes , he wants to communicate so badly , you can hear him from the other room pounding his chest , ” Mr. Rattner said .
“ There ’s a lot of emotion there . ”
The Labor Department reported Thursday that new applications filed for unemployment insurance rose by a seasonally adjusted 7,000 to 455,000 for the week ending Aug .
2 . The increase left claims at their highest level since late March 2002 .
A program to locate people eligible for jobless benefits played a role in the increase , a Labor Department analyst said .
However , the analyst could n't say how much of a role .
The latest snapshot of layoff filings was worse than analysts expected .
They were forecasting new claims to drop to around 430,000 .
The data disappointed Wall Street .
Stocks opened sharply lower .
The new layoff filings were distorted by the outreach program to notify people that they could qualify for additional benefits under a new law .
When people went to state claims offices to apply for these extended benefits , state officials discovered that some were eligible for -- but have n't filed for -- their initial unemployment benefits , the Labor Department analyst said .
That accounted for some of last week 's increase , he said .
Meanwhile , the four - week moving average of claims , which smooths out weekly fluctuations , rose to 419,500 last week , the highest since mid-July 2003 .
Inflammatory Republican rallies raise concerns Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday October 9 , 2008
Print This Email This Shouts of " terrorist " and even accusations of " treason " aimed at Barack Obama have echoed around Republican rallies , whipped up into alarming , hate - filled frenzies against the Democratic White House hopeful .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain has taken to asking , " Who is the real Barack Obama ? " at rallies this week , leading one supporter in Pennsylvania , a blue - collar battleground state to shout back , " he is a bomb . "
Before the rally , local Republican leader Bill Platt warmed up the crowd by several times referring to " Barack Hussein Obama , " focusing on the Illinois senator 's middle name and trying to highlight his differences with other Americans .
Chants of " Nobama , Nobama " mingled with cries of " terrorist , " as one banner in the crowd declared : " Go ahead , let the dogs out . "
The stream of vicious attacks against Obama , who has left McCain trailing in the polls , were ramped at the weekend by Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin who accused the Chicago senator of " palling around with terrorists . "
She was referring to Bill Ayers , a founding member of the Weathermen , a radical leftist group in the 1960s , who served with Obama as a board member on a charitable foundation from 1999 to 2001 .
Now when she mentions Obama , some of the crowds ' responses have escalated beyond boos and hisses , and there are fears among some observers that the attacks are going too far .
On Thursday the McCain campaign issued another hard - hitting negative commercial , slamming his rival 's judgement and candor and accusing him of not telling the truth about the extent of his acquaintance with Ayers .
Since her first vitriolic attacks , Palin has toned it down , but the campaign is not backing away from its negative tack .
" It 's about Senator Obama being candid and straight forward with the American people and their relationship , " McCain told Fox News .
" He has dismissed it by saying he was just a guy in the neighborhood .
You know it 's much more than that . "
Democratic vice presidential pick , Joseph Biden , has slammed the tone , telling ABC : " This is volatile stuff and ... I just thought we were kind of beyond this place . "
If Palin heard hate - filled shouts from the crowds , she should be " at least saying ' whoa , whoa , whoa that 's overboard , " Biden said Wednesday .
And in an email to supporters Biden said Thursday : " I 've heard some pretty unspeakable things in the past few days -- deeply offensive smears that we 'll hear over and over again until election day .
" Instead of focusing on the issues that really matter , our opponents are doing everything they can to encourage this toxic atmosphere . "
One of the language changes in the next C++ standard is the addition of rvalue - references .
While some people believe this mechanism will be used by a small number of library writers , I think that it will have a wider impact on the way we write software in C ++.
In either case , however , it will be beneficial to understand the nuances of rvalue - references even if you do n’t use them in your code directly .
Today I will cover the motivation and basics of rvalue - references , including some counter - intuitive aspects towards the end .
The next installment will deal with the changes that rvalue - references will bring to C++ programs .
While the next C++ standard still has some way to go before being published , the GCC team has implemented support for some parts of the standard in g++ 4.3 and 4.4 ( see C++0x Language Support in GCC for details ) .
All the sample code presented below can be tried with g++ 4.3.2 in the C++0 x mode ( the - std=c ++0 x option ) .
Every expression in C++ evaluates to either lvalue or rvalue .
The standard has a page - long list of rules that define these two terms .
It is more intuitive ( but less precise ) to think of an lvalue as referring to an object that has a name somewhere in the program .
This name can be a variable name or a pointer .
An rvalue refers to an object that does not have a name .
Here are some examples :
struct S {} ; S s ; s // lvalue S ( ) // rvalue S f ( ) ; S& g ( ) ; S* h ( ) ; f ( ) // rvalue g ( ) // lvalue *h ( ) // lvalue
The last two expressions are lvalues because one needs a named object to bind a reference to it or take its address .
Because an rvalue object is always allocated on the stack and is unnamed , its life is short ( unless bound to a const reference variable ) .
As a result , modifying an rvalue does not make much sense and usually means a programming error .
To prevent such errors C++ does not allow binding of non-const references to rvalues :
void f ( S& ) ; void g ( const S& ) ; f ( S ( ) ) ; // error g ( S ( ) ) ; // ok
An issue with the above rules arises when we want to make a copy of an rvalue and this operation is expensive .
Because the rvalue object will be gone immediately after we make the copy , “ transplanting ” the internals of an rvalue to our copy seems like a natural optimization .
Consider the following example :
struct IntVector { IntVector ( const IntVector& x ) { v_ = new int [ x.size_ ] ; size_ = x.size_ ; memcpy ( v_ , x.v_ , size_ * sizeof ( int ) ) ; } ... private : int* v_ ; size_t size_ ; } ; IntVector load ( ) { IntVector r ; //
Load the data into r. return r ; } IntVector v ( load ( ) ) ;
While some compilers may optimize the call to the copy constructor away ( RVO / NRVO optimization ) , this depends on the implementation of load ( ) and is not guaranteed .
What we would like here is to transfer the contents of the returned rvalue into v , something along these lines :
IntVector ( IntVector& x ) { v_ = x.v_ ; size_ = x.size_ ; x.v_ = 0 ; x.size_ = 0 ; }
This approach does not work for two reasons :
First , because we modify the source object , we have to pass it as a non-const reference .
But an rvalue can only be bound to a const reference .
Second , our new version of the copy constructor will just as happily transplant the internals of lvalues :
IntVector v1 ; IntVector v2 ( v1 ) ; // v1 is no longer usable
What we need is a special kind of reference that will bind to rvalues and allow their modification .
And that ’s exactly what the next version of the C++ standard adds : rvalue - references .
Unfortunately , the interaction of rvalue - references with lvalue - references ( that ’s what the plain old references are now called ) and the rest of the language is quite complex .
It is also fairly easy to shoot yourself in the foot , even as just the user of rvalue - optimized types .
What follows is the description of some of the rules governing rvalue - references .
An rvalue - reference of type T is declared as T&& .
The overload resolution between rvalue - and lvalue - references is similar to the way it works for const and non-const lvalue - references .
For example :
void f ( int& ) ; void f ( int&& ) ; void g ( int&& ) ; int h ( ) ; int i ; f ( i ) ; // f ( int& ) is called f ( h ( ) ) ; // f ( int&& ) is called g ( i ) ; // ok
That is , when passing an lvalue and the lvalue overload is available , it is preferred .
Otherwise , the rvalue version is called since an lvalue can be used anywhere an rvalue can .
This is a fairly important point which means that in the majority of cases when you provide a constructor or a function taking an rvalue - reference , you will also want to provide the overloaded version taking const an lvalue - reference .
Otherwise , lvalues will be treated as rvalues ( std : :move ( ) , which is discussed shortly , is one example where this behavior is actually desired ) .
Here is how we could overload our IntVector constructors :
IntVector ( const IntVector& x ) { v_ = new int [ x.size_ ] ; size_ = x.size_ ; memcpy ( v_ , x.v_ , size_ * sizeof ( int ) ) ; } IntVector ( IntVector&& x ) { v_ = x.v_ ; size_ = x.size_ ; x.v_ = 0 ; x.size_ = 0 ; }
Let ’s consider the call to load ( ) once again :
IntVector v ( load ( ) ) ;
If the compiler did n’t optimize the copying of the return value , the process works as follows .
The r object inside the function is first copied into a temporary and then destroyed .
After load ( ) returns , the v object is copy - constructed from the temporary and the temporary is destroyed .
The new constructor now takes care of efficiently copying the data from the temporary returned by load ( ) to the v object .
But what about the other half of the process .
Namely copying of the r object inside the load ( ) function to the temporary ?
The r object is an lvalue and , as a result , the expensive copy constructor will be used .
One way to solve this would be to explicitly convert r to an rvalue - reference with the help of std::move ( ) :
IntVector load ( ) { IntVector r ; //
Load the data into r. return std::move ( r ) ; }
std ::move( ) simply converts any rvalue or lvalue to an rvalue reference :
template < typename T > typename remove_reference <T>:: type&& move ( T&& x ) { return x ; }
While this works , it sure is verbose and easy to forget .
Plus , in template code we do n’t know whether the argument type has a constructor capable of taking an rvalue - reference .
The C++ standard fixes this in quite an interesting way .
The standard provides criteria when a C++ compiler is allowed to optimize away temporaries and copying that is used to return a value from a function ( called elision of copy operations ) .
While compilers can perform this optimization , they are not required to do so .
But then the standard adds that when the criteria for elision of copy operations are met but the compiler is not performing such elision and the object to copy is an lvalue , then the overload resolution to select the copy constructor is first performed as if the object were an rvalue .
One of the criteria for elision of copy operations is returning an automatic ( stack - allocated ) object .
If you think about it , it makes perfect sense : the object being copied is essentially an rvalue since it will be destroyed once the copying is complete and nobody else can access it between now and then .
All this means that in our implementation of load ( ) when we return the result , the r object is first considered as if it were an rvalue and the fast constructor will be called automatically without us explicitly calling std::move ( ) .
Now to the less intuitive side of rvalue - references .
Named rvalue - references are treated as lvalues while unnamed rvalue - references are treated as rvalues .
In other words , once an rvalue - reference is given a name , it starts acting as an lvalue .
The following code snippet helps illustrate this point :
void f ( int& ) ; int&& g ( ) ; int&& i = 2 ; f ( i ) ; // ok f ( g ( ) ) ; // error
Without keeping this in mind , it is natural to expect one thing but get something completely different :
void f ( const int& ) ; void f ( int&& ) ; void g ( int&& x ) { f ( x ) ; // calls f ( const int& ) }
If we wanted to call f( int&& ) , we would need to first convert x to an unnamed rvalue - reference , for example , with the help of std::move ( ) :
void g ( int&& x ) { f ( std:: move ( x ) ) ; // calls f ( int&& ) }
Another interesting aspect of rvalue - references is what happens when we try to create an rvalue - reference to lvalue - reference or vice versa .
While this cannot be done directly ( T&&& is illegal ) , it is easy to achieve , most likely unintentionally , with typedef or template type arguments .
In this case , the resulting type will always be an lvalue - reference :
typedef int& ilr ; typedef int&& irr ; void f ( int& ) {} void f ( ilr&& ) {} // error : same as void f ( int& ) void f ( irr& ) {} // error : same as void f ( int& ) template < typename T > void g ( T& ) ; template < typename T > void h ( T&& ) ; g< int&& > (.. ) ; // void g ( int& ) h < int& > (.. ) ; // void h ( int& )
Next time : how rvalue - references will affect the way we write software in C ++.

The 150 yard - long passageway was found in northwest Mexico less than 65 yards from the US border and close to the California town of Calexico .
It was 1.4 yards wide and 5.4 yards below ground with an electric rail for transporting containers , ventilation , lights and air - conditioning , according to Juan Miguel Guillen , director of police in Mexico ’s northern Baja California state .
Officials discovered the clandestine passage after reports of suspicious activity , including the presence of armed men , at a house in Mexicali , across the border from Calexico .
They moved in and arrested eight suspects , found below ground digging the tunnel .
“ The detainees confessed that they were looking after the building where a drug tunnel was being built , ” Mr Guillen told Agence France Presse .
Agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration were conducting excavations to discover the planned exit point for the tunnel on US soil .
The tunnel ’s lift was operated by a hydraulic pulley .
Police also found a gun , digging tools and a truck used to cart away the excavated earth at the scene .

Over 70 % of men would give up a night out to play nursemaid ... but women are less likely to
But the nation ’s men in fact appear to get very little TLC when they fall ill .
A wife ’s sympathy for a partner with a cold lasts just five minutes , according to new research .
Most wives and girlfriends are happy to admit they are more cold hearted than cold curing .
But when it is women who are suffering , men will not only mop their brow but will even take a day off to look after them , the study found .
The figures from cold remedy Lemsip Max All In One reverses the traditional image of females nursemaiding malingering husbands or boyfriends through the sniffles .
It found 52 per cent of women lose sympathy for their under - the - weather partner after five minutes of moaning .
And 18 per cent do n’t even last that long , admitting they start off being unsympathetic .
But in the cold war of the sexes , when the shoe ’s on the other foot , men see themselves as Florence Nightingales at the first sign of a sneeze .
Seventy per cent claim to be sympathetic but many go further , with 60 per cent doing the housework and 64 per cent cooking dinner .
Lemsip surveyed 1,300 adults to launch a product it claims works after just five minutes .
It found only 19 per cent of women have taken a day off to look after their man while 37 of men have done the same for their wife or girlfriend .
Women are also less likely to give up a night out to nursemaid their partner ( 56 per cent ) , while 73 per cent of men would .
Perhaps it is the fuss men make when they get the sniffles , but other findings also suggest that women are less than generous about a bed - ridden boyfriend .
Almost three in 10 ( 29 per cent ) take one look at him and think “ he ’s going to be grumpy all day ” the survey found , while 28 per cent just think “ hurry up and get better ” , and one in 10 men claims to have been told not to be a hypochondriac .
Men by contrast present themselves as saintlike in comparison with 48 per cent claiming their first thought is “ poor thing ” when their partner is unwell , although only 13 per cent of women said their partners had looked after them .

In a rare moment for California , it is cold and raining this morning .
But as I pulled up to my voting place , I noticed many people braving the rain ( ok , in CA it ’s more like a dirzzle ) , and the cold ( it was a “ freezing ” 65 degrees ! ) , many of them eager–almost too eager–to cast their vote .
In a rare moment of confidence and temerity for Democrats , there were folks along the street carrying Obama / Biden signs and chanting “ O - BA - MA , O - BA - MA ! ”
Do n’t worry , crazy , nutjob Republicans , these guys were the requisite distance away .
In a rare moment , it seems people are truly aching for change , and a new , functional , productive direction in America .
Let ’s hope this rare moment in my home state of California translates to a rare moment of sanity across this nation the likes of which America has not seen in eight years .
Advertisements
It ’s about 8 am in California and I just got home from casting my votes ( oops … did I say votes ?
I meant vote … this is n’t Florida in 2000 or Ohio in 2004 after all ) .
Yes , I voted for the Great Savior Barack Obama .
Unashamed .
Unabashed .
Not to sound cliched , but this country simply cannot endure four more years of the same ; and truly , God forbid , something happens to John McCain and Sarah Palin became president … that wo n’t be a rare moment , but rather , a downright scary moment .
Let me take a moment to address my fellow Californians .
My friends , ( why does that phrase suddenly sound so ” losely … ” )
Folks , please , please , seriously consider voting NO on Proposition 8 .
I understand there are deep religious beliefs involved , some strong morals some are standing on , but if we collective step back for just one rare moment , and looked at this proposition objectively , I think we can all see that it is simply wrong .
According to the official language of the propostion ( from the State Department of California , not a biased side or the other ) , passage would “ eliminate the right of same - sex couples to marry and provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid and recognized in CA . ”
Passage of Prop 8 would actually change the Constitution of the state .
This is a big deal .
It would actually deny a group of people a right .
Whatever you believe , however you feel , my friends , folks , looking at this proposition not through religious or ideological eyes , but through American eyes , we can conclude together that this initiative wishes to constitutionalize the deprivation of rights .
Look back at American history and examine the best ideals of this nation and its founding ; we revolted because we felt we were being deprived of rights … certain unalienable rights .
We pushed for life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
These truths , we claimed , were self evident .
Why deny unalienable rights and happiness ?
Even in our daily pledge to the flag , we ended with a powerful thought : one nation , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all .
Liberty .
And justice .
For All .
Many of us have learned through studies , and regretfully , some of us have experienced first hand , when liberty and justice for all was n’t for all .
There was a time when interracial marriages were illegal ( and decried as immoral ) unless the male was white , then everything was fine ; Japanese - American citizens were rounded up and interned right here in California ; shoot , for that matter , Chinese and Koreans were treated horribly because they looked Japanese .
We ’ve seen these kinds of actions before … too many times .
Believe what you belive , that ’s fine .
But same - sex marraige does n’t change your life and it does n’t deny you any of your rights .
Why not offer them the same courtesy ?
And to input discrimination ( and hate ) into the state ’s constitution is just wrong .
In our federal Constitution , we once had discrimination .
Blacks were 3/5 of a person ;
Blacks were denied the right to vote ; women were denied the right to vote .
But we realized deprivation of rights was just unAmerican and we amended our minds , our hearts , and our Constitution .
This is no different .
Deprivation of rights is never right .
Separate but equal , time and again , proves to be amazingly separate , but it is never equal .
Please vote No on Prop 8 …
.. or tonight , after work , I ’ll have to go back a second time to vote dressed in my Mickey Mouse suit , carrying my ACORN - provided registration .
Cases Against Detainees Have Thinned
By Del Quentin Wilber – Washington Post Staff Writer

Â Â Â Algerians ’ Habeas Corpus Hearings Will Begin With Fewer and Lesser Charges
The six Algerians were scooped up in Bosnia and shuttled to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in early 2002 .
Days later , President Bush proclaimed in his State of the Union address that the men had been plotting to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo .
The case would seem to be an easy victory for the Bush administration , which is preparing to defend the men ’s lengthy detentions in landmark federal court proceedings scheduled to begin this week .
But the government is backpedaling .
The charges of plotting to blow up the embassy have been dropped .
Other allegations , made by a witness whom federal prosecutors called a liar in court filings five years ago , have dissolved .
The government now justifies the detentions on far narrower grounds :
It says the men were planning to travel to Afghanistan to fight U.S. forces .
Lawyers who have represented Guantanamo Bay detainees say those developments could not have occurred without the prospect of habeas corpus hearings looming over the government .
For the first time since Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , opened six years ago , the government must justify a captive ’s detention before an impartial federal judge with no connection to the military , which enforces the detainees ’ confinement .
“ We ’ve always said that when the government ’s lawyers have to stand up and defend their so - called evidence in front of a judge , many of their allegations on paper are going to crumble to dust , ” said Shayana Kadidal , an attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights , which is representing many of the detainees .
The government recently also has withdrawn allegations that another detainee is linked to a high - profile “ dirty bomb ” plot .
Together , the legal moves raise questions about the government ’s claims over the years that it has disrupted imminent terrorism threats .
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment .
Scott Silliman , a former military prosecutor and attorney and a professor of national security law at Duke University , reviewed the government ’s public court filings , which were heavily redacted .
He said he was “ surprised at how weak the government ’s case ” is against the Algerians .
But , Silliman noted , the Justice Department is holding a potentially powerful weapon in reserve .
The government told U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon that lawyers also had filed a set of secret documents that he should review only if he “ determines that the weight of the evidence otherwise supports ” the Algerians ’ release .
Robert Kirsch and Stephen H. Olesky , attorneys for the Algerians , have reviewed other classified documents in the matter and said they want access to that information .
Legal experts say filing such secret evidence is unusual but not unprecedented .
The six Algerians won their access to federal court in June , when the Supreme Court granted all Guantanamo Bay detainees the right of habeas corpus – literally “ present the body ” – in its ruling in Boumediene v. Bush .
Lakhdar Boumediene is one of the Algerians .
It was the third Supreme Court victory for detainees in a legal battle they have waged collectively for years .
Leon is overseeing the cases of 24 detainees .
A second federal judge is pushing to hold hearings in the cases of eight detainees .
A third judge is overseeing the cases brought by about 150 detainees to work out common legal and factual issues before sending them to other judges .
Legal scholars and the detainees ’ attorneys acknowledge that the hearings probably will not lead to quick release of the captives , regardless of the strength of the government ’s evidence .
They note that the Justice Department is vigorously appealing a federal judge ’s Oct. 7 order in a separate case that freed 17 Chinese Muslims at Guantanamo Bay to come to the United States .
“ No matter how fast the judges hold hearings , you are looking at a year or two of litigation , appealing and contesting rulings , ” said Robert Chesney , a national security law professor at Wake Forest University .
As Justice Department lawyers and attorneys for the detainees have sparred in court over the past few months , some judges have looked skeptically on government claims .
A few weeks ago , the government withdrew accusations that a detainee was plotting a dirty - bomb attack in the United States .
A federal judge said Thursday that he was suspicious of the government ’s motives for withdrawing those allegations .
The withdrawal came just weeks after he had ordered the Justice Department to turn over exculpatory evidence to the detainee ’s attorneys .
In the case of the Chinese Muslims , the government did not even present evidence to the federal judge to justify the detentions after its facts and legal theories were sharply criticized by an appeals court in another proceeding .
Leon is expected to hold hearings for the six Algerians over six days beginning Thursday , the detainees ’ attorneys said .
The judge has told the government that it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence , the burden in civil cases , that the detentions are justified .
The detainees ’ attorneys said their clients will be able to watch some of the proceedings and testify by video or audio links .
In a pertinent ruling Monday , Leon said he would use a 2004 military definition of “ enemy combatant ” that was later approved by Congress .
To continue to hold a detainee , the government must prove he is “ an individual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al - Qaeda forces , or associated forces , that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners , ” Leon said .
“ This includes any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities of enemy armed forces . ”
The six Algerians were living in Bosnia – five also had dual Bosnian citizenship – when they were arrested by Bosnian authorities in the weeks after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks at the request of the U.S. government .
U.S. officials alleged that the men had ties to terrorists and were plotting to attack U.S. interests in the region .
Over the next three months , Bosnian authorities investigated the men ’s backgrounds but found no links to terrorism , according to court filings by Alija Behmen , who at the time was Bosnia ’s prime minister .
The Bosnian Supreme Court ordered them released on Jan. 17 , 2002 , ruling that there was not enough evidence to hold them .
The Bosnian Human Rights Chamber issued a separate decision saying the men could not be deported .
But under pressure from the U.S. government , Behmen said , Bosnian authorities handed them over to the U.S. military on Jan. 18 .
Just days later , Bush proclaimed in his State of the Union address that “ our soldiers , working with the Bosnian government , seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy . ”
Besides withdrawing the bombing accusations , Justice Department lawyers also have pulled back on charges that one of the men trained at a military - skills camp in Afghanistan to fight in Bosnia ’s civil war in the early 1990s and worked for a charity that was later designated a terrorism sponsor by the U.S. government .
Those allegations were made by a felon sentenced to 10 years in prison on federal racketeering charges .
In 2003 , prosecutors wrote in court filings that the man , Enaam M. Arnaout , former director of an Islamic charity who is alleged to have ties to Osama bin Laden , was not reliable and “ lied openly and notoriously ” about his conduct .
“ The government ’s much broader , far - reaching allegations are starting to collapse , ” said Kirsch , one of the lawyers representing the Algerians in federal court .
By dropping the bomb - plotting accusation and Arnaout ’s statements , the government has been left to argue that one of the men , Belkacem Bensayah , was an “ al - Qaeda member , facilitator and financier ” and had “ significant ties to other members ” of the terrorist group , according to federal court filings .
The government has alleged that the other Algerians had ties to Bensayah and that some worked for charities later accused by the U.S. government of having ties to terrorist groups , according to the detainees ’ attorneys and government documents .
U.S. authorities have said in military court that Bensayah “ had conversations ” with al - Qaeda operative Zayn al - Abidin Muhammed Hussein , better known as Abu Zubaydah – who was subjected to waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques while in CIA custody – and made 70 phone calls to Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 . attacks .
House prices were at their peak a year ago House prices will not get back to the levels they peaked at in 2007 until 2013 , the Centre for Economics and Business Research ( CEBR ) has predicted .
The group also forecast that prices would fall in value by 25 % from their peak to a trough at the end of 2009 .
It would mean an estimated 2.5 million homeowners could face negative equity .
The predictions of UK house price falls are similar to those made by the chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society , Graham Beale , last month .
The price drops have been welcomed by some who argue that many were priced out of the market when prices rocketed .
Predictions
If proved correct , the prediction from the CEBR would mean the value of the average home would have dropped to £ 157,058 by the end of 2009 .
Now that the financial crisis turns into an economic crisis with rising unemployment and falling household incomes , we could see house price falls starting to accelerate again
Ben Read , CEBR
Persimmon 's prices down 10 %
That represents a decrease in value of about £ 50,000 from the peak in the housing market a year ago .
Prices are expected to be broadly flat in 2010 , before rising by about 20 % during 2011 and 2012 , the CEBR forecasts .
In an interview with the BBC last month , Nationwide chief Graham Beale said he was not expecting any signs of a recovery in the market until 2010 .
He also said the pattern of price falls next year would be similar to this year .
The Council of Mortgage Lenders recently claimed that any short - term prediction of house prices was " futile " before there was clarity after the recent volatility in the market .
But the lenders ' group also joined an emerging market consensus that prices would continue to fall until the end of next year .
Other lenders are expected to give their forecasts for the coming year in November and December .
Mortgage drought
The CEBR suggested that the lack of will among banks to lend to each other , and therefore to homeowners was a key factor in determining house prices .

" Confidence in the housing market has been shattered as lack of mortgage availability has left few sellers chasing even fewer buyers , and expectations of falling prices have become embedded , " said Ben Read , managing economist at CEBR .
" Now that the financial crisis has turned into an economic crisis with rising unemployment and falling household incomes , we could see house price falls starting to accelerate again . "
But he argued that this would be offset to some degree by " aggressive cuts in interest rates " , at least some of which would be passed on to homebuyers .
The next decision on interest rates by the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled for next week , although the possibility of co-ordinated moves by central banks has again been mooted .
The rescue package for the banks would also start to free up lending , and Mr Read suggested that this would help transactions to rise sharply in 2010 .
Waiting time Nearly a third of UK properties for sale have been on the market for more than six months , and 12 % have been unsold since the start of the year , according to property search engine Globrix .
This was seen the most in Aberystwyth , where 70 % of properties for sale had been on the market for more than six months , followed by Merthyr Tydfil ( 62 % ) , Rochdale ( 52 % ) , Shrewsbury ( 49 % ) and Oldham ( 48 % ) .
In the major cities , 41 % of properties for sale in Liverpool have been without a buyer for more than six months compared with 25 % in Bristol .
" Mortgage finance is a lot tougher to secure and many sellers still are not dropping their prices to realistic levels .
They are in 2008 but have a 2005 mindset , " said Daniel Lee , of Globrix .

Barack Obama will move swiftly to unpick many of what he sees as the most egregious acts of the Bush administration when he enters the White House in January , including restrictions on stem cell research and moves to allow oil drilling in wilderness areas , a leading member of his transition team said yesterday .
John Podesta , a former chief of staff to Bill Clinton whom Obama has put in joint charge of his transition process , indicated the incoming president would use extraordinary powers to force through rapid change .
" There 's a lot the president can do using his executive authority without waiting for congressional action , and I think we 'll see the president do that , " Podesta said .
Podesta singled out restrictions applied by George Bush , in 2001 , on federal funding of stem cell research , as well as recent moves by the White House to dilute environmental protections against oil drilling , as two areas in which quick action may be taken .
" You see the Bush administration , even today , moving aggressively to do things that are probably not in the interest of the country , " he said .
Podesta 's comments could be interpreted as a warning to the Bush administration not to forge ahead with controversial decisions in the weeks of transition , a ploy used by many outgoing presidents .
According to the Washington Post , a team of about 50 Obama advisers have worked for months identifying some 200 Bush policies that are possible targets .
Other areas of action may include reproductive rights , food and drug regulation and immigration enforcement .
Podesta 's signal that the new administration would act quickly to negate several key provisions left by the outgoing one came as the president and president - elect prepared to meet today .
Bush will show Obama around the White House , followed by private talks likely to focus on national security , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the economic crisis .
Since last Tuesday 's election , Obama and his team have focused on the economy , which they have underlined as their number one priority .
But by flagging up stem cells and drilling , the team has also indicated it means to move on several fronts , meeting the expectation of change unleashed by Obama 's campaign .
A volley of executive orders reversing key Bush policies would have the benefits of being relatively quick to implement , as they would not involve congressional approval , and of costing little money .
Stem cell research has been a rallying cause for American liberals since Bush blocked federal funding for all but a few sources of old cells in August 2001 .
Scientists have complained the restrictions , inspired by the Christian right , have held back US dynamism in a research field seen as a possible route to cures for conditions such as Alzheimer's .
Podesta pointed to attempts by the Bush administration in its dying days to expose tracts of public land in the west to oil and gas drilling .
In recent weeks the US Bureau of Land Management has offered up about 360,000 acres in Utah to oil and gas companies , with auctions of the leases likely before Obama takes over .
" They want to have oil and gas drilling in some of the most sensitive , fragile lands in Utah .
I think that 's a mistake , " Podesta said .
The Sierra Club , the country 's largest grassroots environmental organisation , said it was concerned about last - minute changes from the Bush administration .
" They have consistently weakened protections over the last eight years , and we are encouraged that the Obama team plans to act to clean up the mess when they get into office , " the club said .
Tony Blair , reacting to Obama 's victory yesterday , said : " There is this huge weight of expectation , but it is at least possible to meet a reasonable part of those expectations . "
Warren Buffett gave a three - hour interview in August .
Here 's an interesting bit from the transcript :
QUICK : If you imagine where things will go with Fannie and Freddie , and you think about the regulators , where were the regulators for what was happening , and can something like this be prevented from happening again ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , it 's really an incredible case study in regulation
because something called OFHEO was set up in 1992 by Congress , and the sole job of OFHEO was to watch over Fannie and Freddie , someone to watch over them .
And they were there to evaluate the soundness and the accounting and all of that .
Two companies were all they had to regulate .
OFHEO has over 200 employees now .
They have a budget now that 's $ 65 million a year , and all they have to do is look at two companies .
I mean , you know , I look at more than two companies .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : And they sat there , made reports to the Congress , you can get them on the Internet , every year .
And , in fact , they reported to Sarbanes and Oxley every year .
And they went -- wrote 100 page reports , and they said , ' We 've looked at these people and their standards are fine and their directors are fine and everything was fine . '
And then all of a sudden you had two of the greatest accounting misstatements in history .
You had all kinds of management malfeasance , and it all came out .
And , of course , the classic thing was that after it all came out , OFHEO wrote a 350-- 340 page report examining what went wrong , and they blamed the management , they blamed the directors , they blamed the audit committee .
They did n't have a word in there about themselves , and they 're the ones that 200 people were going to work every day with just two companies to think about .
It just shows the problems of regulation .
QUICK : That sounds like an argument against regulation , though .
Is that what you 're saying ?
Mr. BUFFETT : It 's an argument explaining -- it 's an argument that managing complex financial institutions where the management wants to deceive you can be very , very difficult .

THE waiters at Martin ’s Tavern in Georgetown see a lot of Chris Matthews , host of the opinionated “ Hardball ” and the lower temperature , eponymously named Sunday - morning discussion hour on MSNBC .
“ It ’s very Christmas -y here .
Very pubby .
I ’ll have clam chowder and prime rib , ” he said , in his trademark rapid - fire delivery .
He ’s been a regular here since 1971 .
“ It was a big State Department hangout .
C.I.A .
It ’s got that reputation .
Old Washington . ”
It was exactly one week to Election Day and Mr. Matthews was in the “ Truman booth ” offering his opinion on everything .
On Web versus print : “ If you do n’t get newsprint , you do n’t get the peripheral vision  you do n’t pick up the odd story . ”
CLEVELAND -- Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's house got a new coat of paint , but it was n't done with brushes or rollers .
Two unknown vandals , believed to be teenagers , shot Kucinich 's house last week with paint balls .
The congressman 's wife , Elizabeth , told police she heard banging noises on the side of their Milan Avenue home about 1:30 a.m. Thursday .
When the sun rose , she noticed the paint balls .
Later that night , the vandals returned and lobbed more orange paint balls on the front and side of the house .
Elizabeth Kucinich watched the teens sprint away and jump fences through the neighborhood .
She then washed the paint away with a hose , a police report said .
Police have no suspects .

Some large IT projects are more successful than they deserve to be .
It 's time for post - project analysis that will benchmark a projects circumstances and capture the risks in assuming that other projects will produce similar results .
One of my current favorite books is Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicolas Taleb .
Taleb ’s thesis , which he explains and defends well , is that we often attribute to talent and insight great results that were actually more a matter of luck — a fortunate random outcome that might well have turned out otherwise .
Taleb ’s examples are largely taken from his own professional experience on Wall Street , where he saw mediocre ( in his opinion ) traders succeed and count themselves brilliant in a particular market situation , only to be “ blown up ” — take such great losses that they were fired or wiped out financially — when the market situation changed .
Taleb ’s thesis has , I believe , application to large - scale IT projects as well .
We focus largely on projects that struggle or fail , and if we ’re really wise , we conduct project postmortems to learn what went wrong and how to do better next time .
However , when a large IT project succeeds , we tend to chalk it up to our collective brilliance without ever doing a postmortem analysis to learn whether we really caused it to succeed — that is , if we had started from the same point and had done the same things , would the project still have been as successful ?
Because the answer is n’t always “ yes . ”
Some large IT projects are more successful than they deserve to be .
That is , if you could roll back time and start the same project over and over again , it might only end up being successful 50 percent , 30 percent or even 10 percent of the time .
In my prior column on IT project metrics , I listed some of the reasons why it ’s hard to predict just where an IT project stands and how long it will take to complete it .
Those same factors ( among others ) represent areas of risk through the history of a given IT project , particularly where they involve human creativeness , insight and effort .
Because of the extensive interconnectedness of IT project tasks and deliverables , and the resulting critical paths that form , a single slip in a single area — say , delivery and configuration of production hardware , fixing a critical defect or scaling a key algorithm — can cause the entire project to slip on a day - for - day basis .
But sometimes with projects that really should n’t succeed — that are attempting too much , too fast , with too many risks — enough things go right , particularly along the critical paths , enough superhuman effort is made by those involved , so that the project does indeed go into production on time and possibly even under budget .
Upper management is thrilled ; the development team looks great ; and all ’s right in heaven .
And that ’s when the real trouble begins .
Why ?
Because most likely no one has actually done the analysis to see why this project ended up succeeding and whether it would likely succeed if repeated under the same circumstances .
This is the point that Taleb hammers home : the need to re-run ( in simulation or analysis ) the same sequence of events with reasonable success / failure probabilities as well as the impact of each outcome ( that is , success or failure ) .
This lets you know whether the project ’s success was a fluke or a reasonable expectation .
Since no one has done that analysis , upper management usually assumes that it was a reasonable expectation — due , no doubt , to their leadership — and that subsequent IT projects started under similar circumstances should likewise succeed .
And so right at the point when those in the IT trenches — who are usually pretty clear on what a “ [ close ] - run thing ” the project really was , to paraphrase Wellington at Waterloo — wipe their brows over a disaster averted , upper management tells them to do it again , but faster or better , or both .
Since the odds were against the original project succeeding as it did , the chances of this follow - up project succeeding are likely even smaller .
Thus , the danger of delivering on time and under budget — what an irony !
In IT projects , we often stress the need for managing expectations , particularly of upper - level executives and business - side sponsors .
However , we tend to do this at the start of and during the project itself .
We do n’t usually think about the need to do so at a project ’s end , particularly when a project has been successful .
But that is just as critical a time to manage expectations , to clearly lay out the odds against the project having succeeded as it did , and the risks in assuming that similar projects under similar circumstances will produce similar results .
In short , while we should be grateful for any IT project success , we should not be fooled by it .
We need to be clear ourselves — and make clear to others who matter — just how and why the project succeeded .

Like many frustrated Democrats , the rhetoric of this election has made me angrier than I 've been in a long time .
But none of my previous agitation has matched the fury I felt during Wednesday night 's debate when John McCain snidely responded to Obama 's health care plan , " If you like that , you 'll love Canada and England " .
I became so enraged that I thought I was going to burst a blood vessel .
But happily , I do live in England , so I was n't worried about being able to afford to get a doctor to treat it .
I took McCain 's statement rather personally because I have lived in both Canada and England since leaving the US in 1999 , and benefited not just from their universal health care systems , but from exposure to societies in which health care is rightly regarded as a human right that should be provided – and regulated – in the public sector , rather than managed by corporations .
I have come to realise that it is the only civilised option .
And yet America has managed to avoid it , until now , under the guise of maintaining freedom .
I was among the lucky ones when I lived in the US : my father worked for a large multinational corporation and his benefits package was decent .
That said , when I was an asthmatic adolescent , my parents were sometimes paying hundreds of dollars a month , even with insurance , when I had to visit the doctor several times a week at $ 15 a shot and took six prescription drugs simultaneously .
Coping with this added financial burden that was manageable , but not easily , for my middle - class one - income family .
It would have been untenable for many of the families of the nearly five million American kids with asthma .
We are all aware that Americans are increasingly cash - strapped , but now we 're cutting back on health care – according to a current Washington Post survey , a quarter of Americans have skipped doctor 's appointments because of the cost .
Preventative tests are becoming luxuries for Americans .
Long waiting lists here in the UK because of limited resources are one thing , but having to choose between having an MRI scan to look for tumours and paying your mortgage is quite another .
This price is too high to pay for the so - called freedom of choice that McCain 's health care is supposed to protect , especially when the $ 5 K tax break that he is offering to help people for health care falls far short of the cost of insurance for most families , particularly if anyone has any kind of chronic illness .
We Americans like to proudly say that our country 's health care is the greatest in the world , and it is true that we have some of the best and most innovative treatment available , thanks to our top - class research institutes and hospitals .
But the statistics are revealing and dispiriting : this great health care is simply not available to too many of the most vulnerable .
One of the most stark examples ?
We have the second worst infant mortality rate in the developed world .
Black mothers , who are poorer on average , are more than twice as likely than white mothers to lose babies as infants .
In Baltimore , two districts divided by three miles and a large difference in average incomes have been found this week to have average life expectancies of 83 years and 63 years ( guess which one is wealthier ) .
Yes , the National Health Service has some serious flaws - last time I was at the doctor I looked over his shoulder and spotted on the computer a slightly embarrassing permanent note on my record that I was ' aggressive ' because I once argued with a doctor who would n't prescribe a drug for my asthma that I was used to getting in the US .
But ultimately , universal health care it is simply a more humane system – something you'd think that John McCain , who often cites his experience of inhumane treatment , might be in favour of .
I 'd rather contend with occasional NHS mediocrity and have the confidence that if I do have a severe illness ( or for that matter , decide to have a baby ) I 'll be in safe hands and wo n't ever face bankruptcy trying to pay medical bills .
John McCain , do I love Canada and England ?
You betcha ' !
I call the first fact the Great Partisan Growth Divide .
Simply put , the United States economy has grown faster , on average , under Democratic presidents than under Republicans .
Image Credit ... David G. Klein
The stark contrast between the whiz - bang Clinton years and the dreary Bush years is familiar because it is so recent .
But while it is extreme , it is not atypical .
Data for the whole period from 1948 to 2007 , during which Republicans occupied the White House for 34 years and Democrats for 26 , show average annual growth of real gross national product of 1.64 percent per capita under Republican presidents versus 2.78 percent under Democrats .
That 1.14 - point difference , if maintained for eight years , would yield 9.33 percent more income per person , which is a lot more than almost anyone can expect from a tax cut .
Such a large historical gap in economic performance between the two parties is rather surprising , because presidents have limited leverage over the nation ’s economy .
Most economists will tell you that Federal Reserve policy and oil prices , to name just two influences , are far more powerful than fiscal policy .
Furthermore , as those mutual fund prospectuses constantly warn us , past results are no guarantee of future performance .
But statistical regularities , like facts , are stubborn things .
You bet against them at your peril .
The second big historical fact , which might be called the Great Partisan Inequality Divide , is the focus of Professor Bartels ’s work .
The Dow dropped below 9,600 Monday after global markets took a pounding amid fear that the credit crisis is spreading around the globe .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 700 points , or 7 percent , falling through 10,000 and quickly breaching 9,900 , 9,800 , 9,700 and 9,600 in rapid succession , levels it has n't seen in nearly four years .
The Dow first hit 10,000 at the end of March , 1999 .
( Track the Dow winners and losers . )
" There are absolutely no buyers , " Matt Cheslock , a senior specialist at Cohen Specialists ,
And with the credit markets frozen , " equities are a source of liquidity right now , " he said .
To put the Dow 's decline in perspective , we 're not even halfway to the first circuit - breaker trigger levelannounced by the NYSE last week .
According to the fourth - quarter guidelines , an 1100 - point drop in the Dow before 2 p.m. will halt trading for one hour , a 2200 - point drop before 1 p.m. will stop trading for two hours , and a 3350 - point drop will shut down trading for the rest of the day , regardless of what time it occurs .
" We 'd actually like to see a little more panic , " Cheslock said .
" Then you get stocks that go down and bounce , " enticing buyers , he said .
" Eighteen percent might seem like a discount but when you do n't get a bounce it 's not .
The stock could go down another 2 percent , " he explained .
The S&P 500 was down about 7 percent , while the Nasdaq lost more than 7 percent .
The CBOE Volatility Index , widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market , soared to a record above 50 .
There were nearly 1,000 new intraday lows set on the New York Stock Exchange , the highest since 1998 .
And 48 percent of stocks in the U.S. are sitting at 52 - week lows .
The fear sent a ripple through markets around the world : Latin American markets were at their session lows ; trading was halted twice in Brazil after the index dropped 15 percent .
European stock markets had their worst day in four years , with most indexes shedding 7 percent or more , amid fear that the credit crisis has spread to European banks .
Asian markets also took a hit , with Japan 's Nikkei 225 Average dropping more than 4 percent .
MOYERS : You 've written three hundred and ninety - one books , you read about everything from supernovas to the invention of hay , you have no researchers or clerical help , you do your own filing , your own phoning .
When I called to ask you about this interview , you answered the phone yourself .
How do you organize it all ?
How do you keep up ?
ASIMOV : When I started out , I assumed that with luck , I 'd sell a few dozen stories in my life , so I would n't need a secretary or a very fancy filing system .
I just made do with card files and my memory .
Things got more and more complicated , but never so rapidly that I felt called upon to change .
It 's like the ancient story of Milo of Croton , who is supposed to have lifted a calf every day until finally he was lifting a full - grown bull .
Here I am with a full - grown bull .
MOYERS : A Bell Labs report said there is more information in a single edition of the New York Times than a man or woman in the sixteenth century had to process in the whole of his or her life .
You seem to keep up .
ASIMOV : You know how we get away with it ?
When you read the New York Times , you read almost nothing in it .
You 're looking for things that interest you , so most of the things just pass under your eyes without notice .
MOYERS : Is that what you do when you are researching ?
Do you learn to discriminate ?
ASIMOV : I must , otherwise I could never get through everything .
It 's impossible for me to go through the New York Times and not see an article that in any way reflects on science .
But on the other hand , it 's impossible for me to go through the New York Times and notice anything that reflects on fashion .
MOYERS : Do you think that we can educate ourselves , that any one of us , at any time , can be educated in any subject that strikes our fancy ?
ASIMOV : The key words here are " that strikes our fancy . "
There are some things that simply do n't strike my fancy , and I doubt that I can force myself to be educated in them .
On the other hand , when there 's a subject I 'm ferociously interested in , then it is easy for me to learn about it .
I take it in gladly and cheerfully .
I 've written more books on astronomy than on any other science , but I 've never taken a course in astronomy .
I 'm completely self - trained in it .
On the other hand , I 've written relatively few books on chemistry , which is my field of training .
I 've got a Ph.D. in chemistry , but I know too much chemistry to get excited over it .
MOYERS : Learning really excites you , does n't it ?
ASIMOV : Just yesterday I read about the invention of hay in Freeman Dyson 's new book .
The thought that occurred to me was , " Why is it I never thought of this ?
How is it I never knew about this ?
What made me think that hay existed from the first day of creation ? "
MOYERS : What is exciting about that ?
ASIMOV : I think it 's the actual process of broadening yourself , of knowing there 's now a little extra facet of the universe you know about and can think about and can understand .
It seems to me that when it 's time to die , there would be a certain pleasure in thinking that you had utilized your life well , learned as much as you could , gathered in as much as possible of the universe , and enjoyed it .
There 's only this one universe and only this one lifetime to try to grasp it .
And while it is inconceivable that anyone can grasp more than a tiny portion of it , at least you can do that much .
What a tragedy just to pass through and get nothing out of it .
MOYERS : When I learn something new - and it happens every day - I feel a little more at home in this universe , a little more comfortable in the nest .
I 'm afraid that by the time I begin to feel really at home , it 'll be over .
ASIMOV : I used to worry about that .
I said , " I 'm gradually managing to cram more and more things into my mind .
I 've got this beautiful mind , and it 's going to die , and it 'll all be gone . "
And then I thought , " No , not in my case .
Every idea I 've ever had I 've written down , and it 's all there on paper .
I wo n't be gone .
It 'll be there . "
MOYERS : You realize how depressing this thought is for the rest of us who can't write it down the way you can .
One could say , " Since I can't write the way Isaac Asimov does , and know what Isaac Asimov knows , I wo n't do it at all . "
ASIMOV : I would n't want people to do that .
A little is better than nothing .
In fact , you could say that I overdo it .
Lately I 've been thinking that people must look upon me as some kind of a freak .
There was a certain pleasure writing a hundred books - you know , I felt I 'd accomplished something .
Then two hundred .
But now it stands at three hundred and ninety - one .
It 's liable to be four hundred by the end of the year , and I have every intention of continuing because I enjoy the process .
In the end , it might be that nobody will care about what I write - just about the number .
Maybe I will have defeated myself in that way .
MOYERS : How do you explain yourself to yourself ?
What is it that causes a man to know so much that he could write four hundred books ?
ASIMOV : I suppose it 's sheer hedonism .
I just enjoy it so .
What made Bing Crosby or Bob Hope play all that golf , you know ?
They enjoyed it - and that 's the way it is with me .
MOYERS : Is it possible that this passion for learning can be spread to ordinary folks out there ?
Can we have a revolution in learning ?
ASIMOV : Yes , I think not only that we can but that we must .
As computers take over more and more of the work that human beings should n't be doing in the first place - because it does n't utilize their brains , it stultifies and bores them to death - there 's going to be nothing left for human beings to do but the more creative types of endeavor .
The only way we can indulge in the more creative types of endeavor is to have brains that aim at that from the start .
You can't take a human being and put him to work at a job that underuses the brain and keep him working at it for decades and decades , and then say , " Well , that job is n't there , go do something more creative . "
You have beaten the creativity out of him .
But if from the start children are educated into appreciating their own creativity , then probably almost all of us can be creative .
In the old days , very few people could read and write .
Literacy was a very novel sort of thing , and it was felt that most people just did n't have it in them .
But with mass education , it turned out that most people could be taught to read and write .
In the same way , once we have computer outlets in every home , each of them hooked up to enormous libraries , where you can ask any question and be given answers , you can look up something you 're interested in knowing , however silly it might seem to someone else .
Today , what people call learning is forced on you .
Everyone is forced to learn the same thing on the same day at the same speed in class .
But everyone is different .
For some , class goes too fast , for some too slow , for some in the wrong direction .
But give everyone a chance , in addition to school , to follow up their own bent from the start , to find out about whatever they 're interested in by looking it up in their own homes , at their own speed , in their own time , and everyone will enjoy learning .
MOYERS : What about the argument that machines , like computers , dehumanize learning ?
ASIMOV : As a matter of fact , it 's just the reverse .
It 's through this machine that for the first time , we 'll be able to have a one - to - one relationship between information source and information consumer .
In the old days , you used to hire a tutor or pedagogue to teach your children .
And if he knew his job , he could adapt his teaching to the tastes and abilities of the students .
But how many people could afford to hire a pedagogue ?
Most children went uneducated .
Then we reached the point where it was absolutely necessary to educate everybody .
The only way we could do it was to have one teacher for a great many students , and to give the teacher a curriculum to teach from .
But how many teachers are good at this ?
As with everything else , the number of teachers is far greater than the number of good teachers .
So we either have a one - to - one relationship for the very few , or a one - to - many for the many .
Now , with the computer , it 's possible to have a one - to - one relationship for the many .
Everyone can have a teacher in the form of access to the gathered knowledge of the human species .
MOYERS : But you know , we have such a miserable record in this country of providing poor children even with good classrooms that I wonder if our society can ever harness itself to provide everyone , including poor children , with good computers .
ASIMOV : Perhaps not at the very start .
That 's like asking yourself , " Is it possible to supply everybody in the nation with clean water ? "
In many nations it is impossible to get clean water except under very unusual circumstances .
That was one reason why people started drinking beer and wine - the alcohol killed the germs , and if you did n't drink that , you died of cholera .
But there are places where you can supply clean water for nearly everyone .
The United States probably supplies clean water for a larger percentage of its population than almost any other nation can .
So it 's not that we would expect everybody to have a perfect computer right away , but we can try for it , and with time , I think more and more will .
For goodness ' sake , when I was young , very few people had automobiles or telephones , and almost nobody had an air conditioner .
Now these things are almost universal .
It might be the same way with computers .
MOYERS : What would such a teaching machine look like ?
ASIMOV : I find that difficult to imagine .
It 's easy to be theoretical , but when you really try to think of the nuts and bolts , then it becomes difficult .
I could easily have imagined a horseless carriage in the middle of the nineteenth century , but I could n't have drawn a picture of it .
But I suppose that one essential thing would be a screen on which you could display things , and another essential part would be a printing mechanism on which things could be printed for you .
And you 'll have to have a keyboard on which you ask your questions ' although ideally I would like to see one that could be activated by voice .
You could actually talk to it , and perhaps it could talk to you too , and say , " I have something here that may interest you .
Would you like to have me print it out for you . ? "
And you 'd say , " Well , what is it exactly ? "
And it would tell you , and you might say , " Oh all right , I 'll take a look at it . "
Anything that would make you feel the teacher was more human would be pleasant for you .
And yet , you can never tell .
I was once shown a device that had a certain number of set statements like " Yes , sir , " " Immediately " - things like that .
After you 've heard it for the tenth time , it irritates you .
So I suppose it 's not wise to try to figure out in advance too much what things will look like or be , but let the public demand guide what one produces .
MOYERS : But the machine would have to be connected to books , periodicals , and documents in some vast library , so then when I want to look at Isaac Asimov 's new book Far as Human Eye Could See , the chapter on geochemistry , I could punch my keys and this chapter would come to me .
ASIMOV : That 's right , and then of course you ask - and believe me , I 've asked - this question : " How do you arrange to pay the author for the use of the material ? "
After all , if a person writes something , and this then becomes available to everybody ' you deprive him of the economic reason for writing .
A person like myself , if he was assured of a livelihood , might write anyway , just because he enjoyed it , but most people would want to do it in return for something .
I imagine how they must have felt when free libraries were first instituted .
" What ?
My book in a free library ?
Anyone can come in and read it for free . ? "
Then you realize that there are some books that would n't be sold at all if you did n't have libraries .
MOYERS : With computers , in a sense , every student has his or her own private school .
ASIMOV : Yes , he can be the sole dictator of what he is going to study .
Mind you , this is not all he 's going to do .
He 'll still be going to school for some things that he has to know .
MOYERS : Common knowledge for example .
ASIMOV : Right , and interaction with other students and with teachers .
He can't get away from that , but he 's got to look forward to the fun in life , which is following his own bent .
MOYERS : Is this revolution in personal learning just for the young ?
ASIMOV : No , it 's not just for the young .
That 's another trouble with education as we now have it .
People think of education as something that they can finish .
And what 's more , when they finish , it 's a rite of passage .
You 're finished with school .
You 're no more a child , and therefore anything that reminds you of school - reading books , having ideas , asking questions - that 's kid 's stuff .
Now you 're an adult , you do n't do that sort of thing any more .
MOYERS : And in fact , like prison , the reward of school is getting out .
Kids say , " When are you getting out ? "
ASIMOV : Every kid knows the only reason he's in school is because he's a kid and little and weak , and if he manages to get out early , if he drops out , why he 's just a premature man .
MOYERS : I 've talked to some of these dropouts , and they think they 've become men because they 're out of school .
ASIMOV : You have everybody looking forward to no longer learning , and you make them ashamed afterward of going back to learning .
If you have a system of education using computers , then anyone , any age , can learn by himself , can continue to be interested .
If you enjoy learning , there 's no reason why you should stop at a given age .
People do n't stop things they enjoy doing just because they reach a certain age .
They do n't stop playing tennis just because they 've turned forty .
They do n't stop with sex just because they 've turned forty .
They keep it up as long as they can if they enjoy it , and learning will be the same thing .
The trouble with learning is that most people do n't enjoy it because of the circumstances .
Make it possible for them to enjoy learning , and they 'll keep it up .
There 's the famous story about Oliver Wendell Holmes , who was in the hospital one time , when he was over ninety .
President Roosevelt came to see him , and there was Oliver Wendell Holmes reading the Greek grammar .
Roosevelt said , " Why are you reading a Greek grammar , Mr. Holmes ? "
And Holmes said , " To improve my mind , Mr. President . "
MOYERS : Are we romanticizing this , or do you think that Saul Bellow 's character Herzog was correct when he said that the people who come to evening classes are only ostensibly after culture .
What they 're really seeking , he said , is clarity , good sense , and truth , even an atom of it .
People , he said , are dying for the lack of something real at the end of the day .
ASIMOV : I 'd like to think that was so .
I 'd like to think that people who are given a chance to learn facts and broaden their knowledge of the universe would n't seek so avidly after mysticism .
MOYERS : What bothers you about mysticism ?
ASIMOV : The same thing bothers me about mysticism that bothers me about con men .
It is n't right to sell a person phony stock , and take money for it , and this is what mystics are doing .
They 're selling people phony knowledge and taking money for it .
Even if people feel good about it , I can well imagine that a person who really believes in astrology is going to have a feeling of security because he knows that this is a bad day , so he 'll stay at home , just as a guy who 's got phony stock may look at it and feel rich .
But he still has phony stock , and the person who buys mysticism still has phony knowledge .
MOYERS : What 's the real knowledge ?
ASIMOV : We can't be absolutely certain .
Science does n't purvey absolute truth .
Science is a mechanism , a way of trying to improve your knowledge of nature .
It 's a system for testing your thoughts against the universe and seeing whether they match .
This works not just for the ordinary aspects of science , but for all of life .
I should think people would want to know that what they know is truly what the universe is like , or at least as close as they can get to it .
We do n't pretend that we know everything .
In fact , it would be terrible to know everything because there 'd be nothing left to learn .
But you do n't want to be up a blind alley somewhere .
MOYERS : You wrote a few years ago that the decline in America 's world power is in part brought about by our diminishing status as a world science leader .
Why have we neglected science ?
ASIMOV : Partly because of success .
The most damaging statement that the United States has ever been subjected to is the phrase " Yankee know - how . "
You get the feeling somehow that Americans - just by the fact that they are Americans - are somehow smarter and more ingenious than other people , which really is not so .
Actually , the phrase was first used in connection with the atomic bomb , which was invented and brought to fruition by a bunch of European refugees .
That 's " Yankee know - how . "
There 's also this feeling that somehow our free enterprise system alone will do it for us .
That helps out in some ways , but not if we 're lazy about it .
It 's not going to do it for us if we do n't do anything , you see .
MOYERS : It 's astonishing how few American students study mathematics or major in science .
ASIMOV : Yes , we are living in a business society .
MOYERS : And yet there 's long been a bias in this country against science .
When Benjamin Franklin was experimenting with the lightning rod , a lot of good folk said , " You do n't need a lightning rod .
If you want to prevent lightning from striking , you just have to pray about it . "
ASIMOV : The bias against science is part of being a pioneer society .
You somehow feel that city life is decadent .
American history is full of fables of the noble virtuous farmer and the vicious city slicker .
The city slicker is an automatic villain .
Unfortunately , such stereotypes can do damage .
A noble ignoramus is not necessarily what the country needs .
When Andrew Jackson became President , it was felt that any person could fill any federal office .
That started the spoils system we have now : when a new guy comes in , everyone is fired , and the new party puts in the people .
That works , if in fact any person can run any job .
But you and I know that there are such things as experience and education and intelligence .
When the Civil War started , the North had no expertise in fighting and no army worth a damn .
Most of the officers with any training were Southerners .
We had to learn how to fight the war the hard way , and lost a lot of people that way .
MOYERS : In 1980 you were afraid that the fundamentalists who were coming into power with President Reagan were going to turn this country even further against science , especially with their demands that biblical creationism be given an equal footing in the classroom with science .
Have they made those inroads that you feared ?
ASIMOV : Fortunately , the currents have been against them .
But they still put pressure on school boards and parents , and it's become a little more difficult in many parts of the nation to teach evolution .
MOYERS : The fundamentalists see you as the very incarnation of the enemy , the epitome of the secular humanist who opposes God 's plan for the universe .
In 1984 , the American Humanist Society gave you their Humanist of the Year Award , and you 're now president of that organization .
Are you an enemy of religion ?
ASIMOV : No , I 'm not .
What I 'm against is the attempt to place a person 's belief system onto the nation or the world generally .
We object to the Soviet Union trying to dominate the world , to communize the world .
The United States , I hope , is trying to democratize the world .
But I certainly would be very much against trying to Christianize the world or to Islamize it or to Judaize it or anything of the sort .
My objection to fundamentalism is not that they are fundamentalists but that essentially they want me to be a fundamentalist , too .
Now , they may say that I believe evolution is true and I want everyone to believe that evolution is true .
But I do n't want everyone to believe that evolution is true , I want them to study what we say about evolution and to decide for themselves .
Fundamentalists say they want to treat creationism on an equal basis .
But they can't .
It 's not a science .
You can teach creationism in churches and in courses on religion .
They would be horrified if I were to suggest that in the churches they teach secular humanism as an alternate way of looking at the universe or evolution as an alternate way of considering how life may have started .
In the church they teach only what they believe , and rightly so , I suppose .
But on the other hand , in schools , in science courses , we 've got to teach what scientists think is the way the universe works .
MOYERS : But this is what frightens many believers .
They see science as uncertain , always tentative , always subject to revisionism .
They see science as presenting a complex , chilling , and enormous universe ruled by chance and impersonal laws .
They see science as dangerous .
ASIMOV : That is really the glory of science - that science is tentative , that it is not certain , that it is subject to change .
What is really disgraceful is to have a set of beliefs that you think is absolute and has been so from the start and can't change , where you simply wo n't listen to evidence .
You say , " If the evidence agrees with me , it 's not necessary , and if it does n't agree with me , it 's false . "
This is the legendary remark of Omar when they captured Alexandria and asked him what to do with the library .
He said , " If the books agree with the Koran , they are not necessary and may be burned .
If they disagree with the Koran , they are pernicious and must be burned . "
Well , there are still these Omar - like thinkers who think all of knowledge will fit into one book called the Bible , and who refuse to allow it is possible ever to conceive of an error there .
To my way of thinking , that is much more dangerous than a system of knowledge that is tentative and uncertain .
MOYERS : Do you see any room for reconciling the religious view in which the universe is God 's drama , constantly interrupted and rewritten by divine intervention , and the view of the universe as scientists hold it ?
ASIMOV : There is if people are reasonable .
There are many scientists who are honestly religious .
Millikan was a truly religious man .
Morley of the Michelson - Morley experiment was truly religious .
There were hundreds of others who did great scientific work , good scientific work , and at the same time were religious .
But they did not mix their religion and science .
In other words , if something they understand took place in science , they did n't dismiss it by saying , " Well , that 's what God wants , " or " At this point a miracle took place . "
No , they knew that science is strictly a construct of the human mind working according to the laws of nature , and that religion is something that lies outside and may embrace science .
You know , if there were suddenly to arise scientific , confirmable evidence that God exists , then scientists would have no choice but to accept that fact .
On the other hand , the fundamentalists do n't admit the possibility of evidence that would show , for example , that evolution exists .
Any evidence you present they will deny if it conflicts with the word of God as they think it to be .
So the chances of compromise are only on one side , and , therefore , I doubt that it will take place .
MOYERS : What frightens them is something that Dostoevski once said - if God is dead , everything is permitted .
ASIMOV : That assumes that human beings have no feeling about what is right and wrong .
Is the only reason you are virtuous because virtue is your ticket to heaven ?
Is the only reason you do n't beat your children to death because you do n't want to go to hell ?
It 's insulting to imply that only a system of rewards and punishments can keep you a decent human being .
Is n't it conceivable a person wants to be a decent human being because that way he feels better ?
I do n't believe that I 'm ever going to heaven or hell .
I think that when I die , there will be nothingness .
That 's what I firmly believe .
That 's not to mean that I have the impulse to go out and rob and steal and rape and everything else because I do n't fear punishment .
For one thing , I fear worldly punishment .
And for a second thing , I fear the punishment of my own conscience .
I have a conscience .
It does n't depend on religion .
And I think that 's so with other people , too .
Even in societies in which religion is very powerful , there 's no shortage of crime and sin and misery and terrible things happening , despite heaven and hell .
I imagine if you go down death row , and ask a bunch of murderers who are waiting for execution if they believe in God , they 'll tell you yes .
I would n't be surprised if the number of people in jail for fraud , for violent crimes , for everything , includes a smaller percentage of acknowledged atheists than we have in the general population .
So I do n't know why one should think that just because you do n't want a ticket to heaven , and you do n't fear a ticket to hell , you should be a villain .
MOYERS : Is there a morality in science ?
ASIMOV : Oh , absolutely .
In fact , there is a morality in science that is further advanced than anywhere else .
If you find a person in science who has faked his results , who has lied as far as his findings are concerned , who has tried to steal the work of another , who has done something other scientists consider unethical - well , his scientific reputation is ruined , his scientific life is over .
There is no forgiveness .
The morality of science is that you report the truth , you do your best to disprove your own findings , and you do not utilize someone else 's findings and report them as your own .
In any other branch of human endeavor - in politics , in economics , in law , in almost anything - people can commit crimes and still be heroes .
For instance , Colonel North has done terrible things , yet he 's a hero and a patriot to some people .
This goes in almost every field .
Only science is excepted .
You make a misstep in science , and you 're through .
Really through .
MOYERS : You love the field , do n't you ?
You love science .
ASIMOV : Oh , I 'm very fond of it .
I think it 's amazing how many saints there have been among scientists .
I 'll give you an example .
In 1900 , De Vries studied mutations .
He found a patch of evening primrose of different types , and he studied how they inherited their characteristics .
He worked out the laws of genetics .
Two other guys worked out the laws of genetics at the same time , a guy called Karl Correns , who was a German , and Erich Tschermak von Seysenegg , who was an Austrian .
All three worked out the laws of genetics in 1900 , and having done so , all three looked through the literature , just to see what had been done before .
All three discovered that in the 1860s Gregor Mendel had worked out the laws of genetics , and people had n't paid any attention then .
All three reported their findings as confirmation of what Mendel had found .
Not one of the three attempted to say that it was original with him .
And you know what it meant .
It meant that two of them , Correns and Tschermak von Seysenegg , lived in obscurity .
De Vries is known only because he was also the first to work out the theory of mutations .
But as far as discovering genetics is concerned , Mendel gets all the credit .
They knew at the time that this would happen .
That 's the sort of thing you just do n't find outside of science .
MOYERS : If it is truth that excites you , what is the value of science fiction , for which you are justifiably universally known ?
ASIMOV : Okay , let 's look at fiction as a whole , just any kind of fiction .
In serious fiction , fiction where the writer feels he 's accomplishing something besides simply amusing people - although there 's nothing wrong with simply amusing people - the writer is holding up a mirror to the human species , making it possible for you to understand people better because you 've read the novel or story , and maybe making it possible for you to understand yourself better .
This is an important thing .
Now science fiction uses a different method .
It works up an artificial society , one which does n't exist , or one that may possibly exist in the future , but not necessarily .
And it portrays events against the background of this society in the hope that you will be able to see yourself in relation to the present society .
I do n't claim that I succeed at this .
It seems to me that to do this properly takes a great man , a guy on the level of - well , at least half that of Shakespeare , and I do n't come up there .
But I try , and who knows ?
Maybe once in a while I succeed a little bit .
And that 's why I write science fiction - because it 's a way of writing fiction in a style that enables me to make points I can't make otherwise .
MOYERS : Someone once said that one great advantage of science fiction is that it can introduce the reader to changes that may well be inevitable , but that are not now conceivable .
ASIMOV : I 've said that myself at different times .
The fact is that society is always changing , but the rate of change has been accelerating all through history for a variety of reasons .
One , the change is cumulative .
The very changes you make now make it easier to make further changes .
Until the Industrial Revolution came along , people were n't aware of change or a future .
They assumed the future would be exactly like it had always been , just with different people .
You know , as things are , so they remain .
As Ecclesiastes says , " There is nothing new under the sun . "
It was only with the coming of the Industrial Revolution that the rate of change became fast enough to be visible in a single lifetime .
People were suddenly aware that not only were things changing , but that they would continue to change after they died .
That was when science fiction came into being as opposed to fantasy and adventure tales .
Because people knew that they would die before they could see the changes that would happen in the next century , they thought it would be nice to imagine what they might be .
As time goes on , and the rate of change still continues to accelerate , it becomes more and more important to adjust what you do today to the fact of change in the future .
It 's ridiculous to make your plans now on the assumption that things will continue as they are now .
You have to assume that if something you 're doing is going to reach fruition in ten years , that in those ten years changes will take place , and perhaps what you 're doing will have no meaning then .
So nowadays futurism has become an important part of thinking in business , economics , politics , and military affairs .
Science fiction is important because it fights the natural notion that there 's something permanent about things the way they are right now .
MOYERS : You once said that your view of the future changes according to what you read every morning in the daily newspaper .
What are you reading in today 's newspapers ?
ASIMOV : Well , I read that in the Soviet Union , for instance , there are protests here , marches there - that there 's a lot of turmoil .
It makes me feel that the Soviet Union is gaining strength because when a nation is absolutely quiet , when no one says anything , when you do n't hear any controversy going on , that 's a kind of death , a death involving fear , a death involving oppression .
With turmoil , the Soviet Union is becoming , shall we say , slightly Americanized ?
I think that 's a good thing .
I think the fact that Reagan got along so well with Gorbachev , and vice versa , that they were palsy - walsy , with their arms around each other 's shoulders , is a great thing .
That does n't mean that tomorrow the Soviet Union is going to be exactly what we want it to be .
It does n't mean that we 're going to be exactly what they want us to be .
But we 're at least moving in the right direction .
I hope this means there 's just a slightly better chance that we 're heading for an era of international cooperation and perhaps the development of a kind of federal world government , which I think is essential .
MOYERS : Use your imagination :
If the President asked you to draft his inaugural address and said , " Dr. Asimov , make sure I say the one thing you think I must convince the American people that they should pay attention to , " what would it be ?
ASIMOV : It would be this :
That all the problems that we face now , that are really important , that are life - and - death , are global problems , that they affect all of us alike .
The ozone layer , if it disappears , disappears for all of us .
Pollution in the ocean , in the atmosphere , in the ground water , is for all of us .
The only way we can ameliorate these problems , solve them , prevent them from destroying us , is , again , through a global solution .
We can't expect that anything the United States does alone is going to affect the situation the world over .
There has to be cooperation among the nations of the world .
If we can achieve that in the face of a danger deadlier than has ever faced humanity before , why , one of the advantages we 'll have is that automatically we will probably start spending less money on war and preparations for war , which will , in turn , be a beneficial cycle , because we 'll have more money for solving these problems we must solve .
MOYERS : You sound more optimistic than you did a few years ago .
I read an essay in which you said that we 're entering a decade of decision , that we have to make life - and - death decisions about our energy problems , about the fact that we 're using up fossil fuel and not developing alternatives , about the population explosion , and about our constant and pernicious tendency to prepare for war .
You said we 'll know at the end of the 1980s if we made the right decisions .
Have we ?
ASIMOV : We have n't made irretrievably wrong decisions .
I was afraid that with the atmosphere of the 1980s , the Cold War would intensify and become something we could n't reverse .
But quite suddenly it has been reversed , and for reasons of the kind that always upsets me as a futurist - for unpredictable reasons .
There 's no way you could have predicted that a man like Gorbachev would come to power in the Soviet Union , a man who is young and flexible and post -Revolutionary in his thinking .
And there 's no way you could have predicted that Reagan would make this Iran - Contra mistake and feel it necessary in his last year to do something that will make him remembered for some other reason .
And so between Reagan , intent on something upbeat , and Gorbachev , intent on somehow ameliorating the Cold War , we had what you might call a meeting of minds , and the beginning of nuclear disarmament , even if only the beginning .
So I have felt a little more confidence all this last year .
MOYERS : What about the subject you 've written so much about - the population explosion ?
Right now , the population of the globe is over five billion .
You 've warned us about what will happen if it continues at its two percent growth rate per year .
ASIMOV : Actually , the growth rate is down to one - point - six percent , but with the higher population , it 's the same amount in actual numbers : eighty million a year .
By the year 2000 , it 's going to be perhaps six - point - five billion .
MOYERS : That 's just twelve years from now .
How many people do you think the earth is able to sustain ?
ASIMOV : I do n't think it 's able to sustain the five billion in the long run .
Right now most of the world is living under appalling conditions .
We can't possibly improve the conditions of everyone .
We can't raise the entire world to the average standard of living in the United States because we do n't have the resources and the ability to distribute well enough for that .
So right now as it is , we have condemned most of the world to a miserable , starvation level of existence .
And it will just get worse as the population continues to go up .
MOYERS : But you can't just say to a woman , " Do n't have children . "
ASIMOV : That 's not the problem ; it 's that so many people are saying , " Have children . "
There is such a pro-natalist attitude in the world .
We celebrate Mother 's Day so enthusiastically , we say , " May all your troubles be little ones , " we celebrate additional children .
I feel sometimes that if we'd only stop pushing for children , somehow there would be fewer of them .
MOYERS : Why did you say that the price of survival is the equality of women ?
ASIMOV : Because if women are allowed to enter into all facets of the human condition , if they can enter business , if they can enter religion , science , government on an equal basis with men , they will be so busy they wo n't feel it necessary to have a great many children .
As long as you have women under conditions where they do n't feel any sense of value or self - worth except as mothers , they 'll have a lot of children because that 's the only way they can prove they 're worth something .
In general , if you look through the world , the lower the status of women , the higher the birth rate , and the higher the birth rate , the lower the status of women .
If you could raise the status of women , I am certain the birth rate would fall drastically through the choice of the women themselves .
We 're always saying that there 's no fulfillment like having
children , but I notice mostly it 's men who say that .
You know , men get along without giving birth to children .
They do that by finding other things to do .
If women could find other things to do , too , they would have fewer children .
MOYERS : But once again , you are in conflict with a biblical imperative , " Be fruitful and multiply . "
ASIMOV : Right .
But God said that when Adam and Eve were the only two people in the world .
He said , " Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth . "
The earth was replenished long ago .
That 's one of the problems of fundamentalism .
Fundamentalists take a statement that made sense at the time it was made , and because they refuse to consider that the statement may not be an absolute , eternal truth , they continue following it under conditions where to do so is deadly .
MOYERS : What happens to the idea of the dignity of the human species if this population growth continues at its present rate ?
ASIMOV : It will be completely destroyed .
I like to use what I call my bathroom metaphor :
If two people live in an apartment , and there are two bathrooms , then both have freedom of the bathroom .
You can go to the bathroom anytime you want to and stay as long as you want to for whatever you need .
And everyone believes in the freedom of the bathroom ; it should be right there in the Constitution .
But if you have twenty people in the apartment and two bathrooms , no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom , there is no such thing .
You have to set up times for each person , you have to bang at the door : " Are n't you through yet ? " and so on .
In the same way , democracy cannot survive overpopulation .
Human dignity cannot survive it .
Convenience and decency cannot survive it .
As you put more and more people onto the world , the value of life not only declines , it disappears .
It does n't matter if someone dies .
The more people there are , the less one individual matters .
MOYERS : People say the United States is bringing its population under control , that many Americans are not even reproducing themselves , and that what the rest of the world does , we can't control .
ASIMOV : The population of the United States is still going up .
The only time it went up really slowly was during the Great Depression , when there were no laws lowering the birth rate , there was just an economic depression , which made people think twice before they had children .
But the United States is doing something else - it is absolutely refusing to help nations control population .
Our feeling is that it 's enough for us to make sure that the United States is in good shape , and what other nations do is their business .
It 's not just their business - it 's our business , too .
MOYERS : Can we exist as a stable economy and a stable society if around us are turmoil and chaos ?
ASIMOV : Absolutely not .
Right now many nations are destroying the rain forests because they need the firewood , and they need the space for farms .
MOYERS : Why should we care about that ?
ASIMOV : Because without the rain forests , we 're going to have deserts .
The food supply will dwindle .
As a matter of fact , there 's even the possibility that we 're going to lose all kinds of valuable substances we know nothing about .
Those rain forests have an incredible number of species of plants and animals that we know very little about .
Some of them may produce chemicals of great pharmacological and medical importance .
If properly cultivated , some of the plants might be new food sources .
In addition to that , nothing produces the oxygen of the atmosphere with the same intensity that a forest does .
Anything that substitutes for it will be producing less oxygen .
We 're going to be destroying our atmosphere , too .
MOYERS : What did you mean when you said once that we have to stop living by the code of the past ?
ASIMOV : Times change .
For example , in the past we felt motherhood was the most important thing a woman could do , and that to be a good wife and mother was the sum total of a woman 's purpose in life .
She did n't need an education or interests outside the house .
You know , Kinder , Kirche , Kuche - the children , the church , the kitchen - or in English you say , " Keep 'em barefoot and pregnant . "
Well , we can't do that any more .
We can't raise women to be baby machines .
In the old days , we did n't worry about the future .
Now we must .
Things are changing so fast that we have to worry about the future all the time .
MOYERS : You and I may not be around when it arrives .
ASIMOV : Our children will be , and our grandchildren - and the human race .
I do n't want to sound like a foolish idealist or as though I just love humanity .
But , look , my books are going to survive me - I want to have people alive to read them .
MOYERS : Is it possible that you suffer from an excessive trust in rationality ?
ASIMOV : Well , I can't answer that very easily .
Perhaps I do , you know .
But I can't think of anything else to trust in .
If you can't go by reason , what can you go by ?
One answer is faith .
But faith in what ?
I notice there 's no general agreement in the world .
These matters of faith , they are not compelling .
I have my faith , you have your faith , and there 's no way in which I can translate my faith to you or vice versa .
At least , as far as reason is concerned , there 's a system of transfer , a system of rational argument following the laws of logic that a great many people agree on , so that in reason , there are what we call compelling arguments .
If I locate certain kinds of evidence , even people who disagreed with me to begin with , find themselves compelled by the evidence to agree .
But whenever we go beyond reason into faith , there 's no such thing as compelling evidence .
Even if you have a revelation , how can you transfer that revelation to others ?
By what system ?
MOYERS : So you find your hope for the future in the mind .
ASIMOV : Yes , I have to say , I can't wait until everyone in the world is rational , or until just enough are rational to make a difference .
MOYERS : Your latest book - number three hundred and ninety - one - is called Far as Human Eye Could See .
How far can we see ?
ASIMOV : It depends on what we 're looking for .
If we 're looking at human history , we can't see very far because human history is a chaotic thing .
Small changes have big results , unpredictable in direction .
But if we 're looking at something that 's essentially simple , such as stars and galaxies and things like that , then it is possible to look far , far ahead .
We may be wrong , but it is possible to make a case for something that might happen ten - to - the - hundred years in the future - one with a hundred zeros after it .
In fact , that 's what I do in the last essay - that 's why I call it " Far as Human Eye Could See . "
It comes from " Locksley Hall , " by Tennyson , of course : " For I dipped into the future , far as human eye could see / Saw the Vision of the world , and all the wonder that would be . "
MOYERS : You see wonder out there ?
ASIMOV : I see a picture of a universe that becomes infinite .
It can expand and expand and expand until it is sufficiently thinly spaced to allow another universe to begin .
And that perhaps surrounding our universe is the far , faint remnant of another universe ; and beyond that , of another one , even fainter , and so on , infinitely .
If the universe does n't expand forever , if it goes into a crunch and disappears , there may be a limitless ocean of vacuum out of which new universes are constantly arising like bubbles in boiling water , some large , some small , some with one set of laws , some with another .
We just happen to be living in one that 's suitable for life .
And there we get into the Anthropic Principle because we can only exist in one that 's suitable for life .
The mere fact that we exist makes it suitable for life , you see .
There are people who argue that everything in the universe depends upon human observation .
Then there are people who say , " Supposing there were no human beings , just frogs .
Will the frog observation do the trick ? "
It 's a game for modern scholastics .
Instead of how many angels can dance on the point of a pin , we try to argue out quantum weirdness .
It 's a lot of fun , but it makes you dizzy .
MOYERS : You 've lived through much of this century .
Have you ever known human beings to think with the perspective you 're calling on them to think with now ?
ASIMOV : It 's perhaps not important that every human being think so .
But how about the leaders and opinion - makers thinking so ?
Ordinary people might follow them .
It would help if we did n't have leaders who were thinking in exactly the opposite way , if we did n't have people who were shouting hatred and suspicion of foreigners , if we did n't have people who were shouting that it 's more important to be unfriendly than to be friendly , if we did n't have people shouting that the people inside the country who do n't look exactly the way the rest of us look have something wrong with them .
It 's almost not necessary for us to do good ; it 's only necessary for us to stop doing evil , for goodness ' sake .
Last night Facebook announced a new feature that increases the promotional capabilities provided by news feed stories .
The new feature is called an “ action link ” and according to Facebook , the feature “ is a call to action for the user to take within your application , directly from a Feed story .
For example , it could be a call to buy an album or a book , or write a review .
The URL encoded within the action link takes the user to the appropriate place to perform the action . ”
This is an interesting feature which most definitely provides a new channel for developers to promote features on external sites including generating affiliate revenue .
Imagine seeing that your friend just read a book on Visual Bookshelf with a link to go purchase it right then .
The version that Facebook displays ( pictured below ) is a notification that your friend just purchased a CD ( similar to the book version I just mentioned ) .
There are links to listen , review , and purchase the CD .
I definitely see this as a great opportunity to drive users to action .
This is a great feature and definitely think developers should quickly find a way to take advantage of the new action links .
Starting a conversation with an attractive woman can be a nerve - racking experience .
In fact , many guys are so intimidated by attractive women that they avoid most females they do n't know ; in turn , missing opportunities to meet potential girlfriends every day .
The solution here is to overcome your " knee jerk " reaction to avoid attractive woman and learn to approach them with confidence .
Here are 10 tips to help you do it :
Approach her no matter what
If you approach , you win -- no matter what happens .
Most guys are too focused and concerned about a conversation going well and walking away with a phone number .
This is a big mistake .
Look at it this way :
As long as you open your mouth and say something -- anything at all -- you 're doing what 95 % of guys can only dream about .
Congratulate yourself the instant you start the conversation -- after all , you 're already a cut above the rest !
Once you 've made this initial verbal contact , relax and enjoy the chat with her .
Ignore your excuses
One of the best ways to move forward and start a conversation is to learn to ignore your own excuses : " She 'll never go for me ; " " She 'll think I 'm a slime - ball or a pervert ; " " She 's busy , I do n't want to interrupt her . " .
All these excuses come from the desire to stay in your " comfort zone , " and each one is complete BS .
As soon as you notice these excuses in your head , stop thinking , go over to her and start talking .
You 'll be glad you did .
Screw up big time
Are you a perfectionist ?
If so , work on restraining your need to get things just right ( at least when it comes to the female sex ) .
When you expect to have perfect interactions with women , you put too much pressure on yourself , which makes it harder to get off your butt and take action .
Even if you mess up , be happy with yourself for taking the initiative .
Focus on how you 'll feel if you do n't talk to her
One reason you hesitate to start talking to her is because it feels uncomfortable to take the leap .
But the fact is , it 's more uncomfortable not to .
Think about it :
If you approach her , you may be nervous at first , but before you know it , the conversation is over .
And if you do n't approach her , you 'll wish you had , and you 'll carry that regret with you for the rest of the day .
Save yourself the agony and go talk to her .
Do n't put undue pressure on yourself
When most guys see a woman they 'd like to meet , they immediately view her as a potential date -- which creates all sorts of pressure .
Instead , look at the next woman you meet as an opportunity to work on your " skills . "
This " mindset shift " helps you to be less attached to the outcome ; in turn , making you more relaxed and more likely to start the conversation .
Do n't forget :
You also improve the chances of it turning out to be a fun experience for everyone .
Use fear as your signal to approach
Learn to make fear your friend .
Next time you 're afraid to say something to a woman , realize that fear is a sign that you need to start the interaction .
Using fear as a guide allows you to stretch your comfort zone , become a more confident guy and meet new women .
Just get it done and you 'll feel great !
Be courageous and you 'll become confident
How would you define courage ?
Is it having no fear of doing " scary " stuff ?
Actually , the correct definition of courage is " the ability to take action in spite of fear . "
The courageous man is n't the one who does n't feel fear -- it 's the one who can push himself to take action even though he is feeling afraid .
The next time you want to talk to a woman and you begin to feel that nervous energy rushing through your body , see it as an opportunity to have courage and channel your fear to make the conversation happen .
Your self - confidence will get an instant boost , and you might just meet a great woman in the process .
Do n't stereotype
Sure , every once in a while , a woman is going to act a little grouchy when you try to start a conversation with her .
But do n't forget , this is the exception , not the rule .
Once you start approaching more women , you 'll find that most are friendly as long as you do n't act like a dumbass .
So stop telling yourself that every woman will turn out to be snooty , because it 's far from the truth .
Make the move
Do you want to know a simple yet effective trick to get unstuck ?
Stop trying to figure out what you 're going to say and just begin moving in her direction .
On the way over , you 'll naturally notice something you can comment on and use that to start the conversation -- no matter how simple it may be .
The key is to say something to get the ball rolling and let things progress from there .
Grab every opportunity to talk to women
Did you just miss a perfect opportunity to talk to a woman ?
No , you did n't -- it 's never too late .
Stop what you 're doing , find her , and have the conversation you should have had earlier .
You 'll find it 's no big deal and she 'll be impressed that you went out on a limb to speak to her .
master your fear of picking up
Apply all 10 tips listed here , and you 'll be on your way to seducing women .
Be cocky , be funny and , soon enough , you 'll get more dates then you have time for .

For those unfamiliar , a FanEdit of a film is " a new take on existing movie material .
Anything can be changed , improved , restructured for a different watching experience and only the sky is the limit . "
Basically , fans edit existing films and add scenes , remove scenes , add music , add CGI , whatever they want , and recompile it as a FanEdit .
The site , since the beginning has said you should not download the edits unless you own the original on VHS DVD or Blu-ray , and even went as far as to place links to Amazon pages so you can purchase the original .
Apparently this was not enough .
Of course , as is always the case , the MPAA 's decision to target fanedits.org has brought massive amounts of traffic to the site , making sure that FanEdits will not die anytime soon .
Well done MPAA , your attempt to kill creative freedoms has backfired , again .
Retired Indian captain Anil Kumble says a recent run of injuries influenced his decision to end his glittering Test cricket career .
Kumble , who finished with 619 wickets from 132 Tests , called time on his career after India drew with Australia in the third Test in Delhi on Sunday .
He says it was tough to walk away from Test cricket .
" When you 've played 18 years of cricket and when you 've been so competitive , to take that decision was tough but the body gave me the decision , and this injury also probably helped my decision , " he said .
" I knew I would not be 100 per cent fit for the fourth Test in Nagpur and I did not want to let the team down . "
The Indian stalwart , given a lap of honour by his team - mates , said it would have been a fitting farewell had his side won the third Test .
" I shared the dressing room with some of the great players like Sachin Tendulkar , Rahul Dravid , Sourav Ganguly and Venkatsai Laxman besides the younger lot like Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan , " he said .
" It has been a great experience and a great journey . "
India leads the four - Test series 1 - 0 , and Kumble says he is confident the team can secure a series victory without him .
" Delhi has been really special for me , and I thought it fitting to finish here , " he said .
" Ideally I would 've liked to have finished the series here , but I 'm confident that we 'll be able to win the series in Nagpur .
Kumble is India 's most successful bowler ever .
He trails only Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidaran and Australia 's retired Shane Warne in the list of the world 's highest wicket - takers .
He picked 337 wickets from 271 one - day internationals before quitting the shorter version of the game last year .
Kumble bowled in the first innings in New Delhi despite 11 stitches on his finger , reminding critics calling for his retirement of his resilience and value to the team .
Kumble said he would like to be remembered as someone who excelled despite facing constant flak from critics .
" Criticism started 18 years ago when people said I could not bowl well , " he said .
" I am lucky that at least I got the opportunity to announce my retirement though I am still trying to learn how to bowl leg spin , " he said in his parting shot at critics .

Substituting for Rachel Maddow , Arianna Huffington interviewed Bill Maher on ' The Rachel Maddow Show ' , asking him about the meeting between Barack Obama and John McCain , having Hillary Clinton back in the White House and what it would mean to have an intelligent President :
Multiple new polls :
If Tories continue to collapse like this , they wo n’t form government
With three polling firms now reporting in confirming this fact , it is now clear that the governing Conservatives are , for the first time in this election campaign , facing some real trouble .
Since September 27th , Stephen Harper ’s Conservatives have dropped 4.8 % in the Paulitics Polling Resource .
What is more , this precipitous drop has now been confirmed by each of the big three polling firms which release daily tracking polls .
As the calculation illustrated right demonstrates , if the Conservatives continue on their current trend , it seems to me unlikely that they will form government even if all of this loss in support goes to the NDP , Greens and / or Bloc and not to the Liberals .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Some children who have fallen ill in China after being fed milk formula that had been contaminated with melamine have developed “ crystals ” in their kidneys , a WHO food safety expert said on Tuesday .
“ Our understanding is that these are not normal kidney stones because they are not being detected via all of the tools that one uses to detect kidney stones , so some are not showing up on x-rays , ” said Anthony Hazzard , regional advisor for food safety at the World Health Organization .
“ We believe at this stage that it ’s really the complex of melamine and cyanuric acid forming what you call crystals ... they can form in the small tubules ( in the kidneys ) and they get bigger and can block the tubules , ” he said in a telephone interview from Manila .
Cyanuric acid is chemically similar to melamine - a plastic - making industrial compound that was added to milk powder to cheat quality tests .
Tens of thousands of Chinese children have fallen ill with kidney stones and other kidney problems after consuming the contaminated milk , and at least four children have died .
It is not clear how cyanuric acid found its way into the children .
Experts say it could have been added along with melamine into milk , also to cheat quality tests , or it may have been formed when the body tried processing the melamine , which is indigestible .
Experts said earlier that crystals may be even more troublesome than stones .
They can potentially impair kidney function especially when large numbers of them suddenly form at the same time , blocking tubules in the kidneys .
Hazzard said the children were mainly treated in three ways .
“ Depending on how severe the situation , they can either pass these crystals in urine or they need hospitalization and treatment with fluids that will allow these crystals or stones to better pass , or in some cases , they may need surgery , ” he said .
This latest China food scandal has sparked tests for melamine in a variety of Chinese - made products from milk and chocolate bars to yoghurt exported around the world , including products in South Korea , leading to items being pulled from shop shelves .

The latest in a series of articles elaborating on the ISO 's " Where We Stand " statement .
China and Cuba , like the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc , have nothing to do with socialism .
We support the struggles of workers in these countries against the bureaucratic ruling class .
-- From the ISO " Where We Stand "
IT WOULD be wrong to argue that the collapse of the Soviet Union has rendered irrelevant questions about what sort of system it was .
Though the pall of " Soviet socialism " -- with its bureaucratic police methods -- no longer hangs over the socialist movement , we still must answer the questions :
What was the nature of the Soviet Union ?
Was it socialist in fact or in name only ?
Was it an inevitable outcome of what the Russian revolutionaries set out to do in 1917 ?
The same questions must also apply to those countries where similar societies were set up -- China and Cuba , for example .
How we answer these questions today determines whether Marxism is a living system of thought that can help us change the world , or whether it is obsolete .
To defend the social relations in either of these societies as somehow socialist -- where wages are low , workers have few rights , and political parties other than the official state party are banned -- is to make a mockery of socialism .
Series Where We Stand Read the series of articles by SocialistWorker.org columnist Paul D'Amato that looks in detail at the " Where We Stand " statement of the International Socialist Organization .
Cuba today -- much less so China , because of its lurch to the market -- still stands as an apparent alternative to capitalism on the left .
It is necessary to make a clear distinction , however , between the defense of Cuba 's sovereignty against the U.S. blockade and other attacks on the island , and defense of Cuba 's economic and political system .
The most honest historical accounts of the Russian Revolution acknowledge that the October Revolution was led by a mass working - class party that enjoyed the support of the majority of the working class in Russia .
The revolution established soviet power -- that is , it created a workers ' state based upon the elected councils of workers , soldiers and sailors that had arisen during the February Revolution .
But only months into the revolutionary process , the new workers ' state began to falter .
Bureaucracy re-emerged , democracy began to wither , and a gradual process began in which the end result was a new bureaucratic regime that the revolution 's initiators had never intended .
Columnist : Paul D’Amato Paul D'Amato is managing editor of the International Socialist Review and author of The Meaning of Marxism , a lively and accessible introduction to the ideas of Karl Marx and the tradition he founded .

WHAT WENT wrong ?
Marx once wrote , " A development of the productive forces is the absolute practical premise of communism because without it , want is generalized , and that means that all the old crap must revive again . "
World capitalism had created the material conditions of abundance that made socialism a real possibility .
However , in no single country , least of all Russia , did the material conditions exist such that socialism could be built in isolation .
Generalized want , that is poverty , creates the conditions in which the " old crap " -- inequality , class divisions , oppression -- revives , regardless of the intentions of those attempting to change society .
This is the dilemma the Bolsheviks faced .
Though the European working class was restive , and in some instances revolutionary , no successful European revolution came to Russia 's aid .
The revolutionary government faced an onslaught of counterrevolutionary " white " armies , foreign invasion , starvation and economic collapse .
The civil war brought mass depopulation of Russia 's major cities and the breakdown of industry .
The mobilization of the nation 's resources overwhelmed the weak shoots of workers ' power that the revolution had created .
The necessity of mobilizing for total war to save the revolution , combined with the terrible economic privation , obliterated soviet democracy and replaced it with a command structure that gave the revolution success in the civil war , but at the cost of strangling the revolution 's very reason for being .
What kind of state arose in Russia ?
It was socialist only in name .
Workers did not hold power .
Yet the old capitalists and landowners were gone , and their military defeat in the civil war meant they were not coming back .
The state , governed by a single party , owned the means of production .
Many argued that since private property had been abolished , and since the market inside Russia had been abolished , Russia was no longer capitalist .
Yet Russia remained in the orbit of world capitalism .
The ruling bureaucracy under Stalin consolidated its power by exiling and murdering the majority of Bolsheviks , including Trotsky .
It was clearly a new ruling class -- it controlled the means of production and it held state power .
But it was not free to do whatever it liked .
In order to consolidate its power , it was compelled to make Russia militarily competitive with the West .
That meant squeezing the workers and peasantry and using every last drop of surplus wealth to build up Russia 's military hardware .
The new bureaucratic ruling class embarked on a period of massive state accumulation to achieve this goal .
This drive to accumulate , imposed on Russia 's new rulers by its competitors , marked Russia 's turn to state capitalism .
IF , IN Russia , workers lost power when the revolution degenerated , in China , workers never had it .
The Red Army that seized state power in 1949 after a protracted guerrilla war was drawn largely from the peasantry , with almost no workers in it and led by a declassed intelligentsia .
The army , rather than any social class , became the source of revolutionary power .
The politics of its main leader , Mao Zedong , were not so much Marxism -- though Mao used some of Marxism 's terminology -- but agrarian populism combined with radical nationalism .
According to Mao , this rural Red Army with almost no workers in it was " the main instrument of the dictatorship of the proletariat . "
When Mao's army marched into the main cities , it issued communiqués urging the workers to remain calm and obey orders .
Essentially , the Communist Party 's aim was to utilize state power to bring about national unity , land reform and launch industrial development , using Stalin 's Russia in the 1930s as its model .
Trade unions , in the words of historian Nigel Harris , became " disciplinary and propaganda agencies of management and state . "
The main difference between Stalin and Mao's ideology is that while Stalin emphasized the inevitable march of the productive forces , Mao emphasized the role of will power in transforming society .
The population was exhorted through slogans to work as hard as possible for the glory of the Chinese state .
The most famous example of Mao's voluntarism was the Great Leap Forward of 1958 , when the state embarked on a policy designed to mobilize millions of people in rural communes to expand output .
Wildly unrealistic plans for increasing steel output were devised .
The attempt to burst through the objective barriers to fast growth had an opposite effect , creating a breakdown in industry and massive economic dislocation .
China 's transition since the 1970s from a state capitalist economy to one allowing for greater leeway for private capital represents not a transition from socialism to capitalism , but from one to another form of capitalist development .
The Cuban revolution of 1959 , like Mao's , involved the toppling of a dictatorial regime by a guerrilla army .
The most significant difference is that while Mao's Red Army numbered in the hundreds of thousands , Fidel Castro 's army numbered at most 2,000 .
As in China , workers in the Cuban revolution played no significant role in the revolution .
It was the guerrillas who marched from the Sierra Maestra to seize power , not in the name of socialism ( that came later ) , but in the name of nationalist and populist ideals .
The revolution was wildly popular for its land , educational and economic reforms , but the Cuban masses neither carried out the revolution nor created the state that emerged from it .
For Fidel , the mass organizations created after the seizure of power were sounding boards and conduits for his policies rather than organs of mass struggle and self - organization .
As Che Guevara wrote , " The mass carries out with matchless enthusiasm and discipline the tasks set by the government , whether in the field of the economy , culture , defense , sports , etc .
The initiative generally comes from Fidel , or from the revolutionary leadership , and is explained to the people , who make it their own . "
Fidel only declared the revolution socialist retroactively , after his forces crushed the U.S. - led Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and increasing U.S. hostility and counterrevolutionary measures compelled him to wrest control of the economy from hostile Cuban capitalists and move closer into Russia 's orbit .
Like Mao , Castro and Guevara 's politics were voluntarist .
Writes Nigel Harris , the guerrillas believed that " armed struggle creates the objective conditions for winning power , and , in Castro 's words , those conditions can be created in the ' immense majority of Latin American countries ' if between four and seven dedicated guerrillas can be found . "
The Cuban model of guerrilla warfare proved successful , however , only in Cuba .
This was a far cry from the politics of Marx and Engels , who argued that the " dictatorship of the proletariat " meant the rule of the working class , not a dictatorship of a minority .
Engels , in his criticism of August Blanqui , a French socialist who believed that revolution would be brought to the masses by a minority , wrote : " From Blanqui 's assumption , that any revolution may be made by the outbreak of a small revolutionary minority , follows of itself the necessity of a dictatorship after the success of the venture .
" This is , of course , a dictatorship , not of the entire revolutionary class , the proletariat , but of the small minority that has made the revolution , and who are themselves previously organized under the dictatorship of one or several individuals . "
WHAT IS notable about the ideology of the Cuban and Chinese revolutions , as well as of Stalin , is that they turn the basic tenets of Marxism on their head .
For Marxism , socialism can only succeed as a movement of the international working class .
There can be no socialism in one country .
Stalin pioneered the slogan " socialism in one country , " and the foundation of Che , Castro and Mao 's politics was first and foremost nationalism and national development .
For Marxism , socialism can only be achieved through the self - emancipation of the working class and the oppressed .
In the Chinese and Cuban revolutions , the working class played at best a passive role , with the center stage taken by armies acting in the name of the working class , which itself never seized nor held state power at any moment .
In Marxism , the workers ' state - - armed democracy -- is a transitory body with the purpose of ensuring that the old ruling classes cannot regain power .
Its purpose is to work itself out of a job , once class distinctions have been abolished .
In Stalin 's Russia -- and in the national versions of " socialism " it inspired -- the state is continually strengthened .
This is indirect proof , as the existence of all state power is , that classes in those societies have not been abolished .
All of the talk about the special Newsweek report describing the backstage events in this year 's presidential campaign has focused on various revelations about Sarah Palin 's astonishing lack of knowledge about global and national affairs , as well as her spending sprees .
But this passage seemed at least as significant , if not more so :
The Obama campaign was provided with reports from the Secret Service showing a sharp and disturbing increase in threats to Obama in September and early October , at the same time that many crowds at Palin rallies became more frenzied .
Michelle Obama was shaken by the vituperative crowds and the hot rhetoric from the GOP candidates .
" Why would they try to make people hate us ? "
Michelle asked a top campaign aide .
Tim Shipman at the Telegraph ( UK ) has more :
Details of the spike in threats to Mr Obama come as a report last week by security and intelligence analysts Stratfor , warned that he is a high risk target for racist gunmen .
It concluded : " Two plots to assassinate Obama were broken up during the campaign season , and several more remain under investigation .
We would expect federal authorities to uncover many more plots to attack the president that have been hatched by white supremacist ideologues . "
Irate John McCain aides , who blame Mrs Palin for losing the election , claim Mrs Palin took it upon herself to question Mr Obama 's patriotism , before the line of attack had been cleared by Mr McCain .
There was a reason , I think , that people were repelled by the ugliness that proceeded from the McCain / Palin campaign this year -- common sense , after all , should tell you where this kind of ugliness was heading .
It showed up at the polls .
The problem is finding a way to put out the fuse that they lit .
The streetcars are being renamed and the red carpets rolled out in the Castro district of San Francisco for the world premiere of Milk , the latest film to break Hollywood 's long - running taboo over homosexuality .
A roar of approval greeted Sean Penn and Josh Brolin as they swept past several hundred people who had gathered on Tuesday to applaud the biopic of Harvey Milk , America 's first openly gay elected politician who was assassinated in a corridor of the nearby City Hall 30 years ago .
Many in the crowd also used the occasion to protest , waving signs urging " Vote No on Proposition Eight " .
The measure would eliminate same - sex marriage in California if it were to be passed next week , and the battle serves as a topical reminder of how much still stands in the way of the movement that has elevated Milk to iconic status .

The colourful event brought considerable star power to Castro Street , the main street through the most famous gay and lesbian district in San Francisco , where Milk 's reign as city supervisor was cut short after he was shot and killed along with the Mayor , George Moscone , having served only 11 months in office .
The actors Emile Hirsch , Diego Luna , and the director Gus Van Sant – the man behind the 1997 film Good Will Hunting – were joined by local politicians , together with Milk 's old friends and contacts , many dressed as Seventies drag queens .
Yet it also highlighted a serious and pressing case of history repeating itself .
Three decades ago , Harvey Milk was responsible for leading the campaign against a ballot measure that seems eerily reminiscent of Proposition Eight .
Proposition
Six would have banned gays from teaching in California on the grounds that homosexuals were , at the time , considered more likely to be motivated by paedophilia .
Milk 's against - the - odds success in defeating the ballot measure is still seen as one of the most inspiring victories in the gay rights movement .
" Harvey Milk was prophetic , a pioneer of gay rights at a time when people needed it most , " said Peter Novak , a researcher on Milk 's career at the University of San Francisco , who also had a role as an extra in the film .
" He was articulate and founded a defence for the movement that continues to this day .
His death was also a significant moment in recognising what was at stake in the struggle for equality .
He used to say : ' if a bullet should enter my brain , let it destroy every closet door , ' and he knew his death would propel the gay rights movement forward . "
Milk , who is played by Penn in the film , was assassinated by a right - wing former city supervisor called Dan White ( Brolin ) , who was upset by the premature demise of his own political career .
Having been brought up in New York , Milk served in the US Navy , and became politically active after moving to San Francisco in the early Seventies .
A gift for speechmaking that has seen him widely compared to Barack Obama , helped him to forge links with the local electorate , trade unions , and the city 's Asian community .
He was elected to office at the third time of asking in 1977 .
The new film , which charts Milk 's life , comes almost a quarter of a century after Rob Epstein 's The Times of Harvey Milk won an Academy Award for best documentary .
The new film features a scene in which Penn enjoys a long French kiss with his co-star , James Franco .
In a recent interview , Franco revealed that shortly after the scene was shot , Penn text - messaged his former wife Madonna saying : " I just popped my cherry kissing a guy .
I thought of you , I do n't know why . "
The singer texted back : " Congratulations ! "
Although Milk 's career as an elected official lasted only 11 months , he pioneered several major pieces of equal rights legislation .
His anti-Proposition
Six campaign culminated in an Obama - like appeal for gay people and civil rights advocates to contribute " just one dollar " to fight the measure .
Yet it came to an end on 27 November , 1978 , in a wood - panelled corridor of San Francisco 's City Hall .
Appropriately enough , this is where thousands of local gay couples have been married in the months since California 's Supreme Court voted to make same - sex weddings legal .
Dan
White had resigned after a political dispute with Milk and other supervisors , claiming that his salary was not enough to carry out the job .
A few days later , he changed his mind and asked Moscone to rescind the resignation .
When that request was refused , he blamed the Mayor and Milk in equal measure .
Though he had n't previously shown signs of violence , the refusal affected White badly .
A few days later , he broke through a downstairs window of City Hall to avoid metal detectors and killed Milk and Moscone with hollow - pointed bullets from a revolver .
At the trial , White was sentenced to seven years for involuntary manslaughter , having convinced the jury he had carried out the killing on a whim as he had n't slept for days and had been bingeing on junk food .
It is now seen as one of the worst miscarriages of American justice .
His successful use of the so - called " Twinkie defence , " named after the snack that White blamed for his state of mind , meant that the plea of " diminished capacity " was later expunged from Californian law .
The sentence caused small - scale riots , and inspired the gay rights movement to secure Milk 's legacy .
Today , the tale will again be thrust to the centre of the public 's consciousness .
" Harvey Milk is a true American hero , " Van Sant told reporters on the red carpet on Tuesday .
" He 's a great example of a man representing his community and city . "
Gavin Newsom , San Francisco's Mayor , who pioneered same - sex marriage in California , and helped to install a bust of Milk at City Hall , announced that a streetcar used in the filming would be renamed in Milk 's honour , saying : " This story could n't have happened anywhere else . "
In Hollywood , the film 's nationwide release later this month is sparking widespread debate over how its production company , Focus Features , will try to sell to middle America a title which contains several explicitly homosexual scenes .
Only a small number of advertisements have been bought , and the film 's trailer has received limited showings .
Producers have kept it away from film festivals and are restricting media screenings , in a strategy aimed to make it become a " word of mouth " success like the 2005 film Brokeback Mountain starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal .
They may still face an uphill struggle .
" At a recent Vegas test - screening for a middle - class , straight audience , several senior citizens tried to leave after a gay love scene in the early moments , but could n't because they were trapped in the middle of a row , " according to the Hollywood Reporter this week .
" The seniors eventually said they were happy that they stayed but , like independent voters in an election contest , these are the very viewers that Focus must woo . "
A week before one of the most crucial ballots in the history of gay rights in the USA , the marketing conundrum inspired by Milk 's biopic provides the movement he prematurely left behind with a graphic reminder of the troubles it still faces .
" You know , the fact that we are still at a stage where you cannot market this as a mainstream film shows how far we still have left to come , " said Mr Novak .

International Business Machines Corp. , Hewlett - Packard Co. and other big computer makers are spotting opportunity in customers ' desire to curb electricity usage in large corporate data centers , where energy use has soared in recent years .
Rising electricity prices , coupled with new computer servers that run hotter and require more power , has corporate technology buyers looking for ways to cut back .
Power use in data centers -- the large , climate - controlled rooms that house a company 's computer servers , storage devices and communications switches -- doubled from 2000 to 2006 and now accounts for about 1.5 % of U.S. electricity consumption , according to the Environmental Protection Agency .
A recent McKinsey & Co. report says that world - wide , the centers ' carbon emissions exceed those of Argentina .
Somewhat ironically , the companies that designed and sold those computers are now able to capitalize on the higher power bills the machines rack up .
IBM surprised Wall Street this year when it said its new " Green Data - Center Services " business -- which redesigns customers ' data centers and sells energy - efficient products -- signed $ 300 million in orders in the 2007 fourth quarter .
The company has declined to release figures for 2008 .
IBM Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano recently told analysts that IBM expects more than 70 % of the world 's biggest companies " will modify their data centers significantly in the next five years " to deal with energy shortfalls and rising costs .
Croom resigned Saturday , less than 24 hours after an embarrassing 45 - 0 loss to Mississippi in the most lopsided Egg Bowl in 37 years .
He announced the decision in a statement released by the school after meeting with athletic director Greg Byrne .
Croom was 21 -38 at Mississippi State and coached the team to one winning season .
Byrne said it was Croom 's decision to resign .
" We talked about a lot of different ideas , and Coach Croom was open to a lot of different ideas , " Byrne said at a news conference .
" The final idea was where we landed . "
With Croom gone , only three black coaches remain at the 119 major college football programs -- Miami's Randy Shannon , Buffalo's Turner Gill and Houston 's Kevin Sumlin .
Ty Willingham at Washington , who has one game left with the Huskies , and Ron Prince at Kansas State have been fired .
Croom , who took over the team while it was under NCAA sanctions , won 2007 SEC coach of the year honors after leading the Bulldogs to an 8 - 5 finish and an appearance in the Liberty Bowl .
He signed a contract extension in the offseason that paid him $ 1.7 million this year .
But he came under immediate pressure from fans after a season - opening loss to Louisiana Tech of the Western Athletic Conference , and the heat only intensified as the offensively inept Bulldogs stumbled to a 4 - 8 finish .
Croom did not immediately return a phone message left by The Associated Press .
" Five years ago , Mississippi State gave me the unprecedented opportunity to be a head football coach in the Southeastern Conference and to build a program based upon a strong foundation , " Croom said in a statement .
" We have tried to build a program the right way that can compete for conference championships .
I believe the foundation has been set for those goals to be reached under the leadership of someone else , and it was my decision to resign . "
Byrne was scheduled to meet with reporters later Saturday afternoon .
Running backs coach Rockey Felker , who was once head coach at Mississippi State , will run the team while the Bulldogs search for Croom 's replacement .
Calls for Croom to make changes to his coaching staff and run-first offensive philosophy dogged the Bulldogs .
The team continued to have trouble at quarterback , and Croom switched starters midway through the season .
A source familiar with Croom 's situation at Mississippi State told ESPN.com 's Pat Forde that the breaking point was not a refusal on Croom 's part to make staff changes ; rather , an important issue was the continuing ineptitude of the Bulldogs ' offense under Croom .
In five years , Mississippi State has never ranked in the NCAA top 100 in total offense .
The Bulldogs were 11th in the SEC in scoring offense ( 16.6 points per game ) and 10th in total offense ( 297.7 yards per game ) through 11 games and lost badly at Georgia Tech ( 38 - 7 ) and Tennessee ( 34 - 3 ) .
Yet some optimism remained that Mississippi State could salvage a bit of pride and its promising recruiting class after a 31 - 28 win over Arkansas last week and after a good game against the revitalized Rebels .
Croom even got a vote of confidence from incoming Mississippi State president Mark Keenum .
But Mississippi State was outmatched from the start and looked poorly prepared against Ole Miss .
The quarterbacks were hit hard on nine of their first 10 pass attempts , as the Rebels put together a school - record 11 sacks and set another mark by holding the Bulldogs to minus - 51 yards rushing .
Croom seemed stunned after the game .
" They came in here with the idea they were going to beat us bad , and they did from start to finish , " Croom said .
" I do n't know why what happened today occurred .
I 'm sorry to say that it 's an absolute mystery to me . "
Byrne , a new hire who 's been on the job for less than a year , would n't comment on the speculation surrounding the football team during the season but said Saturday that a possible resignation had been discussed during the morning meeting .
" We discussed the football program and many topics were addressed , including resignation , " Byrne said in a statement .
" I want to thank Coach Croom for the leadership he has provided our football program over the last five years . "
Although Croom was n't able to squeeze out many wins during his tenure , there 's little question he improved a Mississippi State program that was at its lowest ebb .
The Bulldogs were hit with major sanctions following rules violations under previous coach Jackie Sherrill and had won just three games a season between 2001 and 2003 .
Hired Dec. 1 , 2003 , the Bear Bryant disciple who had been an All - American center at Alabama and an NFL assistant for 17 seasons inherited a team low on talent .
Heavy sanctions and the SEC 's lowest budget made the challenge even steeper .
" We could n't even get recruits to visit campus , " Croom said this past week while talking about his early recruiting efforts .
But Croom upgraded the talent enough that the Bulldogs were competitive in the nation 's toughest conference and earned their first winning season since 2000 last year , capping it with a 10 - 3 win over Central Florida in the Liberty Bowl .
Croom also was having success off the field .
He 'd drawn commitments from several top recruits , including a quarterback .
A spokesman said players would not be available Saturday , but some defended Croom following Friday 's loss .
" I think it is unfair , " wide receiver Delmon Robinson said of the criticism .
" When it 's man - to - man coverage , it 's the receiver against the [ defensive back ] .
If the receiver does n't win , it 's not the coach 's fault that he did n't win .
It 's all about the players .
We 've got to win , and we 've got to go out there and execute Coach 's plays . "
It was the second straight season an embarrassing loss in the Egg Bowl led to a coaching change .
Mississippi coach Ed Orgeron was fired a day after the Rebels collapsed in a 17 - 14 loss .
Ole Miss had led 14 - 0 going into the fourth quarter , but Orgeron went for it on fourth down at midfield .
The Bulldogs stopped the play , went on to score and finished with 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter .
Byrne said Croom 's assistants remain under contract and will work until a new coach is hired .
He told Forde that Mississippi State 's search for a successor begins immediately and will be national in scope .
He declined to discuss any specific potential candidates but said he wanted a " passionate leader who is capable of helping us win in the SEC .
We have a lot of talent here in this state and a very supportive fan base .
We can win here . "
Among the coaches Mississippi State might target to replace Croom are Oklahoma defensive coordinator Brent Venables , East Carolina coach Skip Holtz and TCU coach Gary Patterson .
" Looking forward , I plan to work closely with athletic director Greg Byrne to move quickly , but with due deliberation , to find a new head football coach with high energy and a commitment to compete for championships and bowl opportunities in the best conference in America , " Keenum said .
There likely will be several candidates for a coveted SEC job , but Mississippi State 's new coach should n't get comfortable .
Five of six SEC
West schools have made coaching changes in the past five years , with only Tommy Tuberville at Auburn lasting through that time .
And even he 's facing criticism in a losing season .
The Rebels ' new coach , Houston Nutt , had been at Arkansas for 10 years before resigning after last season and moving to Ole Miss .
But he believes that tenures such as that one could be a thing of the past because fans and boosters have little patience for losing .
" It 's sad , but it does n't surprise me , " Nutt said .
" It 's the way of the world in college football right now . "

Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
There has been chaos at Bangkok 's Suvarnabhumi international airport since it was occupied by anti-government protesters .
Flights from the airport were suspended because of the protest - the latest stage in months of demonstrations in the Thai capital .
Thousands of travellers have been left stranded .
The People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) protesters are demanding the resignation of Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat and say they will not leave until he steps down .
Security has been high and some of the protesters were injured by small blasts , but travellers said they did not feel threatened .
However , some complained that they had received very little information from the authorities and that tensions were rising .
Many have been stuck in no -man 's land , having passed immigration and checked in their luggage .
Some people have now been evacuated , but tourists reported chaotic scenes as buses arrived to take them away from the airport .

We all know how much companies in China love producing knockoffs of successful products , and ActFind is selling a bunch of the iPhone .
What 's interesting is that ActFind is simply using photos of the real iPhone to sell some of the fakes .
The items ' names and descriptions give away they 're fake : " Especial function :
Shake to elect song , ditheringge elect motif picture , " reads the description for the $ 143 Shake to Control GSM Quad - band IP001 ( pictured to the right ) .
Shoot – I wish I could elect a motif picture on my iPhone .
Gearlog came across the knock - off and dug up some other ones , too .
The $ 116 " Shaking Control Phone Unlocked Tri-band P168S " ( pictured to the left ) looks interesting .
It actually appears to be a more " legit " photo of the actual knockoff , with a silver case and a speaker on back .
Comparing it to the real iPhone , you 'll notice the Home button contains a fatter square , the case is a bit thicker , and length - wise the phone looks a bit squashed .
The description is the funniest part :
" Select next previous song by shaking the phone 3.5 inch Touch Screen
QVGA high clear LCD display screen and 1.3 Mega Pixel Digital Camera .
Also , it has MP3 MP4 Player function .
Besides , it supports dual SIM
cards for calling as well as Unlocked SIM card .
If you buy now , we will send you 256M Card Free of charge .
Now go ahead ! "
Why , I think I will go right on ahead !
Okily doo !
I 'll just punch my credit card number in your checkout section right after I post my social security number on the internet and get the words " I 'M A FREAKING MORON " tattooed on my chest .

Republican Math
Like many people McCain's Veep choice
has me stumped .
A play for Hillary voters ?
Palin's pro-life , wants Creationism taught
in schools , does n't think there is scientific
proof of global warming , is against listing
the Polar Bear on the Endangered Species
List —
A wet start to counter Obama 's convention
speech ?
Get his ratings up ?
Oz wrote about McCain 's alarming propensity
for crashing airplanes .
See : The Wrong Stuff .
Was it a gamble , an impulse ?
Or do Republicans just have weird ideas
about women ?
It 's not Cindy McCain 's fault that she looks
like Barbie , but did n't John offer her up
to take part in a contest to be Queen of
a Biker rally — a competition that involved
topless contestants French kissing guys
in Motorcycle garb ?
Or consider Bush 's first pick for Supreme Court
Chief ( no less ) Justice , Harriette Meyer — who quickly
withdrew when it became obvious to everyone
her only qualification was loyalty to G.W .
Or Texas Senator , Kay Bailey Hutchinson , who
votes lock step with the Bush agenda .
Was n't she ,
like Palin , a beauty pageant winner ?
Or Kathrine Harris ( Catherine the Great ) who
ran for Senate after fixing the vote for Bush
in Florida in 2002 .
And there 's Laura Bush , the librarian who did n't
know Walt Whitman had written bitterly
in opposition to war .
Or Barbara Bush , who said Katrina refugees in
shelters in Houston probably had better accommodations
there than they were accustomed to .
Or Condi Rice —
the Russian Scholar from Stanford who gets
everything wrong .
It is not that there are no qualified women
in the Republican party .
Olympia Snow ,
has international experience .
Palin got her first passport
after she was elected Governor of Alaska .
I 'm not alone in wondering what McCain
could possibly have been thinking when he
picked her .
Here are ten disturbing things
about Palin from AlterNet .
I do n't give a flip that her daughter is pregnant ,
but it concerns me that Gov. Palin either lied about
whose child the four month old baby is —
or recklessly endangered his life and her own
by waiting after her water broke to deliver a speech
in Texas , then flew ( while in labor ) eleven hours
to Alaska , drove to her home town hospital
to deliver — a mother over 40 , carrying a Downs
Syndrome baby ?
And the hospital records
only two births that day , neither of which
were her's .
Starting with Enron , which my family first
experienced as rolling brown outs in California ,
I 've been convinced that Republicans can't
count .
Or if they can , the numbers do n't work
unless you assume the existence of something
that 's invisible .
Photos of Palin within weeks of the " birth "
of her last child show her svelt and trim .
Her daughter , at the same time , was absent
from school for several months with mono ,
the kissing disease .
Apply Republican
Math to a woman 's gestation
cycles -- an age old trick -- and you get
Palin 's announcement yesterday that her
daughter is 5 months pregnant and will
marry her childhood sweetheart and raise
the baby with the loving support of the whole
family .
And that 's cool .
It also gets Palin off the hook , if you buy it ,
for the earlier rumor , that her youngest child
( 4 months old ) is actually her daughter 's baby .
Impossible .
The daughter 's five months pregnant .
Women have been counting the days of
our cycles , the months of our pregancies , hours
and minutes and seconds between contractions
since there have been women .
If a woman says
her baby is early ( born 7 months from the wedding
day ) who 's going to challenge it ?
Who cares ?
Why are we even talking about this ?
Is it possible that McCain knew this beforehand ,
and counted on the distraction it would provide ?
They do n't have to defend GW 's record —
Iraq , the economy , the housing market crash ,
the cost of oil ?
They just have to speak up
for a damsel in distress ?
What does this tell us about how
he makes decisions ?
What does the Palin choice tell us about how
he views women ?
Anyhow , what do Republicans do when they are
confronted with a competent , brilliant , informed ,
woman who asks questions , speaks the truth —
like Amy Goodman ?
They arrest her .

Most thought US relations would get better under a president Obama People outside the US would prefer Barack Obama to become US president ahead of John McCain , a BBC World Service poll suggests .
Democrat Mr Obama was favoured by a four - to - one margin across the 22,500 people polled in 22 countries .
In 17 countries , the most common view was that US relations with the rest of the world would improve under Mr Obama .
If Republican Mr McCain were elected , the most common view was that relations would remain about the same .
The poll was conducted before the Democratic and Republican parties held their conventions and before the headline - grabbing nomination of Sarah Palin as Mr McCain 's running mate .
BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says the results could therefore be a reflection of the greater media focus on Mr Obama as he competed for the presidential candidacy against Hillary Clinton .
The margin of those in favour of Mr Obama winning November 's US election ranged from 9 % in India to 82 % in Kenya , which is the birthplace of the Illinois senator 's father .
On average 49 % preferred Mr Obama to 12 % in favour of Mr McCain .
Nearly four in 10 of those polled did not take a view .
On average 46 % thought US relations with the world would improve with Mr Obama in the White House , 22 % that ties would stay the same , while seven per cent expected relations to worsen .
Only 20 % thought ties would get better if Mr McCain were in the Oval Office .
The expectation that a McCain presidency would improve US relations with the world was the most common view , by a modest margin , only in China , India and Nigeria .
But across the board , the largest number - 37 % - thought relations under a president McCain would stay the same , while 16 % expected them to deteriorate .
In no country did most people think that a McCain presidency would worsen relations .
Some 30 % of Americans expected relations to improve under Mr McCain Oddly , in Turkey more people thought US relations would worsen with an Obama presidency than under Mr McCain , even though most Turks polled preferred Mr Obama to win .
In Egypt , Lebanon , Russia and Singapore , the predominant expectation was that relations would remain the same if Mr Obama won the election .
The countries most optimistic that an Obama presidency would improve ties were US Nato allies - Canada ( 69 % ) , Italy ( 64 % ) , France ( 62 % ) , Germany ( 61 % ) , and the UK ( 54 % ) - as well as Australia ( 62 % ) , along with Kenya ( 87 % ) and Nigeria ( 71 % ) .
When asked whether the election as president of the African - American Mr Obama would " fundamentally change " their perception of the US , 46 % said it would while 27 % said it would not .

The US public was polled separately and Americans also believed an Obama presidency would improve US ties with the world more than a McCain presidency .
Forty - six per cent of Americans expected relations to get better if Mr Obama were elected and 30 % if Mr McCain won the White House .
A similar poll conducted for BBC World Service ahead of the 2004 US presidential election found most countries would have preferred to see Democratic nominee John Kerry beat the incumbent George W Bush .
At the time , the Philippines , Nigeria and Poland were among the few countries to favour Mr Bush 's re-election .
All three now favour Mr Obama over Mr McCain .
In total 22,531 citizens were polled in Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , Egypt , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Kenya , Lebanon , Mexico , Nigeria , Panama , the Philippines , Poland , Russia , Singapore , Turkey , the UAE and the UK .
A parallel survey was conducted with 1,000 US adults .
Polling firm GlobeScan and the Program on International Policy Attitudes carried out the survey between July and August .

What are these ?
Much of the analysis is based on records of Guantánamo hearings for individual detainees , which have been made public since 2006 as a result of a lawsuit by The Associated Press .
The Times has posted those documents on its Web site arranged by detainee name .
The analysis shows that about 34 of the remaining detainees were seized in raids in Pakistan that netted three men the government calls major Qaeda operatives : Abu Zubaydah , Ramzi bin al - Shibh and Al Hajj Abdu Ali Sharqawi .
Sixteen detainees are accused of some of the most significant terrorist attacks in the last decade , including the 1998 bombings at American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , the 2000 attack on the destroyer Cole in Yemen , and the Sept. 11 attacks .
Twenty others were called Mr. bin Laden ’s bodyguards .
The analysis also shows that 13 of the original 23 detainees who arrived at Guantánamo on Jan. 11 , 2002 , remain there nearly seven years later .
Of the roughly 255 men now being held , more than 60 have been cleared for release or transfer , according to the Pentagon , but remain at Guantánamo because of difficulties negotiating transfer agreements between the United States and other countries .
Two of those still held , government documents show , were seen by Mr. bin Laden as potential Sept. 11 hijackers .
The case of Mohammed al - Qahtani , whom the government has labeled a potential “ 20th hijacker , ” has drawn wide notice because he was subjected to interrogation tactics that included sleep deprivation , isolation and being put on a leash and forced to perform dog tricks .
The other detainee deemed a potential hijacker , whose presence at Guantánamo has gone virtually unmentioned in public reports , is a Yemeni called Abu Bara .
The 9/11 Commission said he studied flights and airport security and participated in an important planning meeting for the 2001 attack in Malaysia in January 2000 .
The Guantánamo list also includes two Saudi brothers , Hassan and Walid bin Attash .
The government describes them as something like Qaeda royalty .
Military officials said during Guantánamo hearings that their father , imprisoned in Saudi Arabia , was a “ close contact of Osama bin Laden ” and that his sons were committed jihadists .

Walid bin Attash is facing a possible death sentence as a coordinator of the Sept. 11 attacks .
Hassan bin Attash was accused of having been involved in planning attacks on American oil tankers and Navy ships .
Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick , D - Mich .
By Romain Blanquart , Detroit Free Press Enlarge AP Former Mich .
Rep. Martha Scott , left , and Mich . Sen. Mary Waters , right , are challenging U.S. Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick , D - Mich. , in the August Democratic primary for her U.S. House seat .
Kilpatrick is the mother of Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick , embroiled in a scandal over steamy text messages he reportedly exchanged with a former aide .
DETROIT ( AP )  Primary voters across Michigan on Tuesday were weighing ballot possibilities that included congressional contests , judicial races and local measures such as a special tax to pay for operations at the Detroit Zoo .
But a Detroit - area congressional race was the most prominent contest in the statewide primary .
Incumbent Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick was locked in a tight race against former state Rep. Mary Waters and state Sen. Martha Scott .
Kilpatrick , chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus , was fighting harder to retain the seat she easily has won in past elections in the aftermath of perjury and other felony charges against her son , Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick .
The contested election divided voters at Kilpatrick 's polling station Tuesday morning .
It was among the key races for Willie Mitchell , a 59 - year - old painter .
Although he said Kwame Kilpatrick " messed up , " Mitchell said the mayor 's mother deserved his support .
" She 's the most qualified — she has brought money back to the state , " Mitchell said .
" Critics do n't know her track record .
If they understand the power she has in Congress , they 'd put ( the mayoral scandal ) aside . "
Vanita Johnson was in a less conciliatory mood as she walked out of the polling station .
She said the mayor 's legal troubles led her to cast a vote for Waters .
" I 'm tired of the current administration — I 'm ready for a change , " said the 42 - year - old public safety officer for the Detroit Public Schools .
" I know she personally did n't do it , but I believe she had a lot more influence over her son than you or me would . "
Both Mitchell and Johnson agreed on supporting the Detroit Zoo tax , which would generate an extra $ 15 million annually for the zoo from taxpayers in Wayne , Oakland and Macomb counties .
The proposed 0.1 - mill tax would add about $ 10 a year for the next decade to the property taxes on a home with a taxable value of $ 100,000 .
Statewide , 44 of the House 's 110 seats were open because of incumbent lawmakers facing term limits .
The Michigan secretary of state 's office expected fewer than one in five registered voters to cast ballots .
The National Weather Service said there was a chance of thunderstorms across most of the eastern half of lower Michigan and the eastern Upper Peninsula .
Partly cloudy skies were likely in the central and western portions of both peninsulas .
Mitchell said he was disappointed so many voters , particularly young men , stay away from the polls .
He recalled the civil rights struggles of the 1960s that made it easier for blacks to vote .
As he spoke , he gestured to nearby Rosa Parks Boulevard , the site of riots in 1967 riots , when it was known as 12th Street .
Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed , more than 1,000 people were injured and 43 people died .
" People lost their lives in order for me to come out and vote , " he said .
" We have to stand up . " Copyright 2008 The Associated Press .

Hillary Clinton plans to accept the job of secretary of state offered by Barack Obama , who is reaching out to former rivals to build a broad coalition administration , the Guardian has learned .
Obama 's advisers have begun looking into Bill Clinton 's foundation , which distributes millions of dollars to Africa to help with development , to ensure there is no conflict of interest .
But Democrats believe the vetting will be straightforward .
Clinton would be well placed to become the country 's dominant voice in foreign affairs , replacing Condoleezza Rice .
Since being elected senator for New York , she has specialised in foreign affairs and defence .
Although she supported the war in Iraq , she and Obama basically agree on a withdrawal of American troops .
Clinton , who still harbours hopes of a future presidential run , had to weigh up whether she would be better placed by staying in the Senate , which offers a platform for life , or making the more uncertain career move to the state department .
As part of the coalition - building , Obama yesterday also reached out to his defeated Republican rival , John McCain , to discuss how they could work together to roll back some of the most controversial policies of the Bush years .
Putting aside the bitter words thrown about with abandon by both sides during the election campaign , McCain flew to meet Obama at his headquarters in the Kluczynski Federal Building , in downtown Chicago .
Obama , speaking before the meeting , said : " We 're going to have a good conversation about how we can work together to fix up the country . "
Asked by a reporter whether he would work with Obama , McCain , who favours a bipartisan approach to politics , replied : " Obviously " .
Sources on both sides said Obama did not offer McCain a cabinet job , but focused on how the senator for Arizona could help to guide legislation that they both strongly favour through Congress .
Given Obama 's status as president - in - waiting , the two met in a formal setting , a room decked out with a US flag , and were accompanied by senior advisers .
Although the two clashed during the election campaign over tax policy and withdrawal from Iraq , they have more in common than they have differences .
They both favour the closure of the Guantánamo Bay detention centre , an increase in US troops to Afghanistan , immigration reform , stem cell research and measures to tackle climate change , and oppose torture and the widespread use of wire - tapping .
After the meeting , they issued a joint statement saying : " At this defining moment in history , we believe that Americans of all parties want and need their leaders to come together and change the bad habits of Washington so that we can solve the common and urgent challenges of our time .
We hope to work together in the days and months ahead on critical challenges like solving our financial crisis , creating a new energy economy and protecting our nation 's security . "
Although Democrats made gains in the Senate in the November 4 elections , they fell short of the 60 seats that would have allowed them to override Republican blocking tactics and will need Republican allies to get Obama 's plans through .
This was highlighted yesterday when the Democratic leadership in Congress announced that a broad economic stimulus package Obama sought was not likely to be passed because of Republican opposition .
Obama confirmed at the weekend that he would offer jobs to some Republicans .
One of the names that crops up most often is Chuck Hagel , the former Republican senator who is a specialist in foreign affairs and a critic of the Iraq war .
Fascism arrived in an unprecedented coup , and the shameless Paulson is already hard at it completely taking over the US financial system .
The hubris shown by Paulson is breathtaking .
The “ Office of Financial Stability ” will be headed by none other than former Goldman Sachs CEO Ed Forst .
Paulson 's plan is to buy “ up to 250 billion ” in ' toxic assets ' from his cronies on wall street and then sell them at auction , not to individuals , but to “ any financial institution that meets the Treasury 's conditions . ”
Lehman , Sachs and any of the ' troubled ' institutions that have their billions invested in mortgage - backed securities will start auctioning off these “ properties ” through the government to the state - chartered banks – competition to those who now run the show – thereby eventually eliminating their competition .
Sachs et al will be getting a twofer .
Not only will they be getting “ free ” money from the treasury , but will also leave the smaller banks and investment firms holding the toxic waste .
When those companies go out of business , Sachs and Lehman Bros. can snatch the assets back up , either for free , when the government seizes the assets at some later date , or at ridiculously low prices .
It is one big Ponzi scheme and the Congress just opened the door wide and totally sold the entire financial system to criminals .
If you thought that the ' Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ' was going to stabilize the economy , think again .
The Treasury could add three - and seven - year notes , as its borrowing advisory committee has proposed .
It also could reopen existing notes and bonds , or even hold a series of one - time medium - and long - term debt sales .
“ Under normal circumstances , the Treasury 's financing decisions are guided by its desire to be regular and predictable , '' said Louis Crandall , chief economist at Wrightson ICAP in New Jersey .
“ However , there is certainly nothing `regular ' about this rescue package , so that approach is not relevant , '' he said .
You can already tell that Paulson and his cronies , in trying to cover up the largest economic blunder in history , are throwing all caution to the wind .
This seems to be the norm in financial crises .
The people are willing to take things slow and weather the storm while the financial gurus are jumping out of windows .
It is already clear that the medicine is worse than the cure and the bill was only passed today .
Paulson will tinker and fiddle while Rome burns .
With virtually no accountability and an unlimited supply of cash , any mistake he may make will be compounded by many more as he tries to fix the unintended consequences that arise from his tinkerings .
What he cannot possibly admit , and this is the grand irony , is that the fiat system he seeks to control and bend to his will can not be mended .
There is only one , inevitable outcome – bankruptcy .
Because he cannot and will not admit this , and every one of the big asset - management companies he seeks to hire will be , by definition , advocates of this fiat - currency - based system , there will be no one to tap him on the shoulder , telling him what he seeks to accomplish is impossible .
And were there somebody to do so , they would be dismissed faster than you can say “ toxic asset . ”
We are quite near the end of the current dollar 's existence and we should take care to have a say in the currency system that arises from the ashes .
The people who brought you this mess will most definitely be advocating that the dollar be scrapped in favor of the Amero , yet another fiat currency .
Lipstick on a pig , as it were .
When the system collapses , sound money is going to be the only way we can preserve freedom .
But , we do n't necessarily have to wait for the collapse to start using sound money .
As the economy is wrecked and the hyperinflation starts showing effects , the only recourse is to get out of any dollar - denominated assets and hoard things that can be used as money .
Gold and silver are the most obvious choices but there are plenty of valuable barter items including salt .
However it turns out , it 's clear that there are a very small number of blameless politicians .
None of those who voted for or advocated for the bailout should utter a word when remedies are proposed .
And if they do , they should be ridiculed and shunned .
THE FED NOW OWNS THE WORLD�S
LARGEST INSURANCE COMPANY --
BUT WHO OWNS THE FED ?
� Some people think that the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions .
They are private monopolies which prey upon the people of these United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers ; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers ; and rich and predatory money lenders . �
� �� The Honorable Louis McFadden , Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee in the 1930s
The Federal Reserve ( or Fed ) has assumed sweeping new powers in the last year .
In an unprecedented move in March 2008 , the New York Fed advanced the funds for JPMorgan Chase Bank to buy investment bank Bear Stearns for pennies on the dollar .
The deal was particularly controversial because Jamie Dimon , CEO of JPMorgan , sits on the board of the New York Fed and participated in the secret weekend negotiations .
1
In September 2008 , the Federal Reserve did something even more unprecedented , when it bought the world�s largest insurance company .
The Fed announced on September 16 that it was giving an $ 85 billion loan to American International Group ( AIG ) for a nearly 80 % stake in the mega - insurer .
The Associated Press called it a �government takeover , � but this was no ordinary nationalization .
Unlike the U.S. Treasury , which took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the week before , the Fed is not a government - owned agency .
Also unprecedented was the way the deal was funded .
The Associated Press reported :
� The Treasury Department , for the first time in its history , said it would begin selling bonds for the Federal Reserve in an effort to help the central bank deal with its unprecedented borrowing needs .
�2
This is extraordinary .
Why is the Treasury issuing U.S. government bonds ( or debt ) to fund the Fed , which is itself supposedly � the lender of last resort� created to fund the banks and the federal government ?
Yahoo Finance reported on September 17 :
� The Treasury is setting up a temporary financing program at the Fed�s request .
The program will auction Treasury bills to raise cash for the Fed�s use .
The initiative aims to help the Fed manage its balance sheet following its efforts to enhance its liquidity facilities over the previous few quarters . �
Normally , the Fed swaps green pieces of paper called Federal Reserve Notes for pink pieces of paper called U.S. bonds ( the federal government�s I.O.U.s ) , in order to provide Congress with the dollars it cannot raise through taxes .
Now , it seems , the government is issuing bonds , not for its own use , but for the use of the Fed !
Perhaps the plan is to swap them with the banks � dodgy derivatives collateral directly , without actually putting them up for sale to outside buyers .
According to Wikipedia ( which translates Fedspeak into somewhat clearer terms than the Fed�s own website ) :
� The Term Securities Lending Facility is a 28 - day facility that will offer Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York�s primary dealers in exchange for other program - eligible collateral .
It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally .
. . .
The resource allows dealers to switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable .�
� To switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable� means that the government gets the banks � toxic derivative debt , and the banks get the government�s triple - A securities .
Unlike the risky derivative debt , federal securities are considered �risk - free� for purposes of determining capital requirements , allowing the banks to improve their capital position so they can make new loans .
( See E. Brown , � Bailout Bedlam , � webofdebt.com / articles , October 2 , 2008 . )
In its latest power play , on October 3 , 2008 , the Fed acquired the ability to pay interest to its member banks on the reserves the banks maintain at the Fed .
Reuters reported on October 3 :
� The U.S. Federal Reserve gained a key tactical tool from the $ 700 billion financial rescue package signed into law on Friday that will help it channel funds into parched credit markets .
Tucked into the 451 - page bill is a provision that lets the Fed pay interest on the reserves banks are required to hold at the central bank .�3
If the Fed�s money comes ultimately from the taxpayers , that means we the taxpayers are paying interest to the banks on the banks � own reserves � reserves maintained for their own private profit .
These increasingly controversial encroachments on the public purse warrant a closer look at the central banking scheme itself .
Who owns the Federal Reserve , who actually controls it , where does it get its money , and whose interests is it serving ?
Not Private and Not for Profit ? �
The Fed�s website insists that it is not a private corporation , is not operated for profit , and is not funded by Congress .
But is that true ?
The Federal Reserve was set up in 1913 as a �lender of last resort� to backstop bank runs , following a particularly bad bank panic in 1907 .
The Fed�s mandate was then and continues to be to keep the private banking system intact ; and that means keeping intact the system�s most valuable asset , a monopoly on creating the national money supply .
Except for coins , every dollar in circulation is now created privately as a debt to the Federal Reserve or the banking system it heads .
4
The Fed�s website attempts to gloss over its role as chief defender and protector of this private banking club , but let�s take a closer look .
The website states :
� The twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks , which were established by Congress as the operating arms of the nation�s central banking system , are organized much like private corporations � possibly leading to some confusion about �ownership .�
For example , the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks .
However , owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company .
The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit , and ownership of a certain amount of stock is , by law , a condition of membership in the System .
The stock may not be sold , traded , or pledged as security for a loan ; dividends are , by law , 6 percent per year . �
�[ The Federal Reserve ] is considered an independent central bank because its decisions do not have to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branch of government , it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress , and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms . �
� The Federal Reserve�s income is derived primarily from the interest on U.S. government securities that it has acquired through open market operations .
. . .
After paying its expenses , the Federal Reserve turns the rest of its earnings over to the U.S. Treasury .
�5
So let �s review :
1 . The Fed is privately owned .
Its shareholders are private banks .
In fact , 100 % of its shareholders are private banks .
None of its stock is owned by the government .
2 . The fact that the Fed does not get �appropriations � from Congress basically means that it gets its money from Congress without congressional approval , by engaging in �open market operations . �
Here is how it works :
When the government is short of funds , the Treasury issues bonds and delivers them to bond dealers , which auction them off .
When the Fed wants to �expand the money supply � ( create money ) , it steps in and buys bonds from these dealers with newly - issued dollars acquired by the Fed for the cost of writing them into an account on a computer screen .
These maneuvers are called �open market operations � because the Fed buys the bonds on the �open market� from the bond dealers .
The bonds then become the �reserves� that the banking establishment uses to back its loans .
In another bit of sleight of hand known as �fractional reserve� lending , the same reserves are lent many times over , further expanding the money supply , generating interest for the banks with each loan .
It was this money - creating process that prompted Wright Patman , Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee in the 1960s , to call the Federal Reserve �a total money - making machine .�
He wrote :
� When the Federal Reserve writes a check for a government bond it does exactly what any bank does , it creates money , it created money purely and simply by writing a check . �
3 . The Fed generates profits for its shareholders .
The interest on bonds acquired with its newly - issued Federal Reserve Notes pays the Fed�s operating expenses plus a guaranteed 6 % return to its banker shareholders .
A mere 6 % a year may not be considered a profit in the world of Wall Street high finance , but most businesses that manage to cover all their expenses and give their shareholders a guaranteed 6 % return are considered �for profit� corporations . �
In addition to this guaranteed 6 % , the banks will now be getting interest from the taxpayers on their �reserves .�
The basic reserve requirement set by the Federal Reserve is 10 % .
The website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York explains that as money is redeposited and relent throughout the banking system , this 10 % held in �reserve� can be fanned into ten times that sum in loans ; that is , $ 10,000 in reserves becomes $ 100,000 in loans .
Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.8 puts the total �loans and leases in bank credit� as of September 24 , 2008 at $ 7,049 billion .
Ten percent of that is $ 700 billion .
That means we the taxpayers will be paying interest to the banks on at least $ 700 billion annually � this so that the banks can retain the reserves to accumulate interest on ten times that sum in loans .
The banks earn these returns from the taxpayers for the privilege of having the banks � interests protected by an all - powerful independent private central bank , even when those interests may be opposed to the taxpayers � -- for example , when the banks use their special status as private money creators to fund speculative derivative schemes that threaten to collapse the U.S. economy .
Among other special benefits , banks and other financial institutions ( but not other corporations ) can borrow at the low Fed funds rate of about 2 % .
They can then turn around and put this money into 30 - year Treasury bonds at 4.5 % , earning an immediate 2.5 % from the taxpayers , just by virtue of their position as favored banks .
A long list of banks ( but not other corporations ) is also now protected from the short selling that can crash the price of other stocks .
Time to Change the Statute ?
According to the Fed�s website , the control Congress has over the Federal Reserve is limited to this :
� [ T ]he Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by Congress , which periodically reviews its activities and can alter its responsibilities by statute . �
As we know from watching the business news , �oversight � basically means that Congress gets to see the results when it�s over .
The Fed periodically reports to Congress , but the Fed doesn�t ask ; it tells .
The only real leverage Congress has over the Fed is that it �can alter its responsibilities by statute .�
It is time for Congress to exercise that leverage and make the Federal Reserve a truly federal agency , acting by and for the people through their elected representatives .
If the Fed can demand AIG�s stock in return for an $ 85 billion loan to the mega - insurer , we can demand the Fed�s stock in return for the trillion - or - so dollars we�ll be advancing to bail out the private banking system from its follies .
If the Fed were actually a federal agency , the government could issue U.S. legal tender directly , avoiding an unnecessary interest - bearing debt to private middlemen who create the money out of thin air themselves .
Among other benefits to the taxpayers .
a truly �federal � Federal Reserve could lend the full faith and credit of the United States to state and local governments interest - free , cutting the cost of infrastructure in half , restoring the thriving local economies of earlier decades . �
Addendum : Who Owns the Banks That Own the Fed ?
Beyond merely stating that all the shareholders of the Fed are its member banks , I�ve been asked to elaborate on who actually owns those banks . �
Are they owned by powerful foreign banking families as has been alleged ?�
According to a discursive article by Dr. Edward Flaherty , condensed below , the answer is no � not to any provable extent . �
But that does not mean that the Fed and the U.S. banking system are not controlled from abroad . �
The central banking system has its own �banker�s bank , � the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) in Basel , Switzerland . �
The BIS does control the international banking system , in part by setting capital requirements -- the requirements that have now caused the entire U.S. credit market to freeze up .�
But that is a subject for a later article . �
Dr. Flaherty wrote :
�. . .
Each of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks is organized into a corporation whose shares are sold to the commercial banks and thrifts operating within the Bank�s district .
Shareholders elect six of the nine the board of directors for their regional Federal Reserve Bank as well as its president .
. . .
� The SEC requires the name of any individual or organization that owns more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of a publicly traded firm be made public .
If foreigners own any shares of [ eight banks claimed by Eustace Mullins to control the New York Federal Reserve ] , then their portions are not greater than 5 percent at this time .
With no significant holdings of the major New York area banks , it does not seem likely that foreign conspirators could direct their actions .
�. . .
The law stipulates a small portion of Federal Reserve stock may be available for sale to the public .
. . .
However , under the terms of the Federal Reserve Act , public stock was only to be sold in the event the sale of stock to member banks did not raise the minimum of $ 4 million of initial capital for each Federal Reserve Bank when they were organized in 1913 ( 12 USCA Sec. 281 ) .
Each Bank was able to raise the necessary amount through member stock sales , and no public stock was ever sold to the non -bank public .
In other words , no Federal Reserve stock has ever been sold to foreigners ; it has only been sold to banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System .
�. . .
[ E ] ach commercial bank receives one vote regardless of its size , unlike most corporate voting structures in which the number of votes is tied to the number of shares a person holds .�
The New York Federal Reserve district contains over 1,000 member banks , so it is highly unlikely that even the largest and most powerful banks would be able to coerce so many smaller ones to vote in a particular manner .
To control the vote of a majority of member banks would mean acquiring a controlling interest in about 500 member banks of the New York district . �

Cheetah Girls Breakup Announced
The time has come for the Cheetah Girls to move on and that means that after their " One World " tour comes to an end on December 22nd , so do they .
Kiely Williams on of the Disney girl band singers told In Touch magazine :
" We always knew this tour would probably be our last .
We were excited about going out on a high note , it 's sad that this negative attention has put a damper on that . "
Although Williams insists that this has nothing to do with her band mateand her recent nude photos , we 're not buying it .
In the end , Bailon 's " leaked " photos turned out to be a publicity stunt gone wrong .
The photo fiasco led to the Cheetah 's being dropped from the Macy 's Thanksgiving Parade line up .
Macy 's public stance was that it was a " scheduling issue , " but word on the street is that parade sponsors wanted to distance themselves .

While the Pentagon ’s budget has risen to heights not seen since World War II , US diplomatic and foreign aid assets have largely atrophied and must be quickly rebuilt by any new administration that takes office in January , according to a new report released here this week by former senior foreign service officers .
The report by the American Academy of Diplomacy ( AAD ) and the Henry L. Stimson Center is calling for a nearly 50 percent increase in the number of diplomats and aid and development specialists recruited into the foreign service over the next five years .
This would cost about three billion dollars  or approximately what the Pentagon is currently spending every 10 days on military operations in Iraq  over current budget estimates .
” Since the fall of the Berlin Wall , the diplomatic capacity of the United States has been hollowed out , " according to the 26 - page report , " A Foreign Affairs Budget for the Future . "
" The status quo cannot continue without serious damage to our vital interests . "
The vacuum created by the lack of diplomatic resources  particularly in comparison to the Pentagon ’s budget and manpower  has translated into the militarization of US foreign policy , warns the report .
” Today , significant portions of the nation ’s foreign affairs business simply are not accomplished , ” it says .
" The work migrates by default to the military that does have the necessary people and funding but neither sufficient experience nor knowledge .
The militarization of diplomacy exists and is accelerating . "
To that end , the report calls for the State Department to take over control from the Defense Department ( DOD ) of nearly 800 million dollars a year budgeted for several security assistance programs , including humanitarian aid , created in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to help friendly militaries prosecute the " global war on terrorism . "
" Our view is that the Secretary of State has and should have responsibility for assuring that all foreign and security assistance is carried out in accord with US foreign policy , including setting overall policy , approving countries to receive assistance , and setting the budget for such assistance , " the report said .
" DOD ’s expanded policy responsibility for security assistance programs risks the additional atrophy of the civilian agencies ’ ability to plan and conduct foreign policy and foreign assistance and raises serious concerns that such programs could conflict with broader US strategic and foreign policy interests . "
" Moreover , these expanded missions are not the core competence of the military and thus may detract from the readiness to perform more central military missions , " it added .
" Finally , it is important for the US to ensure that its nonmilitary international presence and engagement be carried out primarily by civilians , not by the military . "
Indeed , the latest report echoes the views  albeit in more diplomatic language  of a growing number of non-governmental organizations and foreign policy experts that the Pentagon , simply by virtue of its enormous budget and its worldwide presence with nearly 800 overseas bases , has become far too dominant in policy making .
Even Pentagon chief Robert Gates a former senior intelligence officer , has complained about the imbalance between US military and diplomatic resources .
" Funding for nonmilitary foreign affairs programs … remains disproportionately small relative to what we spend on the military , " he declared in a much - discussed speech last November .
" What is clear for me is that there is a need for a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national security . "
" Our diplomatic leaders  be they in ambassadors ’ suites or on the State Department ’s seventh [ top ] floor  must have the resources and political support needed to fully exercise their statutory responsibilities in leading American foreign policy , " he said in July .
He has also noted ruefully that there are more people serving in military bands than in the entire State Department .
Despite his support , however , Gates ’ views have not yet substantially altered the political equation in Congress , which has routinely approved or even increased the Bush administration ’s budgetary requests for the Pentagon over the last eight years while casting a far more skeptical eye on requests for the State Department , which lacks a comparably broad - based geographic , commercial , or demographic constituency .
The Defense Department is slated to receive well over 527 billion dollars for 2009  not including some 15 billion dollars a month for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  or roughly 13 times more than the State Department ’s budget of less than 40 billion dollars .
Moreover , despite his concerns , Gates has asked  so far without success  that substantially more money be allocated to the new discretionary accounts that the Pentagon currently may disburse for allies in the war on terror , a request which , to the dismay of most foreign service officers , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice supported in hearings before Congress earlier this year .
Last week , the Pentagon submitted a new estimate for defense spending that is 450 billion dollars more over the next five years than it had previously announced , according to Congressional Quarterly , beginning with a nearly 10 - percent increase in its 2010 budget to nearly 600 billion dollars .
Compared to that request , the recommendation by the AAD - Stimson report to increase the State Department ’s planned budget by roughly 3.3 billion dollars over the next five years seems paltry , indeed .
According to the report , which was put together by a task force of 14 former senior foreign service officers with the help of an advisory group chaired by former U.N. Amb .
Thomas Pickering , the State Department currently suffers serious shortages in personnel in virtually all of its operations , from consular activity to development assistance and public diplomacy .
The report noted the decline in the foreign service and State Department spending began at the end of the Cold War when the international affairs budget was reduced by roughly 30 percent in real terms .
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell succeeded in creating more than 1,000 new State Department posts between 2001 and 2004 , according to the report , but these increases were quickly absorbed by diplomatic surges in Iraq and Afghanistan , leaving other key areas and global issues with significant staff shortfalls .
It called for total State Department staffing to increase from roughly 10,000 today to nearly 15,000 by 2014 .

Cable companies face probe of overcharging claims
Federal regulators are investigating claims by a consumer group that cable companies are exploiting broadcast television ’s digital transition to overcharge subscribers .
The probe announced by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin follows a complaint from Consumers Union .
The publisher of Consumer Reports magazine said last week that Comcast Corp. and other cable companies are moving some channels to a digital service , forcing consumers to pay more .
“ Many consumers may have been misled that they ’re having to make the switch over to digital as a result of the digital broadcast television transition , but that ’s not something that ’s true , ” Martin told reporters today in Washington at the agency ’s monthly meeting .
The agency is “ asking cable operators to tell us what they were informing their customers about any changes they were making , ” Martin said .
“ Were they still charging them the same rate as they were charging them before , even though they removed channels from their package ? ” Martin said .
Consumers who previously did n’t need a set - top box must rent one at a monthly cost of $ 4 to $ 10 per TV to keep receiving channels that are moved to digital , Joel Kelsey , a Consumers Union analyst based in Washington , said in an interview last week ..
Packages of digital channels generally offer more programming at a higher monthly cost than basic channel packages that rely on traditional analog signals .
Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice in an e-mailed statement last week said that with digital lineups , “ consumers will benefit because we will give them equipment for no additional charge ” and more program choice .

“ Kaupthing was the last , best hope of the Icelandic banking system , and it was killed there and then , ” Andres Magnusson , an editorial writer for Icelandic Financial News , said in an interview .
“ This really was the last straw .
A lot of Icelanders are asking , ‘ Excuse me : who ’s the terrorist here ? ’ ”
The bank ’s collapse had repercussions beyond Iceland and Britain .
More than 8,000 depositors , individuals and businesses , hold Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander accounts worth about $ 1.34 billion on the Isle of Man , money they cannot get their hands on now  and may never .
Iceland is in line to receive a $ 2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund and is talking to other Scandinavian countries .
It is not entirely friendless : it was recently offered a loan of about $ 52 million from the tiny Faroe Islands , for which it is very grateful , Mr. Gunnlaugsson said .
The Icelandic government has pledged to make good on domestic bank accounts .
But it is still fighting with Britain over how much it is obliged to pay  and how much it can afford to pay  to compensate customers with accounts in Icesave , Landsbanki ’s British branch .
Under European regulations , Iceland is obliged to pay 20,000 euros ( about $ 25,000 ) to each individual account holder in Icesave .
But the total , Ms. Gisladottir , the foreign minister , said , would amount to about 600 billion Icelandic kronur  only about $ 5 billion at today ’s collapsed exchange rate but fully 60 percent of Iceland ’s gross domestic product .
“ The compensation that we would give would be twice as much per head as the reparations Germany faced in the Treaty of Versailles after the First World War , ” she said .
“ That is something we cannot afford . ”
The British government has guaranteed that individual British account holders will be compensated fully , which is why it is seeking to wrest as much money as possible from Iceland .
But no such guarantees have been made to the British companies , local governments , charities and universities  including Oxford and Cambridge  that had Icesave accounts .
That figure alone is well over a billion dollars .
The two men “ planned to drive their vehicle as fast as they could toward Obama shooting at him from the windows , ” according to an affidavit filed in federal court in Jackson , Tenn. , by an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
Mr. Obama has no plans to be in Tennessee , and the affidavit does not make clear whether the men had picked a place for an attack .
Image Daniel Cowart of Bells , Tenn. , was one of two men charged in what officials called a white supremacist assassination plot .
Credit ... Associated Press
The assassination was to be the culmination of a “ killing spree ” that would also single out children at an unnamed , predominately black school , federal officials said .
The men talked of “ killing 88 people and beheading 14 African - Americans , ” according to the affidavit .
The two men each had “ very strong views ” about Aryan white power and “ skinhead ” ideology , the federal officials said , and the numbers 88 and 14 have special significance in the white power movement .
The number 88 is shorthand for “ Heil , Hitler ”  H is the eighth letter in the alphabet and 14 signifies a 14 - word mantra among white supremacists :
“ We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children . ”
Officials said the two men met via the Internet through a mutual friend .
Concerns about possible plots against Mr. Obama have been acute because of his status as the first black presidential nominee from a major party .
He has had Secret Service protection since May 2007 , the earliest a candidate was ever assigned protection .
Mr. Cowart and Mr. Schlesselman were each charged with illegal possession of a sawed - off shotgun , conspiracy to rob a firearms dealer and making threats against a presidential candidate .
A detention hearing is scheduled for Thursday in Memphis .

0936 Bachi Karkaria , of the Times of India , tells the BBC that Mumbai has been " terribly shaken " by the attacks .
" No - one is safe and nothing can be taken for granted , " she says .
0930 Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd expresses concern about the attacks in Mumbai .
He says : " We are deeply concerned by these developments , deeply concerned by the potential impact on Indian citizens and other citizens , and we will have further to say about this during the course of the day . "
0924 Security expert Rahul Roy Chaudhury , from the International Institute for Strategic Studies , tells the BBC that it could be some time before the Taj Mahal Palace hotel is given the all - clear .
He says : " The security services will have to go from room - to - room to make sure the hotel is entirely free of terrorists , " adding the gunmen could try to slip out among Indian nationals who had been taken hostage .
0920 The BBC's Mark Dummet , speaking outside the main entrance of the Taj Mahal Palace hotel , says : I have seen armed soldiers leading out a dozen or so of the guests , one of the men being carried by a soldier to a series of ambulances which are lined up here .
It would seem as if the siege here at the Taj Hotel is over .
Eyewitness reaction and local TV footage from the scene 0915 Indian security forces have surrounded two of the top hotels in Mumbai , the Oberoi Trident and the Taj Mahal Palace , which were taken over by gunmen who launched co-ordinated attacks in the city late on Wednesday that have so far left 101 people dead and 287 injured .
Hostages are reported to have been taken in both hotels , and commandos have been brought in to try to regain control of the buildings .
Officials say another eight locations were attacked , but these have now been secured .
Four attackers have been killed and nine arrested , they add .
A little - known group calling itself the Deccan Mujahedeen has said it carried out the attacks .
The claim was made in a series of e-mails sent to news organisations .
Mumbai city officials have recommended residents stay indoors and the country 's leading stock exchange has been closed for the day .

Checklist for good programming
Identifiers :
Make sure all your identifiers are meaningful .
One - letter identifiers are almost never meaningful .
Names like flag and temp are seldom meaningful .
Instead of flag , consider naming the Boolean condition it checks for , such as valueFound .
Consider multi-word identifiers , like nameIndex .
Long identifiers ( within reason ) tend to be very readable .
Bare literals : Avoid numbers other than 0 and 1 and strings other than " " in your program except when you define constants .
Do n't use a literal integer as an array bound .
Do n't use a literal integer as a run parameter , such as a timeout or port number .
Do n't use literal integers to select menu entries .
Do n't use a literal integer to measure the size of a string or some data ; use sizeof ( ) and strlen ( ) in C and C++ and .length ( ) and .size in Java .
Do n't use a literal string for a file name .
You may output literal strings , though .
Do n't use a literal integer to index into an array containing heterogeneous data .
Do n't declare an identifier with a name denoting a literal , such as " thirty " .
Modularization : A program is built out of interacting components .
Do n't put all your code into the main ( ) routine .
In fact , do n't make any routine do too much work .
If it 's longer than about 50 lines , it is maybe too long .
If you duplicate code several times , consider whether a loop would work better , or perhaps a subroutine .
If you find you are indenting very deeply , you most likely are n't using subroutines when you should .
Do n't reinvent library routines ( unless your assignment requires it ) .
Look in the manuals to learn about sprintf ( ) and atoi( ) , for instance .
Use header files in C and C++ ( header files have names ending .h ) to define all constants needed by multiple files and declare all subroutines exported between files .
But do n't put the body of subroutines in header files ( with the rare exception of inline subroutines ) .
Formatting : Your program should be easy to read .
Look at http://geosoft.no/development/javastyle.html for clear suggestions on formatting and other presentation issues .
This reference is specifically directed at Java , but it has value for other languages , too .
Try to restrict all your lines to 80 characters ; many people view code in 80 - column windows for historical reasons .
Do n't use both tabs and spaces for indentation , because not all text editors treat tabs as exactly 8 spaces .
Do follow a consistent indentation pattern that reflects the program 's control structure .
Do n't put lots of blank lines in your program .
One blank line between subroutines is enough .
Different operating systems terminate lines different ways .
If you move between Win32 ( which uses \r
) , Unix ( which uses
) , and MacOS ( which uses \r ) , reformat your file to use a consistent termination method .
Do n't set the executable bit ( Unix ) on your source files .
Coding :
You want your coding to be clear , maintainable , and efficient , in that order .
Some of the rules here are very specific ; others are more general .
Do n't use a sequence of if statements that have no else if only one can match ; use else if .
When you want to categorize text input , do n't enumerate the possible first characters .
Use shift operators instead of multiplication for constructing bit patterns .
In a switch statement , always check for the default case .
Likewise , in a sequence of if - then - else statements , use a final else .
All system calls can fail .
Always check the return code , and use perror ( ) to report the failure .
Booleans should always use the boolean type in Java , bool in C++ , and 0/1 integers in C .
Do n't use characters t and f , and do n't use - 1 and 1 .
Use loops to initialize data structures if possible .
Use each variable and each field of a structure for exactly one purpose .
Do n't overload them unless there is an excellent reason to do so .
Do n't use the same identifier for both a type , a variable , and a file name , even if you change the capitalization .
It 's too confusing .
If you are modifying data with htonl ( ) or a similar routine before network transmission , do n't modify the data in place .
Build a second data structure .
Try not to use global or nonlocal variables .
Declare each variable in the smallest scope you can .
There are legitimate uses of nonlocal variables , but make sure you really need them .
Shell , Perl , and Python programs should have their #!
line as the first line of the file ; otherwise , the line is just a comment .
Try to avoid coding special cases .
You can often use pseudo - data or other data - structure methods that allow you to fold special cases into the regular cases .
Compilers :
Let them help you find mistakes .
Always invoke compilers with all warnings enabled .
For C and C++ , use the - Wall flag .
For Java , use - Xlint : all - deprecation , and use the pmd program to get suggestions for better style .
For Python , use -t - W all .
For Perl , use the -w flag and specify use strict .
Cgi-bin scripts should have the - T flag , too .
The make utility : Use it , and use it well .
A Makefile should always have a " clean " recipe , which should remove all files that can be reconstructed by other recipes in the Makefile , including object and executable files .
If your project has multiple source files , the Makefile should generate object ( .o ) files as needed and link them together .
The Makefile should be written so that if you run make twice in a row , the second run does no recompilation .
Every recipe should create the file specified in its target .
Every recipe should use every file specified in its prerequisite list .
Learn to use rules for targets like .c.o to avoid repetitious makefiles .
If you have just one C or C++ source file , the executable file should have the same name ( without the extension .c or .cpp ) .
Make sure you list all .h files as prerequisites where they are needed .
Consider using makedepend to generate the prerequisite list for you .
utility : Use it , and use it well .
Documentation :
It 's not just just for the grader .
It helps you as you write the program , too !
Add documentation as you write the program .
You can always modify it as your design changes .
Write external documentation :
How does one compile and run the program , and what is it meant to do ?
The external documentation is usually in a separate README file ; for small projects , it can be a comment in the single source file .
Include internal documentation :
What algorithms and data structures are you using ?
An overview can be in a separate README file , but usually internal documentation is placed on the specific routines , declarations , and steps that it describes .
Check your whole program and documentation for spelling mistakes .
It is impolite to turn in misspelled work , and it bespeaks inattention to detail .
Check all your documentation ( and output messages ) for grammar mistakes .
Programs are much more readable if you put a short comment on closing braces .
For instance , the brace closing a conditional can have a comment like " if value looks good " .
A brace closing a loop can have a comment like " for each input line " .
A brace closing a procedure can have a comment just naming the procedure .
A brace closing a class can have a comment saying " class " and then the name of the class .
For some reason , this page is popular with translators .
An anonymous Mudflatter in Juneau was taking an evening walk past the Governor ’s mansion , found the following political sign in the yard , and sent it to Mudflats for all to enjoy !
Presumably , the Governor herself is not an Obama supporter …. however , it looks like quite a few of her neighbors are .
The following images were passed on by a different Junea Mudflatter .
I ’ve circled the Obama signs , and pointed with a red arrow at the Governor ’s mansion .
Looks like Juneau is ready for change !
Saturday , all these Obama supporters in Alaska ’s capitol will have an opportunity to make their voices heard !
And in a “ sensitive climate ” where state workers are plentiful , participants are encouraged to wear their best Halloween disguises !

So , I finally let the cat out of the bag a few minutes ago and announced Twitter Karma publically .
So , what is it ?
The other day , @ StephAgresta said , “ Twitter desperately needs page navigation on followers / following list .
Also sort functionality by type ( reciprocated or not ) is a must . ”
I suggested a simple mashup that implements this and started hacking on it .
Three days later , it has enough functionality that Stephanie said she thinks I should release it publically .
Basically , it ’s a Flash application that fetches your friends and followers from Twitter when you click the “ Whack ! ” button , then displays them for you , letting you quickly paginate through them .
By default , the list contains all your friends and followers and is sorted by last update , showing those who most recently updated first .
You can sort the list alphabetically either ascending or descending by Twitter ID .
You can filter the list in several ways : only friends or only followers , all friends or all followers , and mutual friends .
It ’s not meant to be a full Twitter client–there ’s plenty of those already and that ’s not a particularly interesting or challenging problem to solve , anyway .
I ’ll be adding a few more features to Twitter Karma soon , though .
If you think you have a must - have feature idea , go ahead and let me know about it in the comments .

When Russell T. Davies asked Prince Charles to guest star in Doctor Who , the prince 's office refused out of hand — such sci - fi tomfoolery is beneath him .
Davies was less than pleased ; he called out the Prince of Wales at a recent literary festival , referring to him as a " miserable swine " for snubbing the offer .
Apparently , though , Charles still has some respect for the starry - eyed producer and writer , as this week he awarded Davies the Order of the British Empire for his services to drama .
And what happened when the two men finally met face - to - face in Buckingham Palace ?
You 'll have to watch the video .

It seems Prince Charles did n't realize a jilted proposal from Doctor Who would create such a stir .
Clearly , he does n't know any British children :
The Prince of Wales turned down an offer to star in Doctor Who , executive producer Russell T Davies has claimed .
Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival , the BBC show 's writer called the prince " a miserable swine " for not accepting the invitation .
According to Clarence House , however , the prince did not see the offer as it was turned down on his behalf .
" We receive a great many requests and it's impossible to accept them all , " a spokesman told the BBC .

The Prince of Wales must be pretty damn important if he can ignore a Time Lord .
The Doctor , though , is nothing if not friendly , so Rusty was happy to patch up their conflict in the service of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire .
BBC
News presents video footage of the investiture ceremony , and everybody 's favorite bespectacled Welshman is as earnest and adorable as ever .
You do n't have to call him " Sir Davies " now — his OBE makes him an Officer of the British Empire , not technically a knight — but you can still cheer at the success of the cheeky , wildheaded giant who gave us aliens made out of fat , a tentacle - headed Dalek - human hybrid , and a glowing Doctor who flies with robotic angels .

How to Get a Great Start to Your Day : 7 Simple Tips
“ When you arise in the morning , think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive – to breathe , to think , to enjoy , to love . ”
Marcus Aurelius
“ Every morning we are born again .
What we do today is what matters most . ”
Buddha
It ’s still dark as your alarm bell goes off .
You pull up the curtains and the world is waiting for you outside of the window .
As you stumble out of bed and into the shower a new day begins .
So how can you make it more likely that it will be a good or even great day ?
Well , in my experience , what you do early in the morning often sets the tone for the rest of the day .
So let me share 7 simple tips that have helped me to create both better mornings and days .
1 . Plan the night before .
Put down just 1 - 3 of the most important things you want to get done on a to - do list .
By keeping the list very limited it becomes easier to actually get the most important thing ( s ) done .
And to not start procrastinating by doing a few of the less important and often easier tasks that I know I always used to add to a longer to - do list .
2. Prepare the night before .
Reduce the stress during your morning by getting the simple details out of the way the night before .
So :
Pack your bag .
Prepare and pack your lunch .
Put your keys , wallet etc. in their “ home ” if they are not already there so you can quickly find and grab them before heading out the door .
3 . Keep a simple reminder on your bedside table .
What you see during your first minutes after you have woken up can in my experience have quite the effect on the morning and as an extension of that the whole day .
So try putting a small note with a reminder on your bedside table .
Three things you could put on that note are :
One of your favorite quotes .
A powerful and timeless quote is one of the easiest ways to charge the mind with positive emotions and to find a helpful perspective .
So write down one of the own favorite quotes .
Here ’s a list of 101 of them about happiness if you want some help .
Set a low bar for happiness .
I love this simple reminder .
I tell myself : “ Today I will set a low bar for happiness ” .
And then I keep that thought in mind for the rest of the day as best I can .
It helps me to feel grateful for the little and everyday things that I too often take for granted like having a roof over my head and all the tasty food I have available .
It makes it easier to stay positive and to find a simple happiness throughout the day .
Write down your most important whys .
Here 's a quick exercise that I use to recharge my motivation again .
It involves finding your deepest and most personal reasons for why you want to make a positive change in your life .
Keeping these most important reasons written down on your bed side table can give you a powerful start to your day and make it easier to stay on the right track from the moment you get out of bed .
4 . Go slow .
When I start my day slowly and keep doing things at a slow pace then it becomes easier to keep the stress away .
It becomes easier to focus on what I am doing and keep my priorities in mind .
When I go slow I stay in the present moment more of the time and so less negative feelings come my way .
And I appreciate the everyday things in life more because my attention is focused outward and not aimlessly inward towards what happened in the past or may happen in the future .
When I start my day slowly I sometimes get worried that this slow pace will mean that I get less done during my day .
But at the end of the day I most often discover that I got more done .
Because I did things well the first time and because when I go slow I tend to spend less energy on draining feelings and on having my attention bouncing around between many things .
And so I have more energy during the last few hours of my workday to spend on things that matter to me .
5 . Get some positive information into your mind over breakfast .
Start your day with something that does not depress you or makes you feel powerless to change your life or the world in some small or bigger way .
Add inspiration and optimism by for example :
Reading one or a couple of new posts from positive , funny or uplifting blogs or websites .
Listening to a podcast that boosts your motivation .
Reading a chapter from a book that inspires you .
Watching a motivating or uplifting video on Youtube .
6 . Start your workday with the most important task .
Find the most important task on the very limited to - do list you created .
Do it first thing when your workday starts .
This task is in my experience often quite hard so it is easy to fall for the temptation to procrastinate .
If you feel that urge , then just be still and do nothing .
The most powerful part of the impulse to procrastinate by checking email or Facebook passes pretty quickly .
When the worst is over then go easy on yourself instead of trying to push yourself hard .
Tell yourself that you will only work for 1 - 3 minutes on this important task .
Then you can stop if you like .
But you may not want to do that once you have gotten started .
This seems to be the case for me most of the time .
Because getting started is most often the hardest part .
7. Build a right thing string .
Doing what you deep down think is the right thing will make you feel good .
It will boost your self - esteem and put a spring in your step for an hour or more .
One way that I like to do that is by creating what I like to call a right thing string .
Here 's what you do :
Do something that you deep down think is the right thing .
Do it right now .
Give a genuine compliment to someone at work or in your life .
Help someone who seems lost with directions .
Unclutter your workspace for 2 minutes .
Go and work out .
Then add another thing that you think is the right thing to do .
Have an apple instead of an unhealthy snack .
When you feel like judging someone in your life or on TV or in the newspaper try to find a kinder and more understanding perspective .
Smile and ask how someone 's day is going ( and really listen to the reply ) .
Then add another thing .
And another .
Build a small string of doing the right things during for example 10 - 30 minutes to boost your energy and the positive feelings you have about yourself and your life .
Continue the string during your day as best you can .
After you have added a right thing to your string – no matter how small it is – make sure to take a few seconds to pause and to appreciate the good thing you did .
I usually think one of these things to myself :
Awesome !
Well done !
That was a good thing to do .
That was fun !
( and then I smile to myself ) .
This boosts the positive mood within and ups the motivation to add another thing to your string .
If you break the string , no worries .
Do n't beat yourself up .
Take a deep breath and then start a new string instead .

McClatchy Newspapers
September 19 , 2008
Despite a massive government effort to shore up the nation ’s financial system , Americans are deeply pessimistic about whether it will work anytime soon , according to a new Ipsos / McClatchy poll .
An overwhelming majority thinks the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers and the sudden sale of brokerage firm Merrill Lynch will have a negative effect on jobs and the economy .
In this first close examination of popular sentiment on the question , Americans appear skeptical at best about the prospects that the government can fix the mess .
A solid majority said they ’re not confident that the government can restore confidence following the mortgage crisis .
And only a sliver thinks the economy will be better six months from now .
A plurality thinks it will be worse .
The findings come as the country works to come to grips with the financial turmoil of recent weeks .
Rooted in the housing - finance crisis , it ’s led to rapid - fire government bailouts of several major financial institutions , the bankruptcy of another , Lehman Brothers , and the shotgun marriage of Merrill Lynch — a venerable firm known to millions on Main Streets coast to coast — to Bank of America .

Honda Motor Co. , the world 's leading motorcycle manufacturer , is developing a gas- electric motorcycle that would use a hybrid drivetrain much like the one in the forthcoming Honda Insight , and it could be in showrooms within two years .
Startups like Zero Motorycles and Brammo already offer electric motorcycles , but the major manufacturers have been slow to join the party because they 've considered the engineering challenges too great for mass - market bikes .
But according to Japan 's Mainichi Times , Honda says it 's figured out how to make the drivetrains work without breaking the bank .
Not only does the company think it can make an electric engine small enough to fit in the narrow confines of a motorcycle frame , but it plans to offer full electric bikes as early as 2011 .
The Times did n't offer a lot of detail but says Honda will offer the hybrids in displacements ranging from 50 cc to 1,000 cc , and the gas - electric drivetrain will offer a 50 percent improvement in fuel economy .
Sharing components with Honda 's hybrid cars will cut down on production costs .
The idea is n't as crazy as it might sound .
Both Honda and Yamaha are working on electric motorcycles .
Honda plans to use lithium - ion batteries that will provide a range of about 60 miles .
Although that 's not nearly enough for a day of touring or canyon carving , it 's more than enough for commuting around town .
Yanking the gasoline engine out of something like the Cub – the best - selling vehicle ever – and replacing it with an electric motor seems like a no - brainer .
Yamaha plans to have its e-bikes on the market by 2010 .
It 'll be interesting to see what direction Honda takes with hybrid motorcycles .
Will it go for maximum efficiency like the Insight , or will it use the torque provided by an electric motor to boost acceleration like Mercedes - Benz and BMW are doing with the S 400 BlueHybrid and 7 - Series Active Hybrid luxo - barges ?
And will we see a gas-electric version of the venerable Interceptor ( pictured ) ?

After being asked a question about keeping Obama supporters from also voting for Democrats down the ticket at a press conference in D.C. , Rep .
Tom Davis ( R - VA ) , a former chair of the National Republican Congressional Commitee ( NRCC ) said : " Well you 're talking about voter suppression and we would never , ever do anything along that line , for the record . "
The room broke into laughter during his comment !
( video 1:14 mins ) ...
Ari at the Oxdown Gazette covered it also and notes that nearly one - quarter of John McCain 's laughably and insultingly named " Honest and Open Election Committee , " " chaired by Warren Rudman and John Danforth , has been involved in GOP voter suppression efforts or unfounded partisan claims of voter fraud .
Of the 21 members of the committee , five have been engaging in these shady efforts . "
See his report for the details on those liars , hooligans , and anti-democracy champions .
Transcript of the above video follows below ...
MS . SMITH : In districts like the one I cover , which is held by a Republican , I would think that a strategy of the NRCC would be to try to keep those new voters who might be voting for Obama from in fact continuing on down the ballot .
Does the NRCC or the Republican Party have any strategy for trying to ensure that that happens ?
REP .
DAVIS : Well you 're talking about voter suppression and we would never , ever --- ( laughter ) --- do anything along that line for the record .
I think it 's fair to say , yeah , I think it 's fair to say we 're not going to spend any money educating them on what they need to do but that 's what you do in these kind of elections .
By the way , you 'll also see in some of these areas , particularly in some of the rural areas , you 're going to see a huge vote come out in presidential years in North Carolina and states like that , this is tradition that would be voting Republican across the board .
I 'm just saying in terms of vulnerability of our congressional candidates , you 've got to look at these high African American voter urban style districts and recognize that it's not business as usual as a candidate , that you 're going to deal with an electorate that is significantly different from what you see in off years .
And I just think that 's the fact .

CA – Pasadena Star - News :
This election will chart the course not just for the next four years but for many more as the incoming president and Congress grapple with two wars and an economic crisis while carrying an onerous national debt and skyrocketing budget deficit on their backs .
To best meet these challenges , we respectfully endorse Barack Obama for the presidency .
CA - LA Daily News : But [ Obama ’s ] offered detailed , sensible plans on pressing domestic issues and thoughtfully addressed the economic situation .
He has a clear health - care plan , similar to what California has been trying to create over the past two years .
He has a tax plan that gives back to the people who are generally asked to share the biggest burden , and a small tax increase on those who have benefited – and will continue to do so – from the policies of the current administration …
His is a message that we ’re a people who might be down , might be facing hard times , but we still have a bright future .
It ’s a message that makes us feel hopeful – not helpless – in the face of the climate crisis , that we can treat the elderly , the sick and the poor as a rich nation not only can , but should .
And that in the end we can and will leave the country a better place for our children and grandchildren .
That ’s a message America is dying to hear .
CO – Aspen Daily News : Barack Obama possesses both the style and the substance to guide this nation out of one of its darkest chapters .
As many have noted , the mere act of electing Obama will begin to undo the unjust reputation bestowed on the United States in recent years .
It would signal to the world that our country is ready for open - minded global debate , that it will act only after careful deliberation , and that the American dream is alive , well and moving into the White House .
CO – Boulder Daily Camera :
He is educated , diplomatic and respected abroad … Obama has remained , for the most part , above the fray .
In Sen . Joe Biden , he selected a solid running mate with more experience than himself , and someone who could help him navigate foreign policy .
Obama is not just the right choice against the McCain ticket , he is the right choice for president in our troubled times .
CT – New Haven Register : Obama has proven a disciplined campaigner and a brilliantly effective orator .
After eight years with a Republican in the White House , a fresh perspective is needed .
Barack Obama should be the next president of the United States .
IL – Daily Herald :
To respond to those challenges , the nation needs a confident change in direction .
We believe Sen. Barack Obama is best suited by temperament , judgment and vision to bring about that change , and we strongly endorse Illinois ’ favorite son for the presidency .
NM - Santa Fe Reporter :
The next president faces massive challenges at home and abroad .
We are living in uncertain times and are in need of fresh perspectives , steady leadership and , perhaps most of all , inspiration .
Barack Obama , whose life story reflects the best of America ’s promise , already has brought these factors to the campaign trail .
Now it ’s time for him to bring them to the White House .
OH – Middletown Journal / Hamilton Journal - News :
If anyone can help erase the Blue State / Red State division that makes any constructive political discourse in this country nearly impossible , it ’s Barack Obama .
Obama has demonstrated the maturity , needed pragmatism , genuine concern and calm understanding of the historic challenges that our nation faces .
That is why this newspaper endorses Barack Obama to be the next president of the United States .
OH – New Philadelphia The Times - Reporter : The Times - Reporter believes Democrat Barack Obama is the better candidate to lead the country out of these trying economic times and today gives its endorsement to him over opponent Republican John McCain …
We believe Barack Obama is the better of the two candidates and the one who can lead us through one of the most difficult economic times since the Great Depression .
OR – Yamhill Valley News - Register :
Only one candidate stands for change in this year ’s presidential race — Barack Obama .
Obama ’s intellect , temperament and ability to inspire are precisely what we need after a disastrous eight years under George W. Bush .
PA – The Daily Item : Throughout our nation ’s history , in trying times , America has been fortunate that voters have shown the wisdom to select leaders ready and able to guide our nation forward … Considering the scope of the challenges facing our nation , voters again must make a bold , but wise , choice for president .
That choice is Barack Obama .
TN – The Nashville Tennessean :
This newspaper believes Obama would be an inspiring choice at an extraordinary time for the nation .
The country needs a fresh , energetic face in the White House .
Every race for president is important , but the current confluence of events , including the war on terror , mountainous challenges in the economy and a growing strain upon the nation ’s health - care system make the current race a call for vigorous new approaches and enthusiasm .
Obama has managed to put a tone of optimism in his campaign at a time it would be very easy to be downhearted , worried and pessimistic .
That characteristic alone goes a long way in demonstrating the kind of leadership the nation needs .
WA – The Columbian : Any successful reformer must excel in leadership and judgment .
In the past several months , Obama has distanced himself as the superior candidate in those two areas , and today he receives The Columbian ’s endorsement for president …
But as we examined leadership qualities of both men , we saw Obama ’s massive strides in uniting his own Democratic party , even reaching beyond his party to speak to all Americans .
McCain , in stark contrast , continues to slog through a fractious Republican Party that often is his worst enemy .
It takes strong leadership skills to enlist record numbers of volunteers and to continually explore new heights in the polls , as Obama methodically demonstrates .
WI – Madison Capital Times : But , for the most part , Barack Obama “ gets it .
” Obama opposed authorizing President Bush to attack Iraq and he has been a wise skeptic with regard to the fantasy that a “ surge ” of U.S. troops into Iraq will turn that country into the “ mission accomplished ” paradise that Bush White House spin doctors keep trying to get Americans to accept .
And he promises to replace threats and violence with a diplomacy that seeks peace , cooperation and development … .
The best hope for an Obama presidency is that he will arrive in the White House with a mandate from the voters , and a clear governing majority in the Congress .
Where will the mandate come from ?
Let it begin here in the progressive heartlands — with an overwhelming vote for Barack Obama — and let it spread out across a country that has waited too long for a change , and a president , we can believe in .
WV - Huntington Herald - Dispatch : Others felt Obama has a better idea of how to finish the war .
He is more attentive to the needs of the middle class .
He has a stronger commitment to education , and he is more likely to bring a fresh approach to health care , the economy and energy policy .
It was a good debate , but in the end , there was more sentiment on the editorial board that Obama would bring the change that America needs .
At 5 am I found a bottle of vintage Cristal champagne .
' No , no ! ' cried the head waiter , ' Those are the wrong glasses '
If Briton Nick Hayward had finished his meal at the Taj Mahal hotel 30 seconds later , he would have been caught in the gunfire .
‘ I was very lucky , ’ he said .
‘ If I ’d left the restaurant for a nightcap at the bar half a minute after I did , I ’d have been in the lobby when the siege began and would have been shot .
‘ When I heard the shots , I looked through a window in the bar and saw a gunman firing a heavy - duty machine gun .
People were screaming .
But we had no idea that this had anything to do with terrorism .
We thought it was a bandit off the street . ’
' Can do ' attitude : Briton Nick Hayward , pictured with his wife Kammilla , the Brit was in the Taj Mahal hotel when the terrorists struck
Nick , 37 , Asia -Pacific managing director of Euromoney Conferences , added : ‘ We barricaded ourselves into a kitchen .
It had a heavy door and there were about 15 or 20 of us crammed into this very small space , so it was claustrophobic .
But for half an hour nobody was too concerned .
We thought it was cops and robbers stuff . ’
The group then decided to find a safer , more comfortable place to hole up .
‘ There was an adjacent restaurant called The Zodiac which we could get to without going through the lobby , ’ said Nick .
‘ There were some other people in there , so when we arrived there were about 40 .
‘ One was a very nice Guatemalan .
He did n’t speak English but his friend did and explained that this guy was ex-army .
He took a lead role .
‘ A few of us helped him try to keep people calm .
We barricaded the doors and , because there were grenades and bombs going off all the time and gunfire in the hotel , we made a thorough bomb search of the area . ’
Nick , who lives in Hong Kong with his wife Kammilla and their young daughters Anna and Pernille , said the group then heard on their mobiles that other places had been attacked .
Scene of terror :

‘ We realised this was highly organised , ’ said Nick .
‘ The mood dropped very quickly . ’
Nick and his younger brother Anthony , who is in the security industry , were in contact via their BlackBerrys .
‘ Anthony was giving me good intelligence , ’ he said .
‘ That allowed me to pass information on and explain that the army was outside and hopefully we ’d be rescued shortly . ’
For three hours they remained on high alert while yards away the executioners calmly went about their business .
‘ There were explosions , some so big the whole building shook , and sporadic gunfire , ’ said Nick .
Terror struck everyone at 4 am , when they believed they were about to be found and killed .
‘ Some of the terrorists made an effort to try to get into the restaurant , ’ said Nick .
‘ If they ’d really wanted to , they could have just blown the door up and that would have been that , they ’d have killed us .
That was truly frightening , a dark moment .
But for whatever reason , they did n’t .
They decided they had other things to do and left us alone .
‘ Then , about two hours later , we got a message that the army had retaken the lobby , so we opened the door , put our heads down and ran out of the hotel at full steam .

' Thank God that was it .
It was tunnel vision .
I knew there was carnage in the lobby but I did n’t want to know anything about it .
I just wanted to get out of there .
‘ I was extremely lucky .
I was with a very good bunch of people .
Three or four of us were Brits .
There were some Irish as well .
Most were Indian .
' We ’d never met each other but I have to say , it was a true British stiff upper - lip situation .
Together , the Brits helped to keep up morale .
‘ There was a can - do attitude .
We thought , ' Let ’s get the barricades done , let ’s do the practical things rather than sit there like sheep and wait to meet our fate . '
‘ There was a lot of crying from many of the other people and I suppose comforting them was a way of keeping ourselves occupied .
My boss Christopher Garnett and some old friends were sending me messages to keep my spirits up .
Soldiers stand in the lobby of the Taj Mahal on Thursday - Mr Hayward and the group he was with made their escape when they heard the army had re-taken the lobby
‘ At one stage Christopher sent me some stanzas from The Private Of The Buffs [ a ballad by Sir Francis Hastings Doyle describing the execution of a captured British infantryman for refusing to kowtow to the Chinese in 1860 ] . ’
Nick added :
‘ We all decided that even though we had alcohol within reach we would n’t touch it because it seemed like a bad idea to get drunk .
‘ But come 5 am , we were fairly confident the police were going to get us out , so I marched over to the bar and found a bottle of vintage Cristal champagne and opened it and began pouring it into glasses .
‘ Then the head waiter came rushing across to me and said , “ No , no , you ca n’t do that ! ” and I said , ' Well we ’re going to ' and he said , ' No sir , those are the wrong type of glasses .
I shall find you champagne flutes . '
' And he did .
The service was immaculate . ’

Right wing talk show host Rush Limbaugh wasted little time sticking the knife in Colin Powell ’s back after the general endorsed Barack Obama this morning .
Limbaugh claimed in an email that , “ Powell ’s move was very much related to Obama ’s status as the first African - American with a chance to become president . ”
“ Secretary Powell says his endorsement is not about race , OK , fine .
I am now researching his past endorsements to see if I can find all the inexperienced , very liberal , white candidates he has endorsed .
I ’ll let you know what I come up with .
I was also unaware of his dislike for John Roberts , Clarence Thomas , Samuel Alito , Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia .
I guess he also regrets Reagan and Bush making HIM a 4 - star and Secretary of State AND appointing his son to head the FCC .
Yes , let ’s hear it for transformational figures . ”
Gen .
Powell spent a half an hour on national television on Sunday morning intelligently making the case for why he is endorsing Obama .
He explained his problems with the direction that the Republican Party has taken the country in , and his doubts about the McCain / Palin ticket .
For Limbaugh to minimize , not only Powell ’s argument , but Powell himself , is deplorable .
Gen .
Powell is a man who is a true public servant .
He has never ran for , or been elected to public office .
Advertisements
Powell made it expressly clear that his endorsement was not based on race , so for Limbaugh to say that it was is a flat out lie .
Perhaps Rush is too high to understand this , but Powell endorsed Obama , because America does n’t need four more years of a broken foreign policy .
Maybe , he sees the military that he served for so long being stressed to the breaking point , and he thought , no more .
Maybe , just maybe , he believes that Obama would be a better president than McCain .
I think Limbaugh is out there all alone on this one .
I doubt that most Republicans would demean Powell ’s career in this way .
Limbaugh ’s comments are just the latest example of how low the conservative movement has sunk in a desperate attempt to maintain their fragile grip on power .
Limbaugh assumes that Powell owes the GOP , but he already gave them years of service , and his credibility when he spoke before the UN on the eve of the invasion of Iraq .
What else does he owe them ?
I wish I could say that no one cares what Limbaugh says , but he will have millions of listeners agreeing with him and this delusional rant on his show tomorrow .

Lisp Bulletin ( 1978 - 1979 )
List of Issues
The ( LISP BULLETIN ) was created by Daniel G. Bobrow and a first issue was published in ACM SIGPLAN Lisp Bulletin , Volume 4 Issue 9 , September 1969 .
Two more issues were published in July 1978 and December 1979 , edited by Patrick Greussay and Joachim Laubsch .
Remington Rand 's Univac computer was big and expensive .
But it built its reputation quickly as a predictor of presidential elections .
Photo : U.S. Army View Slideshow __1952 : __Television makes its first foray into predicting a presidential election based on computer analysis of early returns .
The Univac computer makes an incredibly accurate projection that the network does n't think credible .
The Univac , or Universal Automatic Computer , was the next - gen version of the pioneering Eniac built by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1940s .
Remington Rand bought the Eckert - Mauchly Computer Corp. in 1950 and sold the first Univac to the U.S. Census Bureau in 1951 .
The eight - ton , walk - in computer was the size of a one - car garage and accessed by hinged metal doors .
Univacs cost about $ 1 million apiece , the equivalent of more than $ 8 million in today 's money .
The computer had thousands of vacuum tubes , which processed a then - astounding 10,000 operations per second ( compared to 5 billion per second for today 's superfast chips ) .
Remington Rand ( now Unisys ) approached CBS News in the summer of 1952 with the idea of using Univac to project the election returns .
News chief Sig Mickelson and anchor Walter Cronkite were skeptical , but thought it might speed up the analysis somewhat and at least be entertaining to use an " electronic brain . "
Eckert and John Mauchly enlisted their former Penn colleague , mathematician Max Woodbury , to assist .
Mauchly and Woodbury gathered data and wrote a program that would compare the 1952 returns to previous elections and figure which way the wind was blowing .
The duo worked at Mauchly 's home because he'd been blacklisted as pro-Communist and was n't allowed to work at the company anymore .
The Univac in Philadelphia was connected to a teletype machine at the CBS studios in New York City .
As the first precincts reported on election night , technicians used Unityper machines to encode the data onto paper tape to feed into Univac .
Pre-election polls had predicted anything from a Democratic landslide to a tight race with the Demo candidate , Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson , slightly ahead of the Republican , five - star Gen . Dwight D. Eisenhower , Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe in World War II .
So it was a surprise at 8:30 p.m. Eastern time when Univac predicted Eisenhower would pile up 438 electoral votes to Stevenson 's 93 .
The odds of Eisenhower garnering at least 266 electoral votes — the minimum needed to win — were 100 - 1 .
In New York , news boss Mickelson scoffed at putting the improbable prediction on air .
In Philadelphia , Woodbury added new data to the mix .
At 9 p.m. correspondent Charles Collingwood announced to the audience that Univac was predicting 8 - 7 odds for an Eisenhower win .
But wait !
Back in Philly , Woodbury discovered that he'd mistakenly added a zero to Stevenson 's totals from New York state .
When he entered the correct data and ran it through Univac , he got the same prediction as before : Ike 438 , Adlai 93 , again with 100 - 1 chances of an Eisenhower victory .
As the evening wore on , an Eisenhower landslide gathered momentum .
The final vote was 442 to 89 .
Univac was less than 1 percent off .
Late at night , Collingwood made an embarrassing confession to millions of viewers : Univac had made an accurate prediction hours before , but CBS had n't aired it .
The public was now sold on this computer stuff .
By the 1956 presidential election , all three networks ( yes , there were just three ) were using computer analysis of the results .
It was here to stay .

Two Vice Presidential Candidates in modern history were poorly vetted .
We know that little effort went into checking out Sarah Palin , but what about when Senator Thomas Eagleton was the candidate for McGovern ?
Do you remember what OOPS moment caused him to be dropped from the ticket ?
It was when they found out that he had been treated for depression with Electroshock therapy .
Is it possible that Sarah is hiding some other deep dark medical secret ?
She is the only candidate I remember ever getting by with releasing absolutely NO RECORDS .
In her only interview with NBC she finally agreed to do so , but her handlers quickly scotched the deal .
What do n’t they want us to see ?
As a psychologist I cannot make even an armchair diagnosis of Ms. Palin , but let me just say it would not surprise me if some of her excesses on the stump reflected some kind of issue that she has yet to fully address .
If the rumors on the net ( that she has depression ) are true , that certainly would not even come close to disqualifying her , and that would provide an opportunity to put forth a discussion of mental health in our public discourse .
Could she have a Bipolar Disorder ?
One symptom we sometimes see in that diagnosis is wild excessive spending .
Should she be exempt from scutiny ?
More likely the secret medical problem , that is so worth hiding ( at least to her handlers ) is something more mundane like cosmetic surgery for her beauty pageant .
Several prominent female politicans have remodeled their public face .
But whatever the secret , it ’s not likely to be an empty file filled only with sonograms .
That could have been handled on a slow news night with a brief release and some baby pictures .
There would be no reason to not follow through on her promise .
Instead one is left to wonder if she might have some problems in common with Cindy McCain and Rush Limbaugh .
We need to find out what she brings to the table , if she wants to work for us .
What she does say is carefully worded .
She told Brian Williams of NBC that she was happy , healthy , had 5 kids and had “ never been seroiusly hurt . ”
Notice that she never denied any past problems or illnesses .
She does not talk about whether she is currently on any medications .
Let ’s get this out .
Sony has the burden of being the highest - priced console on retail shelves at the moment .
Both Microsoft and Nintendo are coming in under $ 300 , while the PS3 is $ 400 for a new system .
People are buying games and systems , but it 's clear that price is important :
Sony has to find a way to increase perceived value while not taking a bath on selling the systems at a loss .
Which means bundles !
Kotaku has a picture of what appears to be a new PlayStation 3 bundle , and it 's pretty nice .
For $ 399.99 you get :
An 80GB PS3 system
Ratchet and Clank : Tools of Destruction
Casino Royale on Blu-ray
This bundle is supposed to go on sale on November 28 , and it 's unclear whether other retailers will get these bundles or if this is a Best Buy exclusive .
If you 've been waiting for an excuse to finally pick up a PS3 , this is n't a bad one : the game is fun , the movie is a good showpiece for Blu-ray , and they 're both effectively free .
While a price drop would still be more preferable , we 'll take what we can get .
This is a nice surprise , and it comes just in time for Black Friday .
President Bush Will not Support House Republican ’s Alternative Bailout Bill
The house Republicans are busy crafting an alternative Wall Street bailout bill even as the senate looks to revive the one trillion dollar bailout .
A bill that would not require taxpayers to carry the burden of the Wall Street crowd , and the failures of “ equal opportunity ” lenders who were forced to give out loans to all too willing recipients who everyone knew could n’t afford them .
This bill would require higher premiums on risky mortgages in order to pay for insurance against the loans .
The higher the risk the higher the premium , the lower the risk the lower the premium .
At least this bill would n’t be a government takeover of the economic system balanced on the back of the taxpayers .
This bill is better than a taxpayer funded trillion dollar bailout .
And it keeps the economy more free market than the presidents proposal .
President Bush does not support the idea of the house Republicans free market friendly bailout proposal .
the White House rejected considering a more free market alternative proposed by House Republicans
He prefers the senates government takeover bailout bill .
He supports you and I paying for the irresponsible , whimsical behavior of Wall Street and “ equal opportunity ” lenders and borrowers .
“ I know the RSC wants only the insurance option and not the purchase option .
We disagree with that and believe that the purchase program needs to be part of the solution here , ” Fratto said .
President Bush will not be happy unless the bill that comes to his desk includes the government taking over the free market institutions that this country was based on .
If you agree with the president on this issue just remember who the other two prominent politicians are who also support the senate proposal and not the free market house bill ; John McCain and Barack Obama .
President Bush , John McCain , and Barack Obama all agree on this issue , that should be enough to scare the hell out of you .
The bill being negotiated by house Republicans may not be perfect , hell I think no action by the government would be perfect , it may not be the be all end all , but it is a hell of allot better that a one trillion dollar taxpayer funded bailout and something that I would much rather support .
My feeling is that as long as we are going to get screwed in this deal it should be as painless as possible .
I think the house Republican ’s proposal is much less painless .
Military jury convicts Osama bin Laden 's former driver
A jury of six military officers at Guantanamo Bay reached a split verdict Wednesday in the war crimes trial of a former driver for Osama bin Laden , clearing him of some charges but convicting him of others that could send him to prison for life .
The Pentagon - selected jury deliberated for about eight hours over three days before convicting Salim Hamdan of supporting terrorism .
He was cleared of the conspiracy charge .
Hamdan , who faces a maximum life sentence , held his head in his hands and wept at the defense table after a Navy captain presiding over the jury read the sentence in a hilltop courtroom on this U.S. Navy base .
The judge scheduled a sentencing hearing for later Wednesday .
Defense lawyers had feared a guilty verdict was inevitable , saying the tribunal system 's rules seemed designed to achieve convictions , said Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Brian Mizer , Salim Hamdan 's Pentagon - appointed attorney .
" I do n't know if the panel can render fair what has already happened , " Mizer told reporters as the jury deliberated .
Hamdan 's attorneys said the judge allowed evidence that would not have been admitted by any civilian or military U.S. court , and that interrogations at the center of the government 's case were tainted by coercive tactics , including sleep deprivation and solitary confinement .
Supporters of the tribunals said the Bush administration 's system provided extraordinary due process rights for defendants .
" This military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient trial for the accused and the government - regardless of the ultimate verdict , " said Charles " Cully " Stimson , a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs .
Hamdan was captured at a roadblock in southern Afghanistan in November 2001 and taken to Guantanamo in May 2002 .
The military accused him of transporting missiles for al - Qaida and helping bin Laden escape U.S. retribution following the Sept. 11 attacks by driving him around Afghanistan .
Defense attorneys said he was merely a low - level bin Laden employee .
Justice Minister Sotiris Hatzigakis yesterday stressed that a proposed cohabitation law , granting heterosexual couples living together the same rights as those who are married , would not be extended to gay couples .
« This ( bill ) is as far as we need to go to fulfill the demands and needs of Greek society - if new behavior develops in the future , we will examine the issue again , » Hatzigakis told Parliament .
The minister was reacting to appeals for the reforms to apply to gays too , submitted in Parliament by the Coalition of the Radical Left ( SYRIZA ) , the National Committee for Human Rights and another group representing lawyers from around the country .
« The law should serve social needs , not vice versa , » said criminologist Aliki Yiotopoulou - Marangopoulou , noting that other European countries have introduced cohabitation laws specifically for their gay communities as heterosexual couples already have the options of religious and civil marriage ceremonies .
« It is an issue we will have to tackle at some point anyway , due to the European Convention on Human Rights , » Sofia Spilio - topoulou of the National Committee for Human Rights remarked .
Meanwhile , all the opposition parties in Parliament expressed reservations about aspects of the broader family law bill submitted by Hatzigakis which not only foresees the introduction of the cohabitation law but also a swifter process for issuing divorces and simplification of the state adoption system .
PASOK Deputy Theodora Tzakri claimed that the proposed legislation was « unfair » overall to the financially less solvent half of the couple and needed fine - tuning .
Illinois Sen. Barack Obama picked up another superdelegate Saturday at the Arizona Democratic Party 's state convention as the neck - in - neck race for the Democratic nomination continues with New York Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Charlene Fernandez , chairwoman of the Yuma Democratic Party , was chosen the state party 's first vice chairwoman , a position that carries with it superdelegate status .
Fernandez defeated three other opponents and received claps and cheers when she declared in her stump speech that she pledged her vote to Obama .
Attorney General Terry Goddard also was chosen to a superdelegate position .
Goddard said he has not pledged support for either candidate yet .
He said he is at least a few weeks away from making a decision .
" I look forward to attending the convention as our party comes together to kick some butt in the fall , " he told an audience of more than 500 people at the downtown Wyndham Phoenix .
As superdelegates , Goddard and Fernandez get to attend the August Democratic National Convention in Denver and can vote for the presidential candidate of their choice .
Superdelegates , unlike pledged delegates , are not bound by a state 's popular vote .
The nation 's 794 super delegates make up about one - fifth of the total delegates , so they will determine the Democratic nomination if both candidates stay in the race .
Arizona has 11 super delegates with four supporting Clinton , three backing Obama and four uncommitted as of Saturday .
Obama currently leads in total delegates nationally with 1,724 pledged and super delegates to Clinton 's 1,593 , according to the Associated Press .
A candidate needs 2,025 delegates to win the nomination .

What is TONG ?
Sometimes , the total is greater than the sum of the parts .
Tetris and Pong are classics , addictive and unshakable from their places in gaming history .
TONG is the result of mixing the two , capitalizing on the essential qualities of each classic and adding new twists of its own to make an explosive chemical reaction out of it all .
Why ?
Why play Tetris and Pong in the same place at the same time ?
It is weird , that 's for sure .
Tetris and Pong work different parts of your brain , parts that like to have your full attention to themselves .
So right at first , TONG can seem a bit overwhelming .
As it turns out , though , for all the zillions of variations and clones we 've had of Pong and Tetris over the years , putting the two together actually makes the " twists " and " extras " make sense .
In Arkanoid , Break - out , Brick - out , etc , what are these blocks doing in the middle of a Pong game ?
In various Tetris clones , where do the new , non - four - block shapes come from and what 's with the explosives and other bonuses ?
Well , when Pong and Tetris are going on simultaneously and in the same space , all that stuff and many more clever ideas suddenly are n't little novelties , they 're sensible parts of a frantic game .

Politico's Ben Smith is eating a massive helping of crow from Obama supporters angry he and Matt Drudge posted the race - baiting attack falsely described by McCain supporter Ashley Todd in a most uncritical fashion .
His lame apologia is n't helping the situation , and Politico GOP blogger Jonathan Martin adds noxiously that it " seems like McCain just can't catch a break . "
What went wrong here ?
Texas student Ms. Todd faked a backwards ' B ' on her face and alleged a black Obama supporter had attacked her , as you no doubt know by now , causing Politico 's comments section to launch into a feeding frenzy over editor Ben Smith 's backpedaling .
The elephant in the room is Drudge , of course , and critics are equally peeved at him .
Since
Todd herself has already been discarded by the media , it 's time for Obama supporters and Ben Smith fans to express their anguish to the other folks who reported it as fact .
In his follow - up to the story , Smith never admits he should have been more skeptical of the story and his colleague is downright depressed the girl was n't telling the truth .
As Smith puts it :
Traditional reporters ( including me ) are basically going to follow the old rules of journalism :
Report that there 's been an allegation put onto the public record , report what the police have to say about it , but generally shy away from speculating about things we 're not sure about on a crime story .
There are no such rules online though , something that sometimes makes me wince , but which in this case meant that bloggers on both sides quickly expressed their skepticism , and helped moderate the impact of a story that was designed to explode .
Talk about shifting responsibility to a third person —
Smith acts like he never even reported on the story in the first place .
He has even responded vituperatively via e-mail to one particularly disappointed reader .
Wild : A man who robbed the Sterling National Bank on 7th Avenue near 38th Street in Manhattan was chased and tackled by the bank 's ATM repairmen .
The robber , Thomas Slater , had passed a note to a teller and stole $ 1,082 -- and some of the money went flying onto the street during the chase as Slater wove through cars to evade capture .
CityRoom reports , " Pedestrians walked up to the cops or bank employees and handed over money that they had picked up . "
Police spokesman Paul Browne said , " Even in the bad economy , all $ 1,082 that had been scattered before the police arrived was recovered in full . "
Slater was charged with bank robbery and is suspected in three other bank robberies .
And the NY Times ' director of mobile products Robert Z. Samuels saw Slater get tackled -- he took some video of the arrest .
Welcome to
Christian Nymphos !
New articles are on
MonogaBliss.com !
Check it out !
The mission of Christian Nymphos is to teach married women to walk in sexual freedom with their husbands , so they will be able to reach out and help free the women in their lives .
The Christian Nympho Name
We recognize that nymphomania is a legitimate illness for some women and we do n’t mean to minimize that in any way .
We started referring to ourselves as nymphos long before we started our blog .
We saw ourselves as incredibly passionate wives and found wonderful freedom in embracing our sexuality .
The definition of a nympho is “ a woman with abnormal sexual desires . ”
Sometimes we do feel abnormal , and while sometimes it is with people who are not Christians it can also be when we are in groups of Christian women .
Moms groups .
Ladies Bible studies .
A night out with our Christian girlfriends .
It is not uncommon to hear women speaking negatively about sex .
It is also not at all uncommon for us to hear people telling us that our sexual standards are rigid and uptight because we are so firm in our conviction that sex as God intended it is most intensely fulfilled within the marriage covenant .
While our name includes the term “ nympho , ” we also first and foremost refer to ourselves as Christians .
The core of our identity is that we belong to God and have a connection to Him because of our faith in the saving power of the work of Jesus Christ on the cross .
This allows us to submit all of our sexual desires to his authority so that our expressions of passion with our husbands are healthy and appropriate .
The word Nympho has a negative connotation for some .
It does n’t have to stay this way .
Why ca n’t we take something “ of the world ” and make it into something good ?
We are here to say to women everywhere :

If you ’ve never heard about electronic paper , crawl out from under that rock and read up on the Sony Reader and the Amazon Kindle .
E - paper is a flexible display made of color - changing beads that mimic ink - on - paper for easy daylight reading .
The revolutionary thing about e-paper is that after it ’s set , it stays that way without additional power .
This sounds great in theory , but Esquire ’s cover is the first time everybody can afford to hack an e-paper display .
We took the cover into the Hack a Day lab to document , test , and hack .
In the end , we recycled it into something useful that anyone can build .
We ’ve got all the details on how the display works and what it takes to use it in your own projects .
Read about our e-paper clock hack below .
Background
The Esquire e-paper cover hit big on the net , but was quickly panned .
NOTCOT has beautiful scans of the circuit board and e-paper .
Popular Science posted instructions for reading the code with a PICkit2 .
[ Slaxter ] verified that the PIC chip can be read , and that the code protection fuses are off .
[ Matt ] manipulated the e-paper cells directly with skillful soldering and an Arduino .
So far , there has n’t been a lot of interest in repurposing the e-paper , or reprogramming the existing microcontroller .
E - paper panels
The actual e-paper panels , manufactured by E - Ink , are n’t that exciting .
Each panel has a set of predefined segments , 11 on the front panel and 3 on the rear Ford advertisement .
This is n’t a matrix that we can reprogram into an e-reader .
[ just_mike ] has a great set of ultra close - up shots of the individual beads that make up each segment .
Each e-paper segment has an individual connection , and a connection that ’s shared with other cells on the panel .
The segments become white or black depending on the direction of current applied to the cell .
When common is low , any segment that is also connected high will darken .
When common is high , each cell connected to ground will clear .
The PCB uses 16 volts from five 3.3 volt batteries to switch the cells , but [ Slaxter ] showed that 5volts was sufficient with his Arduino project .
Performance testing
We made several observations about the e-paper operating specifications .
First , it takes nearly 0.5 seconds to completely darken or clear a cell .
In the video you can see the partial states created by switching the e-paper too fast .
We ’re not quite sure of the optimal change time , but between 0.25 and 0.5 seconds seems to be the minimum .
This also raised questions about the maximum change time .
Does it damage the e-paper to apply current for longer than necessary ?
Does the e-paper continue to consume current as long as it ’s applied , wasting the batteries ?
We took special care in our code to return all outputs to ground after a change to avoid a continuous current through the panel .
Clearing and darkening must be done separately .
It takes two complete operations to fully refresh the screen ; one to clear old segments , one to darken new segments .
A smart programmer will think they can save a cycle when only adding or removing items , and not doing both .
This is true to some extent , but continuous manipulation of one cell without refreshing adjacent cells causes color ‘ creep ’ .
In the video , a flashing background without updates to any other segments quickly drives the inactive segments to a mid-state between dark and light .
Driver board
The driver consists of an eight - pin Microchip PIC12F629 , two 4094 shift registers , and some supporting components .

Batteries
Esquire invited hacks of their cover with the rather lame suggestion of replacing the batteries .
This makes sense , the covers were shipped all over the world in refrigerated containers to help extend the battery life .
Even with that effort , Esquire says that the batteries will last a few months .
Batteries 1 - 5 are in series and provide a 15 - 16 volt switching current for the e-paper .
The sixth battery provides 3volts for the PIC .
No word yet on which batteries die first .
If you want to ‘ replace ’ your batteries , you ’ll need to desolder the old ones , and provide a 5 - 16 volt e-paper supply , and 3volt microcontroller supply , at the points indicated .
We eventually had to replace our microcontroller battery because we abused it a bit during development .
A button battery holder with 20 mm pin spacing will fit the existing holes .
Mouser # 534-106 will probably work , but this is unconfirmed .
4094 shift registers ( IC1 , IC2 )
The shift registers switch the e-paper segment controls at 16 volts .
The two 4094 ICs are shift registers setup to cascade data from IC1 to IC2 .
This simple shift register is a slight variation on the 74HTC595 we used in our graffiti wall .
The main difference is that the 4094 strobe line is normally low , and briefly pulled high to put new values on the output pins .
We noticed that the 4094 requires long clock and strobe pulses .
This could be due to lazy drive circuitry between the PIC and the 4094 , or just the nature of the 4000 series .

12F629
Click here for a full size schematic drawing ( PNG ) .
An eight pin PIC12F629 drives the 4094 shift registers that control each e-paper segment .
Two pins are unused ( GP4 , GP5 ) .
The MCLR feature is enabled with resistor R8 .
The design does n’t include a diode to protect the PIC from the 13 volt programming current .
Microchip recommends this , but there ’s no other sensitive ICs sharing the circuit so perhaps the designer felt a resistor was sufficient protection .
Three pins drive the data , clock , and strobe lines of the 4094 ( GP0 , GP1 , GP2 ) .
The 4094 has to be interfaced at the same voltage it switches , 16 volts , so the PIC switches the interface pins through transistors .
As far as we can tell , the 4094 control lines are pulled high with a resistor .
The PIC switches a transistor on , and it pulls the line to ground .
The interface to the 4094 is backwards .
A PIC high pin is seen as low at the shift register , and low is seen as high .
The interface wo n’t work unless reversed .
The programming pins are brought to a header at the top of the PCB .
We soldered standard .1 ″ pin header into the holes provided ( Mouser # 571-41033290 ) .
The two programming pins , PGD and PGC , are shared with the circuitry that drives the shift registers .
We were able to read the device with an ICD2 debugger .
We could n’t reprogram it though , probably because of the shift register driver .
Has anyone had success ?
Regardless , the shared pin arrangement makes it impossible to do in - circuit debugging on this device .
PIC pin connections
Pin Name Connection 1 VDD +3.3volts 2 GP5 — 3 GP4 — 4 GP3 MCLR ( program VPP ) 5 GP2 4094 Strobe 6 GP1 4094 Clock ( program clock ) 7 GP0 4094 Data ( program data ) 8 VSS Ground
Tap the board
It ’s easy to tap into the board and use it with your favorite microcontroller .
All but one of the required interface signals are already brought to a header .
The strobe line can be tapped through the via indicated by the arrow .
You do n’t want the PIC to interfere with your new controller , so remove it or deactivate it by severing the power pin .
Interface library
Our first effort to drive the board involved our PIC24 F - based mini web server .
It was handy , and the PIC24 F is easy to work with .
We perfected our interface library on a low - power MSP430 .
Both versions are in the project archive ( ZIP ) , but the MSP430 version of the library is more mature .
The library includes a software bit - bang routine , functions for interfacing the board , and address definitions for the segment and common lines .
Options in esquire_eink.h enable a bit - bang delay and set its length ; we found the 4094 lazy and in need of a lengthy clock pulse .
The initBang ( ) function sets the direction of the pins , and should be changed to suit your microcontroller .
Call it , or set your IO pins to output elsewhere :
bangInit( ) ; //set bitbang pins to output
The setSeg ( ) function sets the passed segments dark ( 1 ) or clear ( 0 ) :
setSeg(FRONT_BOX_GUY +FRONT_BACKGROUND , 1 ) ; //set ( dark ) these segments setSeg ( FRONT_21ST_CENTURY,0 ) ;// clear ( light ) these segments
The setSeg ( ) function includes a color change delay defined by EINK_DELAY in esquire_eink .h.
At the end of the delay it returns the shift register pins to ground .
We want to avoid damaging to the e-paper or wasting the batteries , though we do n’t really know if this is necessary .
One thing we noticed about setSeg ( ) was that manipulating single cells causes adjacent cells to regress toward a mid-color .
We developed the setDisplay ( ) function to combat this by fully refreshing the display every time .
setDisplay ( ) includes a pause for each change , and then returns the shift register outputs to ground .
Just pass the segment arrangement for a fully refreshed display :
setDisplay ( FRONT_ESQUIRE+BACK_LEFT
);//XX dark , everything else clear
You can access the shift registers directly with the bangIt ( ) function , but consider returning the shift registers outputs to ‘ 0 ’ after the e-paper color change is complete .
You could damage the e-paper or cause excessive current drain if you leave it on , if that ’s actually ‘ a thing ’ .
bangIt ( 0b1110000000000000 ) ;// all back panel segments on pause ( ) ;// wait for the color change bang It ( 0x0000 ) ;// return all outputs to ground
To port the library to your microcontroller , just check the pin configurations in esquire_eink.h , and the pin setup function bangInit ( ) in esquire_eink .c.
Keep in mind that the pin directions are reversed by the interface transistors .
Putting it to use , an e-paper clock
We wanted to do something useful with the first cheap consumer e-paper panel .
It had to be something pretty easy so that lots of people can recycle this cool piece of technology .
We could n’t resist doing what so many do with old display tech : make a clock .
Schematics , firmware , and art templates are in the project archive ( .zip ) .
There ’s so few segments on the e-paper that we can only partially represent the time .
Six segments show time , each fades to reveal the time to the nearest ten minutes past the hour .
We also flash eye - candy on the non-time segments of the panel .
Here ’s the custom bezel we created .
This bezel , and a template to make your own , are included in the project archive ( ZIP ) .
We printed our bezel mirrored so the ink is protected from scratches .
Hardware
We were inspired by the low - power properties of e-paper to use Texas Instruments ’ MSP430 line of 16 - bit microcontrollers .
With the right configuration , the MSP430 draws so little power that it ’s only limited by the shelf life of a battery .
We can even give the original designers a run for their money , and see if we can make a lower power device .
The best thing about the MSP430 is that you can buy a kit with a USB programmer / debugger and breakout board for only 20 bucks .
It comes with a free C compiler limited to 4 K , but the F2013 only has 2 K of memory .
This is a complete development tool , no soldering involved .
Learn more about working with the MSP430 in this how - to .
This schematic shows how we connected our MSP430 to the e-paper driver board .
Click here for a full size version ( PNG ) .
The 47 K resistor , MSP430 , and an LED ( not shown ) are included on the breakout board .
We added a 32.768KHz crystal to keep time ( Q1 ) .
Normally , we ’d also add some capacitors to form an oscillator , but the MSP430 has built - in adjustable capacitors on P2.6 and P2.7 .
We also added a button between P1.4 and P1.2 ( S1 ) .
The internal pull - up resistor on P1.4 holds the button high , and we grounded it through P1.2 .
This is n’t the best arrangement , it would probably be wise to also connect P1.2 to ground .
We slid the MSP430 breakout board over the power and ground pins of the programming header .
You can connect the clock and data pins to the header too , but we decided to route them all from the vias underneath .
Remember to remove the PIC so it does n’t interfere with signals from the MSP430 .

Firmware
The clock software is written with the free demo version of the TI / IAR Kickstart C compiler included with the ez430 programmer .
The MSP430 is very low power .
It uses just 220 uA at 1MHz , but less than 6 uA when sleeping .
The key to long battery life is to keep the chip asleep as much as possible .
Our clock code is written with this in mind .
We use timer_a with the 32.768 khz crystal to create an interrupt twice each second .
The first interrupt triggers code that configures the segments to be displayed , sends these values to the e-paper , and then sleeps for the next 0.5 seconds .
While the MSP430 sleeps , all the ‘ off ’ segments have time to clear .
The next interrupt flips the common lines the other way with a simple XOR , outputs the values , and goes to sleep for another 0.5 seconds .
Next time the cycle will begin again .
We do n’t bother to reset the shift registers to the ‘ 0 ’ position because the refresh is constantly in flux .
Segment creep is n’t a problem because we refresh every segment each cycle .
A button press triggers an interrupt that advances the time to the next 10 minutes .
To set the clock , wait until the time is a factor of 10 minutes past the hour and press the button to show the correct time .
A small debouncing routine ensures that only one hit is detected per button press .
Taking it further
There are some lingering questions about the e-paper panels that would be nice to answer .
What is the optimal change time ?
Will continuous current damage the segments or waste battery power ?
Why did the designer use a full 16 volts to trigger the panels when only 5volts are required ?
Everything you need to build the clock and interface the Esquire cover is included in the project archive ( ZIP ) .
It should be possible to interface any microcontroller with the Esquire e-paper cover using the interface library and three IO pins .
In a future project we plan to build a custom driver board for the unused e-paper module .

NASA confirms liquid lake on Saturn 's moon Titan
NASA / JPL NEWS RELEASE
Posted : July 30 , 2008
PASADENA , Calif . -- NASA scientists have concluded that at least one of the large lakes observed on Saturn 's moon Titan contains liquid hydrocarbons , and have positively identified the presence of ethane .
This makes
Titan the only body in our solar system beyond Earth known to have liquid on its surface .
This artist concept shows a mirror - smooth lake on the surface of the smoggy moon Titan .
Credit : NASA / JPL
Scientists made the discovery using data from an instrument aboard the Cassini spacecraft .
The instrument identified chemically different materials based on the way they absorb and reflect infrared light .
Before Cassini , scientists thought Titan would have global oceans of methane , ethane and other light hydrocarbons .
�More than 40 close flybys of Titan by Cassini show no such global oceans exist , but hundreds of dark , lake - like features are present .
Until now , it was not known whether these features were liquid or simply dark , solid material .
" This is the first observation that really pins down that Titan has a surface lake filled with liquid , " said Bob Brown of the University of Arizona , Tucson .
Brown is the team leader of Cassini 's visual and mapping instrument .
The results will be published in the July 31 issue of the journal Nature .
Ethane and several other simple hydrocarbons have been identified in Titan 's atmosphere , which consists of 95 percent nitrogen , with methane making up the other fiver percent .
Ethane and other hydrocarbons are products from atmospheric chemistry caused by the breakdown of methane by sunlight .
Some of the hydrocarbons react further and form fine aerosol particles .
All of these things in Titan 's atmosphere make detecting and identifying materials on the surface difficult , because these particles form a ubiquitous hydrocarbon haze that hinders the view .
Liquid ethane was identified using a technique that removed the interference from the atmospheric hydrocarbons .
The visual and mapping instrument observed a lake , Ontario Lacus , in Titan 's south polar region during a close Cassini flyby in December 2007 .
The lake is roughly 20,000 square miles ( 7,800 square miles ) in area , slightly larger than North America 's Lake Ontario .
" Detection of liquid ethane confirms a long - held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on Titan , " said Larry Soderblom , a Cassini interdisciplinary scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff , Ariz .
" The fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated , and at a slanted viewing path through Titan 's atmosphere , raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument . "
The ethane is in a liquid solution with methane , other hydrocarbons and nitrogen .
At Titan 's surface temperatures , approximately 300 degrees Fahrenheit below zero , these substances can exist as both liquid and gas .
Titan shows overwhelming evidence of evaporation , rain , and fluid - carved channels draining into what , in this case , is a liquid hydrocarbon lake .
Earth has a hydrological cycle based on water and Titan has a cycle based on methane .
Scientists ruled out the presence of water ice , ammonia , ammonia hydrate and carbon dioxide in Ontario Lacus .
The observations also suggest the lake is evaporating .
It is ringed by a dark beach , where the black lake merges with the bright shoreline .
Cassini also observed a shelf and beach being exposed as the lake evaporates .
" During the next few years , the vast array of lakes and seas on Titan 's north pole mapped with Cassini 's radar instrument will emerge from polar darkness into sunlight , giving the infrared instrument rich opportunities to watch for seasonal changes of Titan 's lakes , " Soderblom said .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Cassini - Huygens mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
The Cassini orbiter was designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer team is based at the University of Arizona .
Our wallets are filling up with SIM and RFID cards that contain hidden information .
Using our latest project , the Bus Pirate universal serial interface , we can dump the memory from many common smart cards .
In today ’s How - to , we show you how to interface common smart cards , and walk you through the data stored on a FedEx Kinko ’s prepaid value card .
Background
The FedEx Kinko ’s prepaid card is actually a SLE4442 smart card .
There ’s nothing secret about the SLE4442 , it ’s completely documented in the datasheet ( PDF ) , and you can buy blank cards on the web .
The card is openly readable , we ’ll be able to look at the contents without any sort of malicious intrusion .
It ’s protected from writes by a three byte password , with a ‘ three strikes you ’re out ’ policy that renders the card useless after three failed password attempts .
Due to its wide - spread use , in Kinko ’s and other capacities , the SLE4442 has been the target of several high - profile hacks .
At the ’06 Toorcon , [ bunnie ] and [ Chris Tarnovsky ] hosted a discussion on the card .
[ Chris ] examined the silicon die and suggested that shorting a trace might defeat the security measures .
You can see high - resolution images of the die on his site .
[ Strom Carlson ] went right to the source and snooped the password with a logic analyzer , as documented in his famous ’06 Defcon presentation .
The card even makes appearances in artwork .
We ’re not planning on maliciously intruding on the card , but we can still look at the contents and demonstrate how to interface arbitrary protocols with our latest project , the Bus Pirate .
Connecting to the SLE4442
Pin Function Bus Pirate pin 1 +5volts +5 volt supply 2 Reset AUX 3 Clock SCL 4 Data IO SDA 5 N/C – 6 Ground Ground
Grab the SLE4442 datasheet ( PDF ) if you have n’t already .
The pinout is shown in the picture above .
If you ’re having trouble orienting the card , note that the large center pad connects to ground .
The card requires 5 volts DC ( datasheet page 27 , table 3.2.2 ) , we used the Bus Pirate ’s handy 5 volt supply .
Interfacing at five volts is no problem because the Bus Pirate inputs are all 5 volt tolerant .
A two - wire interface is used , with a clock line and bi-directional data line .
We connected these to the Bus Pirate ’s SDA and SCL pins .
A third signal , reset , is required to initialize the chip ; we used the Bus Pirate ’s auxiliary output to control the reset line .
The maximum clock frequency we can use to interface the device is 50kHz , with a 7k Hz stated minimum ( page 28 , table 3.2.4 : fCLK ) .
The Bus Pirate ’s raw 2 wire protocol runs at about 5kHz , but we did n’t have any problems interfacing the device .
The sle4442 has open collector outputs , and depends on pull - up resistors to hold the bus high .
Instead of switching the data pin between ground and 5volts , it switches between ground and high - impedance states .
High - impedance means that the chip exerts no state on the line , it lets it float , like a microcontroller input pin .
Each of the signal lines need to be pulled - up to 5volts with a 2K - 10 K resistor , the value is n’t particularly important .
Without the pull - up resistor , we ’ll never see anything but 0 ( ground ) on the bus because the sle4442 does n’t exert a voltage of it ’s own .
A benefit of this technique is that the Bus Pirate , which only switches at 3.3volts , will talk to the sle4442 at a full 5volts , in compliance with the 3.5 volt minimum voltage for a high level ( datasheet , page 27 , table 3.2.3 : Vih ) .
Initializing the card
Before we can read data from the card , we have to initialize it .
This is done with a standard ISO 7816 - 3 Answer to Reset ( ATR ) command .
After initialization , we can read from the card using a simple two wire protocol .
Setup raw 2 wire mode
The interface shares some characteristics with I2C , but it ’s not compatible .
We used the Bus Pirate ’s raw 2 wire bus mode to interface the device .
RAW2 >m
1. SPI
2. I2C
3. UART

5. RAW 3 WIRE

2. Normal outputs ( H=Vcc , L=GND )
MODE > 1 <– high impedance output type
9xx OUTPUT HIGHZ
402 RAW2WIRE READY , P FOR PULLUPS
RAW2 >
The Bus Pirate has on - board pull - up resistors , but they only pull to 3.3 volts .
We must use external pull - ups to 5volts , as shown in the picture .
High - Z output mode is compatible with the bus , normal outputs would put 3.3 volts on the bus , potentially damaging something .
RAW2>l < –configure MSB/LSB
1. MSB first
2. LSB first
MODE >2 <– LSB first
9xx LSB : LEAST SIG BIT FIRST
RAW2 >
The card reads and writes each byte least significant bit first ( datasheet page 10 ) .
We use menu option L to set the data mode to LSB first .
Send 7816 -3 ISO answer to reset command
ISO 7816 - 3 “ answer to reset ” is a standardized command used among many smart cards .
The ATR sequence is shown above : reset is held high , one clock pulse is sent , reset is released .
The next 32 clock pulses ( 4 bytes ) read a generic ATR header from the card .
The header contains information about the card type and protocol .
Multi -card smart card readers use this to determine how to read each card .
RAW2 > @^arrrr < – aux high ( highz ) , clock tick , aux low , read 4 bytes

430 RAW2WIRE READ : 0x13
430 RAW2WIRE READ : 0x10
430 RAW2WIRE READ : 0x91
RAW2 >
We issue the command @^arrrr to the Bus Pirate .
@ puts the auxiliary pin in high - impedance input mode , the pull - up resistor holds the reset at 5 volts .
^ issues one clock pulse , with delay .
a returns the auxiliary pin to output and holds the reset line at ground .
r issues 8 clock pulses and displays the returned bits as a byte .
This is one instance where the protocol is incompatible with I2C .
I2C includes an additional acknowledge bit between each byte , the sle4442 outputs 32 bits consecutively .
Page 25 of the datasheet explains the ISO7816 - 3 header .
It ’s easiest to interpret in binary .
Rather than convert everything to binary , we set the Bus Pirate to binary display mode and issued another ATR command .

The first 2 bytes are protocol header bytes according to ISO 7816 - 3 ( datasheet page 25 ) .
Byte 1 identifies the protocol type .
0b10100010
7:4 – Protocol type ( 1010=2 wire )
3:3 – RFU ( 0 )
2:0 – Structure Identifier ( 010=general )
Byte 2 , protocol parameters , tells us about the card if we did n’t have a datasheet .
0b00010011
7:7 – Supports random read lengths ( 0 =no , read to end )
6:3 – Data units ( 0010=256units )
2:0 – Data unit bits ( 011=8 bits per unit )
From the header we can tell that the protocol type is 10 , a two wire bus .
The card must be read all the way to the end before it accepts a new command .
It has 8 bits to a unit , and 256units ; 256 bytes total storage .
The final two bytes are 7814 - 4 data , which seems uninteresting ( see datasheet page 26 ) .
Dump main memory ( 256 bytes )
Once the card is reset and the ATR bytes are read , we can send commands to the card .
Commands are three bytes long ; they begin with a I2C - style start condition , and end with an I2C - style stop condition .
Start and stop conditions can be generated manually with \-/_\ and _/-\ , but the raw 2 wire library also includes the shortcuts { and } .
The start and stop conditions are the same as I2C , but they ’re used at a different point in the transmission .
The read main memory command is 0x30 , followed by a read start address ( 0 ) , and a third byte that does n’t matter ( 0xff ) .
After the stop condition , the card outputs data on every clock until it reaches the end of the memory .
As described by the ATR header , no new commands can be sent until the card reaches the last byte of memory .
Starting at read address 0 , it takes 256* 8 clock pulses to complete the read cycle .

{ issues the bus start condition .
0x30 sends the read address , 0 is the start byte , and 0xff could be anything .
} sends the bus stop condition .
0r255 clocks in 255 8 bit bytes and displays them on the screen .
The card actually has 256 bytes of main memory , so we issue an additional read command to get the last byte and verify that the bus returns to high after the read is over .
We ca n’t use 0r256 because the Bus Pirate does n’t understand decimal numbers greater than 255 ( we should address that ) .

Dump protection memory ( 4 bytes )
The first 32 bytes of the data memory can be write protected .
Each bit of the four byte data protection register ( command 0x34 ) represents a byte of data memory .
A bit set to 1 can not be overwritten .
We can read the data protection register and find out which bytes of the main memory are write protected .
This is easiest to understand in binary , so we did this operation in binary output mode .

The attempt counter starts at three ( 0b00000111 ) , and counts down to 0 .
When the counter reads 0 , the card is essentially destroyed .

Taking it further
We ’d like to demonstrate all the capabilities of this card , including password verification and data updates , but we need to buy a new card with a known security code .

Perhaps it is the understatement of the century to say that that Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska — that Trojan Moose running mate of Senator John McCain — knows absolutely nothing about foreign policy .
The person who aspires to be a heartbeat away from the presidency only received her first passport last year .
And the extent of her international affairs experience involves Alaska ’s proximity to Siberia .
What receives far less attention , however , is Palin ’s inability to deal with cultural diversity within the borders of her own state .
With a quarter of its population as people of color , including one - fifth Native - Americans and around 10 percent African - and Asian - Americans combined — Alaska is far more diverse than one would conclude at first glance .
Yet there is ample evidence that the governor has little else than utter disrespect for Alaskans of a darker hue .
As for Alaska Natives , who have experienced years of being treated as less than human , crowded out and pushed aside to make way for White settlers , Palin has continued the policy of degrading and suppressing the state ’s first inhabitants .
Do n’t be sidetracked by the fact that Palin ’s husband is of Yup ’ik Eskimo ancestry .
There have been the affronts to the Native community , such as when Palin allegedly fired the highly regarded Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan , a Native , because he refused to remove Palin ’s former brother - in - law from the state police force .
And when she assumed her office , the governor tried to appoint a White woman to a seat on the state ’s wildlife management board , a seat which had been occupied by a Native for 25 years .

Subsistence fishing and hunting are very important to the traditional way of life for Native peoples , and Gov. Palin has done everything in her power to oppose tribal subsistence rights , to the benefit of commercial and sporting interests .
And she has continued a lawsuit which would eliminate all federal fishing protections for Native Alaskan people .
In addition , she opposes tribal sovereignty , and has refused to acknowledge native languages and give them the respect they deserve .
A federal court ordered Palin to provide voter materials in indigenous languages .
And as Earl Ofari Hutchinson recently noted , Alaska is rife with racial inequality .
Infant mortality for Native children is double that of Whites .
Native students are 12 percent of the children in public schools , but 25 percent of the dropouts .
Native Alaskan men are 10 percent of the population , but 40 percent of the prisoners .
Chronically unemployed and victims of discrimination , the indigenous population is underrepresented in employment in the legal , child welfare and criminal justice fields .
Before Palin took office , the U.S. Civil Rights Commission called for a host of reforms to deal with these racial disparities , but Gov. Palin , maverick and reformer that she is , has n’t budged on implementing any of the recommendations .
Then , there is Palin ’s disrespect for Alaska ’s African American population .
Yes , I was just as surprised as you are .
On April 29 , a group of African American leaders met with the governor to discuss their dissatisfaction with her record on diversity in hiring .
According to Gwen Alexander , head of the African - American Historical Society of Alaska , Palin told the group that she did not have to hire any Blacks , and did n’t intend to hire any .
Further , Juneteenth — that well - known day of slave emancipation celebrated by Blacks throughout the country — has been an official holiday in Alaska since 2001 .
However , as veteran journalist Linn Washington notes , Palin did not attend the celebration , and did not send a representative .
The governor similarly declined requests for her attendance to town hall meetings on issues affecting communities of color .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
The extent of Gov. Palin ’s record on diversity seems to amount to ignoring Native Alaskans ’ basic rights , telling Black folks she does n’t have to hire them , and snubbing Juneteenth .
So , where does all of this lead us ?
What is the punchline to this cruel joke known as the vice - presidential candidacy of Sarah Palin ?
Well , in the end , Palin ’s record represents an indictment of the GOP narrative of small town America .
As the new poster child for the conservative cause , Palin gives small town people a bad name .
To be sure , many people in small towns are just as clueless , narrow - minded and averse to cultural diversity and civil rights as the governor of Alaska .
But many more are not , and these people must decide very soon if they will allow Sarah Palin to speak for them .

George W. Bush is the second Republican president in a row , after his father , to leave office breaking a promise ; a fairytale .
During his nomination acceptance speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention , President George H.W.
Bush famously thundered , " Read my lips , no new taxes . "
Then Governor Bill Clinton turned the words against Bush in an unforgettable attack ad that set Clinton on a sure path to victory , entitled , " The George Bush Promise . "
The ad featured Bush making his memorable " no new taxes " declaration over a swell of foreboding music , followed by an enduring voiceover that all but destroyed the president 's character and credibility in less than 18 seconds : " Then [ President Bush ] gave us the second biggest tax increase in American history , " the voiceover says , " Bush increased the gas tax by 56 percent . "
Unfortunately , the ad created a fallout that was limited in its scope to the political career of President Bush .
Democrats missed an opportunity to draw broader lessons ; to connect the necessity for that tax increase to the effects of Reagan 's tax cuts and deficit spending on defense ; ultimately , to expose the inherent shortcomings of a political philosophy that encourages selfishness .
The Republican Party philosophy is that of the grasshopper in Aesop 's fable , " The Ant and the Grasshopper . "
The reader will remember how the grasshopper wastes his summer days singing and chirping " to its heart 's content , " while the ant toils , stocking provisions of wheat and corn for the winter .
( Right now , that ant is China ) .
When winter arrives , the ants live merrily and the grasshopper freezes and starves to death .
In the 1934 Walt Disney version , released in the midst of the last great American economic disaster , the grasshopper ( blue with cold ) is allowed inside and given a tub of warm water in which to place his feet and a bowl of soup .
He survives .
( A dozen or so other pundits and columnists have used the old fable as an analogy in the last month . )
The Chief Grasshopper in 2008 finds himself in the stormy and brisk winds of October as he enters his last 100 days in the White House .
America has $ 10 trillion of debt .
For eight years , President Bush has said , " Read my lips , no nationalized anything , " preaching instead the doctrine of selfishness and market - centered greed in every sector .
" We need , " Bush said on January 28 , 2004 , " to keep ... the private market strong [ read : keep the rich getting richer ] , by resisting efforts that are happening in Washington , D.C. , to say the federal government should be running health care ... I believe the best health care system is that health care system generated in the private markets . "
In reality , we have a costly health care system , adding to our national debt .
America pays nearly twice as much per capita as Switzerland , who has the second most expensive health care system in the world .
In fact , in 2004 our health care system cost $ 6,000 per capita - - its even more expensive today .
By contrast , the recent $ 700 billion bailout cost every American $ 2,000 .
Our health care system costs the equivalent of a $ 2.1 trillion bailout EVERY YEAR .
Grasshopper Bush wants you to keep singing and chirping because that annual $ 2.1 trillion is flowing into the pockets of the insurers and the care providers , never to be seen again .
We 'll pick up the tab .

It ’s no surprise Rep. Marilyn Musgrave is taking her recent loss to Betsy Markey really , really hard .
Musgrave , a Republican who ’s been representing Colorado ’s 4th District since 2002 , became part of the Republican Casualty List when she lost in a landslide , even after the National Republican Congressional Committee doled out almost a million bucks ( reportedly $ 900,000 ) for her campaign .
Two weeks after the brutal loss , Musgrave still has n’t called her opponent to concede or to congratulate the victor , as is not only textbook but also mannerly to do .
Moreover , Musgrave ’s ill manners bleed into her own team .
Rumor has it she still — 14 days later — has n’t even thanked her campaign staff .
( Again , textbook . )
Musgrave press secretary Joseph Brettell tells us : “ It ’s a campaign matter , and I have no further comment . ”
And as for Markey , her campaign manger , Anne Caprara , who is in town this week with her boss for orientation , tells us of Musgrave : “ No , she has n’t called to concede , but we ’re moving forward . ”
Though the Markey team does n’t plan on stopping by Musgrave ’s office while in town , eventually the two camps will have to touch base — just in terms of transitioning .
But curiously , more rumors abound that no one has seen or talked to Musgrave since the brutal loss ; she ’s all but disappeared .
Well , while the Markey crew is here , is there anyone they have n’t met whom they look forward to meeting ?
“ All the new members are all very nice and a really good group of folks , ” Caprara says .
“ Our schedule is up in the air , but it ’d be nice to meet the president - elect .
I do n’t know if that ’s gonna happen . ”
Meanwhile , Markey , for what it ’s worth , has already come onto the Capitol Hill scene with a bang — she ranks as one of the richest freshman members .
The flak bash
Quinn and Gillespie Associates ’ Flak Bash is tomorrow .
This is always a pretty popular affair , of course , honoring the best flaks in each political party in campaigns , on the Hill and in industry .
We hear there were two full pages of names that were culled , topped by all the usual suspects : the Tucker Boundses , the Danny Diazes , the Bill Burtons , blah , blah .
But there are some names that pop out .
Sarah Palin , for one .
Joe Biden .
Tim Kaine .
T. Boone Pickens .
Tom Tancredo ?
And other , more reasonable and actual communications people : Ryan Loskarn , Pepper Pennington , Brad Dayspring and David DiMartino .
The nominating seems to be done anonymously and by the general public , so that should explain a lot .
Typically the awards tend to go to the most well - known , high - profile flaks .
“ It really is a popularity contest , ” says someone close to the process .
Maybe more like a student council campaign .
Apparently , there are pages upon pages of people ’s explanations as to why some should win .
“ It ’s ridiculous , ” laughs another insider , in semi- shock over the audaciousness .
Obviously this award — though purely ceremonial — is taken seriously by those nominated .
One year , a prominent press guy was crowned winner , throwing a clearly disappointed flak into utter despair .
“ Do n’t they know how hard it is being [ incriminated politician ’s name here ] ’s flak ? ! ” he was overheard ranting — with quite a point — at the time .
And if that ’s not evidence enough , one Senate press guy , who works for a Republican senator whose reputation precedes him / her , wrote a page and half as to why he should be voted winner .
His pitch ?
“ The proof is in the product . ”
Oh , and the judges ( deep breath : Politico ’s Jim VandeHei , HuffPo ’s Arianna Huffington , WaTimes ’ Jeff Birnbaum , Newsweek ’s Eleanor Clift , The Hill ’s Bob Cusack , TNR ’s Eve Fairbanks , NRO ’s Kathryn Jean Lopez , Roll Call ’s Charlie Mitchell , WSJ ’s Brody Mullins and NJ’s Bara Vaida ) took to voting Friday afternoon , so kissing up now is pointless .
Just remember , whether you win or not , in the words of one on - message nominated person : “ Of course , it ’s always great to be recognized by your peers for having done great work . ”
Just asking
• What PR - loving nondescript GOP techie and striver is starting his own “ conservative ” version of Wonkette ?
• What former senator — and current lobbyist — was spotted outside the Oval Office on Friday ?*
* We ’ll give you the answer to this one : John Breaux .
­­ —
Does anyone else find this ironic ?
“ They ’re a dinosaur , in a sense . ”

Not mentioning the market
McCain did n't talk about the stock market yesterday , and did n't put out a statement on it , while Obama did both , and McCain campaign manager Rick Davis was asked about that on a conference call ( about Acorn ! ) this afternoon .
" There ’s very little a candidate for president can say and very little the president can say about what ’s happening in the stock markets except hope that they correct themselves , " Davis said , adding that McCain 's mortgage plan could be an " elixir " for the financial crisis .
" I ca n’t imagine a situation where on a daily basis the campaign would put out a statement about what the market was doing , " he said .
" It does n’t meant that we do n’t care and are n’t trying to do something about it . "
The campaign , he said , should n't become a " CNBC news show on the stock market . "
If a new study by Nielsen is accurate , reports of the video star 's death at the hands of the Internet have been greatly exaggerated .
The ratings company tracked the time that Americans spend with the three main " screens " in their life — TV , Internet , and the mobile phone — and found that TV still rules .
The study claims that Americans broke new records in TV watching during the 2007 - 2008 season : households averaged 8 hours and 18 minutes per day , or an average of 4 hours and 45 minutes per person per day .
These figures are the highest on record , and they represent a quarterly increase in addition to a yearly increase .
Both regular and time - shifted TV viewing are on the rise , with time - shifted viewing posting a whopping 52.5 percent year - over - year increase from the third quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2008 ; regular viewing was up only 4.1 percent .
As for the other screens in the Nielsen study , the report pegs mobile phone video viewing at 3 hours and 37 minutes per month , up from 3 hours and 15 minutes the previous month .
This statistic includes any type of mobile video viewing , from subscription - based offerings from wireless providers like Sprint to YouTube and other web - based video outlets .
Nielsen claims that Internet use in general was up only 5.7 percent year - over - year , with Americans spending only an hour and a half more per month online than they did in the third quarter of 2007 .
Color me skeptical of Nielsen 's Internet usage numbers — their panel - based traffic estimates for Ars and other sites for which we have numbers are so low as to literally defy the laws of physics ( we 'd have to change all of our graphics to uncompressed TIFFs to square Nielsen 's estimate of our audience size with our actual bandwidth usage ) .
But Nielsen does know TV , so you might think that the company 's estimates for TV audience increases would be great news for the likes of CBS , NBC , and other broadcasters .
But you 'd be wrong .
Unfortunately for the broadcast networks , the action is in cable TV , and it has been for over a decade now .
Nielsen 's numbers show that network TV viewing has been bleeding viewers since at least 1984 , but audience loss is n't even their biggest problem .
Ad spending for network TV was down last quarter , and a recent Variety article suggests that the possible bankruptcies of US automakers could be a final nail in the medium 's coffin .
This situation led to an unintentionally amusing audience question at a New York conference last week on the future of television .
An audience member was confused about how viewership could be up but ad revenue could be significantly reduced ; top network execs patiently explained that just having eyeballs was n't much good in a major economic downturn .
If advertisers do n't have the budget to buy , it does n't matter if your network reaches two billion people a night .
( The lesson could also be applied to any web startup concentrating only on eyeballs , as though users automatically equal revenue . )
American automakers are major network TV advertisers , accounting for almost seven percent of total network ad spending .
( Of course , they 're also major advertisers in every other medium , including the Internet ; Paul Kedrosky has the breakdown . )
The collapse of auto ad spending would push the networks even further into the red ; but if the networks really imploded , at least the spectrum watchers would be happy .
At the very least , the collapse of broadcast TV as a viable business model would take the wind out of opposition to white spaces broadband , and it might even free up a ton of prime ( non-white - space ) spectrum for wireless broadband .
HSS is tool that extends the CSS syntax with powerful features such as variables and nested blocks .
First download HSS and put it in some place where it can be run from the commandline :
Windows version : hss-1.3-win.zip
OSX version : hss-1.3-osx.gz
Linux version : hss-1.3-linux.gz
Sources are available here , you will need Neko to compile them
TIP : On OSX and Linux you will have to enable the file to be executable after unzipping , by running the command chmod +x hss
You can then rename you .css file with the extension .hss .
Since HSS extends the CSS syntax , it means that every valid CSS valid is a valid HSS file as well .
You can then compile your HSS file into the corresponding CSS file by running the hss command :
hss myfile.hss
You can specify an output directory with - output < dir > if you need it to be different than the hss file one .
Since every time the HSS file is modified the CSS file needs to be regenerated , it 's better if the website itself automatically runs HSS when it notices that the HSS file has changed , and displays errors if any occurs .
HSS is a CSS compiler which supports valid CSS syntax , so for every error that occurs during the parsing of the HSS file , it will display and error indicating at which file and which line the error occurred .
HSS also enforce additional syntax rules .
While this is valid CSS , the following is not HSS - valid since there is a missing semicolon at the end of the color value :
pre { color : # FF0000 }
In that case , you will get an error telling :
myfile.hss:3 : Unexpected '} ' maybe missing ;
Fix all the errors and HSS will then be able to generate the corresponding CSS file .
HSS adds property variables to the CSS syntax .
You can declare a variable with the keyword var and use it in the HSS file by prefixing the variable name with a dollar :
var mycolor = # 1111 AA ; var myfont = " Trebuchet MS " , Arial , sans - serif ; body { color : $ mycolor ; font : $ myfont ; }
Variables are a very good way to avoid replacing everything in a CSS file every time you want to change a single color value .
It also helps designers to remember and easily locate the main colors that are used in a given website .
You can also declare variables that will declare several properties at the same time :
var nomargin = { margin : 0 px ; padding : 0 px ; } pre { $ nomargin ; color : # FF0000 ; }
Block variables are very useful to share some " behaviors " between unrelated rules .
They can be used to improve the way CSS files are organized and makes it much more easy to test style - changes .
One of the things that are the most annoying with CSS is when you want to avoid class - names clashing .
For instance if you declare the following :
. name { font - weight : bold ; }
Then there is an high possibility that class = " name " is used in several different parts of the website , and needs to be styled differently depending on the case .
In order to avoid these problems , it 's often needed to specify the context in which is class occurs , which often to the following declarations :
.faq { color : # BC683 C ; } .faq . form { width : 100 px ; } .faq . form textarea { width : 100 % ; height : 80 px ; } .faq . form . name { font - weight : bold ; } .faq ul { margin - left : 20 px ; margin- bottom : 20 px ; }
In that CSS example , we can see how the natural nested XHTML structure has been " flattened " , and how we need to specify before each block the complete context in which the class occurs .
HSS allows then a much more natural way of declaring the same thing , which is called nested blocks .
Here 's the previous example rewritten by using nested blocks :
.faq { color : # BC683C ; . form { width : 100 px ; textarea { width : 100 % ; height : 80 px ; } .name { font - weight : bold ; } } ul { margin - left : 20 px ; margin - bottom : 20 px ; } }
As you can see , such nested structure provides much more readability and maintainability than flatten one .
Using nested blocks is very good way to express complex structures and avoid class name clashing .
There are two kind of comments possible in HSS , which are the same used in popular syntax such as C / Java .
The /* ... */ comment is a multiline comment which is already part of CSS and the // .... comment is used for single - line comment .
p { font - weight : bold ; }
All comments are removed from the CSS output .
Apart from validating the syntax and providing additional things , HSS also checks the validity of the CSS properties values .
For instance the following will not be allowed because of the double 't ' :
pre { font - weightt : bold ; }
The following also will not be allowed by ' bald ' is not a valid value for the property font - weight :
pre { font - weight : bald ; }
HSS also enforces some good CSS practices such as :
properties declarations must always end with a semicolon ( ; )
) URLs must be quoted : do n't do url ( img.gif ) but please use url ( 'img.gif ' ) instead .
but please use instead .
the background property has a fixed order , which is the following :
background : [ color ] [ url ] [ repeat ] [ scroll|fixed ] [ horiz . ] [ vert . ]
The whole CSS properties rules that are used to check the property value correctness are listed in the Rules.nml file of the HSS sources .
You might want to modify them for your own needs .
Here 's the list of CSS selectors with their HSS support status , see here for the corresponding explanations :
E : supported
E F : supported
E > F : supported
E + F : supported
E ~ F : supported
DIV .warning : supported
E#myid : supported
E:first- child , E:link , E:hover and other CSS2 and 3 pseudo - classes selectors are supported ( except the ones that takes an argument
E[ foo ] , E[ foo=value ] , E[ foo|=value ] , E[ foo~=value ] , E[ foo^=value ] , E[ foo$=value ] , E[ foo*=value ] : supported
Other selectors are not supported , but can be used with the CSS function :
.page CSS ( " h1.nth - child ( 2 ) " ) { color : red }
It 's sometimes useful to use non-standard CSS properties , in particular for various IE - specific things .
HSS adds a specific command for doing that .
Here 's a small example how it can be used :
.image { my - special - property : CSS ( " some specific value " ) ; }
In that case , this will simply output the property in the CSS file without checking that it 's defined in the CSS standard or that the value is correct .
It is possible to perform some operations between values :
var scale = 3 ; .big { width : 50 px + 20 px ; height : 30 px * $ scale ; color : # FF0000 * 0.7 ; }
Operations between two different units ( for instance 50 px + 3em ) are not allowed .
Some hacks has been added to support new CSS properties on most recent browsers .
opacity : will also generate the corresponding IE filter alpha
: will also generate the corresponding IE filter alpha border - radius ( and border - top - left - radius , etc ) : will also generate - moz - border - radius and - webkit - border - radius for Firefox and Chrome / Safari support
( and , etc ) : will also generate and for Firefox and Chrome / Safari support box - shadow : will also generate both - moz - box - shadow and - webkit - box - shadow for Firefor and Chrome / Safari support
: will also generate both and for Firefor and Chrome / Safari support text - shadow : supported by HSS , but does n't show anything on IE6 -
8
: supported by HSS , but does n't show anything on IE6 - 8 display : inline - block : will add a IE fix to get correct support
: will add a IE fix to get correct support color : rgba( r , g , b, a ) : will add a solid color default value for browsers which do n't support rgba
: will add a solid color default value for browsers which do n't support background - color : rgba( r , g , b, a ) : will add a solid color default value for browsers which do n't support rgba , and also add some IE6 - 8 hacks that correctly display the transparent background color .
The only drawback is that the block background image will display below the background color .
: will add a solid color default value for browsers which do n't support , and also add some IE6 - 8 hacks that correctly display the transparent background color .
The only drawback is that the block background image will display below the background color .
hss - width and hss - height : will generate width and height from which will be subtracted the padding and border values declared in the current block .
and : will generate and from which will be subtracted the padding and border values declared in the current block .
background : linear - gradient ( #color1 , #color2 ) : will add support for all browsers , including IE6 - 8 New in 1.4
: will add support for all browsers , including IE6 - 8 You can also add @include ( ' some css string ) '' either at the top level or instead of an attribute , this will include raw CSS string in the output , prefixed with the hierarchy classes if any New in 1.4

You can contact me if you have some question about it .
The classical view of a black hole is that it is an object so massive that nothing , not even light , can escape its pull .
In 1974 , Stephen Hawking put forth his idea that black holes are not technically black — they emit radiation and evaporate over time .
Hawking radiation was assumed to be described by ideal black body radiation , and this assumption allowed for the derivation of the temperature and entropy of a black hole .
But we do n't actually know how black a black hole is or , in more scientific terms , what are the bounds of the effects of greybody terms in a black hole 's radiation spectrum ?
In a paper set to be published in an upcoming edition of Physical Review Letters a pair of New Zealand mathematicians , Petarpa Boonserm and Matt Viser , attempt to put realistic bounds on the magnitude of these greybody terms .
Previous attempts to solve this problem , according to the authors , have used " various approximations that move one away from the physically most important regions of parameter space . "
Basically , that means , in the authors ' view , that past efforts have relied on assumptions that have moved the solutions away from important real world cases .
The duo attempt to rigorously solve for bounds on the transmission probabilities for waves moving through the region of space outside of a Schwarzschild black hole — Schwarzschild black holes are the simplest type , one that is described as a spherically symmetric body with no charge or angular momentum .
The pair derived upper and lower bounds for various cases and came up with closed - form analytical expressions that are functions of the radiation frequency and mass of the black hole alone .
An important point to note here is that the work was n't an attempt to get an ultimate answer regarding black holes ; rather , the pair attempt to use assumptions that do n't make the work easy , but rather those that keep the results closer to reality .
This put a direct answer out of reach , but did allow them to identify limits to how large or small these effects should be .
An interesting side effect of the resulting greybody terms in the radiation spectrum is that certain objects will " bounce " off a black hole .
As is typical in the physical world , this oddity , which goes against common sense , is confined to the quantum world .
If you throw your iPod into a black hole , it 's gone for good .
However , if you have a quantum object with the appropriate energy , it can have a non -zero probability of bouncing off due to these greybody terms .
High energy quantum objects will have a near zero bounce but this work suggests that , at low energies , the bounce has the potential to be quite large .
Yet another phenomenon to add to the long list of oddities that exist in the quantum world .

In a post this morning , Andrew Sullivan notes the latest move of the religious right : globalized theoconcervativism — an Islamic - Christian alliance to bring " traditional morality " to the world .
It 's worth considering exactly what that means .
What , exactly , is the difference between " traditional morality " , as the phrase is used in these contexts , and what some conservatives call " liberal morality " ?
Here are a few :
( My atheist friends will have to forgive some religious language , which I 've used both for historic purposes and for clearer communication with my religious friends . )
" Traditional " Morality " Liberal " Morality Underlying Political Model : Kings and Kingdoms Democracy and Republics The nation is the King .
The nation is the people .
The people , as part of the nation , are mere extensions of the King .
The government , the form of the nation , is a mere extension of the people .
Authoritarian Rule : choices are best made from the top .
Freedom and Responsibility : choices are best made by individuals .
Laws and force are for making sure individuals do what the King 's wants .
Laws and force are for ensuring liberty and protecting individuals .
The people serve the King .
Government serves the people .
Underlying Religious Model : God =
The King and
The King = God( The King 's exerts God 's authority , and acts as God 's representative . )
God , or the Holy , is everywhere , and in everyone .
God is understood as a King , the world as his kingdom .
We are all holy , in our ordinariness , all images of God , temples of the Holy Spirit , children of the Universe .
Whoever is in charge ( whoever has the most power at the moment ) effectively gets to be God , since they decide what God wants , and enforce it , on God 's behalf .
No one person or group ( even whoever has the most power at the moment ) has the right to decide what is right for others , or to enforce it on God 's behalf .
Underlying Model of Humanity : Average people are untrustworthy , incompetent , or evil .
Average people are reasonably trustworthy , competent , and good .
They cannot generally be trusted to know or do what is best for themselves or others .
We can generally be trusted to know and do what is best for ourselves , and others .
Those who subscribe to the " traditional " view also sell themselves ( and anyone who will listen ) a series of myths :
If people do n't accept " traditional " morality , they will run amok , doing all the things that " traditional " morality says they should n't .
Nonsense .
First , it is quite obvious that accepting " traditional " morality does n't begin to protect people from violating its statutes .
Beyond that , there are a great many people , myself included , who reject the " traditional " view and do not find themselves committing rape or murder , robbing banks , or even becoming unpleasant .
The truth is , the values that are used to sell the " traditional " viewpoint are values that are pretty common to human nature , and consequently to the " liberal " viewpoint as well .
Most of us find murder distasteful , because we do .
We do n't have to have someone enforce the idea upon us .
If we believe the traditionalists when they tell us that we have to accept traditional morality in order to disapprove of murder , the next step entails all sorts of unnecessary and weird beliefs : from what women must wear on their heads to whether dancing is wrong to racial and gender prejudice to war in the name of God .
But the worst one is that whoever is in charge at the moment gets to define right and wrong for everyone .
" Traditional " morality is a constant , basic set of " rights " and " wrongs " that never changes .
Only if you do n't look too closely .
All you have to do is open up your Bible to find all kinds of things " commanded by God " which any " traditional " moralist would consider either silly or wrong .
Those things were part of " traditional " morality at the time , but are n't now .
" Traditional " morality is the oldest morality .
False .
Rooted , as it is , in a model of kingship , " traditional " morality goes back no further than kings : about 12,000 years at most .
Before that humans lived for millions of years on this earth , presumably with some value structure , but not the one we now call " traditional " .
The " traditional " model is the only legitimate religious model .
False again .
I 'll confine my comments here to Christianity , since it 's the only religion I really know .
The New Testament , on the whole , is about a struggle against the traditional morality of that time and place .
The early church ( at first a small Jewish sect ) taught that Christians were free of the restraints of the Jewish law , as recorded in the Hebrew scriptures .
Jesus himself taught that judging others ( a fundamental part of " traditional " morality ) should be avoided , as should punishing others .
He stopped the stoning of the woman caught in adultery : a frontal attack on " traditional " morality .
Even when he seemed to be endorsing the traditional view , he undermined it by redefining it in a " liberal " fashion : Love God ... and your neighbor as yourself .
This is the Law and the Prophets .
And we can hardly forget St. Augustine 's moral advice : " Have love , and do as you like . "
The " traditional " model cannot claim the clear support , even of Christianity .
The " traditional " model is traditional .
It is n't traditional in the sense of going back to the beginning of human experience .
It is n't traditional in the sense of having the consistent backing of traditional religion .
It is n't traditional in the sense of being a consistent tradition .
It certainly is n't a model that reflects the traditional values of the United States .
In fact , the traditional model was originally designed to keep the subjects ( a polite word for slaves ) of a king in line .
It was never fit for a free , democratic , people .
We should be careful what we endorse , lest our children find themselves slaves again .

Tsunami in 2004 ' not the first '
By Jason Palmer
Science and Technology reporter , BBC News
Before and after photos show the sediment coverage after the 2004 tsunami
The Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 was not the first of its size to hit the region , according to new research .
Two international collaborations have sampled the sediments in Thailand and Sumatra to examine tsunami history .
At both sites , there was evidence of sediment laid down by a large tsunami between 600 and 700 years ago , pre-dating written and oral records .
The findings , reported in Nature , could be used to put statistical weight behind estimates of future tsunami .
The surge of a tsunami brings with it a great deal of sediment that rushes inland ; the bigger the tsunami , the deeper and further inland the layer of sediment it leaves behind .
In locations where those deposits are n't disturbed by wind or running water , they can be used as a historical record of these powerful events after more layers are added .
How tsunami happen
The study of these layers in coastal regions has revealed instances of tsunami elsewhere in the world , including a prehistoric event that inundated the Shetland and Orkney islands off Scotland .
To investigate the tsunami record in the Indian Ocean basin , two research groups took core samples that capture the layers of sediment below the surface .
One group , led by Kruawun Jankaew of Chulalongkorn University in Thailand , sampled 150 sites on Phra Thong , a barrier island off the west coast of Thailand .
Another group headed up by Katrin Monecke , now at the University of Pittsburgh , sampled 100 sites in the Aceh region in the north of Sumatra .
In both locations , a deep sandy layer was found beneath the surface , matching the top layer of sand left from the 2004 tsunami .
By using radiocarbon dating to estimate the age of the buried sand layer , both teams found that they came from 600 - 700 years ago .
Dr Monecke 's team also found evidence of a deeper sandy layer , with a corresponding age of about 1,200 years , suggesting a " recurrence time " for large tsunami of around 600 years .
Those buried layers occurred as far inland as those on the surface , suggesting that the tsunami that deposited them centuries ago was of roughly the same size as the 2004 event .
The team in Thailand found some suggestion of the 1,200 year - old layer and more substantial evidence for layers corresponding to around 2,000 years ago .
Timely results
Though the earthquakes that drive tsunami do n't happen predictably , the results , reported in the journal Nature , suggest that another tsunami of that scale will not occur in the near future .
Roger Musson of the British Geological Survey says that the findings are " not only interesting but useful because from a point of view of understanding the hazard .
It 's important to know what the recurrence time is . "
The samples showed a number of sandy deposits correlated to tsunami " Geological data is increasingly being used to back up forecasts of how likely there is to be large earthquakes in the future . "
From Dr Monecke 's point of view , that kind of information can serve as a basis for tsunami education in the region .
That , she says , could contribute to policy decisions in the near term .
" For coastal planners I think it 's very important to know this , " Dr Monecke told BBC News .
" We saw that whole villages were being relocated 10 km [ 6 miles ] inland , and these people are mainly fishermen .
" You have to balance this ; would it be better to be that far away so that if in a few generations , another tsunami hits , and they are that far away , or would it be better to stay at the coastline and be prepared for it ? "

A view of the toilet compartment in the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The masterbathroom for three astronauts aboard the International Space Station is on the fritzagain just days before a trio of new spaceflyers are due to launch toward theorbiting lab , NASA officials said Friday .
A temporarytelemetry glitch also sent the space station into a so - called survival mode earlierthis morning , changing the outpost ?s attitude and leading to system power downsfor several hours .
That issue was quickly tracked to an electronics box aboardthe station , but the balky space toilet in the Russian Zvezda service modulecontinues to plague astronauts and flight controllers .
? It failedlate yesterday , ?
NASA spokesperson John Ira Petty said of the Russian - builtspace commode in televised commentary from Mission Control in Houston .
? Russian specialists aretroubleshooting .
The problem appears to be a [ gas ] separator issue .?
It ?s afamiliar problem for space station commander Sergei Volkov and flightengineers Oleg Kononenko and Greg Chamitoff .
A similar glitch knocked the spacetoilet out of commission in June , leading Russian engineers to rush a spare gas - liquidseparator assembly pump to NASA ?s Kennedy Space Center spaceport in Florida , whereit was packed aboard the shuttle Discovery and launched to the orbiting laboratory .
Volkov and Kononenko resuscitated the ailing space toilet during Discovery ?s STS - 124 mission , which alsodelivered the massive Japanese Kibo laboratory and ferried Chamitoff to join the Expedition 17 crew .
The spacestation ?s Russian toilet uses fans and airflow in place of gravity to collectsolid and liquid waste for disposal .
The gas - liquid separator is part of theliquid waste system .
It weighs about 35 pounds ( 16 kg ) and is about 1.5 feet ( about half ameter ) long and 8 inches ( 20 cm ) wide and tall .
It is unclearwhether there is a spare that could be added to Sunday ?s planned Soyuz TMA - 13 launch , which will ferry spacetourist Richard Garriott and two new station astronauts to the orbitinglaboratory for a crew swap .
?
In themeantime , the crew has been instructed to use the toilet in the Soyuz [ TMA - 12 ] spacecraft , ?
Petty said .
NASA has paid $ 19 million for a secondRussian - built space toilet , which will be delivered alongside other life support , exercise equipment and sleeping quarters during a November shuttle mission .
Havingtwo working main toilets is vital for the space station , which is expected todouble its crew size to six astronauts next year .
Meanwhile , Petty said flight engineers in Russian and NASA ?s Johnson Space Center Mission Controlin Houston were still working at recovering systems from this morning ?
stelemetry glitch .
While the malfunction was swiftly tracked to an electronicsbox , backing out of the power down process is a lengthy affair , he added .
? The backout so far has been accomplished without any damage or long term impacts tostation systems , ?
Petty said .
The station ?s new Expedition 18 crew is set to launch into space on Sunday , Oct. 12 at 3:01 a.m. EDT ( 0701 GMT ) .
NASA will broadcast the launch live viaNASA TV .

15 Tips for Writing Effective Email
Photo by Lucia Holm
Have you ever needed to email someone – a stranger , asking them for a favor ?
How can one compose email such that they will be read and responded to ?
How do we effectively email someone who gets a lot of email ?
Whether personal or business , the ability to compose efficient and effective email is super useful – both in terms of productivity and responsiveness .
We ’re all busy , and we ’ve all received long , ambiguous and rambling email .
Ironically , most of us have also been guilty of writing such verbose email while requesting for someone else ’s time .
Now that I ’ve had a little taste , on the receiving end of such email , it quickly became obvious which kind of email works and which do not .
I have made some interesting and useful observations on effective email – particularly ,
What not to do when emailing someone ( ie. a stranger ) .
How to write email that people will actually ( want to ) read .
The point of this article is to share tips on how to approach people via email in the most efficient way possible , along with some common pitfalls on why some emails do not work .
Assumptions
Before we dive in , let ’s lay out some assumptions :
The recipient ( person you are emailing ) potentially gets a lot of email
You need something from the recipient and plan on pitching it via email
You either do not know the recipient , or she is an acquaintance , or she is a close friend and you ’re asking for an unusual request .
Our goal is to construct email that :
Will actually be read
Will actually be understood
Will not annoy the receiver
Does not take up too much time on the receiver ’s end .
Email Psychology
Generally speaking , the sender and receiver see things from drastically different points of views .
And from the perspective of a sender , we often do not spend time understanding who the receiver is and what their inbox might look like .
Let ’s have a quick glance at both sides :
Observing the Receiver
Gets a lot of email .
May receive compliments regularly , if they are a public figure .
Regularly gets asked a standard set of questions and favors .
Does not have a lot of free time .
Does not mind helping you , if it is fast .
Observing the Sender
Spends a long time crafting the ‘ perfect ’ ( - ly long ) email .
Believes that their request is original , unique , and special .
Believes that they are the first to ask for such favors .
Cannot imagine why anyone would turn them away .
Desires to tell the whole story , explained from every angle , so that the listener can understand their point of view .
With such divergent perspectives , it ’s no wonder receivers receive the kinds of email that they do , and that senders are wondering why their emails is n’t effective or eagerly responded to .
Now , putting ourselves in the perspective of a receiver ( and we ’ve all been there ) .
When we are faced with going through an inbox full of email – coming back from a vacation for example , we have some natural habits that are worth noting :
We tend to answer , or be drawn to email that are the fastest to answer or process .
That means email that require very little work or thought .
When we open an email that ’s very long , our gut reaction is to close the email , or come back to it later when we might have more time .
When we receive an email from someone wanting something from us , wanting us to buy something , or wanting our time , we instantly feel guarded and will automatically want to say no , even if the offer will benefit us in reality .
We go through email while asking “ what ’s the point ? ”
We go through email that is pitching something while asking “ why should I care ? ”
15 Tips for Composing Clear , Concise & Responsive Emails
1. Determine Your Desired Outcome
Most people know roughly what they want , but do not take the time to clearly think it through .
This is how we end up with ambiguous or rambling email .
Without a clear understanding of our desired end results , our thoughts are disorganized and we can easily confuse the receiver .
There are 4 types of email :
Self Fulfilling Email –
The email itself is the point .
You want to tell the receiver something , either a compliment or information .
No reply is necessary .
Inquiries –
You need something from the receiver in the form of a reply .
For example , advice , or questions answered .
The reply is your desired outcome .
Open -Ended Dialog – to keep communication lines open , for the purpose of some future result or benefit .
Action Emails –
The goal is not the reply , but some action on the part of the receiver .
For example , a sales pitch , or asking for a website link exchange .
Which type of email are you sending ?
What is your desired outcome ?
The clearer your intention , the more focused you will be , the better you can cater email for the intended result , the more likely you will get your desired outcome .
2. Quickly Answers , “ What ’s the Point ? ”
People want to know “ what do you need from me ? ”
Answer this question quickly .
Skip long introductions , backgrounds , compliments and details .
Jump to the point .
State it clearly using minimal words .
If action is needed , make it clear what the desired action is from the recipient .
And if no action or reply is expected , say that !
“ No reply necessary . ”
It ’ll be like music to their ears .
3. State Benefits Clearly
If a pitch is presented , make sure it includes many clearly stated , easily understood benefits for the receiver .
Too many pitchy emails focus solely on the sender and why the action will benefit the sender .
If you do n’t present incentives , or they are difficult to understand , the receiver will say no – resulting in a waste of time for both .
Also , make sure the incentives are realistic , the exchange is fair , and there truly are benefits to the receiver .
Do your homework before contacting someone .
Put yourself in their shoes , “ Would you act on the offer ? ”
Example , emailing a high profile website like lifehacker for a link exchange is not a fair exchange .
It ’s called spam .
If they do n’t display links to other sites , likely they wo n’t display yours .
4. Remember to KISS
KISS = Keep it simple , stupid ( I did n’t come up with this )
When we send out a long email asking for something from the receiver ( time , favor , etc ) , we are essentially saying “ I do not respect your time . ”
Show them you appreciate their time , by making email short , and simple to answer .
Using as few words as possible , introduce who you are , context if necessary , and why you are emailing .
Being brief does n’t mean we have to be boring .
We can be creative with our wording , add a dash of personality where you see fit , but still be brief .
5. Save the Whole Story – Stick to the Facts .
People tend to say too much in email .
We feel compelled to describe all the details and disclose the whole of our existence so that the receiver can understand the whole picture .
Truth is , unless you already know this person well , they really do n’t care .
Unless asked , you do n’t need to overly elaborate anything .
Simply stick to the facts – it ’ll help you keep your message short .
6. Pretend Face - to - face Intro
If you just met someone new at a party , would you open your mouth first and give them a rambling story about your life ?
Probably not .
Typically , we close our mouth after a quick intro .
In email , stopping talking is equivalent to hitting the send button .
Treating email introductions as if you are meeting them in person is another trick to keeping messages short .
7. Text Message Trick
When we are on mobile devices like the blackberry or our cell phones , we lack the fluidity of the computer keyboard , and as such , we get to the point really fast .
Now , pretend you ’re on a mobile device , what would your message be now ?
8. Avoid Excessive Compliments
Some people have the idea that the more compliments they throw out , the more likely the receiver will comply with their offer / need / pitch .
There is a difference between being genuine and saying what ’s on your heart , and going out of your way to compliment someone .
We humans are exceptional at detecting unauthentic phrasings and remarks – even in email .
Compliment only if you really mean it .
And remember to be brief if you need action from the receiver .
9. Be Personal and Personable
Personalize email with relevant remarks to the receiver , put in a quick comment about their site , product or work .
Address the person by name , sign email with your own name , and a friendly comment like “ Enjoy your weekend ! ”
10 . Make it Easy to Be Found
In your signature , include appropriate URLs for your website , blog , portfolio or product .
Make sure the links are functional so they can read more about you in one - click .
11 . Use Simple English
When the writing is too formal or uses irrelevant technical lingo , it is difficult for laymen to understand .
Plus , you come off sounding like a legal document or spammer .
Neither is good .
Write like you talk , using conversational English .
Be authentic and realistic .
Trying to sound professional will come off as if you are trying to sound professional .
Use your real voice – it ’s more endearing and approachable .
12 . Font Matters
There is nothing worse than opening an email and become blinded by the brightness elicited by all the words displaying in bold .
It makes me want to instantly close the email for the sake of protecting my eyes .
Alternatively , fonts that are too small , too large , or otherwise hard to read ( ie. 8 point , times roman font , all bold . ) makes us not want to read the email as well .
Beware of your fonts in your ‘ presentation ’ .
Do not bold the entire email , use easy to read fonts ( ie. Arial ) , and use a standard size .
Do not use extravagant colors since they do n’t work well on all monitors and can be hard to read .
13 . Formatting Matters
Make emails easy to read and quick to scan by using bullet points , numbered lists , and keeping paragraphs short .
Highlight keywords ( bold or italic ) for emphasis , without overdoing it .
14 . Minimize Questions
Ask questions that matter , and limit the number of questions and favors you ask in an email ( one or two max ) .
The more questions ( especially open - ended ones ) asked in one sitting , the less likely you are to get a response , and the less likely all your questions will be answered .
Also , ask specific questions instead of a general open - ended ones .
Be reasonable and thoughtful when asking .
Do n’t expect the recipient to solve all our life problems .
For example , “ How can I get rich quick ?
How can I become successful ? ” are too broad .
Break them down into specifics and ask the one question that really matters .
You can send additional questions in separate emails .
Key is in keeping the line of communication open by not overwhelming the receiver .
15 . Trimming of Words
Like grooming a garden , read through the finished email and trim out words , sentences , and paragraphs that do not contribute towards your desired result .
Check for potential ambiguities and unclear thinking .
Can you rephrase sentences for clarity using fewer words ?
Check for excess commentary that does n’t add to the email ’s main point .
Remove extra details disclosed , unnecessarily .
Case Study :
This morning , I received this little gem in my inbox ( bold and everything ) :
Subject : We Are Looking For Offers For Our Database
My first instinctive reaction was “ What the * bleep * ? ” I actually stopped reading the moment the email flashed open , because my eyes hurt from the brightness of the bold fonts .
My follow up questions were :
What do you need from me ?
What the heck are you selling ?
Why should I care ?
After reading it about five times , I ’m still left confused as to what they do , or what action items I can take – aside from giving up my phone number ( which I would never do ) .
Reviewing our 15 tips above , a more effective email might be :
Subject : Opportunity for Free Traffic Hi Tina , I ’m writing on behalf of < web-url > .
We make it easy for bloggers to network with one another .

For a 13 - month stretch starting in March 2005 , three environmentalists working for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network were listed in a Maryland State Police data base as being “ suspected of involvement in terrorism . ”
The description went on to note that the police had “ no evidence whatsoever of any involvement in violent crime , ” and the listing , and possible tracking , did not continue .
But the activists — not surprisingly — were not happy to hear about this when they received letters from the state police earlier this month informing them of the situation .
[ UPDATE : 3:30 p.m. :
The climate group has been involved in civil disobedience , both before and since the law enforcement listing .
But my guess is it would be hard to characterize such incidents as anything remotely resembling terrorism . ]
The American Civil Liberties Union is investigating the investigations .
On his blog , Mike Tidwell , the founder of the Chesapeake - area climate group and author of Bayou Farewell , decried the situation , saying his work hardly amounts to terrorism : “ Since 2001 , I have devoted my life entirely to the peaceful promotion of windmills and solar panels to solve global warming .
Apparently not everyone liked my work , however . ”
Josh Tulkin , who just moved to the Energy Action Coalition after working for the Chesapeake group for several years , also received a letter , along with a third person at the organization who does not want to discuss the incident .
I met Mr. Tulkin during the stretch when he was on the “ terrorist ” list , at the 2005 climate - treaty talks in Montreal .
To all appearances , he was a sincere and passionate member of a contingent of hundreds of young people sifting among delegates to press the idea that today ’s “ fossils , ” the generation running countries and companies now , were hijacking their climate .
The closest thing to civil disobedience that I saw was a cluster of youth activists camped out in a cavernous hallway singing a repurposed Beatles tune : “ All we are saying , is give youth a chance . ”
Mr. Tulkin sent me a note overnight with his reaction and also just posted a commentary on YouTube :
Here ’s the email he sent :
My name is Josh Tulkin .
I am currently the Field Director of the Energy Action Coalition and Power Vote .
And I am a suspected terrorist .
On October 21st , I received a letter from the Superintendent of the Maryland State Police .
The letter informed me that from March of 2005 to May of 2006 , I was under surveillance under suspicion of terrorist activities .
The letter further explains that the program is no longer under operation , and that I am among a list of people whom they have “ no evidence whatsoever of any involvement in violent crime . ”
The letter goes on to explain that I have the option of viewing my record once , without a camera or lawyer present , before it is purged permanently .
So what was I up to ?
During this time , i worked as Deputy Director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network .
I helped pass the Maryland Healthy Air Act , which is reducing dangerous pollution from Maryland ’s coal - fired power plants .
I served as a youth delegate to the United Nations .
I organized a coalition of faith leaders , students , nurses , doctors , and every day citizens to clean up Maryland ’s air and protect her shores from sea level rise and global warming .
I have never been arrested .
I have no police record .
I am standing with the A.C.L.U. of Maryland to defend my rights .
I deserve to know why I was being monitored and what is in my file .
And we need legislation passed so that this type of infringement of privacy will not happen again .
But I wo n’t be intimidated .
Like so many young people , I understand that global warming will have severe impacts on my future , and we are working together to address this problem .
I am proud of the action of my peers , and we should be supported , not suspected .
This gives us all more cause to defend our rights and our future by voting this November 4th for candidates that will help fight global warming and will honor the importance of civic engagement , rather than fear it .
There ’s more background on the case in this Washington Post item that I just found .
We 're not the only ones ....
A lot of these photos are not my own - thank you to everyone
BlackBerry fans who 've been yearning for a touch - based handset à la iPhone now have one , but the BlackBerry Storm - - which Verizon Wireless plans to start selling Friday for $ 250 with a two - year contract -- might not be the smart phone of their dreams .
The decision by Research in Motion to differentiate the Storm by giving its capacitive touch screen a mechanical component ( the entire screen functions as a button for confirming selections or initiating actions ) turns out to be more confusing than helpful .
Ultimately , the Storm 's touch interface feels like a failed experiment .
It 's too bad , because the Storm has some nice features and makes a great first impression .
Encased in shiny black with silvery accents on the front and a removable matte metal cover in the back , the Storm is shorter , slightly narrower , and somewhat thicker than the iPhone - - not surprising since it packs support for Verizon Wireless 's fastest network ( EvDO Rev. A ) , for quad - band GSM / GPRS / EDGE , and for 2100 - MHz UMTS / HSPA networks , enabling overseas roaming on the fastest networks available .
The Storm also has a GPS receiver and Bluetooth , but no Wi-Fi .
A quartet of familiar BlackBerry hardware buttons sit below the 4.4 - inch display .
They are , from left to right , a Send button ( marked with a green phone icon ) , which brings up the phone menu and initiates calls or dispatches messages ; a Menu button ( with a BlackBerry icon ) to bring up contextual menus ; an Escape button ( with a return arrow ) to close menus or go back to the previous screen ; and an End / Power button ( with a red phone icon ) for ending calls , returning to the home screen , or turning the handset on or off .
The phone lock and mute controls on the upper left and right corners , respectively , though not discrete buttons , are clickable under the casing .
Hardware features on either side repeat those found on other recent BlackBerrys .
These include volume controls on the upper right ; a button for activating the 3.2 - megapixel camera and capturing snapshots on the center right ; a voice recording button on the upper left , and a mini-USB charging / syncing port on the lower left .
Above the volume controls is a port for a standard 3.5 mm headset ( the earbud headset bundled with the Storm was excellent , however , producing first - rate audio quality ) .
The Storm 's accelerometer lets you use it in landscape or portrait mode for most applications ( it orients the phone in portrait mode only , though ) .
My shipping test unit powered on with the same good - looking analog - style ( that is , with hour and minute hands ) clock seen on the BlackBerry Flip ( you can even use it as an alarm clock ) .
A Disappointing Touch
The touch - screen interface differentiates the Storm from its RIM brethren -- and there I was disappointed .
Here 's a video of the Storm in action .
Though RIM generally produces first - rate hardware ( especially the QWERTY keyboards that it pioneered on handhelds ) , I found the Storm awkward to use for everyday data entry tasks .
RIM 's stated intention in developing its Click - Through technology was to enable users to navigate with the touch screen and to make menu selections ( most of which appear in blue when highlighted ) with a fingertip ; depressing the screen would confirm a selection and initiate the selected action .
But in my tests , things sometimes did n't work out that way .
I 'd tap a menu item , for example , but then when I depressed the screen , the selection would somehow shift and a different item would execute .
At times it was difficult to figure out what action was required :
In setting up the free , downloadable AOL Instant Messaging application , I had difficulty selecting radio buttons to show that I had read and agreed to the user agreement , resulting in my having to scroll through the agreement several times to try again .
Scrolling was generally slow , too .
When looking through contacts , I had no way to get quickly to the general area of the alphabet I wanted to check ( a nice iPhone feature ) -- and then scroll quickly to the appropriate entry with a fingertip swipe .
Swiping moves you just a few entries in either direction , making it too time consuming to be practical with an address book the size of mine ( 1500 - plus entries ) .
Consequently I had to resort to typed searches to speed things up .
In the post Is Safer Always Better ?
I argued that modern Western Civilization , especially American civilization , has become obsessed with safety to the point of absurdity .
I think I now have definitive proof .
Johnson & Johnson has produced , for the benefit of single mothers and tort lawyers everywhere , a booklet on how to walk safely :
Apparently this was distributed to all J&J employees , perhaps in the hope that no one would sue for slipping on the immaculately maintained non-slip flooring .
Let ’s peruse , shall we ?
( click on any image for a bigger version )
Step 1 : Watch your step !
Humans are not naturally adept at level changes , because we evolved in the savanna , where it ’s flat .
Also , there are no stray power cords there .
Step 2 : Height can hurt .
As any mountain biker , knows , “ going down is more dangerous than going up . ”
This is why there are non-slip treads on mountains .
Step 3 : Health Helps !
This man is exercising his arms so that he may walk safer .
Also , you should not walk when you are stressed — after a bad day at work , it ’s best to call a friend to come pick you up in a wheelchair .
Step 4 : Do n’t Do It !
This one is really very reasonable , I think .
There really could be a crocodile hiding in the grass .
You know , in the savanna .
Step 4 again : Yes , there really are multiple pages on each one of these topics .
Likewise , the authors felt it was important to discuss jumping down versus across .
Sesame Street could n’t have said it better .
Step 5 : Wear the right shoes .
In particular , wearing shoes at all is recommended .
But I disagree — here ’s to all our barefoot heroes !
Step 6 : Hold on .
Do n’t ever carry something with more than one hand .
That ’s why we evolved with two : one to drag the zebra carcass , the other for the handrail .
Step 7 : Fix it .
It has long been known that the restroom needs to be closed with a “ Caution : Wet Floor ” sign until evaporation has made it safe to enter .
Further , OSHA has now taken an interest in hazards in other phases , and is recommending labels on all objects in the workplace , with the standardized wording of “ Caution : Solid Matter . ”
The booklet concludes with the discussion “ How Likely Are You To Fall ? ” on pages 38 and 39 .
Yes , that was 40 pages on how to walk .
Whenever I ’m feeling that the fall of Communism has the left the world with a shortage of absurdity , I like to imagine the production meetings for this book .
As an antidote , I present to you here a typical Southeast - Asian sidewalk , this one from Penang , Malaysia :
Note the many objects in the way of the sidewalk , which is bordered by huge gaping open sewers .
Huge gaping open unsigned sewers !
Nary a strip of caution tape in sight !
Further , I assure you that just offscreen there are cars and pedestrians dancing senselessly , and a lack of good footwear .
How do these people survive ?
Actually , I find walking down the street in developing countries somewhat difficult , so do n’t think I ’m advocating for the open sewers approach .
It ’s just that – well , there ’s got to be a balance here somewhere .
NYC Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade ( MTBOT ) has decided to fight the switch to hybrid taxi cabs by pursuing the ' safety ' angle .
They hired an automotive engineer to analyze the safety of the hybrid cars being transformed into taxi cabs and , based on his findings , have filed a lawsuit to halt the switchover .
The report questions how well the hybrid taxis would hold out in the 24/7 operating conditions they would face ( has he seen the test fleet results ??? ) and possibly more damaging , questions the alterations made to outfit the hybrids cars with partitions .
The report claims the inserted partitions , since they are not part of the original equipment are a safety hazard .
They may block " side - curtain airbags from deploying ; become easily dislodged in accidents ; restrict drivers from safely distancing themselves from front airbags ; and diminish backseat legroom ...
" While I question the reason why the MTBOT has brought the lawsuit forward , the question of safety hazards will need to be addressed .
The hybrid taxi fleet owners are motivated by the cost of the hybrid cars , and that 's understandable given how much more a hybrid taxi costs over the Crown Victoria .
But then again , it only takes 14 months for the cost difference to be made up
An earlier protest by fleet owners over the availability of enough hybrids was beaten back when NYC received assurances from car makers that enough would be put aside for their use .
Press Release follows : NEW YORK , Sept. 9 / PRNewswire / --
A new report by a well - known automotive engineer , who previously consulted for the City of New York and several major automakers , exposes the risks and dangers of riding in New York City 's hybrid yellow taxicabs .
The report is the result of several months of analysis and concludes that hybrid taxis are unsafe and incompatible with the rigorous demands of New York City taxicabs that operate 24 hours a day , 7 days a week .
Hybrids will start to replace the stretch Ford Crown Victoria , a purpose - built taxi , and other taxis on October 1 , 2008 if a City mandate requiring that all new taxis have a minimum city rating of 25 mpg is not halted .
Citing public endangerment , the city 's largest taxi advocacy group urged a federal court on Monday to intervene .
According to the report 's author , C. Bruce Gambardella , P.E. , " from an engineering standpoint , vehicles have to be designed for the duty cycle they are likely to encounter and cannot feature modifications that will compromise their safety systems . "
Hybrids strike out on both counts , over and over again in virtually every category analyzed in the 43 - page report .
The report concludes that hybrids are not designed to hold partitions , which are mandated by the Taxi and Limousine Commission ( " TLC " ) to prevent drivers from being assaulted , robbed or killed .
Partitions in hybrid taxis were found to compromise their safety systems by blocking side - curtain airbags from deploying ; become easily dislodged in accidents ; restrict drivers from safely distancing themselves from front airbags ; and diminish backseat legroom so severely -- as much as 10 inches less than in a stretch Ford Crown Victoria -- that even belted passengers will hit their faces on the hard unyielding surface of the partitions in an accident .
Mr. Gambardella took particular issue with the " L - shaped " partition , which features sharp edges , presents a dangerously confined driver space and places passengers at great risk for injury .
Mr. Gambardella , who is the first engineer in the country to analyze and compare safety in both hybrid and conventional taxicabs in New York City , argues that " due to the mandatory vehicle modifications , the TLC has , in effect , created its own vehicle design " and " as such , the TLC has an obligation to crash - test the modified vehicles or require that the automakers crash - test the vehicles as modified . "
He writes , " it is completely unknown whether these modified cars would pass federal crash tests . "
He also opined : " No automaker would put such an inadequately tested vehicle on the road , nor should the public or any federal regulatory agency stand for it .
" Furthermore , the report asserts that the TLC either failed to read , or blatantly ignored , explicit warnings in all hybrid vehicle owners ' manuals that expressly forbid modifications like partitions that could interfere with airbag deployment and other aspects of the safety systems .
The report cites more than 75 separate manufacturers ' warnings in 5 different hybrids authorized for taxi use by the TLC .
Mr. Gambardella calls the Crown Victoria the safest taxicab on the road .
He cites its 25 years of experience as a taxi ( 6 years as a stretch model ) and stresses that they are purpose - built for the police and taxi markets , anticipate partition installations and are built for heavy - duty 24/7 usage .
( Fleet taxis average 85,000 - 100,000 miles per year . )
In contrast , hybrids are designed for non-commercial , private use where the average driver clocks well under 20,000 miles per year .
Hybrid taxis have little experience as 24/7 taxis .
The Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade ( " MTBOT " ) , the fleet trade association that commissioned the report out of concern for passenger and driver safety , instructed its attorneys at Emery , Celli , Brinckerhoff and Abady LLP to send the report 's key findings to several hybrid automakers .
In a letter , the firm requests explicit automaker certification and supporting documentation demonstrating that hybrid taxis , outfitted with partitions , are safe for commercial taxi use in New York City .
The TLC was also provided with the letter and key findings .
MTBOT has received no responses to date .
Ron Sherman , President of MTBOT , stated , " The City 's dangerously aggressive hybrid taxi mandate presents a public danger to our 240 million annual passengers and tens of thousands of taxi drivers , as this report makes clear .
MTBOT has desperately tried to work with the TLC and the Bloomberg Administration on a taxi policy that improves the environment without compromising public safety , but to no avail .
We were left with no choice but to seek the court 's intervention to prevent the City from making a tragic mistake .
" On Monday , September 8 , 2008 , MTBOT and other parties concerned that passenger and driver safety was being compromised , filed a complaint in the United States District Court , Southern District of New York , urging an immediate halt to the mandate .
The lawsuit , which maintains that the City 's mandate will cause irreparable harm to taxi passengers and drivers , argues , that the City 's decision to mandate that all new taxis , as of October 1 , 2008 , have a city rating of 25 mpg or more is arbitrary and capricious because the City failed to follow its own long - standing procedures requiring safety testing and a pilot program prior to the mandate of new vehicles .
The lawsuit also argues that the City 's mandate is preempted by the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act as well as the federal Clean Air Act .
The suit asks for the October 1st mandate to be annulled .
Emery , Celli , Brinckerhoff and Abady , LLP represents the plaintiffs .
MTBOT and the report 's author C. Bruce Gambardella , P.E. plan to testify at the New York City Council Transportation Committee 's oversight hearing , " Green Taxis : Are They Safe " on Wednesday , September 10th at 1 pm in City Hall .
This is the Committee 's second oversight hearing .
The TLC refused to testify at the Council 's June 3 2008 hearing , leaving many safety questions unanswered .
MTBOT is the country 's largest taxi fleet association .
It represents 27 yellow medallion taxi fleets in New York City and over 3,500 medallion taxicabs - approximately 25 % of the taxi industry .
MTBOT members have operated more than 30 different vehicles over several decades including minivans , Compressed Natural Gas vehicles and hybrids .
MTBOT advocates on behalf of its members , its 14,000 drivers and the riding public .
C. Bruce Gambardella is a licensed Professional Engineer in New York , Michigan and Connecticut and has worked as an accident reconstruction expert full time since 1982 .
Clients have included the City of New York , Ford Motor Company , General Motors , NYC Transit Authority , the New York Attorney General 's Office and numerous major insurance companies and private attorneys .
He has inspected more than 3,000 vehicles and performed more than 1,300 detailed accident reconstructions .
Is one of Britain 's best - loved dialects heading for oblivion ?
This is the curious language of personalised number plates , a lingo in which " Hair do " is spelled H41 RD0 ( as purchased by celebrity hairstylist Nicky Clarke ) and BOT 70 M is a cheeky , if not particularly sophisticated , joke .
They might may us groan , but to many , flashy plates are highly covetable – as attested by the sums paid for the most desirable registrations , and the close approximation to a common first name can easily fetch six - figures .
To prevent things getting out of hand , the UK authorities have always insisted on a few guidelines .
Personalised numbers have to have to conform to the systems of prefixes and suffixes , operated since 1963 , that indicate the age of the car to which they were originally attached ; there are also rules on the spacing and style of characters , although these are often ignored .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But now Essex Tory MP James Duddridge wants to allow British motorists to express themselves more freely .
Last week , he proposed a bill designed to loosen regulations that currently govern the format of personalised number plates , addressing their increased popularity .
It used to be only a wealthy few who could customise their cars – Jimmy Tarbuck 's COM 1C and Paul Daniels 's MAG 1C are some of the best - known examples – but now , far more of us want to get in on the act .
The existing rules mean that the supply of the most in - demand words and phrases – in particular pre-1963 style plates which do not have an age - related component – cannot be increased in order to meet demand , meaning that prices have been on a steep upward trend for decades .
Earlier this year , for example , F1 went for £ 440,625 , putting it beyond the reach of all but lottery winners and hedge - fund managers .
The result has been that those who cannot afford the best plates have been forced to use a bit of ingenuity in order to get a close approximation of the word or words they really want .
These drivers rely on " platespeak " , as it is known in the business , to compose their unique signage – substituting a " 5 " for an " S " , for example , an " A " for a " 4 " , and so on .
Duddridge objects to this .
He wants to know why one of his constituents , wanting to advertise their home town on a number plate , should have to resort to an awkward piece of platespeak such as S44 FND ( SARFEND ) rather than simply being allowed to buy a plate that reads SOUTHEND .
Under his scheme , he would be able to buy JAMES , rather than having to settle for J4 MES , or apply for a new plate , JPD , instead of having to bid for the prohibitively expensive pre-1963 JPD1 .
If Duddridge gets his way , we 'd miss out on deciphering platespeak .
But another concern with his plan is that it might undermine the prices of existing plates and the trade in them ; could the value of J4 MES really be left unaffected by the release of the previously unavailable JAMES ?
Rick Cadger of regtransfers.co.uk , one of the leading companies in the secondary sale of plates , thinks that this might be less of an issue than it at first appears – there are after all , hundreds of potential buyers for the word James and , in any case , under the Duddridge proposals , the DVLA would continue to control the release of plates in order to support values .
Cadger thinks that objections to the proposals are less likely to come from the trade than , for example , the police , whose work might be made more difficult if there were large numbers of cars bearing similar numbers on the roads .
Among European nations , Britain is unique in its obsession with personalised number plates ; in Germany , if you buy a Mercedes , the dealer may discreetly exercise a bit of influence with the local registration office in order to secure you a plate incorporating your initials , but that 's about it .
For the Continentals , number plates are all about location , location , location ; in France , for example , a " 75 " suffix instantly associates a car with Paris , while in Germany , " M " shows that a German car is registered in Munich .
In 1994 , Italy dropped regional identifiers but , after protests , these had to be reintroduced in modified form in 1999 .
In Britain , by contrast , it is quite difficult to link a car or its driver to a location via the number plate – except , of course , if like James Duddridge , it comes from E55 EXX , in which case the platespeak is likely to give the game away .

The release of Safari 3.2 on November 13 displayed Apple ’s penchant for cryptic release notes , as the company describes all three versions as featuring “ protection from fraudulent phishing Web sites . ”
Let 's decode that for you : Safari 3.2 offers an entirely new anti-phishing feature , enabled by default in the “ Security ” pane of Safari ’s preferences .
When you try to visit a site that ’s “ known ” to try to attack you , Safari stops and warns you with a pseudo - dialog box ( in a Web page window or tab ) about it .
If the site is suspected of phishing for your personal or financial information , the text reads :
The website you are visiting has been reported as a “ phishing ” website .
These websites are designed to trick you into disclosing personal or financial information , usually by creating a copy of a legitimate website , such as a bank .
On the other hand , if the page you ’re visiting is a “ known ” distribution point for malware ( viruses , trojan horses , other programs that can control your computer ) , the text reads :
The website you are visiting appears to contain malware .
Malware is malicious software that may harm your computer or otherwise operate without your consent .
Your computer can be infected just by browsing to a site with malware , without any further action on your part .
We are unaware of any current method for an attacker to actually download and run code on your system by visiting a Web page “ without any further action on your part , ” but that ’s always the goal of attackers , so it seems sensible to err on the side of caution .
Nothing in Apple ’s ridiculously minimal release notes suggested that this feature existed .
But this time , the company ’s intransigence in telling you what it has changed in the software you use may have further consequences .
How Safari could “ know ” about these phishing and malware sites raises all kinds of interesting questions .
Now we can tell you with reasonable confidence how it all works — but because Apple has not done the same thing , we cannot say with certainty that it is completely private , or that Safari is not sending information about the pages you visit to a third party .
We believe that Safari 3.2 is not doing that , but only Apple can say so — and you get one guess about whether the company has bothered to do so or not .
Let ’s begin with how these sites are “ known . ”
The basic problem Phishing sites are designed to fool people into thinking they ’re the real thing , so your computer does n’t have much of a shot — on its own — of figuring out if a site that looks like eBay really is eBay .
Remember , the people who designed the Internet ( incorrectly ) assumed that all computers on the network would be trustworthy , so the rules are pretty loose .
There ’s no rule that says an eBay Web page URL ca n’t start with a raw IP address .
Even if eBay had a written policy that all of its URLs will be in an “ ebay.com ” domain name , your computer has no way of knowing that .
Google ’s computers , however , have a better shot at deciphering such attacks .
As the world ’s leading search engine , Google has figured out where eBay is , and knows that a single IP address in China is probably not one of eBay ’s servers .
Google knows what banks , credit card providers , insurance companies , and other firms people try to find , and it therefore has a reasonable idea that if their images show up in a page in the wrong part of the world , it may be bogus .
It also helps that Google has something like six umpteen - gazillion times the computing power of the entire Apollo space program .
You may have eight cores , but Google is still slightly ahead of you .
About three years ago , Google Labs released the first test version of Google Safe Browsing for Firefox , an attempt to take advantage of some of this accumulated knowledge .
The extension for the Firefox browser ( which had then recently seen its 1.5 release ) examined URLs as you visited them in Firefox , and warned you if any of them were on one of two lists that Google maintained : one for suspected phishing sites , and one for sites suspected of distributing malware .
Google and the Mozilla Foundation have long been partners , so it was no surprise when Firefox 2.0 included Google ’s “ Safe Browsing ” technology directly in the browser .
To no one ’s surprise , Chrome includes it as well .
We were surprised that Safari 3.2 includes the same technology , especially since Apple ’s minuscule release notes did not mention the word “ Google ” once .
But our investigation convinces us that Safari 3.2 ’s “ protection from fraudulent phishing websites ” is , in fact , Google ’s Safe Browsing technology .
How it works
Even if Google has a list of malicious sites , your browser can’t check in with Google every time you visit a new page .
On the technical side , it would be a drag on slow connections , and some decent percentage of the world still uses dial - up Internet access .
On the personal side , it ’s somewhat unconscionable to imagine that your Web browser would report every page you visit to a central authority , whether it ’s one as well - known as Google or not .
The other alternative is for your browser to keep a list of malicious URLs itself , so it can compare each page you visit against the list .
Such a list would need periodic updates from Google because phishers and other purveyors of malware often use compromised computers for their attacks — one computer may only be “ good ” for attackers for a few hours .
But that poses its own problems — if network administrators know about some of these malicious URLs , then transmitting them over the network could trigger firewall problems .
On top of that , many of the URLs might have variants that also get you to the malicious page .
( You can typically append a useless parameter onto any static page and get the same results ; some phishers do that in their URLs to avoid simple detection . )
Google solves this problem by sending the browser a list of hashed ( encoded ) URLs known to be phishing sites or distributors of malware .
When you first launch Safari 3.2 , it connects to safebrowsing.clients.google.com and requests information on the two main blacklists that Google maintains : a list of known phishing sites , and a list of known malware sites .
Google returns the list of hashed URLs to your computer in chunks , starting with the freshest information first and gradually filling in older information .
The updates are in a compact format that avoids having to send the hashes over the network again , and the hashes are just prefixes of longer numbers to avoid sending huge amounts of data over the wire .
Hash prefixes are n’t hashes , so if you ’re visiting a page whose URL matches a hash prefix , Safari 3.2 goes back to Google and asks for the full hash for the prefix in question .
Google responds , and if the full hash matches the hash for the URL in question , Safari knows that this page is on Google ’s list of malicious sites .
Safari stores all of the data from Google using folder names that are difficult to decipher .
If you look in the folder at / private / var / folders / , you ’ll see one or more folders with two - letter names .
One of those that ’s not named “ zz ” will contain another folder with a much longer random name .
That folder contains a folder named “ - Caches - “ , and inside it , you ’ll find a folder named “ com.apple .
Safari ” .
The full path is / private / var / folders / xx/yy / - Caches-/com.apple .
Safari , where “ xx ” and “ yy ” are unique to your system .
Once you find that folder , you ’ll see two files within it : Cache.db and SafeBrowsing.db .
The former is indeed Safari ’s cache .
The latter file contains the blacklists from Google ’s Safe Browsing initiative — you ’ll notice that the file was most likely created right about the time you first launched Safari 3.2 , and if you have the browser open , the file should have been modified within the past 30 minutes .
( The November 24 issue of MWJ contains information on how you can look inside Safari ’s safe browsing database and what the information you ’ll find in it means . )
Google ’s rules do not allow clients like Safari or Firefox to warn you that a page may be malicious , even if its URL is on the list , unless the list has been updated within the past 30 minutes .
We ran a network spy on Safari 3.2 while visiting suspected phishing sites , and we saw it sending information to safebrowsing.clients.google.com just before displaying the “ Suspected Phishing Site ” warning .
When a site ’s URL matches the first part of a hash on the list , Safari 3.2 apparently asks Google for the full 256 - byte hash value for that URL alone , and then compares the two — the same method that Safe Browsing uses in Firefox .
Why we ’re telling you this
Networking must be transparent to earn your confidence .
That ’s the point behind EV SSL — verified authentication that the company you ’re talking to is who they say they are .
On a lower level , when you visit a page in your Web browser , you expect your computer to get the IP address from your DNS server , get the page from the Web server , and get all of the assets for the page ( images , movies , and so on ) from their locations as specified in the page ’s source .
You do not expect your browser to also tell Google , or even Apple itself , what you ’re doing .
Safari is not the first browser with this feature , though .
Although Safe Browsing is built into Firefox 2 and later , it was a Firefox extension before that , and later part of the Google Toolbar for Firefox as well .
The Google Toolbar Privacy Notice says that , in some circumstances , Safe Browsing collects additional information from users .
We know that Firefox itself does not , because the Mozilla Foundation spells out exactly what the browser ’s “ Phishing and Malware Protection ” send to Google , with links to both the Mozilla and Google privacy policies .
The Apple Customer Privacy Policy says nothing about Safari sending any information to places other than the Web sites you ’re visiting — but as of Safari 3.2 , it does exactly that : it fetches lots of information from Google , and sends ( non-identifiable ) requests back to Google when you encounter a page whose URL is on one of Google ’s blacklists .
( Update : A Macworld reader has found a reference to Google in the Safari licensing agreement .
See the MacJournals response in our comment thread for more information . )
We must point out here that this system provides , indirectly , a way for Google to estimate what pages you ’re visiting .
If the URL of a page you want to visit matches the hash prefix of a known malicious page , Safari 3.2 appears to send that prefix to Google and ask for the entire 256 - byte hash to make sure that this really is a malicious page ( and also to verify that the page has n’t been removed from Google ’s lists since Safari ’s last list update ) .
Millions and millions of URLs could produce hashes that start with the same 32 bits , but if Google gets several requests for the same value , the company could reasonably infer that people were visiting the malicious page it had tracked — and since the request from Safari to Google comes from your IP address , Google might infer data from that as well .
Mozilla ’s privacy policy would forbid use of that data except to improve the service , but Apple ’s privacy policy does not .
Neither Apple nor Google state anywhere that they would only use such data to improve the phishing and malware protection features .
We also note that the Safe Browsing v2.1 protocol mentions a third list beyond the list of phishing sites and the list of malware sites : a whitelist , “ representing sites that are known to be trusted . ”
The spec continues , “ Note that this list should only be used for ‘ enhanced mode ’ clients that do direct lookups to Google to determine which sites are phishy .
In that case , if a site is on the whitelist there is no need to send the query to Google . ”
Safari 3.2’s “ SafeBrowsing.db ” file does not appear to contain data for Google ’s whitelist , but the specification confirms that some clients can , with Google ’s permission , use an “ enhanced mode ” that looks up each page you visit rather than maintaining the list on the client computer .
This would be a serious change for Safari .
If it were implemented , users would need to be told about it and how it worked , so they could make informed and intelligent decisions about whether to use this feature or not .
The compulsion to hide
And yet , we cannot conclusively tell you that it ’s not implemented today , because Apple refuses to document its changes .
This time , it should come back to haunt Apple .
Even when phrased as friendly to Apple as we can manage , the fact remains that after installing Safari 3.2 , your computer is by default downloading lots of information from Google and sending information related to sites you visit back to Google — without telling you , without Apple disclosing the methods , and without any privacy statement from Apple .
Study Shows
It 's All In The Face
Forget a smokin ' bod , a high status job , a hefty bank account or killer style .
It seems the men that reel in the ladies are those with the greatest faces .
No , not a chiseled jawline , eyes to lose yourself in , or pearly white chops -- it 's " the dimesions of the region between the mouth and the eyebrows , " that determine sex appeal .
So says a recent study by palaeontologists at the British Natural History Museum , anyway .
Crazy , right ?
Apparently it all boils down to natural selection .
To give you a brief re-cap on your high school biology class , natural selection is the survival of the fittest , or , in this case , survival of the hottest .
That 's right , the better looking you are , the higher the probability that you 'll pass your genes down , ' cause baby , everyone is going to want to mate with you !
That 's as far as the concept has taken us in understanding human evolution so far , but now researchers have found a little something that we missed before .
" For at least the last two million years , the space between brow and upper lip in hominids has been , proportionately , shorter and wider in males than in females . "
Palaeontologist Eleanor Weston suggests that as we 've evolved , ladies have taken a stronger liking to men with smaller middle faces because it emphasized other features like thick brows , prominent cheekbones and defined jaws .
The more compact , the better .
Dr. Weston , get real !
Nothing can replace a hunky male with a sculpted body , dreamy eyes , a thick head of hair , a whack of ambition , a great sense of humour and killer charm !
At least she acknowledges that it 's only a hypothesis and she 's ready to face scrutiny .
If you like what the woman is suggesting , take a peek at her online journal , PLoS ONE .
Weston has made some pretty neat discoveries though -- one of her latest revealings is that Mrs.
Ples could actually be a Mr. Ples .
Yep , the famous 2.5 million year old Australopithecus africanus may have been the Brad Pitt , and not the Angelina , of their time .
Overseas students will need to have biometric identity cards
The fingerprinting of overseas students for biometric identity cards has begun for those extending their visas .
It is the first phase of tighter visa restrictions which will eventually affect more than 300,000 people applying to study in the UK each year .
The tougher rules are intended to prevent the abuse of student visas as a way of gaining entry to the UK .
However universities will be watching carefully for any impact on what has become a lucrative source of revenue .
Students already at UK universities will not have to be fingerprinted , unless their visas need to be renewed , but future applicants from outside the European Union will all need to have such biometric identity cards .
Confusion
There are universities and courses in which a majority of students are from overseas - with the higher fees becoming an increasingly important part of university income .
Sensitive to fears of deterring such valuable recruits , Universities UK has complained that there are only six fingerprinting centres around the UK which will have to be used by overseas students .
About one in seven students applying to university are from overseas - with concentrations in particular universities or courses .
The London School of Economics has 66 % of students from overseas , London Metropolitan has 25 % , Cambridge has 22 % and King 's College London has 19 % .
Daniel Sheldon of the London School of Economics ' student union said there was confusion among students about how the visa rules were to be introduced .
The students ' union is to debate the new regulations this week - and he says there will be concerns both about singling out overseas students and wider opposition to the principle of identity cards .
From next year , universities will also be expected to monitor whether students are really attending courses .
But Sally Hunt , head of the University and College Union , says staff do not want to enter the " spying game " .
The changing rules for overseas students are part of a " clamp down on bogus students " , announced by the Home Office , which will see colleges having to hold a licence from the UK Border Agency .
There have been widespread concerns that bogus colleges have been providing a means of falsely entering the country - allowing people to claim student visas without really studying for any qualifications .
Almost 300 bogus colleges have been uncovered in the past three years .
The Home Office expects 50,000 to 60,000 students to be affected in the first phase between now and March .
Last year , there were 313,000 applications for student visas - of which 217,000 were issued .
Existing students wo n't be affected unless they want to extend their visa .
From next March , overseas students will need to be sponsored by a college or university holding a licence from the UK Border Agency .
From next autumn , there will be a further tightening of the rules , in which universities and colleges will use a " sponsor management system " to inform the UK Border Agency if students are failing to attend courses .
Some of your comments :
As a student who was seriously thinking about going to the UK for university , I am simply appalled by this .
I believe this program will simply bring more trouble than it is worth onto individual universities while taking biometric information from people whom are most likely not trying to break the system .
The British government is punishing everyone in order to get to the minority .
Instead , they could do better research on the fake universities or use another less encroaching system than the one they plan on using .
Just as I do not hand my own biometric information to my own government in the United States , this ID card in Britain has permanently put me off studying there because I will not willingly hand over information such as that ; it is a violation of my privacy and being an overseas student is no reason for such a violation .
Nathan , Michigan , USA Nathan , whatever the rights and wrongs of this move ( and with an American girlfriend who came over here initially as a student , I sympathise with you ! ) - you should be aware of what the US government requires of all visiting foreigners before you get too upset ...
I hope you do still come despite this discouragement .
Matt , Oxford , UK I'm an American pursuing a PhD in the UK and scrambled to avoid getting this biometric card .
I find it repulsive that this government requires us to pay three times what a home student pays in fees , but insists on treating us like criminals .
Incidentally , the US may be wrong to collect biometric data on visitors , I agree - however , the US government seems to avoid the problems that the UK government can't avoid ; namely , losing vast amounts of sensitive data .
Gavin , Sheffield , UK I have seen too many overseas students abuse student visas as a way of gaining entry to the UK and strongly believe some changes need to be made especially for the security control .
Not too sure about how biometric ID card will contribute to that though !
Richard Chen , Manchester UK
This sends a clear message to foreign students .
The message is : " Do n't come to the UK , we will treat you like criminals " .
Graham , Dundee
There are also plans to bring in the first waves of biometric ID cards for foreign nationals getting married .
I plan to marry my American girlfriend next year and start our lives together here , which should be one of the happiest things we ever do in life - and now we 'll have to do so knowing that my future wife 's fingerprints and retinal scans will be held somewhere on a government database .
At what price freedom , at what price ' security ' ?
Lee Hyde , London , UK
As a current university student I found it embarassing enough that I had to report to a local police station to register .
My tuition fees alone are in excess of 10 k per annum , is it too much to the authorities to treat us with a little more respect and allow students to update their records on campus instead ?
Sebastian , Edinburgh
As a university administrator I am delighted at the tightening of the procedures .
I cannot see this being a deterrent to people committed to academic study .
It will restrict economic migrants masquerading as students , people gaining entry to the UK with acceptance letters never to be seen in class or the significant minority of overseas student to whom I am obliged to provide supportive paperwork to who are along for the ride only , using their status to work in a developed country .
I feel bad about providing papers for students I know are breaking their student visa privileges .
Now I will feel better , helping the genuine students from all over the world who honour us with their presence .
Anon University Admin Officer , Loughborough Good move .
There are lots of so called students in london area in these bogus colleges waiting to complete 10yrs to get a Permanent residence status .
All work illegally and do n't attend classes except to fill fake attendance sheets .
Stop them getting PR after 10yrs and the problem will go away on its own .
sam tom , aberystwyth I think this is grossly wrong .
I can't iamgine giving away my identity just because I want to go to school .
If I need to work and live here , what then will I have to give - my life ?
I see the governemnt over - stepping their bounds and making UK education a distant thing for foreign students .
The long - term impact will be felt by all and sundry .
I can assure the government that this will lead to a very drastic drop in the rating of UK education all around the world
Michael , Birmingham I just completed a Masters at Edinburgh University .
It was an amazing year and I 'm much richer for the experience , while the university is much richer for my overseas tuition .
I loved Scotland .
Thank goodness I was not required to supply fingerprints , etc. or I would never have come to the UK to study .
For now , I 've returned to the US , where we have the hopeful promise of Barack Obama 's administration to look forward to .
How interesting to find out that Bush 's policies of eroding civil liberties will live on in Great Britain .
Why not just call them " Patriot Cards " ?
Ben , Atlanta , Georgia , USA I am an International student from Saudi Arabia and I fully support this move .
I believe that every country has the right to protect its economey and to control immigration levels .
However , as my Visa will expire soon , I wonder if new visas can still be issued by mail under the old system or do new changes mean that from now on only premium service will be available ?
Grami , Newcastle
It 's already so hard for people from my country to get admission , then to get visas , and now they 've added to the long procedures by introducing this .
I do n't know how we are supposed to cope with all this on top of the unfavourable interest rate and rising tuition fees !
S , Pakistan
The bigger picture is that this is the first step towards introduction of biometric ID cards for everyone .
Foreign students are nothing other than a testing ground for the role out of this technology .
The Church has lost its control over the population and The State needs something new to keep us all in line .
Orwell was right he just got the date wrong by 30 years .
George Taylor , Edinburgh
The government 's obsession with ID cards is incomprehensible .
Numerous reports ( including one from the LSE ) have shown it is an insanely expensive scheme that will have none of the claimed benefits , penalising the innocent whilst the " guilty " ignore it .
I 'd rather they spent the billions of pounds they 're pouring down the sink into ID cards on something that might have a real effect on our society .
How about doing something more to reduce the number of children growing up under the poverty line , or providing more resources to hospitals , schools or police on the beat ?
A total waste of money , let alone a massive invasion of our privacy .

After seven years , startling new footage of the collapse of World Trade Center 1 ( North Tower ) and World Trade Center 7 have mysteriously surfaced on internet video sharing site Veoh .
Watch the video in the player below :
The footage was posted November 1 , 2008 by " GldBr " a user who signed up the same day the new footage was posted and has no other videos on the account .
The videos contain no soundtrack but show clear views of both the WTC1 and WTC7 collapses , apparently from the roof of a nearby building .
It is unclear at this time who shot the footage or why it is just making its first appearance on the Internet at this time .
The new footage of the WTC7 collapse starts with an extreme close - up and zooms out just before the collapse .
The image zooms out again to show the pyroclastic flows of dust from the demolition engulfing the streets below .
Just as the building begins to collapse , a series of explosions can be seen shattering a line of windows along the side of the building on the right side of the frame , consistent with blast squibs .
The unreleased footage of the North Tower collapse starts with an extreme close - up of the building showing a squib well below the area of collapse before jump - cutting to a zoomed - out view of the building as the collapse is already taking place .
It is not evident whether these two shots are from the same camera or why they were edited together in this way .
The collapse footage shows red - hot areas within the still standing " spire " of core columns not toppled in the collapse and then pans down for a moment .
When the camera pans back up , the spire is gone .
The Corbett Report will continue to follow this story as more information becomes available .

Two biologists at the University of California , San Diego have discovered the first of a new class of cellular motor proteins that “ rewind ” sections of the double - stranded DNA molecule that become unwound , like the tangled ribbons from a cassette tape , in “ bubbles ” that prevent critical genes from being expressed .
“ When your DNA gets stuck in the unwound position , your cells are in big trouble , and in humans , that ultimately leads to death ” said Jim Kadonaga , a professor of biology at UCSD who headed the study .
“ What we discovered is the enzyme that fixes this problem . ”
The discovery represents the first time scientists have identified a motor protein specifically designed to prevent the accumulation of bubbles of unwound DNA , which occurs when DNA strands become improperly unwound in certain locations along the molecule .
The UCSD researchers ’ findings , detailed in the October 31 issue of Science , are also important because they provide biomedical scientists with a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to a rare genetic disorder called Schimke immuno - osseous dysplasia .
The discovery will eventually allow medical researchers to design future treatments for this devastating genetic disorder , which causes strokes , congestive heart failure , kidney failure and death in young children .
“ We knew this particular protein caused this disease before we started the study , ” said Kadonaga .
“ That ’s why we investigated it .
We just did n’t know what it did . ”
What this protein , called HARP for HepA - related protein , did astounded Kadonaga and Timur Yusufzai , a postdoctoral fellow working in his laboratory .
The two molecular biologists initially discovered that this motor protein burns energy in the same way as enzymes called helicases and , like helicases , attached to the dividing sections of DNA .
But while helicases use their energy to separate two annealed nucleic acid strands — such as two strands of DNA , two strands of RNA or the strands of a RNA - DNA hybrid — the scientists found to their surprise that this protein did the opposite ; that is , it rewinds sections of defective DNA and thus seals the two strands together again .

As a consequence , the UCSD biologists termed their new enzyme activity an “ annealing helicase . ”
“ We did n’t even consider the idea of annealing helicases before this study started , ” said Kadonaga .
“ It did n’t occur to us that such enzymes even existed .
In fact , we never knew until now what happened to DNA when it got stuck in the unwound position . ”
Now scientists who study the action of helicases on DNA and RNA have an entirely new class of proteins to investigate .
“ This will open up a whole new area of study , ” said Kadonaga .
“ There are very few enzymes known that alter DNA structure .
And we ’ve discovered an entirely new one .
This was not expected to happen in the year 2008 .
We should have found them all by now . ”
“ I believe it ’s going to go beyond DNA .
Just as there are DNA - DNA helicases , there are RNA - DNA helicases and RNA - RNA helicases .
So it does n’t take a lot of imagination to foresee that there are probably going to be RNA - DNA annealing helicases and RNA - RNA annealing helicases .
The field potentially can be fairly large .
And as more and more people discover additional annealing helicases , this field will expand . ”
Kadonaga and Yusufzai are already searching for more annealing helicases , but they also plan to continue their studies of HARP .
“ First , what we want to do is find more of these proteins , so we ’re looking for more right now , ” said Kadonaga .
“ We also want to see what other specific processes are affected by this particular protein , HARP , in the cell . ”
The project was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health .
Increasingly we 're seeing big business jump on the Linux bandwagon , as companies wake up to the money that can be made out of a community of developers working for free .
Someone has to protect that community from being exploited , and if you 're a Fedora contributor , that someone is Max Spevack .
Linux Format magazine caught up with Max to ask him about the way the Fedora world is turning .
Linux Format : Max , you were the Fedora Project leader for a while ; now you 're the manager of the community architecture team .
How do those roles differ ?
Max Spevack : More or less my entire job is Red Hat community management , and Fedora is the shining example of Red Hat 's community work .
Part of my job also is to make sure that Red Hat participates in non-Fedora communities , so I spend like 75 – 80 % of my time on Fedora and the other 20 % of my time on more general community business .
LXF : Was it the community side or the technical side that attracted you more ?
MS : If I 'm going to honest about myself I 'd have to say that I was a decent programmer , not a superstar programmer .
Even in college there were people who just loved to write code for hours and hours and hours , and those were the best programmers .
I liked it and was good enough at it to get good grades , but it was n't an all - consuming passion for me .
I always kind of thought that I would be in a technical company but in a managerial , a leadership type of role , so looking back it does n't necessarily surprise me that this is the job I 've ended up in .
I live in awe of our brilliant engineers and the things they can do .
LXF : How well do you think Fedora / Red Hat is addressing the oft - repeated claim that Fedora is just a beta for RHEL ?
MS : I hear a lot less of that than I did four years ago .
I think the fact that we have built our community in an entirely transparent way says the most about that , because people see Fedora being an extreme innovator , they see SELinux get developed , they see Network Manager get developed , they see Red Hat participate in Xen and the work that 's been done in virtualisation , and they see Red Hat doing stuff that 's good for all distros , which I think gives Red Hat a lot of credibility as a technical innovator .
Fedora stands on its own as an operating system , and it just so happens that Fedora is upstream of Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
No one is going to call Debian a beta of Ubuntu , but Debian is in many ways upstream for a lot of the Ubuntu packages in the same way that Fedora is upstream for a lot of the RHEL packages .
That does n't mean that one is a beta of the other .
LXF : Has there been any call for users to have , say , one in every three releases supported long - term , like Ubuntu , for those who do n't want to buy RHEL or use CentOS ?
MS : We have a Fedora long - term support : it 's called either RHEL or one of the RHEL rebuilds that you can get for free .
Ironically , when Fedora was started it was given a separate brand because when Red Hat Linux split into RHEL and Fedora , the Red Hat salespeople were worried that they would n't be able to sell certain products .
Fedora was given a separate brand to distinguish between things that Red Hat sold support for and those things that they did n't .
Now there are people who use Fedora who have no idea that it's a part of Red Hat , which from my point of view as the Fedora guy is incredibly successful .
With the same genes in the same environment , one E. coli cell ( yellow ) switches on its lactose genes , while its neighbours stay in glucose - munching mode ( Image : Sunney Xie )
For an E. coli bacterium , 300 is its lucky number .
That ’s about how many protein molecules it takes to make a life - changing shift in its diet preference , according to new research .
But this shift happens entirely by chance , says Sunney Xie , a biochemist at Harvard University .
“ You do n’t know when it ’s going to occur .
It ’s a random event . ”
While this may sound more like chaos theory and quantum mechanics than biology , it is how all living cells operate at the molecular level , from drug - resistant tuberculosis to stem cells , he says .

In Escherichia coli‘s case , Xie studied a simple trait : the ability to digest lactose sugar .
E. coli normally prefer to dine on a sugar called glucose .
To conserve energy , bacteria shut down the genes that control lactose consumption when glucose is around .
This is achieved with the help of a “ repressor protein ” that sits on the lactose genes .
However , when glucose runs out and lactose is available , evolution has come up with an ingenious solution to bring the lactose - digesting genes out of slumber .
Tipping point
A protein called permease sits in the cell ’s membrane and imports stray lactose molecules into the cell .
These sugars latch onto the repressor protein , stopping its repressive activity , and allowing the lactose genes to switch back on .
This ensemble – called the lac operon – then produces more permease proteins that let in even more lactose , sending E. coli down a one - way street to lactose digestion .
Outlining this behaviour earned two scientists a Nobel prize in 1965 .
“ The lac operon is like the hydrogen atom of molecular biology , it ’s the first system that describes gene regulation , ” Xie says .
His team sought to understand what happens at the tipping point between repressing and activating these genes under low levels of lactose in genetically identical bacteria .
“ A single cell has to make a decision whether it wants to be induced or not , ” he says .
“ How is this life - changing decision made ? ”
To answer that question , Xie and colleagues Paul Choi and Long Cai , used a technology pioneered in their lab to count permease molecules tethered to a fluorescent marker protein .
They found that when a cell hit a critical threshold of about 300 permease proteins , the lac operon switched on in a burst of activity and the cell gained the ability to break down the sugar .
With fewer molecules , a cell remains stuck in neutral .
Double grip
However , this flurry of activity is all controlled by the repressor protein , which grabs onto the lac operon at two different places .
Losing grip of one of these points allows for little bursts of lactose gene expression – enough to get a taste of the outside world – but cell division prevents cells from reaching 300 in this way .
The repressor protein must completely let go for a cell to reach the magic number , Xie says .
And this happens by chance .
The random event allows the expression of more permease molecules , which means more lactose gets into the cell , and so the lactose genes are active for longer .
Eventually a point is reached where the cell is switched to lactose digestion .
“ It ’s a beautiful paper , ” says Michael Elowitz , a molecular biologist at Caltech in Pasadena .
“ Trying to understand the behaviour of cells in terms of the behaviour of the individual molecules within them is one of the most fundamental goals of biology . ”
The bizarre behaviour of single proteins could explain why one tuberculosis - causing bacterium is antibiotic resistant , while another bacterium with an identical genome falls prey to drugs , Xie says .
Even our own cells depend on life - changing fluke events involving single molecules .
While vastly more complicated than an E. coli bacterium , embryonic stem cells capable of turning into any kind of tissue probably make this decision with a small cast of molecules .

Are you planning to decorate your home for Christmas this year ?
If so , you it might be that you are in need of Christmas decorations .
Did you know , that when it comes to Christmas decorations , when you shop is almost the same important as where you shop ?
You will encounter that purchasing your Christmas decorations early is easier and , of course , also recommended .
The most important reason why you should start shopping for Christmas decorations early is that you will find a bigger selection .
A lot of retail stores display their Christmas decoration items already from September and some people start purchasing their Christmas decorations by then .
But most retail stores are limited on their selection of Christmas decorations that they stock .
Thus getting the Christmas decorations before they are sold out is the better thought .
But also when planning to shop online , being early is recommended .
Although many retailers have a larger selection of products in stock it does not mean that they do n't end up selling out .
Additionally the shipping time must be considered , when shopping online .
Usually it takes about a week that your purchases arrive at your door .
Just being early enough will help to ensure that you will get the Christmas decorations that you want .
We 're still a week out from the release of Bender 's Game , the third ( of four ) direct - to - DVD Futurama movies , but that is n't stopping David X. Cohen , co-creator of the series , from looking at what the future holds for the futuristic sitcom beyond its release ... and the answer includes more than just the fourth DVD .
Cohen told SciFi
Wire that he 's optimistic for life beyond the cartoon 's final DVD :
Hope never dies on Futurama , or not anymore ...
It died once , but once you introduce the idea that you can come back from the dead , then the second time you have to have a little bit of hope that you might come back to life yet again .
So we do retain hope of resurrection ...
The hard facts would seem to support us coming back again .
From what we have heard , the DVDs have sold very well , and I have heard the phrase ' greatly exceeded ' 20th Century Fox 's expectations .
So that 's got to be a good sign , you would think .
We have n't heard anything , yes or no , so it 's familiar territory .

And in case he 's wrong , well , there 'll be a certain symmetry to Into the Wild Green Yonder , the final DVD ; it 's been written by Ken Keeler , who wrote the last episode of the Futurama TV series .
Bender 's Game ( and , yes , the Orson Scott Card pun is intentional ) is released November 4th ; Into The Wild Green Yonder is due next year .
A Future For Futurama ? [ SciFi Wire ]
Everybody ’s wonderin’ what and where they all came from .
Everybody ’s worryin ’ ’bout where they ’re gonna go when the whole thing ’s done .
But no one knows for certain and so it ’s all the same to me .
I think I ’ll just let the mystery be .
The vice presidential candidate of a major political party in America apparently believes dinosaurs and men once walked the earth at the same time :
After conducting a college band and watching Palin deliver a commencement address to a small group of home - schooled students in June 1997 , Wasilla resident Philip Munger said , he asked the young mayor about her religious beliefs .
Palin told him that " dinosaurs and humans walked the Earth at the same time , " Munger said .
When he asked her about prehistoric fossils and tracks dating back millions of years , Palin said " she had seen pictures of human footprints inside the tracks , " recalled Munger , who teaches music at the University of Alaska in Anchorage and has regularly criticized Palin in recent years on his liberal political blog , called Progressive Alaska .
Some of you out there may be familiar with Peter Milligan ’s late Vertigo comic series , Shade , The Changing Man , in which the titular character attempts to contain America ’s collective madness .
We sure could use him right about now now .
A California man has been charged with a felony hate crime after attacking a gay neighbor with his “ Yes on 8 ” sign – that is , a sign showing his support for Proposition 8 , which would overturn gay marriage in the Golden State .
Such violence is n’t new during this increasingly frenetic election season , but this story differs in a significant way : the men have known each other since junior high :
Joseph Storm , 23 , got into a scuffle with a 22 - year - old man wearing a “ No on 8 ” button early Sunday in Torrance , according to Deputy District Attorney Janet Wilson .
Storm and the victim , whose identity has not been released , have known each other since junior high school , she said .
During the fight , Storm took the lawn sign and knocked the victim down with it , then punched him in the face and choked him , Wilson said .
Storm is also accused of calling the victim a derogatory name for homosexuals .
We can only guess what they name could have been – there are so many !
When Twitter Met Facebook : The Acquisition Deal That Fail - Whaled
[ Updated with new details about deal , including who worked on it and info on a cash component . ]
About three weeks ago , Facebook and Twitter ended several weeks of serious talks , in which Facebook was offering to acquire Twitter for $ 500 million of its stock , which also included a cash component .
While rumors of Facebook ’s interest were brought up in an interview with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the Web 2.0 Summit a few weeks ago , some shot down the idea as silly .
Quite incorrectly , as it turns out , since top execs at both Facebook and Twitter were right then at the tail end of discussions , which were initiated by the privately held Facebook in mid-October , about bringing the two together .
Those talks , sources on both sides said , are now over .
So why did the deal break down ?
Well , as is usually the case , over price –was $ 500 million worth of Facebook stock actually worth $ 500 million ? –and the typical concerns about integration and costs .
But , more important , it seems , was a feeling among Twitter investors and execs that the start - up should still take a shot at building its revenues –there are none right now–as well as it had done at building its growth .
“ It ’s more about timing , ” said one person familiar with Twitter ’s motivations .
“ There is a strong feeling that there is still an opportunity –even with the economic downturn –to blow this thing out . ”
Still , combining the world ’s fastest - growing social - networking site with what is quickly becoming the best - known microblogging service is actually a natural fit .
That ’s especially true given that Facebook –for all its powerful online social connections –has seen Twitter race past it in innovating in the “ status update ” arena .
While some sources at Facebook said Zuckerberg was becoming frustrated by the buzz Twitter was getting–a market that should have been dominated by Facebook–others at the company said he was interested in buying Twitter because of his respect for its progress .
Indeed , at the Web 2.0 interview , Zuckerberg called Twitter an “ elegant model ” and said that he was “ really impressed by what they ’ve done . ”
Indeed , with about six million registrations , as reported in October , up 600 percent over the last year , the San Francisco - based Twitter –launched in 2006 – has had impressive growth .
( It has also been plagued by technical issues , which are –to be fair –decreasing . )
In any case , for those not familiar with it , the premise of Twitter is dead simple : A registered user logs in via the Internet or a mobile phone and answers the “ What are you doing ? ” question the service asks in only 140 characters or fewer .
It ’s quite a clever idea , although–so far–not a money - making one .
To try to goose that , Twitter ’s board replaced the engineer who created Twitter , Jack Dorsey , with another founder , Evan Williams , who had served as its chairman and chief product officer .
The more experienced Williams ( pictured here ) had already built one company – Pyra Labs , which created the Blogger blogging service –that he sold to Google in 2003 .
He also started the audio and video search site Odeo , where Twitter was actually born .
Still , its investors have not come down on Twitter to hold back its growth efforts , and have handed over $ 20 million to the start - up so far .
In its last round , Twitter was valued at $ 98 million .
Its funders include : Union Square Ventures , Charles River Ventures , Digital Garage , Spark Capital and Bezos Expeditions , backed by Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos .
In addition , well - known Silicon Valley figures , such as Marc Andreessen and Ron Conway , have also invested .
Interestingly , Andreessen is also on Facebook ’s board .
Other private investors include FeedBurner Co-Founder ( and now Googler ) Dick Costolo , former Epinions Co-Founder Naval Ravikant and former Googler Chris Sacca .
Twitter needs all the investors it can get , since it has no revenue , although it has been exploring things like charging business customers and adding advertising into the consumer service .
Lack of revenues was an issue for Facebook , said sources , especially related to fees Twitter pays for delivery of its messages to cellphones .
While the issue has been manageable in the U.S. , Twitter cut off its SMS support in some international markets this summer because of too - high costs .
But , if Twitter was offered to Facebook ’s 120 million users , Facebook execs estimated that it might have to deal with huge SMS fees–up to $ 75 million annually .
“ Facebook has its own revenue - generating challenges , ” said one person close to the company .
“ As much as Twitter would give them a lift in the status area , it was still a worry . ”
Not enough , said several sources , to stop Facebook from making another approach at some point in the future .
“ We ’d hate to see Twitter go to another company , ” said one source .
Indeed , while all are even more price - conscious than Facebook , large companies that could also be interested include : Google ( GOOG ) , Yahoo ( YHOO ) , Microsoft ( MSFT ) or a large telecom company , such as Verizon ( VZ ) .
If it had completed the deal to buy Twitter , it would have been Facebook ’s most significant acquisition by far .
Zuckerberg and Williams did meet and get along well , but the deal was primarily negotiated by Spark Capital partner Bijan Sabet ( Spark is a Twitter investor ) and Facebook deal guy Dan Rose .
But in this time , at least , the Twitter side was still not interested in selling at the price Facebook had offered .
The $ 500 million offered was in an all - stock form , said sources on both sides , at the $ 15 billion valuation that came from the Microsoft ’s investment in the company last October .
The Twitter side felt that figure was inflated and the shares should be valued at the lower figures that have also been reported for Facebook ’s true valuation , more in the $ 5 billion range .
That would have given the deal a $ 150 million price tag , which was seen as too low , especially since it was in Facebook stock and not cash initially .
In fact , Twitter wanted cash , which some sources say was offered by Facebook in the $ 50 to $ 100 million range , in addition to stock , but taking too much stock was still a major issue .
There are other ways the pair could have approximated a safer choice for Twitter , via warrants , of course , or other methods .
But , said several sources close to Twitter , the primary reason for not selling was because its board simply did not want to yet or perhaps ever .
Said one source : “ The question is , is it really a good idea to sell on the first chance you get ? ”
Well , for Twitter , we ’ll just have to wait and see about that , of course .

Gordon Brown tonight called on the world 's most powerful industrial nations to agree a programme of immediate and coordinated tax cuts to prevent the global economy sliding deeper into recession .
Arriving in New York for this weekend 's unprecedented gathering of the leaders of the world 's leading 20 economies , the prime minister said the need for a " fiscal stimulus " both for the UK economy and the world had increased after an autumn in which accelerating job losses had intensified fears of a deep and lasting slump .
Brown proposed a four - point plan which he hopes will win support at tomorrow 's summit and help tackle the most severe financial crisis for 90 years .
" By acting now we can stimulate growth in all our economies , " he said .
" There is a need for urgency .
The cost of inaction will be far greater than the cost of any action . "
Brown believes an agreement by the G20 this weekend will provide his government with the political cover it needs to finance a multibillion - pound package of tax cuts in the upcoming pre-budget report .
" For Britain , a fiscal stimulus is the right course , as Mervyn King [ governor of the Bank of England ] made clear today , and we will be setting out our proposals in the pre-budget report , " he said .
Brown will argue that countries cannot rely on interest rate cuts alone in the face of the wider economic crisis , and that the impact of tax cuts or higher public spending will be lessened if only a handful of countries take part .
" It is now becoming increasingly accepted around the world that a temporary and affordable fiscal stimulus is needed .
This will have most impact if it is coordinated internationally . "
Last night George Bush admitted the global financial system needed reform , but insisted that the credit crunch was not a failure of the free market system .
Speaking at Federal Hall on Wall Street , he said while financial markets needed some new regulation and more transparency , free trade should not be restricted .
" The answer is not to try to reinvent that system .
It is to fix the problems we face , make the reforms we need , and move forward with the free market principles that have delivered prosperity and hope to people all across the globe , " he said .
" While reforms in the financial sector are essential , the long - term solution to today 's problems is sustained economic growth .
And the surest path to that growth is free markets and free people . "
The scale of the problem facing Brown was underlined yesterday as the pound fell to a six - year low against the dollar , ending the day at $ 1.48 .
It also ended at an all - time low against the euro of almost 85 pence as traders priced in more interest rate cuts in the UK following Wednesday 's bleak outlook from the Bank of England .
Figures confirmed that Germany , the world 's third largest economy , had entered recession .
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development yesterday predicted the world 's economies were heading into a " protracted recession " .
The summit is seen by Downing Street as a crucial stage in tackling domestic and international problems .
" This is a global problem that requires a global solution .
Only by acting with our international partners can we address the challenging economic circumstances affecting families and business in Britain . "
Progress was urgently needed in three other areas , Brown said .
• To identify and rectify the weaknesses of the international financial system exposed during the banking crisis .
• For rich countries to pump more money into the International Monetary Fund to support developing countries .
• Brown will push for world trade talks which opened in 2001 but finally broke down in the summer to be reopened and concluded by the end of this year .
Government officials are concerned that the meeting is being chaired by the outgoing President George Bush rather than president - elect , Barack Obama .
They fear it means that Washington is less focused than other countries on making firm commitments .
Brown will not be meeting Obama personally on his two day trip but his officials will be meeting Obama 's transition team .

News Report ( translated from gazeta.ru ) :
The United States government is trying to put the blame for the financial crisis on the rating agencies , who knew about the great risk that was coming but kept giving high reliability ratings to companies that did n’t deserve them .
However , the impending financial crisis could not have been unnoticed by the investment companies , or by officials in the United States and other countries .
If the institutions that can see all the risks will continue to keep silent about it in order to avoid sowing panic among the population , then they will harm the population even more .
The chief economist of ITinvest , S. Yegishantz , predicts that the lessons will be learned three to five years later , when the world economy will be in ruins and humanity ’s objective will be just to survive .
My Comment :
What difference does it make “ Who ’s to blame ? ” ( supposedly ! ) or who is trying to hush up the financial crisis ?
The crisis keeps progressing regardless .
We have to find its true cause – the quality of egoism inherent in man ’s nature , and an effective way to overcome it .
It can only be overcome by the force that can correct egoism – the force of the Light that created egoism in the first place .
This force is evoked when we study it – by studying Kabbalah .
This is what we should do instead of looking for for a scapegoat – “ who hushed it up ” or “ who is trying to hush it up now . ”
If the remedy for the disease has n’t been found , then maybe it ’s better to silence it in order to avoid sowing panic and unnecessary depression .
This is what the governments are doing for now .
Since Kabbalah talks not only about the nature of the crisis , but also about the remedy , it is very important to disseminate Kabbalah ’s view on the crisis , its nature and the method of healing it .
Let ’s work together to help the world learn about the solution to the problem !

Anyone thinking of swiping an Obama / Biden '08 sign from a front lawn in Portland might want to consider this :
The world may be watching .
A Portland woman known as " Poverty Kids ' Teacher " has created an Internet sensation with a webcam that 's streaming video around the clock of the political signs in her yard .
No , it 's not another artsy viral campaign in support of the Democratic ticket .
It 's one woman 's response to thieves taking her political signs when she was n't looking this month .
After the second $ 8 - a - pop Obama / Biden '08 sign disappeared , the woman , who has kept her identity and address a secret , made a handmade placard with the candidates ' names .
She then asked her 16 - year - old son to set up a webcam inside the house to monitor the yard .
According to the Huffington Post , her son , who goes by " SignKid " on the popular Ustream.tv site , went one step further :
He streamed the view of the sign to the universe -- or at least every battleground state and any country with an Internet connection .
Portland partisans tired of getting their yard signs swiped can rejoice .
People seem to care .
At one point , Obama Sign CCTV1 was the 6th most viewed stream on Ustream.tv .
Some viewers have reported watching the lawn - cam for hours at a time .
So far , squirrels and cars have made plenty of appearances , but the signs are still standing .

Thousands of anti-nuclear campaigners have assembled along a train route in Germany to protest the annual convoy carrying tons of nuclear waste from France to a storage facility in northeastern Germany .
[ social_buttons ]
In what is becoming an annual ritual of civil resistance and direct action in Germany , more than 15,000 anti-nuclear protesters turned out along the route to Gorleben on Sunday — twice the number at a similar protest at the site two years ago — in the largest and most violent anti-nuclear protest in Germany since 2001 .
The train is carrying spent nuclear fuel that was originally used in German power stations , turned into pellets at a factory in France and then returned to Germany for long - term storage .
The cargo consists of 17 tons of waste pellets encapsulated in 100 tons of insulating glass .
It is the 11th trainload of waste to be taken from the retreatment facility in Normandy to the salt mines in Gorleben .
At the border between the two countries three German demonstrators blocked the train for more than 11 hours by chaining and cementing themselves to the track .
Protesters also set barricades on railroad tracks on fire forcing police to use water cannons to extinguish them .
As many as 16,000 police mobilized to protect the train throughout its three - day journey , which began in France on Friday .
According to reports , several protesters and police were injured in the confrontation , but police gave no reports about the number of victims .
To the north , close to the waste facility , protesters defied a ban on demonstrations near the railway and invaded the line .
Riot police used batons to disperse the crowd back into nearby woods .

The robust anti-nuclear movement in Germany seeks the immediate closure of all nuclear power stations .
Demonstration organizers were pleased with the turnout at Gorleben .
Jochen Stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group x-tausendmal quer , called it the “ rebirth of the anti-nuclear movement in Germany . ”
Although the German government has officially begun phasing out its 17 nuclear power plants by 2020 , Chancellor Angela Merkel has said the ambitious plan must be slowed if the country hopes to cut greenhouse gas emissions significantly .
The opposition Social Democrats have vowed to block any attempt to roll back the plans to phase - out nuclear power and will likely make the issue a centerpiece of their campaign in next year ’s election .

What they ’re trying to connect him to is some kind of terrorist feelings .

At least 160 people have been killed after an earthquake of 6.4 magnitude hit Balochistan province in south - western Pakistan , officials say .
Officials in Balochistan say they expect the toll to rise .
The tremor struck 70 km ( 45 miles ) north of Quetta at 0409 ( 2309GMT Tuesday ) at a depth of 10 km ( 6.2 miles ) , the US Geological Survey said .
Many houses collapsed during the quake and some were destroyed in landslides that followed it , officials said .
See a map of the affected area Reports say teams of army and paramilitary Frontier Corps troops are in the area , helping to rescue the injured and retrieve bodies .
Senior army official Maj Gen Salim Nawaz said the area remained accessible for convoys carrying relief material .
In pictures : Pakistan quake Quake eyewitnesses History of deadly earthquakes
But the mountainous region is thinly populated and local infrastructure is poor , making it difficult to get a clear picture of the casualties .
The two main tremors struck at about 0409 and then 0510 .
The BBC's Azizullah Khan in Balochistan says aftershocks of 6.2 magnitude have rattled the province on Wednesday , causing more panic among local people .
Officials say there have also been at least four aftershocks .
Our correspondent says communications in many areas have been cut off and many people are scared to return to their homes as another cold night approaches .
Provincial Revenue Minister Zamrak Khan told Reuters news agency that many affected areas had still not yet been reached .
And a local television correspondent reported that some people in villages outside Quetta were angry that no rescue teams had arrived on the scene .
Homes buried
Many stunned survivors spent the rest of the night in the open , with little more than the clothes in which they had been sleeping .
The worst - hit area appeared to be Ziarat , about 50 km north of Quetta , where hundreds of mostly mud and timber houses had been destroyed in five villages , mayor Dilawar Kakar said .
Some homes were buried in a landslide triggered by the quake , he said .
Graves are being dug with excavators as we can't keep dead bodies in the open
Sohail - ur - Rehman
Senior official in Ziarat " Our rescuers are still working but we 've recovered 160 bodies from various villages in Ziarat , " he said .
" There is great destruction .
Not a single house is intact , " he added .
He said hundreds more people had been injured and some 15,000 made homeless .
" I would like to appeal to the whole world for help .
We need food , we need medicine .
People need warm clothes , blankets because it is cold here , " he said .
Another senior official in Ziarat , Sohail - ur - Rehman , said the authorities were also scrambling to bury the dead .
Mass grave " Graves are being dug with excavators as we can't keep dead bodies in the open , " he told the Reuters news agency .
In the village of Sohi , a reporter for AP Television News saw the bodies of 17 people killed in one collapsed house and 12 from another .
Distraught residents were digging a mass grave in which to bury them .
Residents hurried into the streets of Quetta after the quake " We can't dig separate graves for each of them , as the number of deaths is high and still people are searching in the rubble , " village elder Shamsullah Khan said .
In the nearby town of Kawas , dozens of dead and injured were brought to a hospital in Kawas in Ziarat district .
A doctor there , Mohammed Irfan , told the Associated Press news agency the hospital was unable to cope with the number of injured .
Nearby Pishin district was also hit , and at least five people died there .
" We were fast asleep when the tremor struck .
We grabbed the children and ran outside .
The earth continued shaking for more than a minute , " said resident Habibullah .
The quake was also felt in Quetta itself .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Parents who want their preschoolers to eat their vegetables may need to take a hard look at their own eating habits , new research suggests .
A family during mealtime in an undated photo .
REUTERS / File
In a study of 120 young children who were allowed to “ buy ” food from a play grocery store , researchers found that even 2 - year - olds tended to mirror their parents ’ usual food choices .
Children who stocked up on sweets , sugary drinks and salty snacks generally had parents whose typical grocery list featured such items .
Similarly , children with the healthiest shopping habits seemed to be following their parents ’ lead as well .
The findings , reported in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , suggest that even very young children do not indiscriminately reach for candy when given the chance .
Instead , they seem to already be forming food preferences -- potentially lasting ones -- based on their parents ’ shopping carts .
“ The data suggest that children begin to assimilate and mimic their parents ’ food choices at a very young age , even before they are able to fully appreciate the implications of these choices , ” write the researchers , led by Dr. Lisa A. Sutherland of Dartmouth Medical School in Lebanon , New Hampshire .
That , the researchers say , means that the grocery store can be like a classroom , where parents teach their children that foods like fruits , vegetables and whole grains take priority over snacks and desserts .
For the study , Sutherland ’s team had 120 children aged 2 to 6 years old each take a turn in a play grocery store .
The children were told they could buy anything they wanted out of 133 items : “ healthier ” foods included fruits , vegetables , whole - grain cereals , bread and milk ; “ less healthy ” items included desserts , candy , potato chips , soda and sugary cereals .
Parents completed questionnaires on how often they bought specific foods and beverages .
All said they brought their children with them on grocery store trips .
Most of the children , the researchers found , bought some sugary , salty treats ; on average , their carts were filled with equal parts healthy and unhealthy items .
However , 35 children bought significantly more healthy fare than junk food .
In general , the study found , the health - consciousness of a child ’s shopping cart mirrored that of her parents ’ grocery list .
“ Nutrition interventions for children most often begin with school - aged children , ” Sutherland and her colleagues write .
“ This study suggests that preschool children are already forming food preferences and are attentive to food choices made by their parents . ”
Giving preschoolers a taste for healthy foods , the researchers add , could ultimately make it easier for them to keep up a lifetime of smart eating .

At the tail end of a piece about the death ( or otherwise ) of music TV on the Sentric Music blog , Mr Pursehouse says :
In a blog post in the not too distant future I ’m going to pose some questions to some real life A&R people and maybe a couple of other industry professionals to give you guys a look into the murky minds of the music industry .
So this is your chance to ask that question that has always been burning in your mind but never been answered thus far :
Want to know how to get an A&R man to your gig ?
Do A&R for major labels believe their employers have a future in this industry ?
What do they look for in a demo ?
If you have any questions then either leave a comment or get in touch in that way you lot always seem to do .
If you ’re in an unsigned band , in the industry , or simply curious , give him a shout !
He ’s a very nice chap .
Watch as this female mosquito fills up on blood .
Mosquitoes are insects that have been around for more than 30 million years .
And it seems that , during those millions of years , mosquitoes have been honing their skills so that they are now experts at finding people to bite .
Mosquitoes have a battery of sensors designed to track their prey , including :
Chemical sensors – mosquitoes can sense ca More ..rbon dioxide and lactic acid up to 100 feet ( 36 meters ) away .
Mammals and birds gives off these gases as part of their normal breathing .
Certain chemicals in sweat also seem to attract mosquitoes ( people who do n’t sweat much do n’t get nearly as many mosquito bites ) .
Visual sensors – if you are wearing clothing that contrasts with the background , and especially if you move while wearing that clothing , mosquitoes can see you and zero in on you .
It ’s a good bet that anything moving is “ alive ” , and therefore full of blood , so this is a good strategy .
Heat sensors – Mosquitoes can detect heat , so they can find warm - blooded mammals and birds very easily once they get close enough .
Something with this many sensors sounds more like a military aircraft than an insect .
That ’s why mosquitoes are so good at finding and biting you .
As we ’ll see later , one of the only ways to stop mosquitoes from finding you is to confuse their chemical receptors with something like DEET .
Like all insects , adult mosquitoes have three basic body parts :
Head –
This is where all the sensors are , along with the biting apparatus .
The head has two compound eyes , antennae to sense chemicals and the mouth parts called the palpus and the proboscis ( only females h­ave the proboscis , for biting ) .
Thorax –
This segment is where the two wings and six legs attach .
It contains the flight muscles , compound heart , some nerve cell ganglia and ­ trachioles .
Abdomen –
This segment contains the digestive and excretory organs .
So you have a sensor package , a motor package and a fuel processing package — a perfect design !
Little Fly
The word “ mosquito ” is Spanish for “ little fly , ” and its use dates back to about 1583 in North America ( Europeans referred to mosquitoes as “ gnats ” ) .
Mosquitoes belong to the order Diptera , true flies .
Mosquitoes are like flies in that they have two wings , but unlike flies , their wings have scales , their legs are long and the females have a long mouth part ( proboscis ) for piercing skin

We St Louis bloggers all know Mae Mason , otherwise known as MuthaMae .
She ’s the mother of a three who not only blogs , but video - blogs ( vlogs ) and produces her own online show , Word To Your Mutha .
Mae ’s blog discuss all kinds of parenting and family issues in a lighthearted , humorous way , and in her latest show , she tackles how to instill the value of recycling in her four - year - old and two one - year - olds … when she does n’t really recycle herself .
Best of all , she used Green Options to help her figure it out …
Smarty pants that she is , Mae enlisted the help of Green Options Senior Editor and founder of Sustainablog , Jeff McIntire - Strasburg .
Jeff is a fellow St. Louisan , and he offered to appear on Mae ’s show walking her through recycling for beginners , giving information on how to set up a system that works for your family , what you can and ca n’t recycle , and different types of recycling programs .
Mae says :
I had read a recent article that stated it ’s easy to get young kids to recycle , but once they hit the teen years they lose interest .
It hit me that we did n’t have a recycling program in our home and that ’s NOT GOOD !
I went online to do some research on how to set up a program , then realized it would be a fantastic show episode .
Maybe I could convince other families like mine to recycle , too .
I wanted to bring an expert on board to show us how to set up a proper program .
Jeff was so kind , so informative , and so good on camera .
I look forward to making future shows with him .
Kudos to Mae for getting on the green train .
This is a great video for anyone looking to go green , but especially parents who want to teach their kids .
Wanna check it out ?

SAN FRANCISCO 
In a city known for its pricey property , and terrible parking , some of the most valuable real estate may soon be curbside .
Under a trial plan passed Tuesday by the board of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency , 6,000 of the city ’s precious parking spots will be priced on a sliding scale depending on how popular they are .
And while the worst locales will go cheaply  as little as a quarter  a handful of premium parking spots will be worth $ 18 an hour , or nearly a pound of quarters .
Other cities have dabbled in such pricing , but Nathaniel P. Ford Sr. , executive director of the transportation agency , said San Francisco ’s plan  due to start in the spring with the aid of new meters , sensors and $ 18.4 million in federal financing  would place the city at the forefront of parking technology .
Mr. Ford cited the various benefits it would reap , including reducing congestion and carbon emissions from circling cars and ensuring pedestrians are not sideswiped by parking - obsessed drivers .
“ It ’s an exciting time , ” said Mr. Ford , who also pointed to advances in payment technology , including the ability to buy parking time with a cellphone .
I 'm going to keep this simple because the results speak for themselves .
I 've taken the Presidential vote totals from 2004 and calculated the number of additional votes needed , beyond what our projection dictates , for the trailing candidate to reach the 50 % threshold .
The result of this arithmetic can be seen in the Votes Needed column .
The EVs Per Voter ( 10 ^ - 4 ) column takes the Votes Needed and divides by the voting population of the given state in 2004 .
The results of this calculation are very small , with four zeros directly after the decimal point , but their meaning is very large .
Take a look at the data before I explain its significance ; the results are ordered based on Obama 's projection percentage in descending order .
If you order the results by EVs per Voter the twelve most contested states fall within the top fifteen .
This would be great news for McCain if eleven of these twelve states were n't states previously carried by Bush in 2004 ; Pennsylvania is the exception and ranks fifteenth .
Within the eleven he must win , McCain is currently trailing in seven ; North Carolina , North Dakota , Montana , Nevada , Missouri , Colorado and New Mexico .
If we total the Votes Needed column for these seven states the result is 409,239 ; this is the absolute minimum number of additional votes ( beyond our projection ) McCain needs to win the Election .
McCain needs 409,239 votes in seven states to win the election , whereas John Kerry needed 118,599 votes in Ohio .
" O Lord our Father , our young patriots , idols of our hearts , go forth to battle -- be Thou near them !
With them -- in spirit -- we also go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved fire sides to smite the foe .
O Lord our God , help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells ;
help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead
help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded , writhing in pain ;
help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire ;
help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief ; help us to turn them out roofless with little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst ,

I do n't generally comments on politics in this blog , but this is something that I cannot ignore .
I was just watching the evening news , and I saw Ehud Barak , Israel 's Minister of Security , state ( for the record ! ) that the goal of the current government is to reduce the number of missile launched on Israel to 10 - 7 a month .
Allow me to repeat that .
The Minister of Security for Israel , as part of answering an inquiry for parliament , has stated the official position of the government .
And that government goal , the thing it strive for , is to to have missiles launched on Israel .
I almost puked when I heard that , and I am still furious .

The word bizarre does n’t even begin to cover how the McCain campaign presents itself to my eyes .
For a minute or two I was taken in by McCain ’s announcement on Wednesday .
I wondered if this would play out right in American voters ’ minds .
“ Patriotism and putting the country first always goes down well with the American public ” I have been told in my political science seminars .
But the unbelievably incompetent execution of McCain ’s ill thought - out plan and the resulting developments in the race from Wednesday till tonight , the total public disintegration of a presidential campaign within a timeframe that you can still measure in hours , is something I would not have thought possible .
As details are emerging about the dismal performance during the White House crisis meeting , John McCain eats his own words and heads to Mississippi for tonight ’s debate with Barack Obama .
He ca n’t not , now that his incompetence is so very obvious and the Democrats have called his bluff .
And he is in it to win it .
So much so that the McCain campaign has issued a campaign ad claiming McCain had won the debate .
A wee bit premature .
Not only has n’t the debate even started yet , the ad already has been published before McCain even announced his participation in the thing .

Pakistan has sought an emergency bail - out from the International Monetary Fund , a humiliating step forced on Islamabad after allies refused to come up with cash to prevent the country going bust .
The IMF confirmed yesterday that Pakistan had sought funds to meet balance of payments difficulties .
It is expected to provide $ 5 bn ( about £ 3 bn ) or more for the coming year , with billions more for subsequent years .
Pakistan 's finance minister , Shaukat Tareen , said recently that going to the IMF was his " plan C " , but Islamabad has been stung by rebuffs from its closest international partners - China , the US and Saudi Arabia - leaving it with few choices .
Past IMF programmes , requiring Pakistan to agree to austerity measures , were deeply unpopular .
The previous regime , of President Pervez Musharraf , had trumpeted its break from this source of finance .
" Musharraf , everyone , celebrated that Pakistan had graduated out of IMF programmes .
He said he had ' broken the begging bowl ' , " said Faisal Bari , a professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences .
" Going back to the IMF means that the country is carrying the begging bowl again , that it is not on a path of sustainable growth . "
Pakistan 's foreign exchange reserves will run out within about seven weeks , meaning that it will not be able to meet external debt payments , making it bankrupt .
The restoration of democracy , with elections in February , coincided with an economic collapse that has sent inflation soaring and the rupee plunging .
Islamabad had hoped that , as a frontline state in the " war on terror " , allies would come to its aid , as a bankrupt country would not be able to fight the Taliban and al - Qaida .
The foreign minister , Shah Mahmood Qureshi , said the west would suffer if Pakistan was not helped .
" You have to wake up and realise that Pakistan is a victim , Pakistan has stood by you ... if you do n't stand by Pakistan you will let yourselves down , " Qureshi said in a BBC interview .
The US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher , visiting Pakistan this week , said the " goal was not to throw money on the table " .
The IMF typically lends money in return for economic reforms that require deep cuts in government expenditure and a rise in taxes .
But the coalition government has already carried out some of these measures , mostly by withdrawing subsidies for fuel , electricity and food .
Mushtaq Khan , an economist at Citibank in London , described the bail - out as good news .
" The IMF is like bitter medicine but , unfortunately , that 's what is required . "
Separately , Pakistan 's parliament last night agreed on a counterterrorism policy .
However , the strategy , which has the support of all parties , may prove controversial with international partners as it calls for dialogue with militants and the use of force only as a last resort .
Harriet Harman criminally hates men
There is nothing wrong with having women politicians , as long as they are honest , objective , and not of the man-hating feminist kind .
I came into this world living in a totalitarian regime .
I was born into and raised during Hitler ’s regime .
I experienced the destruction and human misery deliberately caused by that regime .
It appears to be an inescapable conclusion that , when I depart for greener pastures , I will be leaving a totalitarian regime of a different sort but even more deadly .
After the defeat of the Hitler Regime , there was then in all developed nations a short interval of democracy during which we became promptly and intensely indoctrinated to adhere to materialism and consumerism .
The all - out drive toward that resulted in another form of totalitarianism that brought us the systematic implementation of the international agenda for the planned destruction of the family .
That was to achieve the liberation of women under the guise of freeing them from the slavery of the family .
That brought women into the workforce , intensified materialism and consumerism , and that made the vast majority of us on average very poor , spiritually and economically .
It also created escalating totalitarianism that is as bad and just as deadly , even far more deadly and destructive – demographically – than any other totalitarian regime was throughout the history of mankind .
There has never been another totalitarian regime that systematically and deliberately destroyed the population that supported it .
Not enough children are being born to maintain our population levels critically necessary to ensure our survival .
Within about three generations , at the most four , the people of the West and their cultural heritage will have vanished .
As Lenin said , if you destroy the family , you will destroy society .
Harriet Harman criminally hates men , but she is neither the first nor the last
It now appears that , just as I was born into and raised in a totalitarian regime , I will be leaving this world while firmly in the grip of a totalitarian regime that is worse than the one I came into when I was born .
Not only that , but hatred of a visible minority ( this time all men are being targeted ) drives and controls this regime to a far greater extent than the one I lived in as a child .
There is a major difference between the totalitarian regime then and the one we are in now .
This time around there will not be any war trials to bring to justice the radical extremist ideologues who , for the sake of gaining absolute power and control , exploit and harm us .
Daily Mail [ UK ] July 29 , 2008 Erin Pizzey , champion of women ’s rights , says radical feminist plans to let victims of domestic abuse get away with murder are an affront to morality By Erin Pizzey
Harriet Harman recently made a leaden attempt at self - deprecating humour .
In response to a House of Commons question about her leadership ambitions , she said that she could not possibly become Prime Minister because , if she did , then the nations airports would be filled with men trying to flee the country .
The joke caused bewildered looks rather than laughs , partly because of her lack of comic timing , but more importantly because there is nothing funny about her aggressively feminist agenda , which treats men as either second - class citizens or a menace to society ….( Full Story )

About Erin Pizzey — Founder of the Modern Women ’s Shelter Movement
Angry Harry puts Harriet Harman ( and all others like her , plus the statement that deservedly got Erin Pizzey ’s ire ) into the proper context .
After all , although what Harriet Harman says and does in relation to men is extremely harmful , it is only a relatively small part of the government - sponsored man-hating enterprise in the developed nations .
Men ’s News Daily Do Not Respect Them By Angry Harry
In my last piece on MND I suggested that long - time MRAs would do better by focusing less on the outrages that men so often have to endure ( family courts , misandry in advertising etc ) and focusing more on stirring up fear in the public about the impending awfulness that is going to continue to materialise unless we do something about political correctness and feminism .
But I now want to go further than this , and try to urge all MRAs to spend less time in the future discussing all the bullets that keep coming the way of men , and to spend more time firing some bullets back … .( Full Story )
To permit an assessment of how harmful Harriet Harman ’s political ambition were and still are to millions of people in the UK and elsewhere , one needs to delve a little more into her history and ambitions .
Why would anyone in his right mind vote for someone who should be prosecuted ?

Do you have too many browsers installed already ?
Well , today I ’m test - driving yet another browser from a Japanese startup named Lunascape ( I ’m not really sure what to call this product , they sometimes refer to it as “ Genesis ” , but mostly they just call it Lunascape ) .
Where did they get that name , I wonder ?
It sounds like you ’re taking Netscape to the moon or something .
What makes this browser different is that instead of using one rendering engine , it bundles three of them together : Trident ( the Internet Explorer engine ) , Gecko ( used by Firefox ) , and WebKit ( Safari and Chrome ) .
Now you ’re asking , how could a browser possibly use three different rendering engines ?
Well , Lunascape lets you switch rendering engines on the fly .
I can think of two different reasons why you might want to do that :
You ’re a web designer , and you want to see how your creation looks in the various browsers without having to start up each one .
The trouble with that is you ca n’t be certain that WebKit in Lunascape looks exactly like WebKit in Chrome or Safari .
In fact , I was able to find a couple of differences in CSS rendering ( which you would think would be isolated to the rendering engine ) .
In my JavaScript Timeclock application , the clock face is supposed to be green on black , and Lunascape rendered it black on white when using WebKit .
Also , the “ X ” on the right was significantly smaller in Lunascape than in any other browser ( using font - size : 50 % ) , but only when using WebKit or Trident .
I do n’t know if those differences were caused by different versions of the rendering engine , or whether they result from some unique interaction between the browser and rendering engine .
But that convinces me that Lunascape is an inadequate substitute for cross - browser testing .
You visit some sites that require a different browser than your favorite one .
Typically , that means you need Internet Explorer for certain pages to work properly , but using Internet Explorer as your default browser is like running a marathon wearing only an overtightened corset .
Lunascape looks like a great fit for this scenario .
Not only can you select your rendering engine on the fly , but you can also configure a specific engine to be used by default for a given page or domain in the “ Auto - Engine Switcher ” .
Lunascape claims to have the fastest JavaScript engine , and they quote results from the SunSpider Benchmark to support it .
But it depends on what you test .
Using the Dromaeo Benchmark , Google Chrome beats Lunascape in most categories by about double — though Lunascape wins on some operations , notably DOM query and traversal using certain popular libraries .
For details , see the results for each : Lunascape and Chrome .
Lunascape supports Internet Explorer plugins ( not that you ’d want to use them ) and its own plugin system ( alas , no Firefox add - ons ) .
I visited the “ Abundant plug- ins ” page and found exactly zero plugins available :
Switching the language filer to Japanese yields 43 plugins .
Unfortunately , I do n’t know Japanese .
OK , it ’s an alpha release , so I ’ll cut ’em some slack .
If you ’ve gotten used to the more intelligent address bars in Firefox 3 and Chrome , Lunascape will drive you nuts with its distinct lack of foreknowledge .
When you start typing , it drops down a list of — I ’m not kidding — local filenames .
Even an initial “ h ” ( which , you know , is the first character in “ http ” ) listed files from a share on another computer on my local network whose name begins with “ h ” .
And these are n’t filtered by webbishness , either .
I might understand if they were local HTML , JPEG , and PNG files — but no , it seems to include all files recently accessed through Windows explorer or Lunascape .
I suppose that after you ’ve used Lunascape for a while , previously accessed web pages would start to dominate the results , but that ’s still a far cry from the psychic abilities of Chrome ’s address bar .
Lunascape supports RSS auto - discovery , placing a very busy , non-standard RSS icon at the end of the address bar when a site offers a feed :
Unfortunately , your only subscription option when you click this icon is to add the feed to a bookmarks folder within Lunascape .
Firefox users have come to expect more options , like automatically subscribing in your favorite feed reader instead .
You can add feeds to an RSS ticker that scrolls headlines in Lunascape ’s header :
But I find that to be more of a distraction than a benefit .
Likewise , the “ Popup News ” feature — who asked for that ?
Disabled .
Like most browsers ( and unlike Chrome ) Lunascape runs in a single process .
Initial testing indicates that Lunascape does a pretty good job of releasing memory as tabs are closed , though .
Overall , it does seem to be an efficient browser and it performs well when loading pages .
Unfortunately , it ’s currently only available for Windows XP and Vista as a 32 - bit executable .
Obviously , some sharp people have been working on this product .
It might be one to watch .
Unfortunately for us developers , its one more browser to test — er , make that three .
ANCHORAGE  When Gov. Sarah Palin meets Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday in the vice - presidential debate , even her fellow Alaskans might hear for the first time some of her views on health care reform , education policy and other issues of state government .
In her 22 months in office , Ms. Palin has not addressed many of those matters in a significant way , pursuing a narrower agenda rooted in Alaska ’s resource - based economy .
Ms. Palin has approved increased spending for education and the elderly , sued the federal government for listing the polar bear as a threatened species , and pushed for a bill that would have reduced state regulation of new medical facilities .
But by and large , oil and gas issues have dominated her tenure .
“ You ca n’t think of another area where there ’s been another drive or initiative coming out of the administration with the same level of intensity , ” said Scott Goldsmith , a professor of economics at the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage .

The only good EVM is one that has been clubbed with a sledgehammer .
At the Washington Post : The Greedy Old Pricks continue their voter suppression campaign .
This time the battleground is the Commonwealth of Virginia .
They are freaking out because Gov. Kaine restored the voting rights of 1,484 nonviolent felons that met the requirements for having their voting rights restored .
The GOP would prefer that they lose voting rights for life since they all must be democrats .
Since it appears that most are ' white collar ' criminals , I 'd bet that most are Republicans .
Another data point is the the previous Governor ( Warner ) restored the voting rights of 3,500 nonviolent offenders .
This is actually a full restoration of rights so the ex-convicts can also possess firearms again as well as vote .
Hunting is a big deal in VA .
This restoration of rights is automatic by law in most states .
Only Virginia and Kentucky require an act of the governor to restore voting rights to felons .
The GOP are whining like a bunch of little girls .
Perhaps they think that they are about to have their head handed to them .

As Judge of Elections I swear an oath to administer the election to the best of my abiliy .
Now , the fact that my sos pedro cortez and my local election board are ignoring the gross falability of PA 's paperless electronic voting machines and are only now being sued to have emergency paper ballots in place if 50 % of the machines break down ( which leads to unreasonable wait times for voting and lost votes ) .
I feel that in order to faithfully execute my job it is within my right to unplug faulty machines and have paper ballots ready in the event of problems .
I went to my county 's website and printed the sample ballot for my precinct .
On my own time and nickle I will print the new number of registered voter ballots .
I take my job seriously and if those above me will not address factual evidence and likely probabilities it is down to me the person .
Furthermore , I will stay at my precinct and count the votes with my coworkers and any one wishing to observe the counting .
The results will be posted outside my precinct before leaving to drive them to the election headquarters with a witness .
At this moment in time nothing less than the courage of those who have given their lives guides my conscience .
Any lawyers feel like commenting ?

John Martin , the black man has every right to be angry - to stop being invisible and stop being fearful of unjust incarceration or voter caging .
I agree the message was a little on the " strong " side , but maybe it 's about time !?!
Remember the 15th Amendment to our Constitution ?
Section 1 .
The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude .
Section 2 . The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation .
Now go back to the years 2000 and 2004 [ the years we have the most information on video and documented by people like Bob Fitrakis plus the other Ohio Lawyers , Greg Palast , Brad Friedman and other voting rights activists ] and count the number of Black Americans who were purposefully and unjustly disenfranchised .
We 've been trying to hold each individual in congress to his / her oath of office but they are still not upholding Section 2 of the 15th Amendment .
In 2005 Howard Dean [ Chairman of the Democratic Party ] admitted he had not read John Conyers ' What Went Wrong In Ohio : The Conyers Report On The 2004 Presidential Election .
Dean was n't the only one - if memory serves me , John Kerry admitted the same and there were others .
I hope Barack Obama read it , but some of his comments on the campaign trail make me wonder because I do n't think he gets it even yet - or maybe he 's playing his cards close to his chest .
Maybe it 's time for the hard - hitting comedy to bring attention to the anger we disenfranchised are feeling .
Hopefully , this along with the growing disgust for the racist theme of the McFailin campaign will finally spotlight the vile and pernicious slime that calls itself the GOP .

Hey Kira , I think the piece is funny and humor is a good way to get uncomfortable info across , but in these heightened times any excuse for martial law will do for these F**** , all of them .
Trust me , they 're doing their best to incite it , but MLK , Ghandi and my Mom are still my best role models .

Ancient - the times seem to be Damned if you Don't , Damned if you Do .
We 'll just have to wait and see about the Martial Law thing .
I hope there will be a revolt within the military if they try it .
If not , I guess we 'll all be digging tunnels to Canada .

I 'm advocating the use of Theater to express the anger .
Just wanted to make that clear .
Besides , this skit falls so far on the tame side compared to the reThug talking points .

* woot !* Irish Bookmaker Pays out on Obama as Next US President DUBLIN , Ireland , October 16 , 2008 / PRNewswire -FirstCall via COMTEX / ---
Following the concluding presidential debate in New York last night Ireland 's largest bookmaker , Paddy Power , has decided to pay out on Barack Obama as the forty - fourth President of the United States of America .
This unprecedented move comes almost three weeks ahead of Election Day on November 4th and sees the bookie paying out in excess of EUR1,000,000 [ $ 1,360,000 ] to Obama backers .
Prior to Paddy Power paying out , Obama was practically unbackable at odds of 1 - 9 to be the next American President ( meaning a bet of EUR90 was required to make EUR10 profit )
To date Paddy Power has taken over ten thousand bets on the 2008 US Presidential Election , the majority of which were placed in support on the Illinois Senator over the past 12 months .
In fact betting support was so strong for Obama that Paddy Power paid out over EUR50,000 ( $ 68,000 ) on his successful nomination as the Democratic Party candidate back in January of this year , seven months before the convention .
Paddy Power said " We declare this race well and truly over and congratulate all those who backed Obama , your winnings await you .
Although the Senator seemed a little off sorts in last nights final debate we believe he has done more than enough to get him across the line on November 4th .
The overall betting trends has shown one way traffic for Obama since the start of the summer and punters seemed to have called it 100 % correct .... " [ more at link ]

Hey Kira , I 'm Black Irish !
Me Da ( German Irish French Canadian ) used to love to tease my Spanish Ma about the Southern Spaniard integration of Muslin blood !
Man , you should have seen her eyes flash .
But my ma was never quick enough in her anger or bugus rightousness to mention when the Spainish Armada crashed on the southern Irish shore , thus Black Irish .
I grew up to say what 's the big deal !

I experienced a paradigm shift in my design approach recently , which I 'd like to put into writing , so I can formulate the rough thoughts in my head better .
Background
I 've been working on an Erlang AMI library implementation for a couple of weeks now .
I set out initially to write a simple AMI Client library that I could use to implement my application .
On the way , I had to learn eunit so I could thoroughly test as I built , not to mention , quickly build test the small blocks before integrating them .
After I built a working prototype ( with plenty of bugs which I was well aware of ) , I knew I had to unittest this properly , if I wanted to have confidence in the code not to mention bragging rights for well tested code .
First a problem
The problem with testing external connections like this is usually bootstrapping .
If I have asterisk installed on my dev machine , writing the tests is not a problem .
But if J. Random
Hacker grabs my source , and
out of habit types :
make test
They 're only going to get pass marks only if they have asterisk configured , and by some telepathic ethos among hackers , also set up his asterisk instance to have the same username and password as my own , among other things ( channels , etc ) .
Unfortunately , this does n't happen as much as we'd love it to :) .
There is a way around this using Mock frameworks ( which I 've never used by the way : D ) .
Anyways , I did what any hacker worth his mettle would do , I sucked it up , stashed the client code in its buggy state , and went ahead to implement a simulator from the same code base .
You what ?!!!
Yup ...
I 'm building AmiSym , which is an Asterisk AMI Simulator , and it shipswith the ami library ( so you get a client and server for the price of just the client ) .
Now onto the cool parts of doing this .
Advantage Number 1 - More experience
You can never over emphasise the value of increased experience when solving a domain specific problem .
In my case , I 'm basically solving the AMI problem a second time , even though it is from another perspective
( more on that below ) .
This give me more exposure to the problem , than I would have had if I 'd done a one - time - coding - pass and written the client library .
Infact , I end up tackling the AMI library problem 3 times .
Once when I implemented the prototype .
Once when I implemented the simulator .
And once when I reimplement the client with the experience I 've gained from implementing the simulator .
Advantage Number 2 - The other side
If I had stuck to writing just the client , I would probably come up with a well done client ( I mean , I love to consider myself a not - so - shabby programmer ) , but now that I am also implementing the server side , I get
to see the problem from both sides of the coin .
And that has impacted the way I understand the communication and the mechanisms that the client has to implement because I 'm designing both the producer and consumer .
For instance , I created an internal data structure to store the Key : Value pairs that are AMI responses , with a simple hack to deal with things like action : command results , which contain extra data that
do n't come in Key : Value pairs .
This worked satisfactorily for as far as I was just a client .
But once I started implementing the simulator , I decided I had to use the same data structure on both sides of the connection , immedietly , I found out my
Data structure would n't be symmetric .
That Is , I could n't do :
AMI RAW DATA => RESPONSE PARSER => INTERNAL REPRESENTATION
and then
INTERNAL REPRESENTATION
=> DESERIALIZER => AMI RAW DATA
This was a problem , since it would mean , either two code bases , or just mean that I should redesign my INTERNAL REPRESENTATION , which is what I did .
So I now have a more robust Data Structure , because I took a trip to the other side .
Advantage Number 3 - Borrowing
From the other side
If these were the only advantages , the code would already be better off , but there is more .
My design of the simulator State Machine and internal processes , end up being very sensible .
I attribute this to the fact that my first attempt at writing the simulator is in actualty , my second attempt at tackling an AMI library core .
Now , going back to the client , and I 'm borrowing a MIRROR image of the simulator process in the client .
Simply put , this makes a * lot* of sense .
It makes sense for a Client and Server of the same protocol , to be mirror images of each other , such that when plugged together , and a message in inserted into any them , it will loop through the virtual ring that is formed and " theoritically " come back in the same representation .
This is all kind of abstract , but just think of two halves of a hoop that fit perfectly together ... or YinYang ... each groove in one is complemented by an extrusion on the other , so they 're really just each other , only turned inside out .
I think that approaching any problem space from this perpective produces a much more robust and complete design and coded implementation .
Or to state it in cooler terms ... realizing the Zen of YinYang in
Client / Server systems yeilds better code and a better design .
Advantage Number 4 - Modularity
The final advantage I want to bring up is extreme modularity .
Usually , one can relate to modularity in its more common form .
Take for instance a problem where we write a generic TCP framework that allows one to inherit and extend to either an HTTP or SMTP module .
This I would like to call forward - divergent modularity , which refers to a single code base being made modular to allow the core functionality to be easily diverged down an irreversible path .
This is not type of modularity I gained .
The type of modularity I 'm referring to , which I 'd like to call cyclic - divergent modularity would best be described with the help of some funky diagrams .
Enjoy :P
The figure above shows what I have termed Forward - Divergent Modularity .
Each of UNIQUE CODE A and B have a common core or set of common core modules , which do similar stuff ( like open a socket , setup a generic session , store client_id / ip mappings in a HashMap , etc ) , but then each of them have their unique portions ( SMTP protocol versus HTTP protocol ) .
I call it forward - divergent , because a virtual message travelling through this system , would either start from CORE and move towards A , or move towards B . A system that is structured this way is an Either / Or system .
Nothing would make a single message cross camps .
You would not be able to " virtually " LOOP the above system at the UNIQUE CODE POINTS without introducing a protocol converter ( mostly impractical ) which
confirms that even though they have the same base , they 're different logical systems .
Now onto cycle - divergence .
The figure above shows what I term cyclic - divergent .
As you can see , this entire system turns out to be a Single virtual system , even though there is some uniqueness in A and B .
In this case , a " virtual " system message can be inserted at any point , and it should theoritically , go through various transforms , but by the time it returned to its originating point , it should be back to the same format it originated in .
In Conclusion - Dude Stop Being Abstract
Ok , I 'll stop . :)
I do n't know about you , but I 'm always thinking about code I write , and realisations like these , make me a better systems designer and implementor .
For instance , now that I know that I 'm actually building a single virtual unit , I have been able to identify that common core in my code base now .
My work from here on out is to widen the common core as much as possible , so that the unique parts are very small .
This will result in a more robust client library and server library , that both depend on a well tested and shaken core .
This is most decidedly better than implementing one in absense of the other would have resulted in .
As an aside , I 'm not so sure I would have seen this using a mock framework ( I 've never used one , so I do n't know ) .
This is not an anti-mock framework rant , just an observation anyways .
My personal conclusion then is that whenever one is implementing a protocol - ish library , there could be a lot to gain from also building the Other Side of the protocol in the same code base .
The important point of note is IN THE SAME CODE BASE .
So if I were to write an HTTP server , I would also write a client in the same code base , and use that in my testing .
Too much work ?
Yeah , maybe ... but its fun ... and its got its perks :)
Peace out .

Castagna Electrifies the Fiat 500
September 17th , 2008 by Courtney Carlisle Bolton
In the fifties , beach goers could jet around in the Fiat 500 Jolly meant to be a zippy golf cart replacement when running to the yacht or out to the course .
The hot Italian car design firm known for bringing the past into the present , Castagna , is building the Tender Two , a modern - day take on the Fiat 500 without the doors and back seat but keeping the zippy style and adding a few special features .
The Tender Two adds raised siding , teak wood , updated upholstery , and of course , a zero-emission electric engine , which gets up to 81 mph and a range of 140 km or 87 miles after a four hour charge of the battery .
Now , you just have to figure out how to get it from Italy to your driveway in time for summer .

A gene linked to male - to - female transsexualism has been uncovered by Australian researchers .
Following a similar finding for female - to - male transsexuals announced in July , the work strengthens the idea that transsexualism has a biological basis .
The study of 112 male - to - female volunteers – the biggest of its kind to date – found that they were more likely than normal males to have a long version of a gene that helps testosterone bind to cells , which could reduce its effects in the body .
The biological bases for gender identity are largely unknown , “ but we could speculate that [ effective ] testosterone signalling is required for male gender identity ” , says Vincent Harley at Prince Henry ’s Institute for Medical Research at Monash University in Melbourne , Australia , who led the work .
“ This signalling is weakened in male - to - female transsexuals , leading to decreased masculinisation of their brains ” .
Andrew Sinclair , director of early development and disease at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Melbourne agrees .

The work “ supports the notion that transsexualism has a biological basis rather than being due to psychosocial factors in early childhood , ” he says .
“ However the finding does not explain all male - to - female transsexuals , suggesting that multiple genetic factors are involved . ”
While the genetic link was statistically significant , it was weak – 55 % of the transsexuals had the long version of the gene , compared with 50 % of normal men .
Harley agrees that many more genes related to male - to - female transsexualism probably remain to be discovered .
A better understanding of this would also help in assigning sex to children born with ambiguous genitalia , which is a much more common condition than transsexualism , Harley says .

Should we fear fluoride in water ?
By Tom Warren
BBC News
Children who have fluoridated water enjoy healthier teeth , it is claimed A fierce debate is under way in Hampshire over whether to put fluoride in tap water for about 200,000 residents in and around Southampton .
But for years it has been added to drinking supplies for cities such as Birmingham and Newcastle .
So why is there still such concern ?
Tooth decay is a big problem among children in Southampton .
Last year more than 520 had to undergo general anaesthetics to have a total of 2,900 teeth removed .
So the city 's primary care trust wants fluoride added to water supplies to improve dental health .
Fluoridation is not a new idea that 's been dreamt up , it 's as old as the hills
Prof Michael Lennon , British Fluoridation Society
But the plan , currently at consultation stage , has sparked strong opposition from campaigners who claim it could cause tooth discolouration and other health problems .
Earlier this year residents of the Isle of Man rejected a similar scheme .
But millions of people in England already drink fluoridated water .
In the 1950s pilot schemes were carried out in the UK after some US cities began adding the substance to their supplies .
Today , most of the West Midlands , large parts of the North East and parts of the East Midlands , East and North West have fluoridated water .
Deprived areas
In February this year Health Secretary Alan Johnson called for fluoride to be added to more water supplies to reduce tooth decay among some of society 's poorest and most vulnerable people .
Prof Michael Lennon , chairman of the British Fluoridation Society , believes there are major health benefits for deprived areas and people are wrong to oppose the move .
He said fears over fluorosis [ teeth discolouration ] and other side affects were misguided .
" About 10 % of the UK is currently fluoridated and our view is we should extend that to about 30 % of the population , " he said .
Campaigners fear adding the mineral could cause fluorosis in children " Fluoridation is not a new idea that 's been dreamt up , it 's as old as the hills .
" We have conducted public opinion surveys for the last 15 years and public support for fluoridation is quite high , 65 to 75 % think it 's a good idea .
" But 10 to 20 % oppose it vehemently .
I 'm not sure why but I think it boils down to a view about ethics and public health responsibility .
" [ Opponents ] will use all sorts of statistics about fluorosis .
If this is true how come two million people in Birmingham have been drinking fluoridated water since 1964 ?
These arguments just do n't stack up . "
The British Dental Association ( BDA ) also backs fluoridation .
" One of the most compelling arguments is it can help reduce health inequalities , " a spokeswoman said .
I do n't think anything should be added to the water as a medicine , because it 's the beginning of the end
Brian Donohoe MP , All Party Parliamentary Group Against Fluoridation
" Six of the top 10 places for children with the best dental health have fluoridated water .
" I 'm sure there 's an element of fear of the unknown , people do n't like things to be added to the water supply .
" I think that 's understandable , but equally it 's very important that people supporting fluoridation explain the case .
" [ Fluoride ] is not a poison , it 's an occurring mineral .
" The BDA feels very strongly that targeted fluoridation is appropriate to redress serious dental decay . "
Less than 1 % of people who have fluoridated water suffer from fluorosis , she added .
But Ann Richards , a member of Hampshire Against Fluoridation , strongly disagrees .
The group is drawing up petitions , leaflets and DVDs to distribute to people in and around Southampton arguing against the change .
' Nasty poison '
Mrs Richards said , as well as fluorosis in children , evidence showed fluoride in water could lead to irritable bowel syndrome , rashes and nausea among some people .
" There are a lot of very angry people out there .
" The authorities that put it in the water have no control over the dose that people get , " she said .
" There has been no examination of the population to determine what it is doing .
It is a vicious nasty poison and it's one that accumulates in the body . "
And it is not only people in Hampshire who are opposed to the move .
Several years ago a number of MPs formed the All Party Parliamentary Group Against Fluoridation .
Its chairman Brian Donohoe , Labour MP for Central Ayrshire , said he wanted the public to get the full facts about fluoridation and not be " duped " into accepting it .
" I do n't think anything should be added to the water as a medicine , because it 's the beginning of the end .
" What 's to stop you adding other things as medicine ?
" I do n't think it should be imposed upon people without them having a say .
There has to be a poll of the public . "

What are these ?
One of the first clues of how the Obama administration will deal with the issue of domestic surveillance may come in a court case in Alexandria , Va. , where a judge has ordered the Justice Department to turn over material from the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies on possible eavesdropping on Ali al - Timimi , an Islamic leader convicted of supporting terrorism .
The Justice Department has never acknowledged that it has used intercepts from the N.S.A. program in any criminal or civil case , which could be unlawful because the wiretaps were conducted without court warrants .
Mr. Timimi has claimed that he did not get a fair trial because prosecutors secretly used N.S.A. wiretaps in his case , and he also argues that the government has turned over to the court only intercepted conversations that make him look guilty , while withholding those that might prove he is innocent .
A recently unsealed transcript , citing a closed hearing , strongly suggests that the wiretaps were used in Mr. Timimi ’s criminal trial .
“ We believe that the undisclosed interceptions already uncovered in this case are serious and knowing violations of federal law , ” said Jonathan Turley , a lawyer for Mr. Timimi .
Meanwhile , an Islamic charity in Oregon that had its assets frozen by the Treasury Department on the ground that it was also supporting terrorism is pushing ahead with a lawsuit of its own .
The Obama administration must decide whether to continue to use the state - secrets privilege in order to block the disclosure of information about any N.S.A. eavesdropping .
The charity , Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , is charging , based in part on a classified document that the government mistakenly gave to its lawyers , that it was the target of wiretapping without warrants .
Lawyers for the group say they believe that the N.S.A. listened illegally not only to the international phone calls of members of the charity itself , but also to the calls of two of its lawyers in Washington .
Mr. Eisenberg , a lawyer for Al - Haramain , said the Justice Department had frustrated efforts to develop evidence in the case both by invoking the state - secrets claim and by refusing to grant security clearances to some members of the charity ’s legal team .

“ In every way , they ’ve stonewalled us , and the new administration can change all that , ” Mr. Eisenberg said .
“ They can take the blindfolds off . ”
In answering Gwen Ifill ’s question about vice presidential powers at last week ’s debate , Joe Biden redirected attention to the still not very well known concept of the “ unitary executive . ”
Biden charged that Dick Cheney had become “ the most dangerous vice president we ’ve had probably in American history ” because of his attempts to create a super - powerful unitary executive .
Biden did n’t take time to explain exactly what he meant , but it ’s an extremely important , poorly understood subject , and it ’s time to question the presidential candidates -- closely -- about it .
Plenty of presidents have worked to increase presidential power over the years , but the theory of the unitary executive , first proposed under President Reagan , has been expanded since then by every president , Democrat and Republican alike .
Reagan ’s notion was that only a strong president would be able to dramatically limit big government .
Perhaps drawing on a model for unitary corporate leadership in which the CEO also serves as chairman of the board , the so - called unitary executive promised undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies , expanded unilateral powers and avowedly adversarial relations with Congress .
In the years that followed , Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society conservatives worked to provide a constitutional cover for this theory , producing thousands of pages in the 1990s claiming -- often erroneously and misleadingly -- that the framers themselves had intended this model for the office of the presidency .
Unitarians ( for lack of a better word ) want to expand the many existing uncheckable executive powers -- such as executive orders , decrees , memorandums , proclamations , national security directives and legislative signing statements -- that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid , interference or consent from Congress .
Ardent proponents even insist that there are times when the president -- like a king -- should operate above the law .
Presidents and their supporters justify the unitary executive with an expansive reading of Article II of the Constitution ( which sets out the role of the executive branch ) , invariably citing congressional log- jamming ( what we used to call “ checking and balancing ” ) or national security .
Each president since 1980 has used the theory to seize more and more power .
Reagan used expanded unilateral powers to launch an era of deregulation .
Presidents George H.W. Bush , Clinton and George W. Bush all used the legislative signing statement -- the written text they are allowed to give when signing a bill into law in order to explain their position -- not simply to offer warnings and legal interpretations but to make unilateral determinations about the validity of the provisions of particular statutes .
The American Bar Assn. denounced this practice in 2006 as presenting “ grave harm to the separation of powers doctrine , and the system of checks and balances , that have sustained our democracy for more than two centuries . ”
One problem is that presidential unilateralism can seem reassuring in times of crisis , so it often receives congressional support .
Most recently , in the name of managing our fiscal crisis , Congress has granted unprecedented powers to the executive and to an unelected and unaccountable secretary of the Treasury .
Another problem is that once Congress gives powers to the executive branch , it seldom can get them back .
In 2001 , Congress granted Bush the authorization to use military force against terrorists ; five years later , when Congress sought to take back some of that authority by passing a bipartisan anti-torture bill , Bush was unwilling to back down .
Instead , he signed the bill into law but appended a signing statement insisting that he would uphold the law in a manner consistent with “ the constitutional authority of the president to supervise the unitary executive branch and as commander in chief . ”
In other words , he would ignore its provisions if he felt they limited his authority .
Bush ’s aggressive exercise of unilateral powers has attracted serious opposition .
Unfortunately , too many imagine that the unitary executive doctrine and its kingly prerogatives will leave office with him .
That hope is false .
History teaches that presidents do not give up power -- both Democrats and Republicans have worked to keep it .
And besides , hoping the next president will give back some powers means conceding that it is up to him to make that decision .
If people have found Bush ’s exercise of executive power alarming , they should not only begin questioning presidential candidates about it , they should make it clear to their congressional representatives that they want these excess powers checked .
Barack Obama has already promised that he will continue using signing statements , though he will not act as if they have the force of law .
Interestingly enough , John McCain has suggested he will end the practice .
These slim indicators deserve more pressure and scrutiny .

MDMA may boost the benefits of psychotherapy , trial suggests .
The controversial drug MDMA - known to recreational users as ' ecstasy ' - can help ease the effects of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , according to the first phase - II clinical trial into the potential therapeutic benefits of using the drug as an adjunct to psychotherapy .
Most patients in the trial who were given psychotherapy treatment along with doses of MDMA ( 3 , 4 - methylenedioxy -< i > N < /i>- methyl amphetamine ) experienced statistically significant reductions in the severity of their condition after two months , compared with a control group who received psychotherapy and a placebo .
MDMA may help those undergoing psychotherapy to be less defensive and trust their therapist more , helping their recovery .
Punchstock
" It 's important to realize this is a small pilot study and it will be necessary to replicate the results elsewhere , " says Michael Mithoefer , a private - practice psychiatrist based in South Carolina who led the study .
" But it 's evidence that this should be studied further . "
Mithoefer believes that MDMA tends to decrease levels of fear and defensiveness and increase levels of trust when used in a clinical setting .
" It can remove some of the obstacles in therapy and act as a catalyst to the therapeutic process , " he says .
" As someone who sees people with severe untreatable PTSD in my clinic , I think these results are very exciting , " says David Nutt , a psychopharmacologist at the University of Bristol , UK .
" These data give further credence to the idea that there 's a medical use for MDMA . "
The results , which have yet to be submitted to a peer - reviewed scientific journal , were presented today at the 24th annual convention of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies in Chicago , Illinois .
Powerful flashbacks
MDMA is an illegal drug of abuse in Europe , the United States , and many other countries , but its therapeutic promise for trauma victims was first investigated by psychotherapists in California in the 1970s and early 1980s when the drug was relatively unknown , and still legal ( see ' A Brief History of MDMA ' ) 1 .
The symptoms of PTSD usually strike within three months of a person being involved in a disturbing event , such as sexual assault , torture , warfare , or witnessing a severe accident .
The condition can lead sufferers to become withdrawn , depressed and unable to function because of powerful flashbacks that repeatedly expose the victim to the debilitating emotions of the original event .
A combination of cognitive behavioural therapy and treatment with drugs such as Seroxat ( paroxetine ) can lead to recovery within months .
However , Nutt points out that up to 20 % of patients do not respond to any conventional treatments .
Mithoefer spent more than five years seeking approval to find out whether MDMA can help those non-responsive patients .
His study was funded to the tune of $ 1 million by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ( MAPS ) , a psychedelics advocacy group based in California .
Traumatic times
Most of the 23 treatment - resistant patients in the study were female victims of sexual trauma ; two patients were male veterans of the 2003 Iraq war .
The patients completed a series of tests to assess the severity of their PTSD , before undergoing a series of therapy sessions - one of which was conducted after taking either MDMA or a placebo .
Four days later they underwent further psychological tests and therapy sessions .
After this whole sequence had been completed twice , subjects who received the placebo could then opt to move onto an open - label trial so that everyone could experience treatment having taken MDMA .
A total of 21 participants completed all three rounds of the full experimental cycle .
Two months after the last experimental session , psychologist Mark Wagner of the Medical University of South Carolina , who was not involved in any of the experimental sessions , assessed the patients ' PTSD symptoms .
Ninety - two per cent of participants had a clinically significant reduction in their clinician - administered PTSD scale ( CAPS ) scores of 30 % or more .
Only 25 % of the placebo group saw comparable reductions in CAPS scores .
No ill - effects were seen in any of the participants .
Mithoefer believes that it is the combination of therapy and MDMA that is effective , and not the drug alone .
" Subjects need good follow - up to help integrate the experience because it can stir up strong emotions , " he says .
Small hope
Whereas Nutt agrees with Mithoefer that the results should prompt follow - up studies , Simon Wessely , a psychiatrist based at King 's College London , UK , says the study is far too small to draw any meaningful conclusions .
" In my experience , treatment - resistant PTSD is a complex disorder with many causes – we should be very cautious about any ' miracle ' cures , " he says .
As consultant adviser in psychiatry to the British Army , Wessely adds that he will not be recommending this treatment based on current evidence .
Swiss psychiatrists have previously reported data on MDMA use in a therapeutic context , but the subjects also received LSD psychotherapy .
Although the results were broadly positive , it was not possible to separate the effects of each drug .
A similar MDMA - PTSD trial in Spain , which ran between 2000 and 2002 , was halted following negative publicity after several local deaths associated with recreational use2 .
Other MDMA - PTSD studies are underway in Israel and Switzerland .
MAPS founder , Rick Doblin , is in no doubt that the results are of fundamental significance .
" For the entire 22 years of MAPS ' existence we 've been struggling to study the therapeutic use of MDMA , " he says .
" And the results suggest MDMA psychotherapy can be more effective than any prescription medicine currently available from the pharmaceutical industry . "

Barack Obama and John McCain made a number of arguable claims during their second presidential debate .
The BBC News website took a look to see which claims stacked up - and which ones were less than accurate .
OIL COMPANIES ' UNUSED ACRES Claim : Barack Obama said : " The oil companies ... currently have 68 million acres that they 're not using .
Either you use them or you lose them . "
Fact : Mr Obama was probably basing his claim on a June report from the Democratic staff of the House Natural Resources Committee , which cited statistics from the Interior Department 's Minerals Revenue Management that classified 67,055,715 acres of oil and gas leases as " non-producing " in 2007 .
But just because land is defined as " non-producing " , it does n't mean that it is not being used .
It can take more than 10 years for an oil company to start producing oil or natural gas from a parcel of land , during which they are often engaging in serious exploratory work .
Throughout this time , however , the land parcel in question must officially be described as " non-producing " .
Verdict :
It is misleading for Mr Obama to use statistics about " non-producing " land to make a point about oil companies not using their existing land holdings .
OBAMA'S 94 VOTES TO RAISE TAXES Claim : John McCain said Mr Obama " has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts " .
Fact :
The claim comes from a Republican National Committee fact sheet , which counted votes on non-binding budget resolutions , as well as votes that , in the opinion of Politifact.com " would not have resulted in a net tax increase , but instead redistributed the burden among different payers " .
Using the RNC 's methodology , in an effort to demonstrate the bogusness of the McCain team 's claims , the Obama campaign released their own fact sheet detailing the 477 times that Mr McCain had " voted for tax increases or against tax cuts " .
Verdict : Technically , Mr McCain 's claim can be stood up , but - as the Obama camp 's tallying of McCain 's 477 pro-tax hike votes demonstrates , such apparent statistical exactness actually obfuscates more than it enlightens .
WHO INVENTED THE COMPUTER ?
Claim : Mr Obama said that " the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out , for defence purposes , how to communicate " .
Fact : Early versions of the computer were developed by governments during World War II , but the personal computer was created by private enterprise in the 1980s .
However , the first version of the internet was created as a secure network by US defence scientists working for ARPA who were trying to find a way to protect networks from nuclear attack .
Verdict :
It does sound here like Mr Obama was referring to the internet , but misspoke .
OBAMA'S SUPPORT FOR OIL COMPANY TAX BREAKS Claim : John McCain said that " an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies , billions for the oil companies ... sponsored by Bush and Cheney " was supported by " that one " , meaning Barack Obama .
Fact : Mr Obama did vote for the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which did indeed contain tax breaks for oil companies .
But , as Factcheck.org have pointed out " according to a Congressional Research Service report , more tax breaks were taken away from oil companies than were given .
Overall , the Act resulted in a small net tax increase on the oil industry . "
The Act contained about $ 2.6 bn of tax cuts for the oil and gas industry , but also $ 2.9bn of tax increases on the oil and gas industry .
It also provided tax breaks to alternative sources of energy .
Verdict : Mr McCain 's claim is misleading - the opposite of his claim is actually the case .

What are these ?
You know holiday shopping is offensive and wasteful .
You know Christmas " wish lists " and " gift exchanges " degrade the concept of giving .
You know Christmas marketing is a scam , benefiting manufacturers , stores , and huge corporations , while driving individuals into debt .
You know this annual consumer frenzy wreaks havoc on the environment , filling landfills with useless packaging and discarded gifts .
Yet , every year , you cave in and go shopping .
The relentless onslaught of advertising exerts constant pressure .
So do the unified bleatings of herds of shoppers , who call you " Scrooge " if you fail to enthusiastically join their ritual orgy of consumption .
Friends and family needle you with gift requests , store windows beckon with shiny colorful packages , the same " classic " holiday jingles are piped constantly through every speaker in town .
How can you resist ?
Join the Christmas Resistance Movement !
The growing CHRISTMAS RESISTANCE MOVEMENT is joined in solidarity against the Shopping Season .
For every 100 automatons who call you " Scrooge , " there 's a sparkly - eyed CHRISTMAS RESISTOR who supports YOU in NOT BUYING INTO THE HOLIDAY HYSTERIA .
Together , we boycott Christmas Shopping , Christmas decorations , Christmas cards , and every variety of Christmas Crap .
We refuse to support the Holiday Industry .
We show our love for friends and family by giving our time and care , not by purchasing consumer goods .
We maintain the integrity of giving by giving spontaneously and from our hearts , rather than during a specified season .
For the whole quarter the lagging indicators who populate the Inside the Beltway political establishment have predicted that the Democrats will probably net 8 - 12 House seats .
The daring ones predicted -- in their giddiest moods -- that the net could be ... 20 .
They 're a stupid and clueless as they were in 2006 , where the 31 new Democrats came as a shock .
Today Ted Stevens trial wraps up and if he 's found guilty his Senate seat is gone .
If the jury finds there is n't enough clear evidence to find him guilty he may still lose the election since he is very clearly guilty of having taken bribes and everyone in Alaska knows it .
But today 's big race shakeup is across Capitol Hill on the House side .
altered their ratings on 23 more House races .
The 23 races are 23 more that are now less likely to be Republican after November .
We discussed 8 races in the Midwest headed in a Democratic direction on Friday .
A bunch of lowlife Blue Dogs are safer in Illinois and Indiana and a bunch of Republican Bush rubber stamps are a bit less safe throughout the region ; no surprises and ... nothing too exciting , although it is looking more and more likely that the robot the GOP has in Cincinnati , Steve Chabot will lose out to a " moderate " Democratic state Rep , Steve Dreihaus .
Except one : in Iowa 's 4th CD there was something exciting : 7 - term incumbent Repug , Tom Latham is no longer considered safe and Becky Greenwald , once considered a " longshot , " is now seen as a real contender .
You can donate to Becky 's campaign on the special ActBlue page targeting GOP hypocrites , like Latham , who voted for Bill Clinton 's impeachment .
Today 's ratings changes deal with the South and West and many of the changes , at least in the South , presage conservative Democrats replacing fascist - oriented and extremist Republicans .
The race with the most national import is in the Orlando CD ( FL - 08 ) where two consecutive polls show very progressive and very outspoken Alan Grayson beating tired lard - ass Ric Keller .
Still lagging , downgrades Keller 's chances by calling it a " toss up . "
If Grayson does win , his experience and intellect will propel him into a leadership role within the progressive movement .
He 's another one like Darcy Burner and Donna Edwards who will be important to his own constituents and important to the United States of America .
There 's not a more important race you can contribute to anywhere .
Keeping his powerful TV ads ( like this one ) are an effective and worthwhile way to spend grassroots contributions .
The one bright spot in Alabama is the 3rd district where far right lunatic fringe Republican Mike Rogers is looking like he could lose to a decent true moderate ( not a conservative monstrosity calling himself a moderate ) , Josh Segall .
Last week Josh was added to the DCCC 's red to blue program .
Other races where GOP hacks ' chances of survival were downgraded include : FL - 24 where Suzanne Kosmas is starting to look like a winner over one of Congress ' most corrupt members , Tom Feeney , an Abramoff satellite who has n't been indicted yet .
KY - 02 where David Boswell is gaining on Brett Guthrie is a seat left open by the retirement of Ron Lewis .
LA -01 where Democrat Jim Harlan is looking alive in his battle against far right extremist Steve Scalise , a freshman who won the special election a few months ago to replace Bobby Jindal .
I do n't see this district changing hands , although Scalise is on the Mean Jean Schmidt / Michele Bachmann level of extremism .
NC - 10 -- worse even than Scalise is the GOP incumbent , Patrick McHenry , a closet queen , who is being challenged by war hero Daniel Johnson .
It 's a very red district but Johnson is the right candidate to beat McHenry .
SC -01 where far right zombie Henry Brown is suddenly in jeopardy from Linda Ketner , who has outraised him and out - campaigned him .
It 's a district where enthusiasm for Obama among African - Americans and young people could propel Ketner to an unlikely win in a district that gave Bush 61 % of its vote in 2004 .
SC - 02 where another Iraq War vet , Rob Miller , is offering a significant challenge to Joe Wilson a congressman who has amassed one of the most disgraceful and radical voting records of anyone in the House .
The West offers far better opportunities for progressives and has more worthwhile races for donors interested in changing the actual conservative bent of Congress .
In most of these races , it wo n't just mean replacing a Republican conservative with a Democratic conservative but replacing a Republican conservative with a real progressive .
The newchanges include : AZ - 03 where Bob Lord could rid the political system of corrupt hypocrite and bizarre extremist John Shadegg .
CA-03 where extremist Dan Lungren is running neck and neck with very progressive Bill Durston CA - 26 where Blue Anerica - endorsed Russ Warner is on the verge of making history but replacing right - wing corrupt closet queen David Dreier .
CA - 46 , where progressive energy maven and Huntington Beach mayor Debbie Cook is virtually tied with one of California 's worst representatives from either party , Dana Rohrabacher , who has done more for his pals in the Taliban than he has for Orange County working families .
CA -50 where Nick Leibham is quickly catching up with corrupt GOP lobbyist Brian Bilbray .
ID -01 where the much disliked radical right Bill Sali , who has a well - earned reputation as a liar and a thug , is facing a credible challenge -- and a tied race -- from Walt Minnick .
Now , remember , these were just the changes , looking through their rearview mirror , published today .
It does n't take into account quick moving developments , like Michele Bachmann 's national unmasking as a McCarthyite , like Dennis Shulman beating Scott Garrett in last night 's debate , or like a shocking endorsement from the staunchly conservativein Michigan 's 9th CD for Gary Peters or even Mario Diaz - Balart 's psychotic episode .
Yes , this is going to be a very good year for Democratic congressional candidates -- and the insiders are just starting to get a sense of the magnitude .
It 's not coming from the efforts of the DCCC or from any insider groups .
It 's coming because Americans are tired of being lied to and ripped off by Republicans and their corporate allies .
Our program with SaysMe.tv allows netroots activists to pick out ads and TV networks and times of the day they want to run their own advertising for their own campaigns .
Please check it out and see if there 's a candidate or an ad in the system you 'd like to see on local TV .
Here 's one for Debbie Cook that I particularly like :
For all the talk about how Democrats have a cash advantage over Republicans this cycle , when you look at the ten top- raising House challengers , half of them are Republicans : 1. Multimillionaire Sandy Treadwell ( NY - 20 ) - $ 5.4 million , all but a million of it from his own deep pockets , will be decisively beaten by moderate Democratic freshman Kirsten Gillibrand .
2. Multimillionaire Jim Oberweis ( IL - 14 ) - $ 5 million ( $ 3.8 million from himself ) , is eager to be beaten by conservative Democrat Bill Foster again .
3 .
Deborah Honeycutt ( GA - 13 ) -- $ 4.4 million -- is challenging a reactionary corporate Democrat , David Scott , by being far more reactionary and far more corporate .
They did this in 2006 as well and he 'll beat her again .
6 . Multimillionaire Chris Hackett ( PA - 10 ) -- $ 2.7 million , about half from her own deep pockets -- is probably going to be beaten by reactionary Blue Dog Chris Carney who is well financed from the lobbyists and corporate buddies he 's made by voting like a Republican .
8 . William Russell ( PA - 12 ) -- $ 2.5 million -- has no chance against Jack Murtha but insists on running a scurrilous vanity campaign anyway .
He does n't appear to have filed the paperwork with the FEC that would indicate where he 's getting all that money from .

Cern 's Large Hadron Collider is out of action until next year .
What will physics junkies and apocalyptic prophets talk about until then ?
Legal challenges , electrical faults , hackers , death threats , and even suicides were n't enough to bring down Cern 's Large Hadron Collider – but a simple technical fault and the cold Swiss winter seems to have succeeded where they failed .
CERN confirmed on Saturday that a mechanical fault is forcing it to shut down the experiment .
You can read more about it in Ian Sample 's breakdown of the breakdown , but the fallout is that physicists will now have to wait until spring for any signs of the Higgs boson .
Reaction to the technical glitch has been mixed .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , given fears about the experiment 's potential to destroy the entire world , some have wondered if ' science ' itself has come to the planet 's rescue .
One explanation relies on invoking the anthropic principle and ' quantum suicide ' theory .
If an LHC run at full - throttle actually did destroy everything , then the only outcome of the experiment that we could ever observe would be a technical failure ( like a helium leak , perhaps ) .
Anything else would be logically impossible .
Not quite far - fetched enough ?
Try Cern physicist Kevin Black 's eerily prescient commentary on time - travelling quantum particles that are probably weird enough to confuse Doctor Who .
The suggestion is that if the LHC did / does / will ( tenses fail me ) produce the Higgs boson , the particle might behave strangely enough to come back to the point in time where it was born and prevent its own creation .
It 's even claimed that you could test this .
Long wait
But assuming nature herself is n't saving us from our own folly , the few months between now and when the collider is scheduled to start again will give the Citizens Against the LHC more time to present their case .
Look out for more protests and lawsuits from Walter Wagner in the new year .
For the researchers themselves , the news is a big setback – Cern 's director general admitted it was a " psychological blow " – but maybe not entirely unexpected .
The machine has " many , many elements , and some of them had never been used , " as MIT 's Bolek Wyslouch points out .
" It 's impossible not to have things break " .
Judith Jackson , based at Fermilab , concurs , reflecting that " these things happen " .
So while we 're waiting , where can particle physicists get their particular fix ?
Well , try Fermilab .
Until Cern 's LHC comes back online , its Tevatron is still the world 's most powerful collider , and is still turning up strange particles .
Or you can watch as researchers play with and fine - tune ATLAS and the CMS ( they 're two of a kind , apparently ) in readiness for switch - on 2.0 , as well as ogling some of ALICE 's early photos .
Plus there 's the build up to the official launch of the LHC Grid supercomputer – look out for more from our science blog on that next week .
And if that 's a bit heavy , there 's always time for some idle speculation on how long it would take the LHC to cook a pizza ( or doom - mongers ) .
In any case , while some will be rejoicing that the world is n't ending just yet , genuine physics junkies will just need to develop the patience of a physicist and wait for the LHC to come out of hibernation .
If you want an idea of exactly how exciting that 's going to be , you can follow the action ( almost ) live on the ATLAS experiment webcam …

For the first time in my adult life , I am proud of my country :
( Photo credit to the brother of my friend Dan Smith .
I do n't know his name , but I 'm sure he 's equally proud to be an American . )
The horse , called Gracie , was unable to free itself and could have been in danger were it not for a passer - by who was able to come to the rescue after he heard the horse whinnying .
Described as the eighth wonder of the world by those who saw it , the Amber Room is certainly the most unique missing treasure in history .
It was an 11 - foot - square hall consisting of large wall panels inlaid with several tons of superbly designed amber , large gold - leaf - edged mirrors , and four magnificent Florentine mosaics .
Arranged in three tiers , the amber was inlaid with precious jewels , and glass display cases housed one of the most valuable collections of Prussian and Russian artwork ever assembled .
Created for Prussia 's King Friedrich I and given to Russian czar Peter the Great in 1716 , it was located at Catherine Palace , near St. Petersburg .
Today , the Amber Room would be valued at more than $ 142 million .
When Adolf Hitler turned his Nazi war machine toward Russia , the keepers of the Amber Room got nervous .
They tried to move it , but the amber began to crumble , so they tried to cover it with wallpaper .
They were unsuccessful and when the Nazis stormed Leningrad ( formerly called St. Petersburg ) in October 1941 , they claimed it and put it on display in Königsberg Castle during the remaining war years .
However , when Königsberg surrendered in April 1945 , the fabled treasure was nowhere to be found .
The Amber Room was never seen again .
Did the Soviets unwittingly destroy their own treasure with bombs ?
Was it hidden in a now lost subterranean bunker outside the city ?
Or was it destroyed when Königsberg Castle burned shortly after the city surrendered ?
We 'll probably never know for sure .
But fortunately for lovers of opulence , the Amber Room has been painstakingly recreated and is on display in Catherine Palace .
Preamble : Morning .
It 's a pity Roy Jones Jr could n't shave a few years off for this fight – well actually , 15 years to be honest .
He reminds me of Oasis , full of bluster in 2008 , but with his biggest hits belonging way back in the mid-1990s .
But when Roy Jones
Jr was good , he was unstoppable .
The punch that floored the undefeated IBF super - middleweight champion James ' Lights Out '
Toney at the beginning of the third round in 1994 was like a bolt from the blue .
It also announced him onto the world scene .
And if anybody still needed convincing of his class , four months later , he knocked out Antoine Byrd in the first round with rare skill and raw power to defend the title .
Despite a disqualification defeat to Montell Griffin in 1997 , Jones Jr dominated at both super - middleweight and then light - heavyweight through the late 1990s until his fading star burnt out with three defeats in a row in 2004 - 05 – two to Antonio Carver and one to Glen Johnson .
These defeats , two knockouts and a points loss , effectively put an end to his reputation as a serious prospect .
Now aged 39 , and lacking the incredible speed in the ring that used to be his trademark , Jones Jr will have to draw on all his experience and ring craft to score a victory against Calzaghe .
At the weigh - in he looked enormous , so perhaps he 's hoping to conserve his energy and , like Bernard Hopkins displayed with some success , attack the Welshman sparingly , but with great power .
As for the unbeaten Joe Calzaghe , he has maintained a high level throughout his career .
People first stood up and took note of his talent 11 years ago when he beat a below - par , but still dangerous , Chris Eubank over 12 rounds .
He has grown into himself as a boxer in the years since , recovering from his first ever knockdown against big- hitting Byron Mitchell in 2003 , to annihilate his opponent with a deadly assault of 26 unanswered punches to claim victory just a little over a minute after tasting the canvas himself .
If the bout with Mitchell was evidence of Calzaghe 's burning pride , his clash with Kenya 's Evans Ashira in 2005 , proved he had the heart and skill worthy of an undefeated champion .
After breaking his left hand early in the third round , Calzaghe fought on for nine rounds with only his rapid right jab to win a unanimous points victory .
This rare ability to fling out countless jabs , thus giving his opponents no let - up , has served him well over the years and came to the fore in career - defining points wins against the heavily fancied Jeff Lacy and the hard - as - nails Dane Mikkel Kessler , whom Calzaghe defeated to unify the WBA , WBO and WBC super - middleweight titles .
Calzaghe 's biggest weakness could be a feeling within himself that he should have perhaps hung up his gloves after his brilliant win against Kessler .
At light - heavyweight against the aged but crafty Hopkins , Calzaghe looked like he was winding down as he struggled to get inside the American .
Thanks to a desperate flurry of punches late in the fight he won narrowly , and some would say fortuitously , on a split decision .
I can't see that he will show any such complacency in his final ever fight this morning , but there is just enough doubt lingering around Calzaghe 's brittle hands for me to believe that he 'll have to go the full 12 rounds to end his career with a perfect record .
Right , I 'm back and fully loaded on coffee .
In the pre-fight build - up Calzaghe has already intimated that he might continue fighting after tonight .
" This is probably my last fight , " he said , much to the chagrin of his concermned mother I presume .
Here are some of your pre-fight emails : " This reminds me a lot of the Lewis vs Tyson fight , " says Chay in Chorleywood .
" A good British boxer who 's not really had many decent opponents to face during their prime , and wants to be seen to beat a big name who was once one of boxing 's best ever .
And just like Lewis , Calzaghe will systematically take Jones apart until he can't take anymore .
Maybe 6 - 8 rounds . "
Jeff Lacy was no mug Chay and Kessler gave Calzaghe one hell of a fight , but I agree that Calzaghe never got involved with the big names like Roy Jones Jr and Bernard Hopkins when they were at their best , and I doubt he'd have been up to their level in the mid to late 90s .
" I'm Welsh and living in Los Angeles , " says Michael Aston .
My brother lives in LA Michael , say hello if you see him .
He 's got dark hair and - oh never mind ...
Continue .
" I want Roy to win this one .
He is a most noble man and a truly great champion .
The Italian / Welsh boy will have the greatest lesson there is : humility and respect . "
Interesting Michael .
Does n't Jones
Jr cross the border to go dog-fighting in Mexico ?
Not much nobility in that .
But anyway , an interesting switch of allegiances .
I 'm not sure Tom Jones would be too thrilled with you backing Jones Jr though .
The Observer 's Kevin Mitchell is at ringside and here is his scene - setter :
All week , the word has been that the Garden would be half - full for this fight - but , whether or not the gate was papered over by complimentaries , it is n't a bad turn - out .
And most of the singing , of course , has a Welsh lilt .
The bars around the famous old barn have been heaving for hours .
Calzaghe has been a 3 - 1 on betting favourite with most odds - makers , Jones a 3 - 1 outsider .
However , early 50 - 1 odds on a draw have been cut to 20 - 1 now punters have seen the value there .
So far there has been nothing on the undercard that you would remember for long , apart , maybe , from the performance of Emanuel Augustus , who is 33 and has been boxing since 1994 .
He hip - hopped , he shimmied and he banged as best he could , smiling all the time at his considerably younger opponent , Francisco Figueroa .
None of which prevented his posting the 30th defeat of his 72 - fight career .
They never give it to the old guy if it 's close .
The celeb count is n't extraordinary , although Lennox Lewis got a good cheer as he strolled to his seat .
Mikkel Kessler , who gave Joe his toughest fight , is at ringside , as is Bernard Hopkins , still angling for a rematch with whoever wins the main event .
That wo n't happen .
More emails : " Is this an exhibition match ? " barks Derek Talbot .
" We have one of the best pound - for - pound fighters ever reducing himself at 39 to fighting a slap / box boxer who always chooses the easy fight .
Big deal if Calzaghe wins .
He 's won no respect regardless . "
It does have that Harlem Globetrotters feel in which names are used to sell meaningless contests .
Let 's hope Jones
Jr has something left in the tank to make this mean something .
" Hopkins is sticking by his prediction of a win for Jones Jr , " says Kevin Mitchell , ringside in New York .
As Calzaghe 's last opponent I suppose Bernard Hopkins knows better than most how to give the Welshman a rough time , but surely a Jones win is a tall order .
The final fight on the undercard is still ongoing so we 've a while longer to wait before the main event gets underway .
Meanwhile your predictions keep coming .
" Jones before round eight is a worry , " says Laurance Langdon .
" But Joe over the 12 , thanks to his sheer work ethic . "
" Having hopefully sneaked the fight on some illicit broadband network I 'm determined to stay awake , " says tinternet criminal Paul Woods .
" I think Jones will knock Calzaghe down in the first couple of rounds but fancy Calzaghe to win the bout , assuming he gets back up again .
I expect Jones to unload a few bombs from the outset and ' check the chin ' of Calzaghe .
Calzaghe also has an unhealthy prediliction for standing toe to toe against stronger opponents which could find him out .
I won some money on Samuel Eto'o earlier and it's all going on a Calzaghe knock down , and Calzaghe on points . "
Illegal Internet sites , gambling , and staying up late ?
You live life on the edge Mr Woods .
" Almost all boxers go on too long ( some twice or thrice ) - is n't this a fight to decide which is guilty of this inevitable hubris ? " says Gary Naylor .
" Because on that reasoning , Calzaghe should cruise it . "
All boxers are spurred on by pride and I can't blame somebody like Jones Jr wanting to restore some of his by taking on an undefeated fighter .
It reminds me somewhat of a gambler who is losing heavily and tries desperately to win back his stake by going for broke .
If he loses , his reputation lies ever more in tatters , if he wins , well he 's either back in the game , or he can retire content .
4.22 am : The final fight before the main event plods on .
It 's in round nine so hopefully not too long to go .
Jones Jr had a bunch of cronies whoopin ' an' a hollerin ' as he shadow boxed in preparation in his dressing room .
Calzaghe looked ultra-relaxed .
In fact , he looked a little too at ease - he ought to get pysched just a wee bit in my opinion .
Meanwhile , back in my inbox : " I 'm stuck in Bangkok with no access to a TV with the fight on it , " laments Ronn McMillan .
" I recall watching Jones Jr's finest / unfinest hour , when at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 he won his final easily , then had the gold medal handed to his Korean opponent .
The Koreans were never too subtle when it came to cheating .
I rate Calzaghe though , and want tonight to be his night .
Go for it Joe . "
I might just add that it was Ron McMillan who intimated Koreans are fond of cheating , not me .
We 're just about ready to rumble !
But while the razmattazz builds up here 's Laurance Langdon with career advice for Jones Jr and Calzaghe .
" Both of these guys are finishing on this fight , no matter what Jones may say .
If Jones wins , his claim for the best of all time is cemented , if Calzaghe wins he can go out saying he beat them all , despite some being past their prime .
It 's a legacy fight , and a massive pay day to boot .
It 's freezing in Atyrau [ Kazakhstan ] , so we need some excitement to warm us up . "
Build - up : Jones
Jr enters the ring wearing an orange hoody and looking particularly moody .
He 's greeted by a mixture of boos from the travelling Welsh support and cheers from the home crowd .
Calzaghe looks cock - sure in a ridiculous sequin vest .
Not the best choice of attire for what is probably your final fight .
Not that it matters if he wipes the floor with Jones Jr .
The national anthems are blasted out into Madison Square Garden .
The ginger American woman wins the sing - off in my opinion .
She empties her lungs with much more vigour than did the Welsh singer .
Maybe that 's an omen .
The orange tanned PA gives it his all as he presents the fighters .
It takes him about five minutes to list all of Jones Jr's achievements .
Calzaghe grins as he is presented as undefeated .
He punches the air and we 're ready to RUMBLE !
Ding ding !
Round one : Calzaghe throws out his jab very early on and pins Jones Jr against the ropes and works at his body .
Jones appears to weigh up his opponent and throws a rapid left hook in the centre of the ring .
It does n't connect but it acts as a warning .
They both trade punches in the corner .
Calzaghe works a neat combination into Jones ' body ... then Calzaghe goes down !
Amazing !
After a quiet start Jones lands an straight left to floor Calzaghe in much the same way Hopkins did with his right in the first round .
Calzaghe gets up gingerly and throws out some wild punches and manages to survive .
What a start !
My score : Calzaghe 8 - 10 Jones Jr
Round two : Calzaghe is the aggressor early in this round .
Jones sucks it all up and waits like a coiled cobra to attack .
The Welshman does n't allow him too though as he throws Jones onto the ropes and follows up with a flurry of punches to score points with the judges .
Jones sticks out his tongue as if to say ' you did n't hurt me ' but in my book Calzaghe won that round .
This fight has been anything but a meaningless exhibition - in large part thanks to Jones , who looks much more youthful than 39 .
My score : Calzaghe 10 - 9 Jones Jr
Round three : Calzaghe flies out with intent and looks more spritely on his feet than he has in any other round .
He pins Jones back into the corner and works Jones 's body before landing a big right hand over the top .
He grins as he dances into the centre of the ring and goes toe - to - toe with Jones , who has nothing in reply .
This is much better from the Newbridge southpaw .
He must have landed four times as many punches as Jones in this round and many have connected too .
Calzaghe struts on the bell and wiggles his hips at his opponent who does n't like that one bit .
The bell goes and Calzaghe will regret showboating if he is dumped on his behind again .
My score : Calzaghe 10 - 9 Jones Jr
Round four :
This fight is echoing the Hopkins battle .
Calzaghe is playing catch - up .
Jones does n't have the water - tight guard of Hopkins though and I expect him to have to take a few more on the chin than Hopkins did .
Calzaghe ought to be careful not to pose too much though as one rapier - like punch from Jones will floor him .
Jones does catch Calzaghe with two clean jabs towards the end of the round , but the Welshman laughs them off just before the bell calls time .
Calzaghe 's work rate wins him the round though .
My score : Calzaghe 10 - 9 Jones Jr
Round five : Jones takes the pace out of the fight , by allowing Calzaghe to back him into the corner .
Calzaghe characteristically lands a machine gun-like flurry of punches in the corner but Jones covers up well .
Calzaghe steps up the pace and lands through Jones ' guard and shakes the American .
Right up to the bell the two of them trade punches .
Calzaghe continues to land more blows but Jones always connects with the more accurate powerful shots .
My score : Calzaghe 10 - 9 Jones
Round six : " Slightly worrying how confident Joe is putting his unprotected face in Jones 's all the time , " says Alex Hughes .
" He looks great though .
Either another Lacy performance or he 'll look very stupid flat on his back .
Do n't want to take the mickey too much with someone of Jones 's calibre . "
Agreed Alex . Enzo Calzaghe reckons Jones will run out of steam .
He may do but while he is standing he is a great threat .
Calzaghe continues to put in the work to the body with his combinations .
Jones invites Calzaghe onto him and then lands a terrific uppercut .
Calzaghe responds well in the corner but Calzaghe 's chin must be wobbling after that .
My score : Calzaghe 9-10 Jones Jr
Round seven : Jones
Jr has already proved his doubters wrong with his performance so far .
He looks like he has got a second wind and manages to stay up as Calzaghe lands a crushing left hand midway through the round which sends Jones crashing onto the ropes .
Calzaghe pounces on the opportunity and lands a straight left hand which gouges a cut above Jones Jr 's left eye .
The American survives but he is left with blood all over his upper body .
That was a great round for Calzaghe .
My score : Calzaghe 10 - 9 Jones Jr
Round eight : " Joe leading comfortably after six rounds , " says the Observer 's Kevin Mitchell at ringside .
" Five rounds to one , through sheer volume of punches , after coming through a nasty first - round knockdown , which he dropped 10 - 8 .
Pace relentless .
Calzaghe super confident and Jones bemused by the number and quality of Joe 's combinations . "
That 's the ringside view .
Meanwhile Jones has been shaken by that cut .
He looks a mess with blood gushing from his eye .
Calzaghe is like a predator playing with his injured prey .
Jones can't see and Calzaghe continues to pound him with a relentless stream of shots .
Jones bats him off with an uppercut but Calzaghe forces Jones to cling on until the bell .
The doctor has got much work to do to clean Jones 's cut up so he can continue .
My score : Calzaghe 10 - 9 Jones Jr
Round nine :
There 's a delay as Jones has his cut worked on .
A replay from the last round shows a left hand from Calzaghe tearing across the cut .
It 's enough to make me wince never mind Jones .
The American dances around and manages to limit the damage in the early exchanges in this round .
Calzaghe seems content to hold off and wait for an opportunity to connect .
He goads Jones - somewhat disrespectfully I feel - by sticking his chin out at his wounded opponent , who thankfully gives Calzaghe a jab to the mush .
Calzaghe has it on points now and only has to see this one home .
Jones has to do something special through one eye .
My score : Calzaghe 10 - 9 Jones Jr
Round 10 : Mercifully for Jones , the pace has dropped .
He clings onto Calzaghe , who backs off and lands some crunching blows to Jones 's ribs .
The American legend is showing tremendous bottle .
The whole left hand side of his face is crimson with blood .
The fight should be stopped in my opinion .
Jones survives another round .
Calzaghe could be more ruthless and finish this but perhaps he 's trying to lengthen his career .
My score : Calzaghe 10 - 9 Jones Jr
Round 11 : There 's another delay as Jones has a lot of first aid work on his eye .
Calzaghe immediately homes in on the cut with his right hand , but Jones Jr connects with a single accurate left .
Calzaghe lands a solid right jab which Jones bizarrely acknowledges by saying " good shot Joe . "
Calzaghe showboats again and ... again gets his just deserts as Jones swings a right hook his way and connects .
I 'll score the round as a draw for Jones 's sheer bravery .
My score : Calzaghe 10 - 10 Jones Jr
Round 12 : There 's a standing ovation as these two legends of boxing , who may never fight again , touch gloves for the final round .
It 's been a gruelling fight and a great spectacle .
Calzaghe crouches low and invites Jones onto him .
With his trademark lunge Jones almost dizzies Calzaghe with a crashing right which just grazes his ear .
Calzaghe skips on the spot to prove how much he has left in the tank , but in my opinion he should fuel a couple of punches and try to down Jones instead .
Like a bloodied warrior Jones has one final lunge at Calzaghe which misses and as the bell sounds the two fighters embrace .
My score : Calzaghe 10 - 10 Jones Jr
My result : A quick tot up of my scores puts it at Calzaghe 117 - 113 Jones Jr
The judges ' result :
All three have it at Calzaghe 118-109 Jones Jr
Joe Calzaghe wins comfortably after a shaky start .
For his sake it 's a blessing that he has an iron chin because he needed it after being floored midway through the first round .
Post - fight musings : " I wo n't make my final decision yet , " says Calzaghe when asked about his future .
" I 'll go home and think about it . "
I think that 's a clue that Calzaghe will have one last ' last ' fight .
The PA suggests Chad Dawson .
We 'll have to wait and see who he will face if he does decide to continue boxing .
After tonight 's performance I hope he does .
Thanks for all your emails .
We want it bad .
Reeeeeal bad .
Bonanzle is still running on Subversion ( via Tortoise ) , because comparing its UI to the UI for the de facto git standard ( msysgit ) is like comparing Rails to ASP on Visual Basic .
Yes , the difference is that big .
Msysgit is ugly as Pauly Shore , most of its windows can’t be resized , it crashes regularly , and trying to decipher the intent of its UI is like reading dead sea scrolls .
Yes , yes , I know : if you do n’t like a piece of open source software , you should shut up and fix it .
Unfortunately , I ’m sort of single - handedly maintaining this web site that has grown to about 150k uniques this month , where two months ago we had about 10 k uniques .
I can not end world hunger and rescue my cat stuck in a tree .
But if there is any intelligent life out there that has spare programming cycles and the desire to make a huge difference in the world , this is my personal plea that they will consider giving some love to the woebegone msysgit … or maybe just start their own Windows git client , I ca n’t imagine a real hacker would take more than a week or two to match the featureset of the existing msysgit .
I ’d really like to move Savage Beast to github , and I ’d really like to collaborate on the other projects that are happening on there , but it just does n’t make sense to go from a slick , error free , decipherable UI like Tortoise to the meager helpings of msysgit .
I ’d happily donate to a project like better Windows git .

Mr Somchai vowed to stand firm despite pressure from the military Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat has rejected calls by the country 's military chief to stand down .
Army leader Gen Anupong Paochinda had asked him to call snap elections to end months of political deadlock .
But Mr Somchai said his government was legitimate and that he would continue to work for the country .
The call came after anti-government protesters occupied Bangkok 's main airport and forced its closure , a move that Mr Somchai called illegal .
" I reassure the people that this government , which is legitimate and came from elections , will keep functioning until the end , " Mr Somchai said in a televised address .
" My position is not important .
But democratic values are , " he said , speaking from the northern city of Chiang Mai .
He returned from a foreign trip earlier in the day but was unable to land in Bangkok because of the airport blockade .
Shortly after he arrived in Chiang Mai , a man was killed in a clash between pro- and anti-government supporters , police said .
' No coup ' Thailand has been in a state of political stalemate since former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a military coup in 2006 .
POLITICAL TURMOIL September 2006 : Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra ousted in military coup February 2008 : Samak Sundaravej sworn in as prime minister September 2008 : Protesters call for Mr Samak 's resignation , saying he is a proxy for Thaksin 9 September 2008 : Mr Samak dismissed for violating conflict of interest law .

October 2008 : Thaksin given a two - year jail sentence for corruption in his absence
Chaos at seized airport Q&A : Bangkok protests
Fresh elections at the end of 2007 failed to resolve the crisis , when a party made up of former allies of Mr Thaksin returned to power .
Gen Anupong 's call for polls earlier in the day heightened speculation that another military coup could be imminent .
But the army chief denied that was his plan , saying the government still had " full authority " .
A Thai court , meanwhile , has ordered the protesters occupying Suvarnabhumi airport to leave .
But the group - who belong to the People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) - say they will stay until the government resigns .

They have brought in food and blankets and appear set for a long stay .
All flights have been cancelled and thousands of Thais and foreign tourists are stranded in the Thai capital .
Frustrated passengers have been sent to hotels until the airport , one of Asia 's busiest , can reopen .
The blockade comes at the height of the tourist season and threatens an industry which is one of the country 's biggest earners .
The campaign by the PAD , which began in earnest in May , has paralysed the Thai government .
The group - a loose alliance of royalists , businessmen and the urban middle class - claim that the government is corrupt and hostile to the monarchy .
They also accuse it of being a proxy for Mr Thaksin , who remains very popular among Thailand 's rural poor .

Avortement : trois questions sur l’allongement du délai légal de recours à l’IVG en France
Une proposition de loi visant , entre autres , à allonger le délai d’accès à l’interruption volontaire de grossesse de douze à quatorze semaines doit être discutée en commission à partir du 30 septembre , puis en séance publique le 8 octobre .
hough his role as Dream is taken over by the former Daniel Hall , Morpheus is truly dead , and his sacrifice is a true cause for mourning .
However , while the preceding details are clear , the exact actions that put them into play are not .
Lyta was an unwitting pawn in calling forth the Furies ( or , as they prefer to be called , the Kindly Ones ) ; who set her down this road for vengeance ?
She believes Dream took her son , but it was actually Loki and Puck working , they say , in someone else 's employ ?
Also , who could have arranged for Dream to be called by Nuala at the exact moment when the Kindly Ones most desired it ?
Over his many millennia of existence , Morpheus made many enemies and was the subject of numerous assassination attempts , so the question is not , " Who wanted Dream dead ? "
The question , left interestingly vague by the end of The Sandman , is : Who KILLED Dream of the Endless ?
hile the circumstances of his demise are clearly chronicled in The Kindly Ones ( and the background to those circumstances interwoven throughout the entire Sandman series ) , one item is left interestingly unclear :
Who killed Dream ?
The obvious answer is his sister , Death .
When the Furies come to avenge the death of his son , Orpheus , at Lyta Hall 's urgings , Morpheus is placed into checkmate .
He had to momentarily leave his kingdom and source of power , the Dreaming , to fulfill a promise to the faerie , Nuala .
In doing so , he allowed both his kingdom and person to become vulnerable to the Furies ' assault and the havoc they plan to wreak .
A previous absence ( of several decades ) had already once caused the Dreaming to fall into ruin --
He wo n't allow that to happen again , but he can no longer fight the Furies .
Instead , he cuts their rampage short by summoning his sister to come take him and give the Furies what they desire before they dismantle the Dreaming .
Death , saddened , complies , and Morpheus dies .
The following is a list of characters , namely suspects , each with a motive for the Dream King 's demise .
While some longshots are included , the most obvious candidates also seems unlikely .
The selection has been limited to only beings with enough supernatural " sway , " intelligence , and sufficient cause to orchestrate Morpheus ' elimination can be considered .
And , only characters who appeared in the 75 issues and related specials of Sandman as they appear in trade paperback form are valid .

The Three Ladies
AKA : The Kindly Ones , the Furies , the Fates , the Hecaeteae , the Muses , the Gorgons , the Triple Goddess Motive : Vengeance against Morpheus ' son ; professional obligation Regardless of what guise they work under , the Three Ladies play significant roles in the life of Dream and his acquaintances .
They help him to locate his missing tools when he is first released from his decades of imprisonment ( though , they claim they are no real help -- his troubles , they say , " are only just beginning " ) .
They reunite him with his enslaved ex-wife , the titular " Calliope . "
And , as the Grey Ladies , they set in motion a chain of events that lead to Dream 's possession of Lucifer 's empty Hell and the release of his late love , Nada .
Some of the Three Ladies ' manifestations :
But , for all of their " help , " they are not Dream 's allies .
His quest for his tools almost ended in death at the hands of psychotic Doctor Dee .
And , while the confrontation with Lucifer goes well , Dream is put in an even more precarious place as the possessor of vacant Hell ; all of the other divine forces wanted it .
Additionally , his judgment to turn possession of Hell back to its Creator gains him the animosity of powers that could include Loki and the semi- fallen angels , Remiel and Duma .
The Three Ladies ' advice and influence seldom ever leaves Morpheus unscathed .
But , the pain they bring Morpheus was never worse than their assault on his realm as the Furies or , as they prefer to be called , the Kindly Ones .
Though Lyta
Hall came to them seeking revenge on Dream for the death of her son , they take full advantage of the mortal 's , you 'll pardon the expression , fury and , instead , assault Dream 's home for taking his own son 's life .
They even seem to hire the witch - woman Thessaly to guard their mortal host from physical harm or from completing their quest .
The Endless are not above the wrath and harsh justice of the Furies , it would seem , when they kill their own blood ; this is likely the consequence to which Dream referred in The Doll 's House when Desire almost tricked him into killing Rose Walker : Desire 's granddaughter and Dream 's great - niece .
Though the Furies are one of the most direct tools to his destruction , are they the architects ?
As the Fates , if we can cleanly equate these roles to one and another , they do determine the lifeline of a being .
And , during his first call for their help , the Crone is quick to remind Morpheus that he did not help them in some conflict with Circe .
Finally , they may harbor a deep - seeded grudge , not against Morpheus , but against his son , Orpheus ; during his brief journey to the underworld , the mourning musician made the Three Ladies as the Harpies cry , something for which he will never be forgiven according to Queen Prosephone .
Would their rage against Orpheus spill over and fuel an already tenuous association with Dream ?
The answer , I think , is no .
As the Fates , they are beyond revenge ploys , no matter how complex .
In fact , their actions were documented in Destiny 's book , making it more unlikely that these extensions of Fate are acting on their own behalf .
Their enmity towards Orpheus and possibly Dream himself may explain why they are so eager to help and manipulate Lyta Hall .
But , in the end , they merely serve their role .
Lyta Hall
AKA : The Fury Motive : Mistaken vengeance over her child 's kidnapping and husband and child 's death Morpheus ' is n't the only tragedy in The Sandman .
Consider Lyta Hall .
Before Sandman and the Vertigo line of comics , she was a mainstay in the DC Universe as the Amazonian daughter of an alternate Earth 's Wonder Woman .
When the DCU was overhauled in Crisis on Infinite Earths , she became the orphan daughter of the original Golden Age Fury ( who , it is argued , is actually seen in The Sandman series as one of the Three Ladies named Helena in the nursing home Rose Walker visits ) .
For a time she joined the super - group Infinity Inc. , only to have her husband killed while she is pregnant with their child .
His " reincarnation " as " The Sandman " is just an illusion , the work of two renegade nightmares who escaped the Dreaming and needed a dupe to " protect " their pocket dreamscape .
So , even after living in this artificial realm , Lyta is sent back to Earth as Dream destroys his underlings ' facade , leaving Lyta still pregnant and now without her love .
Only one trace of him remains -- the baby she is carrying that gestated in the dreamscape , though Dream says he will one day come for the child , too .
When her son , Daniel ( named by Dream ) , goes missing and is then found dead and burned , Lyta loses it .
She can only assume that the being who dispersed her husband and threatened to take her child has committed the act .
Though crazed , she finds her way to the Kindly Ones and entreats them to help her kill Dream .
They tell her that they may only go after those who have spilled their family 's blood ... which , fortunately for her , Dream has .
Her physical body is provided protection by the witch - woman Thessaly while her mental self joins the Kindly Ones to destroy the Dreaming and its master .
In the end , Lyta realizes her error and wishes to undo her request for Dream 's demise .
However , she cannot .
Dream dies ( by Death 's own hand , not the Kindly Ones ' ) and Lyta is returned once again to Earth , this time without her son .
Thessaly warns her that the quest to destroy Dream has made her many enemies , so she is forced into hiding until Daniel , now a manifestation of Dream assures her that he will watch over her to keep her safe .
However , he is no longer truly her child .
Lyta
Hall is now totally alone .
Hers is a sad story , and her motives for first wanting Dream dead are clear .
But , not even a former super - heroine has the power or , necessarily , the knowledge to take down a member of the Endless .
Too many coincidences lead to her contact with the Kindly Ones , too many planned details .
No one just happens upon the Three Ladies unless they were meant to .
And , her quest for misappropriated vengeance would not have been possible without Dream 's very recent killing of his immortal son .
Like the Kindly Ones themselves , someone was pulling Lyta 's strings ... and a whole lot harder .
Desire
AKA : Epithumia Motive : Sibling rivalry ; inscrutable cosmic agenda The Good , the Bad , and ... the Freaky .
Desire of the Endless falls squarely into that final category .
And , this is not because of his / her amorphous , transgendered identity .
( I have absolute respect and appreciation of transgendered issues , so , to avoid any confusion , I will use the feminine pronouns when referring to Desire without the intent to label her strictly as a woman . )
No , Desire is a bizarre character , because , like desire itself , her power and motive comes from an irrational , purely emotional ( or hormonal ) source .
In fact , desire is motive in itself ; people commit actions like murder because of their own desire .
So , what would the personification of need and longing herself want ?
It seems fair to say that she wants to challenge and best her older siblings .
According to the Sandman FAQ List ( which I largely believe is accurate ) , Desire , Despair , and Delight / Delirium are the three " youngest " Endless , meaning they came into existence last .
And , it would seem that these three have a habit of challenging their older siblings to little competitions , as shown in Fables and Reflections ' " Thermidor . "
I doubt that Delirium herself has any need to belittle or best any of the others -- she probably just finds it fun and goes along with her other siblings .
And , I also believe that Despair , in fulfilling her office , just wants people to lose and experience the bleakness and shame associated with failure .
That is , who cares who wins , so long as someone loses ?
Additionally , she mentions both in " Thermidor " and elsewhere how much she misses her brother -- she may hold her elder siblings partially responsible for his mysterious departure .
But , why does Desire enjoy challenging the others , especially Dream , so muchso ?
( In her role , she could just as easily lust for him or wish for his good fortune as want to destroy him ! )
When her attempt to disillusion Emperor Norton seems to fail , Desire seethes .
She promises that her next scheme will be far more difficult and " subtle . "
" I 'll bring the Kindly Ones down on his blasted head .
One day ... "
Does n't that sound like a plan to have the Furies assail Dream ?
Yes ... ... But not this plan .
Desire already attempted to have Dream take his own blood in A Game of You .
There , he nearly killed Rose Walker , a human dream vortex who endangered the boundaries of individual dreams .
Unbeknownst to him , Rose was Desire 's kin , her granddaughter , so slaying her would have given the Kindly Ones cause to go after him had Desire , well , desired .
But , Dream did not kill Rose , fortunately , and later gave his sister a deadly warning to never attempt that again .
Did she ignore his threat and go after him one more , lethal time ?
Doubtful .
Perhaps if this were a mortal police investigation , a prior attempt may provide damning evidence .
But , Desire is one of the Endless , and if there 's one thing Desire is n't , it 's repetitive or dull .
Why would she hatch the same scheme twice ?
It does n't seem likely that she was being so subtle as to make the Rose Walker ploy a red herring for her greater plan .
Desire and delayed gratification do n't mix .
And , who 's to say that she would have had the Kindly Ones try to kill Dream had he eliminated Rose Walker ?
She might have them make his life miserable , sure , just to show her victory over him , but without additional elements like Nuala calling him out of the Dreaming or Thessaly protecting the source of the Kindly Ones ' complaint , Desire 's original plan could easily have been less - than - lethal .
Additionally , as the events of The Kindly Ones unfold , Desire locks herself in her kingdom , letting no communication pass in or out .
If she is about to accomplish a major victory , why would she deprive herself of watching it come about ?
It 's also hardly an alibi to be all alone while a coup is afoot .
More likely , she saw what was coming and had seriously mixed feelings about it , about the coming death of her unfavored brother --
She locks herself away in her kingdom of desire because , in regards to Dream 's fate , she does n't know what she desires !
Desire may not love her brother , she may even loathe him , but it does n't sound like she killed him .
Lucifer Morningstar
AKA : Satan , the Devil , Lightbringer , King of Hell Motive : Sworn destruction ; political opposition ; boredom
The elements seem to be all there .
First , Morpheus had publicly embarrassed Morningstar in front of the legions of Hell back in Preludes and Nocturnes .
For this , Lucifer swore to destroy Dream .
Second , even as a fallen angel , he 's an immensely powerful being , able to call upon The Kindly Ones , hire Loki and Puck , settle old scores for Thessaly , and manipulate individuals like Nuala , Lyta , and her friends , Carla and Eric .
Third , he was at - large on Earth as the events unfolded , no longer constrained to Hell and able to put events in play at his discretion .
Finally , who knows his feelings towards the Endless ' lack - of - role in his Rebellion ?
Dream could easily have ignored Lucifer 's entreaty for help in overthrowing God just as he seemed to have turned his back on helping the Kindly Ones with Circe .
While Lucifer seems to have given up his quest and decided to walk the Earth ( as the piano player and bar owner of " Lux " ) , could the Devil be in the details of Dream 's death ?
Not likely .
This is n't , pardon the expression , sympathy for the devil ; Lucifer already had his revenge on Dream by forcing the Key to Hell upon him in Season of Mist .
Morpheus ' handling of that situation gained him even more enemies , political complications , and embarrassment than Lucifer alone -- Sounds like turnabout is fair play .
Also , Lucifer is wise , not vengeful ( unlike some of his opposition , he might say ) ; what would he gain from Morpheus ' elimination ?
When Delirium comes to visit him at Lux , he tells her truly that he once did , in fact , want Dream destroyed , but now sees it as a waste of time and effort .
Even if he 's lying to her for indiscernible reasons , Remiel comes to him later about " the Dream King " situation , implying it is something that the angel 's divine knowledge does not think Lucifer is part of .
Lucifer may be a trickster and a tormentor , but rarely is he shown as a liar .
Certainly , he may have done it and for no better reason than the fact that he was bored as the leader of Hell .
But , like Desire , his current actions did n't match his past ambitions .
He may have wanted to destroy Dream in the past , but time changed both of them .
A kinder , gentler Satan ?
Probably not .
But probably not a guilty one either .
Thessaly
AKA : Larissa Motive : Crime of passion ; payment of outstanding debts
The witch - woman known both as Thessaly and Larissa is a puzzle unto herself :
She 's a murderess , a sorceress , a guardian and ... a lover .
Yes , the same woman over whom Morpheus is moping at the beginning of Brief Lives turns out to be same woman he met in Alianora 's land at the conclusion of A Game of You .
The relationship , it appears , ended badly , evidenced by his sullen reaction and her own testimony in The Wake .
Of course , bad romances do n't necessarily make for murders .
One should also consider Thessaly 's line of work and m.o. :
She is the last of an ancient race of witch , extremely long - lived , reckless , and deadly .
Her actions , those that often spit in the face of immortals and the divine , speak louder than words .
She kills , pardon the pun , mysterious George when he sends his nightmare crows after her and the other resident ladies of their building .
Thessaly also skins his face , plucks his eyes , and cuts loose his tongue .
She pulls the moon out of orbit for her own goal of revenge , breaks Luz ' neck as easily as she smashed the crow , and argues face - to - face with Dream of the Endless even as he holds their fate in his hands .
As the Moon Aspect warns her , " Where others ask timorously , Thessalian , your kind commanded , directed , ordered ... The others are dust now ... and one day you , in your turn will join them ... One day there will be a reckoning . "
What would a woman like this do to a spurned lover ?
Moreover , what would n't a woman like this do to continue her hyper - extended life ?
She later tells Morpheus that she made a deal " with the Three ... and they agreed to forget some old scores . "
There 's little doubt that the Three are the Three Ladies , whether they be the Fates , the Furies , the Muses , or the Moon Aspects ...
And that , I think , most easily rules her out as the mastermind of this plan .
Her role in the plan is a reluctant one -- even though she is still plainly hostile to Morpheus when he visits , she also holds a great deal of anger towards Lyta .
When she emerges after Dream 's death , Lyta is told by Thessaly that , " Lots of people are going to want to hurt you or kill you for what you 've done .
Including me . "
Why would Thessaly set these events in motion to destroy a former lover that she may want hurt , but not killed ?
And , could n't she have found an easier way to balance matters with the Three , rather than set a crazed mother in motion who needs physical protection by Thessaly herself ?
In The Wake , the strong , stoic Thessaly weeps for Dream one last time , something she promised she 'd never again do .
Perhaps this near - immortal sorceress does not know herself as well as she thinks .
Maybe she did n't know that having a role in Dream 's torment and destruction would affect her .
But , I do n't think that she could have solely planned and implemented his demise without tripping over that part of herself that could have still , in fact , loved him .
Loki
AKA : Loki Scar - Lip , Loki Skywalker , Loki Giants Child , Loki Lie-Smith , Lt. Luke Pinkerton , Loki Mare 's - Mother , Malice - Monger Motive : Personal debt ; mischief Marvel Comics has its own version of the Norse god Loki as the arch - enemy of Thor , God of Thunder .
The Sandman version proves that they hardly do the immortal trickster justice .
He has hoodwinked Thor into believing an excrement - covered squirrel was his son , he has endured millennia of snake - venom torture , and -- when the realm of Hell goes up for grabs -- his brother and nemesis Odin comes to this most sly and cunning member of their clan for help in sealing the deal .
However , the only regal nature that this version of Loki seems to display is the fact that he 's a royal bastard .
Without a thought , he takes the place of an Asian deity entreating Dream for Hell and leaves the original to suffer
Thor 's brawny wrath while Loki escapes .
When Dream discovers the deceit , he lets Loki go with the understanding that the trickster - god now owes Morpheus a favor .
Rather than be happily owing and free , Loki cannot stand to be in anyone 's debt -- it relies on a begrudging honor and hierarchy that he refuses to acknowledge .
So , he becomes an eager accomplice to wrecking the Dream King by stealing a child , burning away its mortality , and driving a woman mad .
Loki :
He has the power and he has the motive -- what does this candidate lack ?
Opportunity ?
No , there 's plenty of time after Seasons of Mist for him to put the plan into effect .
The only element of it that was already underway was Nuala 's servitude in the Dreaming which began during the Hell 's Key tale .
Also , he certainly could have the connections to both mortal Earth and the divine beyond , allowing him to move both players like Lyta and Thessaly as well as Titania and the Kindly Ones into position .
In fact , there is only one thing he lacks that could rule him out as a candidate : Patience .
Most of Loki 's ploys are short - run , immediate pay - offs .
For an immortal god , he commits very immediate tricks .
In fact , it 's impressive that he lasted behind the facade of Lt. Luke Pinkerton as long as he did before exploding in fury and torching Lyta 's poor friend , Carla .
Dream 's set - up was methodical , certainly demanding the skill of immortal experience and treachery , but also patience and forbearance .
Remember , if Eric and Carla , Lyta 's acquaintances , were not either planted or manipulated , the conspirator had to just wait until Lyta finally left her baby 's side by their urgings .
And , waiting is not the best trait of the Skywalker .
Finally , it seems unlikely to me that the master planner of this endgame would have been as easily bested by the Corinthian as Loki was .
Neck snapped , Loki was left there for Odin to collect -- not exactly the ultimate result of a masterful ploy .
No , as Puck said , the devilish duo was working for someone ; perhaps they were even working for someone who Loki also owed , thereby negating two obligations , one honorably and one dishonorably , at once .
But who besides Dream could have had Loki in their pocket ?
It 's worth noting : Loki and Puck disguise themselves as officers Luke Pinkerton and Gordy Fellows .
Each name is a cute play of their own -- Luke for Loki and the famous Pinketon agency 's name ; Gordy Fellows for Robin Goodfellow , Pucks other pseudonym .
However , have a good look at these guys .
They look conspicuously like two other comic book cops , Detectives Fine and Borquin from Alan Moore 's Watchmen .
Other than the friendship between their creators , Gaiman and Moore , is there any reason for their similarity ?
A clue , perhaps ?
Puck
AKA : Robin Goodfellow , " That Merry Wanderer of the Night " Motive : Mischief ; employment People have been trying to decipher and deconstruct Puck of A Midsummer Night 's Dream for literally hundreds of years .
So , Gaiman 's Puck , being a direct derivation of that character , could certainly prove equally as vexing and difficult to unravel .
However , I have to respectfully disagree with the talented and brilliant Hy Bender when he says in his remarkable book , The Sandman Companion , that Puck is inspired to join in capturing Daniel purely out of a desire to cause mayhem .
There are many wonderful ways for Puck to stir up chaos -- picking a fight with one of the Endless does not seem like a smart one , even for a " giggling-dangerous-totally - bloody psychotic - menace - to-life - and - limb " as Peaseblossom puts it ... ... unless there is something to gain from it .
I , for one , believe Puck when he implies that there were employers behind his and Loki 's actions .
Notice that he says " inclinations " and " principals " -- not the homonymous " principles " -- which verbally illustrates ( as Shakespearean characters are wont to do ) both a little personal wanting to do this ( " inclinations " ) and a supportive benefactor to the whole endeavor ( " principal " ) .
Even if this literary pseudo - analysis is off - the - mark or an over - reading , I do n't think that scrutinizing his other comment is out - of - line : " I could answer you endlessly , and perhaps your expect me to ... " --
He 's clearly hinting at ( or , misleading us towards ) one of the Endless themselves !
Therefore , if it is one of the Endless -- surely , any one of them has the power and influence to move pawns in any number of realms -- who could it be ?
Death is certainly innocent , at least as innocent as Death can be in a death .
She never seemed to actively select individuals to die and clearly never enjoyed becoming involved ( as she was , much to her annoyance , in " Facade " and " Orpheus " with Element Girl and Orpheus , respectively ) .
Also , Destiny sticks to his book , which seldom ever tells him to do something -- he was rather shocked , as shocked as Destiny could be -- when the Grey Ladies had him call a meeting from his garden .
His response ?
" Nothing begins here . "
Finally , Delight is too disjointed to pull together such a plan ; she has a hard enough time finding her dog .
So , if Puck is incriminating one of the Endless , it could only be Despair ( who I personally tend to discount as the weakest and least active of the Endless ) , Desire , Destruction , or Dream himself .
Stretch the definition a little and , I suppose , you can also include the future Dream , Daniel , who is not above suspicion even as a baby .
But , if Puck is mis-directing us , who would he be doing this for ?
That is , to whom does he show enough loyalty to both carry out their doings and not reveal their name ...?
Read on ...
Morpheus
AKA : Dream of the Endless , Lord - Shaper , Onieros , Lord L'Zoril , Murphy , etc. Motive : Guilt ; exhaustion ; trauma
Could the answer be ... suicide ?
That depends on a whole bunch of other questions .
Namely , was the imprisonment at Wynch Cross far more traumatic that Dream ever let on ?
Did it irreversibly alter Morpheus , forcing him to face his coldness towards others and over - weighing of responsibility ?
Did it create such a schism that the only way to extricate himself from it was a subconscious attempt at death ?
For that matter , can an immortal being ever actually even admit it , do anything other than destroy themselves , when they want " out ? "
Though very few of those questions can be answered definitively , we already have the solution to the last one :
Yes , an immortal being can extricate themselves from their station .
After all , Lucifer did it and with relative ease .
So did Destruction , it would seem , though the circumstances and motivations of his resignation can still only be guessed at .
Additionally , some trauma turned Delight in Delirium , an alteration , for certain , but hardly a death .
However , as it goes for mortals , what is true for one Endless or divine being may not be true for them all .
If Dream killed himself -- if he set the players in motion by hiring Loki & Puck , freeing Nuala , and maddening Lyta -- it was not out of god - like post - traumatic stress .
No , not trauma , at least not directly .
If he killed himself over anything is was guilt .
His time of imprisonment made him feel vulnerable , trapped , and powerless -- in short , it made him feel mortal .
Once released , he nicely regained his might and balance ... except the experience haunted him .
He saw how merciless and unforgiving he had been to many well - intentioned individuals over his year 's of existence .
And his cruelty , figuratively , killed him .
He did not like who he was , nor could he block out this realization entirely .
This is why he is so willing to go back and finally save Nuala in Hell ; this is why he is so willing to grant the one boon entitled to the end of Alianora 's land ; this is why he is so willing to meet up with Hob as a friend for their 100 - year date ; this is why he is ( eventually ) so willing to help Delirium find Destruction ; and , ultimately , this is why he is ... well ... just willing to finally make amends with his son , Orpheus , and give him the release of death .
Morpheus no longer cares about the harm or consequences his acts may bring ; the boon for Princess Barbara could have been just as destructive as Nuala 's , just as perilous as facing Satan .
But , he cannot allow his wrongs to go untreated any longer .
As he says to Death in their final conversation , he could not ignore his responsibilities .
And so , the act of killing Orpheus and dealing harshly with Lyta brings the Kindly Ones .
He dies .
I do think Morpheus had a death - wish , but he did n't hire anyone to finish him off ; in the same way Shakespeare 's Romeo was zealously dedicate to the principles of love , so too was Morpheus with being one of the Endless .
However , also like Romeo , that dedication did not mix well with his reality ( or , his new reality after the imprisonment ) and led to his demise .
He could n't be the Dream he wanted , no , needed to be , so he prepared the mortal baby Daniel to take his place as a kinder , gentler Dream .
There was no plan , per se .
It was simply a matter of time before he made enough of a misstep to bring about his destruction .
Nuala ( looking strangely like Lyta speaking to the Furies as she says this ) is even able to see it : " You want them to punish you , do n't you ? "
He cannot answer ; only admit that he has changed , but , by asking Nuala , his slave of many years , if she has ever been imprisoned , he is still marvelously unself - aware .
Does he ever know he wanted to die ?
A final note : Rose Walker meets three women at the nursing home who are unmistakably manifestations of the Triple Goddess .
They tell a very odd , out - of - place story about a man who is terrible to his lover and then suffers for it by having his children fly off and the spirit of his lover come back to eat him alive .
Look at the resemblance between the evil man and Morpheus -- lanky , dark hair , pale skin , unseen eyes .
Is there something being said here , as a clue , perhaps , through these women ?
Morpheus was rather terrible to his lovers .
Nada especially , but , most likely , also the scarred Alianora , Thessaly , and Calliope ( though , there was a friendly reconciliation later in " Calliope " ) .
And , his child , Orpheus , did leave him ; Orpheus disavows Dream when he will not help in reclaiming Euridice 's life .
And , later , Dream must kill his son .
The Three Ladies comment that the protagonist of their story was actually dead when his children left .
A story , perhaps , about the Prince of Stories ?
So , if this story can be taken as a parable or allegory for Dream 's downfall , who is the lover that consumes him at the end ?
Again , read on ...
Boss Smiley
AKA : Prince of the World Motive : Revenge ; power play
On some other Earth , in some other America , Boss Smiley is in control of it all .
Or , rather , was until a optimistic , young upstart named Prez Rickard came along and became the youngest American President ever and would n't play ball with the tyrant - phantasm .
Boss Smiley finally had the boy in his clutches , though , once Prez died - or so he thought .
Enter Morpheus , acting on behalf of his sister , who liberates Prez from any servitude to Boss Smiley .
After all , Prez 's life has been an exceptional story and , as he says , Dream is the Prince of Stories .
This infuriates Boss Smiley who vows to get revenge on Morpheus .
When Prez apologizes for causing Morpheus any trouble , the Endless being assures him not to worry : " He would not be the first to threaten me . "
Could this minor character actual be the cause of Morpheus ' demise ?
Simply ... not bloody likely .
This big fish in his little pond would n't last a round against Morpheus .
The Dream King would do the same to him as he did to Azazel in Season of Mist -- very easily and passively put him in his place .
Rather , I 've honored Boss Smiley with a place on the suspects page to represent all the little deities and minor gods that Morpheus has pissed off in his time .
In the same collection of stories as Prez ' " The Golden Boy " is a tale of the faerie Cluracan and his mission on behalf of Queen Titania to the City of Aurelia .
When things go badly for him , Morpheus once again intercedes , this time on behalf of Nuala .
( Though this and Prez ' story have no exact time , Nuala seems to already be in Dream 's employ ; therefore , they seem to support the idea that this is the post - imprisonment Dream , subconsciously intent on putting things right and helping those loyal to him where he may have once just stood aside . )
Had Aurelia 's leaders lived long enough to hear of the Dream King 's intervention , Morpheus could have easily added another enemy to his long list .
So , Boss Smiley ?
Please ... But , he does help illustrate Dream 's freedom to interfere in the kingdoms of others .
Notably , the faerie kingdom .
Titania
AKA : Queen of the Fay Motive : Crime of passion ; political cover-up
As she stands atop a mount at the wake for the Dream King , Titania states a very telling statement to three former lovers of Morpheus , " My association to the Lord Shaper ?
That is none of your affair .
I am the Queen of Faerie .
I keep my own counsel . "
Perhaps .
But that private " counsel " does n't seem too hard to discern .
Their actions , Morpheus ' and her own , speak louder than words .
Dream enters into a pact with William Shakespeare just to create a play in memoriam of her people departing the Earth .
He says that he did it for all the diversion and entertainment she and her people afforded him .
She finds it familiar to a " tale sung once , in Greece , by a boy with a lyre . "
While at its premiere , he breaks into a hugely uncharacteristic self - reflection to her , asking her if he has done the right thing in regards to the price people pay for what they want .
Titania has no response to this outpouring , but , as this little show called A Midsummer Night 's Dream plays on , she does tell him that he will always be welcome in her kingdom .
Her husband , Lord Oberon , says nothing ; perhaps he does n't hear or maybe he 's engrossed with the play .
But , it turns out Dream 's prediction is true -- " That King Auberon and Queen Titania will be remembered by mortals , until this age is gone . "
And , we do today .
We remember their fighting , their lovers , their duplicity .
" You are a deep one , " Titania comments to Dream .
" I would I could fathom your motives ...? "
They could as easily have been to honor the royal couple as to disgrace them .
Perhaps that is why Oberon ( whose name I choose to spell in the Shakespearean fashion because ... well , those would be my own motives for you to fathom , would n't they ? ) calls for the Faerie party to leave early , before its conclusion .
Perhaps not ... but ...
It 's exchanges like this -- knowing Dream 's son , having acted as hostess to him , accepted grand and legendary gifts , receiving rare outpourings of his emotions -- that easily paint Titania as another of Morpheus ' former lovers .
In fact , their affair may have occurred during his rough period with Calliope and under the nose of Oberon ( who Charles Vess nicely draws with horns , implying a cuckold husband ) .
Centuries later , she still sends him gifts -- forces them upon him , is more life it ; he must accept Nuala as a gift or else face " her severest displeasure . "
When Nuala is allowed to return to Faerie , Titania instantly interrogates her about him and is put out when Nuala has no messages for her .
Perhaps it 's made worse by the fact that Nuala loves him , too ...
If I 've timed their affair correctly , then Morpheus ' only other chronicled affair would have been his recent one with Thessaly .
How concerned should he be about a woman scorned , especially when that woman is Queen of the Fay ?
As Cluracan warns , " It 's bad luck to cross the fair folk . "
She is not above conniving , shown by her orders to break up an upcoming alliance by any means necessary in World 's End .
And , did Oberon ever catch on ?
... Well ... if he did n't , and Dream was on the suicide run I theorized above , Titania could easily have seen him as a liability .
One that she might take joy in eliminating .
Could she align the mortals , Lyta , Carla , and Eric ?
Yes .
Could she hire Loki and Puck ?
Yes , especially Puck , who serves her husband and lives for mischief .
Finally , would she want him dead ? ... Perhaps .
In fact , I think a lot of signs point to her until the final Act .
When Dream does die at the end of Kindly Ones , she is immediately notified by a bolt of lightning .
And , for a moment , she has the face of one in immense pain and grief .
Not only that , she is also a member of the funeral dirge that crosses through the sky in World 's End and an attendant at The Wake .
Plainly , she grieves for Dream .
Is that enough to absolutely clear her from all suspicion ?
Certainly not .
But , it does provide enough doubt to allow the primary suspect - the most conspicuous in his inconspicuousness - to move to into the interrogative spotlight .
Not Titania , maybe , but her husband ... Oberon .
Oberon
AKA : Auberon , King of the Fay Motive : Infidelity Who better to kill a King than a King ?
In my mind , so many factors imply or implicate Oberon that it might be more plainly illustrated if we take each element at a time : Did he have the Means to engineer killing Dream ? --
Yes .
Oberon is King of the Fay , a sly , powerful , and ingenuitve race to begin with .
Also , they are extremely long - lived , so millennia of political connections could easily be made by a figure in authority .
Could he have reached into the mortal world on Earth and put Eric and Carla into play as distractions for Lyta ?
Surely .
Could he have found out about Orpheus ' death ?
Easily .
Could he have recalled Nuala and cause her to inadvertently call Dream out of his kingdom ?
Of course , he is her King , after all .
And , he is also King and master to another -- Puck .
In fact , Oberon may be one of the only people whom Puck obeys ( as seen in " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " ) .
If Loki was looking for the opportunity to strike at Dream , Oberon could have easily discovered that desire and paired the two to steal Daniel .
In fact , given their long histories , perhaps there is another , unspoken debt that Loki was chafing under which serving Oberon releases him from .
Regardless , while that might be speculation , it is no great feat to assume that Oberon both had knowledge of the Kindly Ones and the facilities to engineer Death 's elimination if he wished .
Did he have Reason to kill Dream ? --
Yes .
If the prior write - up for Titania does n't say it plainly enough , I will reiterate :
In all likelihood , Titania and Dream had an affair .
In fact , The Sandman Companion is kind enough to note that Oberon is drawn with horns , the sign of a cuckold .
Again , this is not an unthinkable event ; if Shakespeare 's performance is at all accurate , the King and Queen have always had a less - than - strictly - monogamous , uneven relationship .
Outside of any political gains or losses that Oberon would receive with the Dream King 's death , this most personal and long - held injury seems reason enough for exacting vengeance .
Did he have the Opportunity to engineer killing Dream ? --
Yes , to a bizarre degree .
Oberon seems to make only one real appearance in the Sandman series -- in " A Midsummer Night 's Dream . "
Despite the number of times the series deals with the faerie , with Cluracan , with Nuala , with the Queen Titania , and with Puck , Oberon is little seen .
To be fair , this can be interpreted that Oberon is a very minor character , not worth consideration on this list of suspects .
But , alternatively , that could make him all the more suspicious .
The most damning absence would seem to be his presence in The Wake .
Put simply , he does not attend Dream 's funeral .
With major and minor friends , enemies , allies , and associates all there ( except Destruction , perhaps for good reason ) , it seems exceptionally odd that this regal ambassador of the fair folk would not come to honor Dream 's memory ... unless he caused his death .
If Morpheus ' death was intentional and executed by a mastermind behind - the - scenes , Oberon seems , in my mind , to be the best candidate on paper .
There are only three circumstances that could exonerate him , two of which would have to come from the mouth of creator Neil Gaiman himself .
First , it is possible that the simplest answer , while not the best , is still correct and that it was Desire , as awkward an answer as that may be .
Second , perhaps Oberon is too minor a character in Gaiman 's world for him to even be thought " behind - the - scenes ; " perhaps he 's just gone and we , as the audience , were never intended to take his sole appearance all that seriously .
Only one other explanation holds if one wishes to declare Oberon innocent .
And , interestingly enough , it lies with an equally absent character from the series who may have inadvertently caused the chain of events leading to Morpheus ' death .... his own brother .
Destruction
AKA : Olethros , The Prodigal Motive : Incidental duty
There is another approach to this dilemma .
I have been analyzing suspects based on who could have planned out the murder and had the power and reason to implement it .
But , what if Dream 's death was more of a natural event than a planned one ?
That is , someone or something still caused it , but only inadvertently .
Then , Reason and Opportunity could be deleted from the equation , leaving only Means .
And , no being has greater pure Means to demolish a life and kingdom than Dream 's own errant brother , Destruction of the Endless .
An associate of mine , Meghan Fowler , has theorized that Destruction actually causes mayhem for those around him as much by presence as by action .
That is , he is a true embodiment of destruction , bringing it with him wherever he goes .
This theory does hold some water given the limited histories we know of the Endless .
Destruction had a hand in the events that caused Delight to turn into Delirium .
Likewise , he is much beloved and missed by Despair , herself a second version of that office -- could Destruction have lead to the demise of the first ?
His hand in accidentally destroying Orpheus , however , is known .
The boy asks his advice and he " lets slip " that Death may have a way for him to find his late love , Eurydice .
Destruction even helps Orpheus in guiding him to her domicile .
Certainly , the aid was well - meant and non-malicious , but , had he not interfered , Orpheus would have not gone underground to lose Eurydice again and would have instead survived the initial loss rather than give up on life .
This could be the reason he abandons his post -- he may have become aware , too aware , of the destruction he accidentally brings to others , particularly those he cares about .
When we meet him in the modern day during Brief Lives , he is only interested in acts of creation : cooking , writing , painting , etc .
Morpheus , who has joined Delirium in seeking him out , do n't really disturb any of his activities , yet he had several traps and signals in place for anyone that may come pursuing him .
If these mechanisms were not for his sake ... they must have been to deter any followers from finding him for their own sake .
In fact , once he meets with his brother and sister , Destruction packs up once again , hoping and asking not to be found .
Did this encounter with Destruction lead to Dream 's demise ?
Perhaps .
His pursuit certainly can be seen as the catalyst for Morpheus ' pursuance by the Kindly Ones -- the final killing of his son , Orpheus .
Interaction with Destruction ( who speaks of all things changing and lack of permanence ) brings things full circle : Orpheus took Destruction 's advice , which led to his miserable immortality , and the encounter with Destruction leads to Dream 's ending of that life .
Now that Morpheus has taken his own blood , the Kindly Ones may pursue him if entreated .
Two curious events are chronicled in The Wake that merit reflection .
First , instead of going to Morpheus ' funeral ( a la Oberon ) , Destruction actually comes to visit Daniel , the new manifestation of Dream .
They speak quite politely and kindly to each other -- this new Dream can more easily accept Destruction 's notions on change , especially since he is the product of a major change -- yet Destruction goes out of his way to ensure Daniel that he means his brother no harm .
With no overt threat at hand , why is this said ?
Is it an assurance that none of the symptomatic mayhem of being in his presence will occur ?
Or , could it be read as a subtle apology for the destruction of Dream 's former self ?
Add to that the curious event in The Wake 's epilogue , where Hob Gadling has a dream that includes Morpheus and Destruction , a man / being he has never met before .
They walk together on the beach as friends , laughing and talking , but the inclusion of Destruction is very odd --
What does it signify that Hob dreams the late Morpheus accompanied by himself and Destruction ?
Could this be another attempt by Destruction to make amends ?
If someone arranged for Daniel to be taken , then holding Destruction as a true suspect is difficult -- someone else had a malicious intent and took advantage of Orpheus ' death .
But , if Loki and Puck were just being mischievous , if they were truly working for nobody and wished merely to harass the Dream King , then Lyta 's desire to kill Morpheus is just unfortunately well - timed .
Well - timed , yes , or brought about by Destruction 's terrible , though unintended , nature .
Lucien
Motive : Job security ; possessiveness
Never in the history of existence has there been one as devoted to his job as Lucien the Librarian .
And while his dedication to master and duty make him an honestly unlikely suspect , it is worth examining the possible motives of those close to Dream , if only to uncover the effect he has on those who serve and honor him .
Consider Lucien a representative of the anti-Boss Smileys , such as Matthew , Mervyn Pumpkinhead , Corinthian , Cain , and Abel -- all those who are dedicated to Dream , yet still take the brunt of his pain and actions .
Lucien 's job , put simply , is to track and tend to every book in the Dreaming 's library ... which contains every book either written , dreamt of , or considered by anyone who has ever lived .
Of course , it 's huge .
But , Lucien , formerly the first raven ( and , therefore , it has been speculated , the first actual man ) has had millennia to manage it .
In addition , he serves as Dream 's aide , often dictating Morpheus ' wishes / orders to the appropriate parties .
When Dream was imprisoned , however , all of that fell apart .
After centuries of careful collection and care , the library slowly began to crumble for Lucien .
As he said , " Slowly , the words began to fade ... My books became bound volumes of blank paper ; the next day the whole library was gone .
I never found it again . "
The sheer trauma of losing the one thing he has worked ages on is buried beneath what he says , but readily apparent on his features .
Dream returns , of course , as does the full glory of the Dreaming , but things are not perfect .
Some dreams have gone missing , such as Brute and Glob , the " benefactors " of Daniel 's father , the mock " Sandman . "
And , many of the books are still in abstentia .
Even by Seasons of Mist , Lucien is still recooping his loss , finding missing books , rebuilding the library , etc . Having Dream depart again , this time to Hell , has terrible potential repercussions to Lucien -- If Dream is imprisoned again , then the Dreaming and the library could easily fall apart once more .
Everything Lucien has worked for with be for naught .
Outside of Destruction and perhaps Death , Lucien seems to be the most aware of Morpheus ' change and plight .
Later , in The Wake , he comments that perhaps Morpheus was only willing to change so much before it led to his death .
If Lucien interpreted Dream 's newly empathetic , risk - taking Morpheus as a being with a death - wish , then he probably also recognized the threat that meant for his dear library .
Unless Dream was killed ( and replaced , of course , by another Dream ) , any long - time absence would have terrible repercussions on his kingdom ... and Lucien 's library .
So , would Lucien actually use all the knowledge of his library to eliminate the foolhardy Dream in place of another one , less threatening to his dear library ?
... No , probably not .
But , I think that at least discussing this possibility might show how Morpheus ' behavior ( both over the centuries and since his imprisonment ) affects those around him .
Certainly , Dream 's lovers fair poorly : Nada is condemned to Hell , Calliope is betrayed then imprisoned , and the scarred Elianora seems to have perished mysteriously .
Likewise , Dream 's associates gain no real protection from his interaction ( how many people die because of his quest to find Destruction in Brief Lives ? ) and his own servants must endure whatever hardship he brings to the Dreaming , either due to his mood or outside parties .
Does Morpheus , in the end , wind up wreaking more incidental ruin than Destruction does ?
Daniel
AKA : Dream of the Endless Motive : Ascendance Outside of the Kindly Ones and the murderer himself / herself / itself / themselves , only one being had anything to really gain from Morpheus ' death : Daniel .
The boy goes from mortal baby ( albeit , one of peculiar and interesting origins ) to a manifestation of the Endless .
Certainly , on paper , as it were , that is a major power - jump .
From mortal to immortal , toddler to god , preschooler to omniscient .
And , he got it all because he was Dream 's heir .
As far back as A Doll 's House , it seems , Daniel was named to be Morpheus ' successor .
Morpheus tracks down Brute and Glob inside the head of Rose Walker 's brother .
There , they have constructed their own mini-Dreaming and enlisted their own Sandman , the late Hector Hall of DC Comics ' Infinity Inc .
With him is , you guessed it , his pregnant wife Lyta .
Morpheus removes all of them from the boy 's mind , ships the two little dreams off for punishment , and sends Hector on to the Great Beyond ( where , later , he is pulled back in the form of the new Dr. Fate for the revamped JSA ) .
This leaves Lyta all alone , back on Earth , and nine months pregnant .
Morpheus leaves her saying that he will return for her child , not explaining to the distraught woman that since it gestated in the Dreaming it will have special value and abilities .
He just leaves her , carelessly ( or intentionally ? ) allowing her to grow embittered to him .
He visits Lyta again , during Season of Mist in preparation to take on Lucifer and whatever may befall him , and once more he gives her reason to fear him .
But , he does seem to already be in close connection with the boy .
Morpheus informs her that the baby 's name is Daniel , almost as if the baby himself told Morpheus so .
Daniel is the " precaution "
Dream spoke of to his servants in the event of his own destruction at the hands of Lucifer .
Daniel can already access the Dreaming 's inhabitants , as he did with Cain , Abel , and Eve in Fables and Reflections ' " Parliament of Rooks . "
He is even able to bring objects back from the Dreaming , such as Matthew 's raven feathers .
The boy , certainly , has incredible potential .
But , how much of that potential was already realized before Dream 's death ?
He seemed able to communicate with Morpheus and even the Corinthian ( who did not kill Matthew , apparently , because of Daniel 's desires ) .
If Daniel was already aware and cognizant , could he have stretched his power further to move Morpheus along and make himself Dream ? ... Naaahhh ... A powerful baby had himself stolen to drive his mother mad and bring the ancient Furies down on his predecessor ?
He would have had to stretch his power , for sure , but buying that idea ( over all the other suspects ) would be an even greater stretch ...
PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
The explosion happened without warning around 4 a.m. in West Chester , Pennsylvania .
FBI agents were sitting in this car when a " flash - bang " grenade on one of the agents went off without warning .
FBI agent Donald Bain was sitting in his car in a parking lot with two other agents .
He was armed and wore a Kevlar vest .
He was also carrying a " flash - bang " grenade , a nonlethal weapon that emits a bright flash and deafening bang that 's used to shock and disorient criminal suspects or the enemy in combat situations .
The three agents -- Bain , Thomas Scanzano and James Milligan -- were waiting for developments on a kidnapping that had turned into a hostage stakeout .
That 's when , Bain says , the flash - bang grenade in his vest just blew up .
" The car is on fire , " Bain recalled .
" I was told later I was on fire .
Smoke billowing in the car .
It was obviously chaos . "

Scanzano remembers " it was like being in combat .
There was smoke and fire in the vehicle , and I knew that we were in trouble . "
An ambulance rushed the three agents to a nearby hospital .
" To me , it felt like someone just whacked me in the back with a baseball bat as hard as they could , " said Bain , recalling the incident , which happened four years ago .
Bain suffered severe bruising , a concussion and burns to his neck and ears .
All three agents said they have experienced hearing loss .
" There was smoke , and it was like a grenade going off in the car , " Scanzano said .
The company that manufactured the flash - bang grenade that Bain used is Pyrotechnic Specialties Inc. , also known as PSI , based in Byron , Georgia .
Earlier this year , PSI , its chief operating officer , David Karlson , and three other defendants were indicted for fraud , conspiracy and money laundering .
According to the federal indictment , PSI had a $ 15 million contract to supply flash - bang grenades to the military before it supplied them to the FBI .

The indictment states the company knew its flash bangs were defective and even knew how to fix those flaws , which would have cost PSI $ 3.72 per unit .
But , according to the indictment , many of the defective grenades the military was using were relabeled and then sold to the FBI and other local law enforcement agencies .
" In order to sell diversionary charges which had been rejected by , and were otherwise unacceptable to the Department of Defense , the defendants developed a scheme and artifice to defraud , and attempt to defraud , the United States of America , as well as state and local law enforcement agencies , " the indictment states .
In a court filing , PSI 's attorneys state the " indictment is lacking in detail , vague and / or confusing , however , either in regard to what particular conduct by PSI or Mr. Karlson is alleged to be wrongful ; or what particular laws , regulations , rules or other authorities rendered any alleged conduct by PSI or Mr. Karlson wrongful , as well as many other areas . "
CNN tried to speak with Karlson at PSI headquarters , but he would not comment .
PSI attorney Craig Gillen also declined to comment .

The criminal trial is scheduled to begin in January in Macon , Georgia .

" It drives me crazy , " Scanzano said .
" I do n't sleep .
I have tremendous headaches .
I have the doctors claim severe hearing loss , but for all practical purposes , I 'm deaf in my left ear . "
Andrew J. Stern , a Philadelphia attorney , has filed civil suits against PSI on behalf of the three FBI agents .
" I do n't know how someone looks themselves in the mirror every day in light of the kind of things that have happened here , " Stern told CNN .
Stern has also filed a civil lawsuit against PSI on behalf of Dean Wagner , a master sergeant in the Army who also said he was seriously injured by a flash - bang grenade that he says prematurely detonated and was manufactured by PSI .
An emotional Wagner told CNN he was days away from finishing his second tour in Iraq when he was putting away his flash bangs .
One of them exploded , severely damaging his right hand .
The injuries were so severe that he ended up having his hand amputated .
Wagner said PSI officials have no idea how the incident has affected his life .
" They do n't have a clue what it 's like , " Wagner said .
" If they could experience that , or someone close to them would have to go through that experience , I 'm sure it would be a different story and maybe they would n't have allowed it to happen . "

Editor 's note : Fareed Zakaria is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts " Fareed Zakaria : GPS " on CNN at 1 p.m. ET Sundays .
Fareed Zakaria says " We need to have communication channels open . "
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
On the day President - elect Obama visited the White House , a new national poll suggested that the current occupant at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is the most unpopular president since approval ratings were first measured more than six decades ago .
Seventy - six percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday disapprove of how President Bush is handling his job .
That 's an all - time high in polling by CNN or Gallup dating back to World War II .
CNN spoke to world affairs expert and author Fareed Zakaria to get his take on what the Republican Party should do to get back on track .
CNN : If we accept that President - Elect Barack Obama and the Democrats seem to have won largely on the message of change , then why do you think Sen. John McCain and the Republicans lost ?
Zakaria : I actually think that there were broad reasons for the resounding Republican loss and that they need to rethink their ideas before they can start winning again .
CNN : It was their ideas and not their strategy ?
Zakaria : The Republican Party has become a party bereft of ideas or trapped by the wrong ones .
The Reagan - Thatcher revolution of low taxes , deregulation and tight money is n't relevant to the problems of under - regulated financial products , huge deficits and a deepening recession .
Add to that the Republican Party 's social program is out of tune with an increasingly young , diverse and tolerant electorate .
Something similar has happened in foreign policy .
Voters have seemed to sense that there is a new world out there and that the solutions presented by McCain in his campaign did n't address the change .
CNN : But do you really think that American voters care about foreign policy ?
Especially when it seems it was the economy that mattered more .
Zakaria :
The economy was definitely an issue , but note that President Bush 's approval ratings had plummeted to historic lows by 2005 even when the economy seemed to be on a steady course .
And I do believe the vigorous unilateralism openly advocated by the administration is recognized by most Americans to have weakened the country 's influence abroad .
Its excessive reliance on military force has yielded few results relative to the costs .
Zakaria urges Obama to ' go big ' to fix economy »
At the heart of President Bush 's ideology was regime change -- armed Wilsonianism .
Whether in Iraq , North Korea or Iran , the basic goal was to refuse any kind of negotiation or diplomacy and instead try to overthrow the government and replace it with a democratic and friendly one .
Most Americans now recognize that , however pleasant this sounds in theory , the real world is a complicated place and cannot be transformed by magic or military power .
CNN : So we need to negotiate with the enemy ?
Zakaria :
We need to have communication channels open .
As former Secretary of State Madeline Albright said on our show , " Talking is not necessarily making nice .
It is delivering tough messages and listening .
I would bet that Milosevic did n't think that he was having a nice conversation with me -- or Kim Jong Il , for that matter . "
Recently , even President Bush himself has seen the necessity of this .
Over the past three years , he has negotiated with North Korea and Libya and even taken a tentative step with Iran ; launched a high - profile peace process between the Palestinians and Israelis ; and made encouraging proposals about global warming .
These are all steps Bush actively opposed during his first term .
He has moved in this direction out of necessity .
Failure concentrates the mind .
CNN : So what would you recommend to the Republican Party ?
Zakaria :
They need to realize the world is changing and the old rules do n't apply .
They need to be innovative as Ronald Reagan was in 1980 .
Shouting " USA is No. 1 " is cheap rhetoric , divorced from the real world .
The real challenge for Washington is not to boast about America 's might but to use its capacities -- military , political , intellectual -- to work with others to create a more stable , peaceful and prosperous world in which American interests and ideals will be secure .

In a move that is sure to put to rest the notion that there are no second acts in American life , former Bear Stearns chief risk officer Michael Alix has landed a job in the office of the Federal Reserve charged with assessing the safety and soundness of domestic banking institutions .
We suppose that Alix at least has plenty of experience with unsound banking institutions .
He was the chief risk officer of Bear Stearns from 2006 until 2008 .
So , basically , he was the guy on the mast charged with yelling " iceberg " just before the titantic introduced its bow to a floating hunk of ice .
Prior to that he ran credit risk management for Bear from 1996 to 2006 , Jon Keehner at Bloomberg points out .
That worked out just great .
" Alix will be a senior adviser to William Rutledge , executive vice president of the bank supervision group , according to a statement on the New York Fed 's Web site .
Staff in the group ' assess the safety and soundness of domestic banking institutions , ' " Keehner reports .

Does Studying Economics Inhibit Cooperation ?
by Robert H. Frank , Thomas Gilovich , and Dennis T. Regan
In an essay written in 1879 , Francis Amasa Walker tried to explain “ why economists tend to be in bad odor amongst real people . ”
Walker , who went on to become the first president of the American Economic Association , argued that it was partly because economists disregard “ … the customs and beliefs that tie individuals to their occupations and locations and lead them to act in ways contrary to the predictions of economic theory . ”
More than a century later , the general public continues to regard economists with suspicion .
This attitude stems in part from an apparent misunderstanding of economists ' positions on important public policy issues .
For example , economists commonly advocate auctioning rights to discharge atmospheric pollutants to the highest bidders , leading critics to bemoan economists ' “ shocking disregard for the environment and lack of compassion for the poor . ”
What else , the critics ask , could enable them to support a program under which “ the rich can pollute to their heart 's content ? ”
On closer examination , however , the economist 's position is less hostile to the interests of the poor and the environment than it appears .
Indeed , as almost every economics student now knows , the effect of auctioning pollution rights is to concentrate the burden of pollution reduction in the hands not of the poor but of those people and firms who can reduce pollution at the lowest cost .
And this is an outcome that is clearly in the interests of all citizens , rich and poor alike .
Misunderstandings of this sort aside , there remains another important source of public skepticism toward economics — namely , the perception that economics encourages people to act selfishly in pursuit of their own material interests .
In this paper , we examine the validity of this perception .
Economists and the Self - Interest Model
If pressed , most economists will concede that people sometimes care about more than just their own material well being .
Many have concerns for the welfare of other people , for esthetics , for their duties as citizens , and so on .
Yet few economists include these broader concerns in their models of human behavior .
It may well be that the unpaid volunteer who heads the local United Way Campaign is driven purely by his concern for the disadvantaged ; but economists feel on much firmer ground if they can identify some more narrowly self - interested motive for his action .
And on inspection , there is at least some evidence in support of their cynicism .
When we examine the membership rolls of volunteer organizations , we find that insurance brokers , real estate agents , car dealers , chiropractors , and others with something to sell tend to be disproportionately represented .
Such organizations have less than their share of truck drivers and postal employees .
The self - interest model has well established explanatory power .
Whatever role love may play in the sustenance of marriage relationships , we know that divorce rates are higher in states that provide liberal welfare benefits .
When energy prices rise , people are more likely to form car pools and to insulate their houses .
When the opportunity cost of time rises , people have fewer children .
And so on .
From the economist 's perspective , motives other than self - interest may matter , but they are peripheral to the main thrust of human endeavor , and we indulge them at our peril .
In Gordon Tullock 's words , “ the average human being is about 95 percent selfish in the narrow sense of the term . ”
From its base in economics , the self - interest model has made strong inroads into a variety of other disciplines .
Psychologists , political scientists , sociologists , philosophers , game theorists , biologists , and others rely increasingly on this model to explain and predict human behavior .
The basic question we investigate in this paper is whether exposure to the self - interest model alters the extent to which people behave in self - interested ways .
The paper is organized into two parts .
In the first , we report the results of a series of empirical studies — some our own , some by other investigators — that support the hypothesis that economists behave in more self - interested ways .
By itself , this evidence does not demonstrate that exposure to the self - interest model is the cause of more self - interested behavior , although , as we will see , a case can be made for this proposition on a priori grounds .
An alternative interpretation is that economists may simply have been more self - interested to begin with , and this difference was one reason they chose to study economics .
In the second part of the paper , we present preliminary evidence that exposure to the self - interest model does in fact increase self - interested behavior .
I. Do Economists Behave Differently ?
A. The Free -Rider Experiments
One of the clearest predictions of the self - interest model is that people will tend to free - ride on the efforts of others when it comes to the provision of public or collective goods .
Even people who would strongly benefit from having , say , higher program quality on public TV have little incentive to contribute .
After all , any single individual 's contribution is far too small to alter the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome .
A study by Gerald Marwell and Ruth Ames found that students of economics are indeed much more likely to free - ride in experiments that called for private contributions to public goods .
Their basic experiment involved a group of subjects who were given an initial endowment of money , which they were to allocate between two accounts , one “ public , ” the other “ private . ”
Money deposited in a subject 's private account was returned dollar for dollar to the subject at the end of the experiment .
Money deposited in the public account was first pooled , then multiplied by some factor greater than one , and then distributed equally among all subjects .
Under these circumstances , the socially optimal behavior is for each subject to put her entire endowment in the public account .
But the individually most advantageous strategy is to put all of it in the private account .
The self - interest model predicts that all subjects will follow the latter strategy .
Most do n't .
Across eleven replications of the experiment , the average contribution to the public account was approximately 49 percent .
It was only in a twelfth replication with first - year graduate students in economics as subjects that Marwell and Ames obtained results more nearly consistent with the self - interest model .
These subjects contributed an average of only 20 percent of their initial endowments to the public account , a figure significantly less than the corresponding figure for noneconomists ( p<.05 ) .
On completion of each replication of the experiment , Marwell and Ames asked their subjects two followup questions :
What is a “ fair ” investment in the public good ?
Are you concerned about “ fairness ” in making your investment decision ?
In response to the first question , 75 percent of the noneconomists answered “ half or more ” of the endowment , and 25 percent answered “ all . ”
In response to question 2 , almost all noneconomists answered “ yes . ”
The corresponding responses of the economics graduate students were much more difficult to summarize .
As Marwell and Ames wrote ,
… More than one - third of the economists either refused to answer the question regarding what is fair , or gave very complex , uncodable responses .
It seems that the meaning of ‘ fairness ’ in this context was somewhat alien for this group .
Those who did respond were much more likely to say that little or no contribution was ‘ fair . ’
In addition , the economics graduate students were about half as likely as other subjects to indicate that they were ‘ concerned with fairness ’ in making their decisions .
The Marwell and Ames study can be criticized on the grounds that their noneconomist control groups consisted of high school students and college undergraduates , who differ in a variety of ways from first - year graduate students in any discipline .
Perhaps the most obvious difference is age .
As we will see , however , criticism based on the age difference is blunted by our own evidence that older students generally give greater weight to social concerns like the ones that arise in free - rider experiments .
It remains possible , however , that more mature students might have had a more sophisticated understanding of the nuances and ambiguities inherent in concepts like fairness , and for that reason gave less easily coded responses to the followup questions .
Yet another concern with the Marwell and Ames experiments is not easily dismissed .
Although the authors do not report the sex composition of their group of economics graduate students , such groups are almost always preponderantly male .
The authors ' control groups of high school and undergraduate students , by contrast , consisted equally of males and females .
As our own evidence will later show , there is a sharp tendency for males to behave less cooperatively in experiments of this sort .
So while the Marwell and Ames findings are suggestive , they do not clearly establish that economists behave differently .
B. Economists and the Ultimatum Bargaining Game
The other major study of whether economists behave differently from members of other disciplines is by John Carter and Michael Irons ( 1991 ) .
These authors measured the self - interestedness of economists by examining their behavior in the ultimatum bargaining game .
This is a simple game with two players , an “ allocator ” and a “ receiver . ”
The allocator is given a sum of money ( in these experiments , $ 10 ) , and must then propose how to divide this sum between herself and the receiver .
Suppose , for example , the allocator proposes $ X for herself , the remaining $ ( 10 - X ) for the receiver .
Once the allocator makes this proposal , the receiver has two choices : ( 1 ) he may accept , in which case each player gets the amount proposed by the allocator ; or ( 2 ) he may refuse , in which case each player gets zero .
The game is played only once by the same partners .
If both players behave according to the self - interest model , the model makes an unequivocal prediction about how the game will proceed .
Assuming the money cannot be divided into units smaller than one cent , the allocator will propose $ 9.99 for herself and the remaining $ 0.01 for the receiver , and the receiver will accept on the grounds that a penny is better than nothing .
Since the game will not be repeated , there is no point in the receiver turning down a low offer in the hope of generating a better offer in the future .
Other researchers have shown that the strategy predicted by the self - interest model is almost never followed in practice : 50 - 50 splits are the most common outcome , and most one - sided offers are rejected out of concerns about fairness .
The research strategy employed by Carter and Irons was to compare the performance of economics majors and other students and see which group came closer to the predictions of the self - interest model .
In a sample of 43 economics majors , the average minimum amount acceptable by the receiver was $ 1.70 , as compared with an average of $ 2.44 for a sample of 49 noneconomics majors ( p<.05 ) .
As receivers then , economics majors came significantly closer than nonmajors to the behavior predicted by the self - interest model .
In the allocator 's role as well , economics majors performed more in accordance with the predictions of the self - interest model than did nonmajors .
Economics proposed to keep an average of $ 6.15 for themselves , as compared to an average of only $ 5.44 for the sample of 49 nonmajors ( p<.01 ) .
Kahneman , Knetsch , and Thaler ( 1986 ) report findings similar to those of Carter and Irons : commerce students ( the term used to describe business students in Canadian universities ) were more likely than psychology students to make one - sided offers in ultimatum bargaining games .
One difficulty with the Carter and Irons results is that the way they assigned the allocator and receiver roles leaves open possible differences in the interpretation of what behavior is required in the name of fairness .
In particular , allocators earned their role by having achieved higher scores on a preliminary word game .
Allocators might thus reason that they were entitled to a greater share of the surplus on the strength of their earlier performance .
The observed differences in the behavior of economics majors and nonmajors might therefore be ascribed to a differential tendency to attach significance to the earlier performance differences .
The training received by economics students in the marginal productivity theory of wages lends at least surface plausibility to this interpretation .
To summarize the existing literature , both the Marwell and Ames and Carter and Irons papers provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that economists tend to behave less cooperatively than noneconomists .
But because of the specific experimental design problems mentioned , neither study is conclusive .
In the following sections we describe our own attempts to test the hypothesis that economists behave less cooperatively .
C. Survey Data on Charitable Giving
The central role of the free - rider hypothesis in modern economic theory suggests that economists might be less likely than others to make gifts to private charities .
To explore this possibility , we mailed questionnaires to 1245 college professors randomly chosen from the professional directories of 23 disciplines , asking them to report the annual dollar amounts they gave to a variety of private charities .
We received 576 responses with sufficient detail for inclusion in our study .
Respondents were grouped into the following disciplines : economics ( N 75 ) ; other social sciences ( N 106 ) ; math , computer science , and engineering ( N 48 ) ; natural sciences ( N 98 ) ; humanities ( N 94 ) ; architecture , art , and music ( N 68 ) ; and professional ( N 87 ) .
Members of every discipline , even economics , fell far short of the prediction of the strong version of the free - rider hypothesis .
But the proportion of pure free riders among economists ( that is , those who reported giving no money to any charity ) was more than double that of any of the other six areas included in the survey .
( See Figure 1 . )
Figure 1 . Proportion of Pure Free Riders in Seven Disciplines .
Although we do not have data on the gender of each survey respondent , gender differences by discipline do not appear to account for the pattern of free - ridership shown in Figure 1 .
For example , the natural sciences , which are also preponderantly male , had only one - third as many free riders as did economics .
Despite their generally higher incomes , economists were also among the least generous in terms of their median gifts to large charities like viewer - supported television and the United Way , which are shown in Figures 2 and 3 , respectively .
Figure 2 . Median Gift to Public Television .
Figure 3 . Median Gift to the United Way .
In fairness to the self - interest model , we should note that there may be self - interested reasons for contributing even in the case of charities like the United Way and public television .
United Way campaigns , for example , are usually organized in the workplace and there is often considerable social pressure to contribute .
Public television fund drives often make on - the - air announcements of donors ' names and economists stand to benefit just as much as the members of any other discipline from being hailed as community - minded citizens .
In the case of smaller , more personal charitable organizations , there are often even more compelling self - interested reasons for giving .
After all , failure to contribute in accordance with one 's financial ability may mean outright exclusion from the substantial private benefits associated with membership in religious groups , fraternal organizations , and the like .
An examination of economists ' gifts to other charities revealed that their median annual gift is actually slightly larger , in absolute terms , than the median for all disciplines taken as a whole .
But because economists have significantly higher salaries than do the members of most other disciplines , these data , like the data shown in Figures 2 and 3 , tend to overstate the relative generosity of economists .
Unfortunately , we do not have direct income measures for the respondents in our survey , but we do have the number of years each respondent has been a practitioner in his or her discipline .
In an attempt to take income effects into account , we estimated earnings functions ( salary vs. years of experience ) for each discipline using data from a large private university .
We then applied the estimated coefficients from these earnings functions to the experience data from our survey to impute an income estimate for each respondent in our survey .
Finally , we used these imputed income figures , together with our respondents ' reports of their total charitable giving to estimate the relationship between income and total giving shown in Figure 4 .
In the latter exercise , all economists were dropped from the sample on the grounds that our object was to see whether the giving pattern of economists deviates from the pattern we see for other disciplines .
Thus , for example , in Figure 4 we see that a noneconomist with an annual income of $ 44,000 ( roughly , the median imputed income for architects in our sample ) is expected to give almost $ 900 per year to charity , while a noneconomist with an income of $ 62,000 ( roughly the median imputed income for economists in our sample ) is expected to give more than $ 1400 per year .
Figure 4 . Charitable Giving vs. Imputed Income .
Using the relationship between charitable giving and income , we calculated the expected gift for each respondent as a function of his or her imputed income .
We then calculated our measure of a discipline 's generosity as the ratio of the average value of gifts actually reported by members of the discipline to the average value of gifts expected on the basis of the members ' imputed incomes .
A discipline is thus more generous than expected if this ratio exceeds 1.0 , and less generous if it is less than 1.0 .
The computed ratio for economists was 0.91 , which means that economists in our sample gave 91 percent as much as they would have been expected to give on the basis of their imputed incomes .
The performance of economists by this measure is compared with the performance of other disciplines in Figure 5 .
Figure 5 . The Ratio of Average Gift to Gift Expected on the Basis of Income .
On a number of other dimensions covered in our survey , the behavior of economists was little different from the behavior of members of other disciplines .
For example , economists were only marginally less likely than members of other disciplines to report that they would take costly administrative action to prosecute a student suspected of cheating .
Economists were actually slightly above average for the entire sample in terms of the numbers of hours they reportedly spend in “ volunteer activities . ”
In terms of their reported frequency of voting in presidential elections , economists were only slightly below the sample average .
D. Economists and the Prisoner 's Dilemma
In this section we report our results from a large experimental study of how economics majors and nonmajors perform in the prisoner 's dilemma game .
Table 1 shows the monetary payoffs in dollars to two players , X and Y , in a standard prisoner 's dilemma .
In Table 1 , as in all prisoner 's dilemmas , each player gets a higher payoff when each cooperates than when each defects .
But when one player 's strategy is fixed , the other player always gets a higher payoff by defecting than by cooperating ; and hence the dilemma .
By following individual self - interest , each player does worse than if each had cooperated .
Table 1 . Monetary Payoffs for a Prisoner 's Dilemma Game .
One of the most celebrated and controversial predictions of the self - interest model is that people will always defect in one - shot prisoner 's dilemmas .
The game thus provides an opportunity to examine the extent to which various groups exhibit self - interested behavior .
Accordingly , we conducted a large one - shot prisoner 's dilemma experiment involving both economics majors and nonmajors .
Many of our subjects were students recruited from courses in which the prisoner 's dilemma is an item on the syllabus .
Others were given a detailed briefing about the game .
Our subjects met in groups of three and each was told that he would play the game once with each of the other two subjects .
The payoff matrix , shown in Table 1 , was the same for each play of the game .
Subjects were told that the games would be played for real money , and that none of the players would learn how their partners had responded in each play of the game .
( More below on how confidentiality was maintained . )
Following a period in which subjects were given an opportunity to get to know one another , each subject was taken to a separate room and asked to fill out a form indicating his response ( cooperate or defect ) to each of the other two players in his group .
After the subjects had filled out their forms , the results were tallied and the payments disbursed .
Each subject received a single payment that was the sum of three separate amounts : ( 1 ) the payoff from the game with the first partner ; ( 2 ) the payoff from the game with the second partner ; and ( 3 ) a term that was drawn at random from a large list of positive and negative values .
None of these three elements could be observed separately , only their sum .
The purpose of the random term was to make it impossible for a subject to infer from her total payment how any of the other subjects had played .
It prevented both the possibility of inferring individual choices and also of inferring even group patterns of choice .
Thus , unlike earlier prisoner 's dilemma experiments , ours did not enable the subject to infer what happened even when each ( or neither ) of her partners defected .
In one version of the experiment ( the “ unlimited ” version ) , subjects were told that they could make promises not to defect , but they were also told that the anonymity of their responses would render such promises unenforceable .
In two other versions of the experiment ( the “ intermediate ” and “ limited ” versions ) , subjects were not permitted to make promises about their strategies .
The latter two versions differed from one another in terms of the length of pre-game interaction , with up to 30 minutes permitted for the intermediate groups and no more than ten minutes for the limited groups .
All groups were given an extensive briefing on the prisoner 's dilemma at the start of the experiment and each subject was required to complete a questionnaire at the end to verify that he or she had indeed understood the consequences of different combinations of choices .
Results for the Sample as a Whole
For the sample as a whole there were a total of 267 games , which means a total of 534 choices between cooperation and defection .
The choices for economics majors and nonmajors are shown in Figure 6 , where we see that the defection rate for economics majors was 60.4 percent , as compared to only 38.8 percent for nonmajors .
Figure 6 . Defection and Cooperation Rates for the Sample as a Whole .
Needless to say , this pattern of differences is strongly supportive of the hypothesis that economics majors are more likely than nonmajors to behave self - interestedly ( p<.005 ) .
Adding Control Variables
Earlier we noted that one possible explanation for the observed differences between economics students and others is that economics students are more likely than others to be male .
To control for the possible influences of sex , age , and experimental condition , we performed the ordinary least squares regression reported in Table 2 .
Because each subject played the game twice , the individual responses are not statistically independent .
To get around this problem , we limited our sample to the 207 subjects who either cooperated with , or defected on , each of their two partners .
The 60 subjects who cooperated with one partner and defected on the other were deleted from the sample .
The dependent variable is the subject 's choice of strategy , coded as 0 for “ cooperate ” and 1 for “ defect . ”
The independent variables are “ econ ” which takes the value 1 for economics majors , 0 for all others ; “ unlimited , ” which is 1 for subjects in the unlimited version of the experiment , 0 for all others ; “ intermediate , ” which is 1 for subjects in the intermediate version , 0 for all others ; “ limited , ” which is the reference category ; “ sex , ” coded as 1 for males , 0 for females ; and “ class , ” coded as 1 for freshmen , 2 for sophomores , 3 for juniors , and 4 for seniors .

Consistent with a variety of other findings on sex differences in cooperation , we estimate that , other factors the same , the probability of a male defecting is almost 0.24 higher than the corresponding probability for a female .
Even after controlling for the influence of gender , we see that the probability of an economics major defecting is almost 0.17 higher than the corresponding probability for a nonmajor .
The coefficients for the unlimited and intermediate experimental categories represent effects relative to the defection rate for the limited category .
As expected , the defection rate is smaller in the intermediate category ( where subjects have more time to interact than in the limited category ) , and falls sharply further in the unlimited category ( where subjects are permitted to make promises to cooperate ) .
With subjects ' permission , we tape recorded the conversations of several of the unlimited groups , and invariably each person promised each of his partners he would cooperate .
( There would be little point , after all , in promising to defect . )
Note , finally , that the overall defection rate declines significantly as students progress through school .
The class coefficient is interpreted to mean that with the passage of each year the probability of defection declines , on the average , by almost 0.07 .
This pattern will prove important when we take up the question of whether training in economics is the cause of higher defection rates for economics majors .
The Unlimited Subsample
Focusing on subjects in the unlimited subsample , we see in Figure 7 that the difference between economics majors and nonmajors virtually disappears once subjects are permitted to make promises to cooperate .
For this subsample , the defection rate for economics majors is 28.6 percent , for nonmajors 25.9 percent .
Figure 7 . The Unlimited Subsample ( Promises Permitted ) .
The Intermediate and Limited Subsamples
Because the higher defection rates for economics majors are largely attributable to the no-promises conditions of the experiment , the remainder of our analysis focuses on subjects in the limited and intermediate groups .
The conditions encountered by these groups are of special significance because they come closest to approximating the conditions that characterize social dilemmas encountered in practice .
After all , people rarely have an opportunity to look one another in the eye and promise not to litter on deserted beaches or disconnect the smog control devices on their cars .
In Figure 8 we report the choices for the pooled limited and intermediate groups .
Comparing the entries in Figure 8 with Figure 7 , we see clear evidence of the higher defection rates of both economics majors and nonmajors .
The defection rates of 71.8 percent and 47.3 percent for economics majors and nonmajors , respectively , differ significantly from one another at the .01 level .
Figure 8 . Defection and Cooperation Rates for the No-Promises Subsample .
Reasons for Cooperation and Defection
As part of the exit questionnaire that tested our subjects ' understanding of the payoffs associated with different combinations of choices , we also asked them to state their reasons for making the choices they did .
We hypothesized that economists would be more inclined to construe the objective of the game in self - interested terms , and therefore more likely to refer exclusively to features of the game itself when describing reasons for their choices .
By contrast , we expected the noneconomists to be more open to alternative ways of interpreting the game , and thus more likely to look to their partners for cues about how to play .
Accordingly , we expected noneconomists to refer more often to their feelings about their partners , aspects of human nature , and so on .
This is precisely the pattern we found .
Among the sample of economics students , 31 % made exclusive reference to features of the game itself in explaining their chosen strategies , as compared with only 17 % of the noneconomists .
The probability of obtaining such divergent responses by chance is less than .05 .
Another possible explanation for the economists ' higher defection rates is that economists may be more likely than others to expect their partners to defect .
The self - interest model , after all , encourages such an expectation , and we know from other experiments that most subjects defect if they are told that their partners are going to defect .
To investigate the role of expectations , we asked students in an upper division public finance course in Cornell 's economics department whether they would cooperate or defect in a one - shot prisoner 's dilemma if they knew with certainty that their partner was going to cooperate .
Most of these students were economics majors in their junior and senior years .
Of the 31 students returning our questionnaires , 18 ( 58 percent ) reported that they would defect , only 13 that they would cooperate .
By contrast , just 34 percent ( 14 of 41 ) noneconomics Cornell undergraduates who were given the same questionnaire reported that they would defect on a partner they knew would cooperate ( p<.05 ) .
For the same two groups of subjects , almost all respondents ( 30 of 31 economics students and 36 of 41 noneconomics students ) said they would defect if they knew their partner would defect .
From these responses , we conclude that while expectations of partner performance do indeed play a strong role in predicting behavior , defection rates would remain significantly higher for economists than for noneconomists even if both groups held identical expectations about partner performance .
II .
Why Do Economists Behave Differently ?
In the preceding sections we have seen evidence that economists behave less cooperatively than noneconomists along a variety of different dimensions .
This difference in behavior might be exclusively the result of training in economics .
Alternatively , it might exist simply because people who chose to major in economics were different initially .
Or it might be some combination of these two effects .
We now report evidence on whether training in economics plays a causal role .
A. Comparing Upperclassmen and Underclassmen
If economics training plays a causal role in uncooperative behavior , then we would expect defection rates in the prisoner 's dilemma experiments to rise with exposure to training in economics .
Again focusing on the no-promises subsample , the defection rates are broken down by major and level of education in Figure 9 .
As shown , the defection rate for economics majors is virtually the same for both upperclassmen ( juniors and seniors ) and underclassmen ( freshmen and sophomores ) .
By contrast , the defection rate for nonmajors is approximately 33 percent higher for underclassmen than for upperclassmen .
Figure 9 . Defection Rates for Upper- and Underclassmen .
The pattern shown in Figure 9 continues to hold when we control for the effects of other factors that influence defection rates .
As the regression equation summarized in Table 3 shows , the defection probabilities do not differ significantly between upperclass economics majors and underclass economics majors .
For nonmajors , defection probabilities are sharply lower than for majors in each category , and fall by more than 0.16 with the transition to upperclass status .

The Effect of Education Level on Defection Rates .
Thus , for students in general there is a pronounced tendency toward more cooperative behavior with movement toward graduation , a trend that is conspicuously absent for economics majors .
On the basis of the available evidence , we are in no position to say whether the trend for noneconomists reflects something about the content of noneconomics courses .
But regardless of the causes of this trend , the fact that it is not present for economists is consistent with the hypothesis that training in economics plays at least some causal role in the lower observed cooperation rates of economists .
B. Honesty Surveys
In a further attempt to assess whether training in economics inhibits cooperation in social dilemmas , we posed a pair of ethical dilemmas to students in two introductory microeconomics courses at Cornell University and to a control group of students in an introductory astronomy course , also at Cornell .
In one dilemma , the owner of a small business is shipped ten microcomputers but is billed for only nine and the question is whether the owner will inform the computer company of the error .
Subjects are first asked to estimate the chances ( 0 - 100 % ) that the owner would point out the mistake , and then , on the same response scale , to indicate how likely they would be to point out the error if they were the owner .
The second dilemma concerns whether a lost envelope containing $ 100 and bearing the owner 's name and address is likely to be returned by the person who finds it .
Subjects are first asked to imagine that they have lost the envelope and to estimate the likelihood that a stranger would return it .
They are then asked to assume that the roles are reversed and to indicate the chances that they would return the money to a stranger .
Students in each class completed the questionnaire on two occasions , first during the initial week of class in September , and then during the final week of class in December .
For each of the four questions , each student was coded as being “ more honest ” if the probability checked for that question rose between September and December ; “ less honest ” if it fell during that period ; and “ no change ” if it remained the same .
Our hypothesis was that even a single semester of introductory microeconomics would have a measurable effect both on students ' expectations of the level of self - interested behavior in society and on their own propensities to behave self - interestedly .
The first introductory microeconomics instructor ( instructor A ) whose students we surveyed is a mainstream economist with research interests in industrial organization and game theory .
In class lectures , this instructor placed heavy emphasis on the prisoner 's dilemma and related illustrations of how survival imperatives often militate against cooperation .
The second microeconomics instructor ( instructor B ) is a specialist in economic development in Maoist China who did not emphasize such material to the same degree , but did assign a mainstream introductory text .
On the basis of these differences , our expectation was that any observed effects of economics training should be stronger in instructor A's class than in instructor B's .
The results for the three classes are summarized in Figures 10 - 12 .
Introductory Microeconomics A ( N 48 )

Introductory Microeconomics B ( N 115 )
Figure 10 .
Questionnaire Findings , Introductory Microeconomics B .
Introduction to Astronomy ( N 30 )
Figure 12 .
Questionnaire Findings : Introduction to Astronomy .
As Figures 10 and 11 indicate , a tendency toward more cynical responses was observed in instructor A's introductory economics class but not in instructor B's .
In our control group of introductory astronomy students ( Figure 12 ) , there was a weak tendency toward less cynical expectations and behavior over the course of the semester .
It may seem natural to wonder whether the differences reflected in Figures 10 and 11 might stem in part from the fact that students chose their instructors rather than being randomly assigned .
Perhaps the ideological reputations of the two professors were known in advance to many students , with the result that a disproportionate number of the least cynical students chose to take instructor B's course .
Two observations , however , weigh heavily against this interpretation .
First , the average values of the initial responses to the four questions were in fact virtually the same for both classes .
And second , note that Figures 10 and 11 record not the level of cynicism but the change in that level between the beginning and end of the course .
Figure 11 thus tells us that even if the students in Microeconomics A were more cynical to begin with , they became still more so during the course of the semester .
This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that emphasis on the self - interest model tends to inhibit cooperation .
Discussion
There have been several previous attempts to discover whether economists behave in more self - interested ways than do noneconomists .
The Marwell and Ames finding of a greater tendency to free ride on the part of economists is uncertain because their samples of economists and noneconomists were different on so many dimensions other than academic history and interests .
The Carter and Irons findings on the ultimatum bargaining game were subject to an alternative interpretation based on the possibility that economics majors may have held different views on how performance in the preliminary word game affected entitlements in the ultimatum game .
We believe our prisoner 's dilemma results constitute the clearest demonstration to date of a large difference in the extent to which economists and noneconomists behave self - interestedly .
And our survey of charitable giving lends additional support to the hypothesis that economists are more likely than others to free ride .
But we also emphasize that both of these exercises produced evidence that economists behave in traditionally communitarian ways under at least some circumstances .
For example , they reported spending as much time as others in volunteer activities , and their total gifts to charity were only slightly less than would have been expected on the basis of their incomes .
Finally , in the unlimited version of our prisoner 's dilemma experiments , where subjects were allowed to promise to cooperate , economists were almost as likely to cooperate as noneconomists were .
We also found evidence consistent with the view that the differences in cooperativeness are caused in part by training in economics .
First , we saw that the gap in defection rates between economics majors and nonmajors tends to widen as students move toward graduation .
Second , we saw that introductory microeconomics , at least if taught in a certain way , seems to affect student attitudes toward honesty .
Clearly , our evidence for the existence of a difference between the behavior of economists and noneconomists is more compelling than our evidence for the causal role of economics training in creating that difference .
But there is additional indirect evidence for such a role .
One of the clearest patterns to emerge in several decades of experimental research on the prisoner 's dilemma is that the behavior of any given player is strongly influenced by that player 's prediction about what his partner will do .
In experiments involving noneconomists , people who expect their partners to cooperate usually cooperate themselves , and those who expect their partners to defect almost always defect .
In our experiments , economists were 42 percent more likely than noneconomists to predict that their partners would defect .
It would be remarkable indeed if none of this difference in outlook were the result of repeated exposure to a behavioral model whose unequivocal prediction is that people will defect whenever self - interest dictates .
For the sake of discussion , suppose that exposure to the self - interest model does , in fact , cause people to behave more selfishly .
Should this be a cause for concern ?
To the extent that norms favoring cooperation help solve prisoner 's dilemmas and other market failures , one cost of a rise in selfish behavior is a fall in the real value of economic output .
Who bears this cost ?
By conventional accounts , it is those who continue to behave cooperatively , a troubling outcome on equity grounds .
Several researchers have recently suggested , however , that the ultimate victims of noncooperative behavior may be the very people who practice it .
Suppose , for example , that some people always cooperate in one - shot prisoner 's dilemmas while others always follow the seemingly dominant strategy of defecting .
If people are free to interact with others of their own choosing , and if there are cues that distinguish cooperators from defectors , then cooperators will interact selectively with one another and earn higher payoffs than defectors .
Elsewhere we have shown that even on the basis of brief encounters involving strangers , experimental subjects are adept at predicting who will cooperate and who will defect in prisoner 's dilemma games .
If people are even better at predicting the behavior of people they know well , it seems that the direct pursuit of material self - interest may indeed often be self - defeating .
These observations do not challenge the obvious importance of self - interest as a human motive .
But they do suggest the need for a richer model of 20 human behavior , one that explicitly recognizes that people who hold cooperative motives often come out ahead .

Question # 1 .
In an effort to increase productivity , the owner of a small business has ordered ten personal computers for use by his staff .
When the UPS shipment arrives , he notices that the invoice from the mail - order house bills for only nine PCs , even though all ten were included with the shipment .
The owner has two options .
( 1 ) He can inform the mail - order house of its error and ask to be billed for the correct amount ; or ( 2 ) he can pay the amount shown on the invoice and take no further action .
If the owner pays the amount shown , the worst thing that can happen is that the mail - order house may later discover its error and bill him for the tenth computer .
There is a high probability ( 0.99 , say ) that the error will never be discovered .
