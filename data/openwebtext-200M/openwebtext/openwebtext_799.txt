You used to make gazillions .
Now you wo n’t even make an honest , old - fashioned million .
What to do ?
That thought could have flashed through the minds of people accustomed to a lot of zeroes in their paychecks after President Obama announced his plan to place income limits on executives who work for companies that receive federal bailout money .
The plan includes a $ 500,000 cap on compensation for senior officials and new restrictions on other kinds of megabuck payouts , like severance pay .
It was enough to raise the obvious question :
What if your salary were capped at $ 500,000 a year ?
Time to look up a couple of people who have made more than that , and ask , when was the last time they had made that little ?
( It ’s still a lot of money by almost any measure . )
And , how did so much money change their lives ?
“ It would take me back to ’91 or ’ 92 , ” said Mary Rodas , who made big money when she was a teenager as vice president for marketing of the company that made Balzac , a ball - in - a - sack toy that became a top seller at F.A.O. Schwarz .
In those days she rode around in a limousine ( “ I was too young for a driver ’s license , ” she said ) and did her market research at the private school she attended , trying out product designs and colors on younger students .
Firms dealing with Britain 's debt problems warned tonight that one in 60 people were facing insolvency after the latest government figures showed that a collapsing economy led to record personal bankruptcies and a 50 % jump in company failures late last year .
Industry specialists said the sharp rise in individual and corporate financial distress reported by the Insolvency Service for the last three months of 2008 was " the tip of the iceberg " and that rising unemployment and the credit crunch would deepen the debt crisis this year .
Official figures released today showed that the steepest economic decline in almost 30 years led to 19,100 people being declared bankrupt – a 22 % increase on the fourth quarter of 2007 .
A further 10,000 people took out individual voluntary arrangements ( IVAs ) , under which interest on debt is frozen in exchange for set repayments each month .
The total of 29,444 people being declared insolvent was up 18.5 % on a year earlier and is already running at higher levels than during the recession of the early 1990s .
David Mond , chairman of the Debt Resolution Forum , the trade body for IVA and debt resolution firms , said : " The government 's figures , showing that one in 400 adults became personally insolvent last year , are the tip of the iceberg .
" Not only are there an estimated 110,000 people currently in individual voluntary arrangements , but there are probably more than 700,000 people in informal debt management plans – and these are just the people who have decided to deal with their unsustainable debt , hundreds of thousands more are probably still struggling on .
" This means that 1 in 60 adults in England and Wales are dealing with unmanageable debt – nearly seven times the government 's figure . "
The 1.5 % contraction in the economy in the wake of the financial market mayhem last autumn also claimed 4,607 companies – a 52 % increase in liquidations on October - December 2007 .
Economists warned that the level of bankruptcies was set to increase as unemployment rose and the problems caused by the credit crunch meant people were no longer able to borrow their way out of trouble .
Lending figures for December showed an increase in the number of people shifting their debt to personal loans and credit cards , many of them with higher interest rates than a year ago as banks increased the cost of unsecured lending .
Financial advisers warned that this move , coupled with a clampdown by lenders on customers to extending their mortgages , was likely to increase further the pressure on people with high levels of debt .
Alan Tomlinson , a partner at the licensed insolvency practitioners Tomlinsons , said : " I have been an insolvency practitioner for over 25 years and have never seen so many companies , from all sectors , going to the wall .
" Trading conditions have never been so tough and given the bleak economic outlook , it could be some time yet before they begin to improve .
" The appalling economic conditions are claiming more and more victims , as companies in all sectors make redundancies or simply fail .
" What is especially interesting is that more people have gone down the bankruptcy rather than the IVA route , which is a reflection of the fact that lenders have tightened up the criteria for the acceptance of IVAs . "
Many customers have also avoided bankruptcy and an IVA following a trend among banks to offer debt management plans , which can delay repayments or spread them over a longer period .
These plans , like IVAs , often fail and debtors are forced into bankruptcy at a later date .
The Consumer Credit Counselling Service recently said it received record numbers of calls to its helplines in the first two weeks of January .
The Insolvency Service figures also showed a 75 % jump in the number of people declared insolvent in Scotland during the final quarter at 5,807 , although the figure was slightly down on the total for the previous quarter .
In Northern Ireland insolvencies increased by 39 % year - on - year to 443 during the three months to the end of December .
Nick O'Reilly , president of the insolvency professionals ' trade body R3 , said : " What today 's figures mean is that in 2008 we saw a staggering 350 people becoming insolvent in the UK every day .
For 2009 our members believe this number will reach in excess of 430 people a day for the whole of the UK .
" The outlook is bleak for the next two years , when insolvency practitioners expect to see in excess of 158,000 personal insolvencies annually .
" We 'll start to see the knock - on effects of increasing business failures and redundancies on personal financial situations , " he said .
Personal bankruptcy hit a record level and company failures soared by 50 % as the collapse in the economy in the final three months of 2008 took its toll , official figures showed today .
Data from the Insolvency Service revealed that the steepest decline in output in almost 30 years led to 19,100 people being declared bankrupt - a 22 % increase on the fourth quarter of 2007 .
A further 10,000 people took out individual voluntary arrangements ( IVAs ) under which interest on debt is frozen in exchange for set repayments each month .
The total of 29,444 people being declared insolvent was up 18.5 % on a year earlier and was higher than during the recession of the early 1990s .
The 1.5 % contraction in the economy in the wake of the financial market mayhem last autumn also claimed 4,607 companies - a 52 % increase in liquidations on the October to December period of 2007 .
Economists warned that the level of bankruptcies was set to increase as unemployment rose and the problems caused by the credit crunch meant people were no longer able to borrow their way out of trouble .
Howard Archer , chief UK and European Economist at IHS Global Insight , said : " Unfortunately , the marked rise in the number of individual insolvencies in the fourth quarter of 2008 is a harbinger of what is very likely to be seen through 2009 .
" Deep economic contraction , sharply rising unemployment , higher debt levels , lower equity prices , and more and more people being trapped in negative equity will exact an increasing toll over the coming months .
" While the substantial cuts in interest rates by the Bank of England will obviously help some people , they are likely to be insufficient to save many from insolvency . "
Alan Tomlinson , partner at licensed insolvency practitioners Tomlinsons , said : " I have been an insolvency practitioner for over 25 years and have never seen so many companies , from all sectors , going to the wall .
Trading conditions have never been so tough and given the bleak economic outlook it could be some time yet before they begin to improve .

Mercenary / Private Military Companies ( PMCs )
Not all companies provide all services .
Some of these companies are classical " merc " operations , while others are risk management firms that have nothing in common with privately contracted military support operations .
For reasons I have expressed in earlier posts , I am opposed to the death penalty .
I simply do not trust our criminal justice system enough to make a life or death decision on the innocence or guilt of an individual ( based on recent news concerning Dr. West and others , it seems my distrust in the system is completely justified ) .
I am very pleased to learn that the Colorado General Assembly is taking a hard look at this issue and considering repealing the death penalty and using the money saved to help investigate cold cases .
The Rocky Mountain News reports :
The idea of abolishing the death penalty in Colorado and using the money it takes to prosecute such cases to solve so - called cold cases stirred debate in a House committee late into the night Monday .
House Majority Leader Paul Weissmann , D - Louisville , revived his bill that just missed passing the House in 2007 .
The threat of death does not deter people from committing murders , he said , and the $ 370,000 spent to prosecute those cases could be better spent on investigating unsolved murders .
Since 1967 , Colorado has executed one person and there are only two people on death row , Weissmann said .
During that time , there have been 1,435 unsolved homicides .
Considering that the death penalty is so rarely enforced in Colorado , it seems to me that even those who support the death penalty should recognize the incredible costs associated with placing less than a handful of individuals on death row .
The families of these 1,435 victims have just as much right to bring the killers of their loved ones to justice as those who wait for the day of execution for the ones who have taken their loved ones from them .
The article continues :
But several opponents of Weissmann ’s bill said it ’s based on a false argument .
Attorney General John Suthers noted that the Homicide Assistance Unit that works to solve and prosecute death penalty cases also has assisted 19 of the state ’s 22 judicial districts with cold cases .
Colorado Bureau of Investigation Director Ron Sloan said that a Cold Case Task Force formed in 2007 is nearing the point where it will bring together federal , state and local analysts to review cases that are referred to it .
Plus , Suthers said , there are times when the possibility of receiving the death penalty is necessary to deter crimes .
Those include instances in which someone who has been sentenced to or is facing life in prison might want to kill witnesses or commit an act of terrorism , he said .
I disagree that the bill makes a “ false argument . ”
If the state saves $ 370,000 by no longer prosecuting death penalty cases , that ’s $ 370,000 the cold case units have to work with that they currently do not .
And if Colorado has only executed one person since 1967 , how does having the death penalty on the books deter individuals from committing homicide ?
I think we all instinctively know the answer : it does n’t .
Faith - based office to expand its reach under Obama
WASHINGTON — President Obama Thursday announced the creation of his faith - based outreach office , expanding its agenda beyond funding social programs to work on policies aimed at strengthening family life and reducing abortion .
Obama ’s office leaves in place rules that allow faith - based groups receiving federal funding to hire only people of their own faith , but White House aides said the hiring rules would be reviewed on a case - by - case basis when there are complaints and that the Justice Department will provide legal assistance .
Obama ’s move more fully formalizes the partnerships between the federal government and faith groups that first began under President Bill Clinton and was expanded by President George W. Bush .
But where Bush used the faith office primarily for funding programs — drawing criticism that he was mainly assisting his political supporters —
Obama said he wants to use the office for policy guidance , as well .
Speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast at the Hilton Washington Thursday , Obama said the goal of the initiative “ will not be to favor one religious group over another — or even religious groups over secular groups .
It will simply be to work on behalf of those organizations that want to work on behalf of our communities , and to do so without blurring the line our Founders wisely drew between church and state . ”
The president created a 25 - member advisory council and named 15 of its members yesterday , including several high - profile evangelicals — the Rev. Joel Hunter , senior pastor of a Florida megachurch , and the Rev. Frank Page , president emeritus of the Southern Baptist Convention — as well as representatives from secular nonprofits , which largely had little association with Bush ’s faith - based initiative .
The council members are to advise the faith office on policy but will not play a direct role in allocating federal grants .
The office will be headed by Joshua DuBois , a 26 - year - old Pentecostal who worked on religious issues for Obama ’s campaign .
The office will be more involved in policy planning than it was during the Bush years , White House aides said .
They said the top priorities for the office will be interfaith relations , strengthening the role of fathers in society and reducing poverty .
The office also will help develop policies aimed at reducing the number of abortions , though no specifics were offered .
Obama kept in place , however , much of the legal structure for the office created through executive orders by Bush .
The 11 faith - based offices Bush established in different agencies and a faith liaison in the public outreach office will continue .
Paul Monteiro will be the religious liaison in the Office of Public Liaison , the White House said Thursday .
DuBois said the faith - based office will employ about 50 people .
Despite speaking on the campaign trail against the Bush administration ’s approach — including on hiring and proselytizing — Obama wants “ to create a process to look at this in a way that can withstand scrutiny and takes into account views on all sides , ” DuBois said in an interview Thursday .
Three members of the advisory council — Page , the Rev. Jim Wallis and World Vision President Richard Stearns — have heightened concerns among church - state separatists .
Wallis persuaded Clinton to start his faith - based program , which opened the door to Bush ’s larger program .
The Southern Baptist Convention , which Page led , says that it is discriminatory for the government to prevent its members from sharing their faith with others .
And Stearns ’ organization received funding in the Bush years while saying it should not be forced to hire non-Christians .
Faith - based nonprofits received federal grants totaling more than $ 10.6 billion during the Bush administration , said members of the former White House staff .
As the Journal previewed Wednesday night , Macy's this morning announced the closing of 11 stores , a move that came after a rough holiday season .
Macy 's also said Thursday that same - store sales for December fell 4 % , amid what it called " the most challenging economic environment in memory . "
Here 's the list of the store locations Macy 's is closing :

Like many successful internet phenomena , 4 chan is a shockingly simple idea : an online bulletin board where anyone can post pictures .
This simplicity is deceptive .
4 chan 's founder is a 21 - year - old New Yorker named Christopher Poole .
Known as " moot " to the site 's devotees , Poole is disarmingly well - spoken and pragmatic about what he has created .
" It 's my belief that the community should dictate its norms , standards , and rules , " he says .
" I 've left /b/ to its own devices , with very little intervention . "
Of all the memes spawned from 4 chan , is there one you feel most attached to ?
At the last ROFLcon [ in Cambridge last April ] , someone asked " Do you like RickRolling ? "
I said something to the effect of " Screw RickRolling ! "
Everyone gasped because that was the cool thing at the time .
But now they 'd probably agree .
Yeah , once Nancy Pelosi does a RickRolling video with her cat on YouTube , you know it 's done .
But then I remembered that my favorite was something called Weegee , and only two people in the crowd were like " Yeah , Weegee ! "
That 's a good sign -- that no one knows what it is .
What is it ?
Weegee is just a vectored photo of Luigi from Mario Brothers placed in completely random situations .
Sounds harmless .
Does it bother you that most people think of 4 chan as only being the most controversial board , /b/?
We have 44 image boards at this point , so in that sense it 's a small part of the site .
But /b/ accounts for 30 percent of our traffic .
That 's where the attention is , that 's where the headlines are coming from .
That 's also where a lot of the rowdiness and lawlessness goes on .
What do you think of that lawlessness ?
Some of it can be healthy , as long as it remains within certain boundaries .
What boundaries ?
Like that we do n't actually break that law .
Because of the lack of rules , 4 chan has fostered an environment where there 's a lot of creativity and good things coming out of it .
But at the same time , when people go out and do crazy things ...
Which kinds of things ?
The best example is when Jake Brahm was arrested for posting a bomb hoax .
[ In October 2006 , Brahm was arrested for threatening to blow up multiple NFL stadiums .
He was sentenced to six months in prison . ]
And after that we saw a lot of copycat stuff .
People were getting arrested for saying they were going to do the same thing .
Law enforcement was coming every week and asking for our help .
When you started the site , did you expect any of that ?
Absolutely not .
Its popularity has been entirely an accident .
I was 15 years old and into anime .
I threw up one image board , which was the original / b/.
At first it was all anime .
As people started posting other things , I added more boards and /b/ remained the random board .
4chan has blown up over the past five years .
It 's gone from 100 people to 4.75 million per month .
And /b/ is pushing 100 million pageviews .
What makes it so big ?
At the time , it was very unique .
Image boards and anonymous BBS had been big in Japan , but not in the West , where we were used to bulletin boards and blogs .
When 4 chan started , the format was new .
And it was unique because of the anonymity aspect .
What was your scariest moment running the site ?
Probably the first time I was contacted by law enforcement .
At the time I was 16 and I was living with my mother .
That was shocking .
Given your user base , are you worried about your own identity theft ?
Yeah , I originally hid behind the moniker because I was 15 .
It was not appropriate to use my real name at the time .
My friends did n't know , my parents did n't know , my educators did n't know .
Back then , people did n't appreciate the site so much , but now I can point to good things like LOLcats .
Back then , they would have just seen porn .
When did your family find out ?
Only when those articles came out last year .
I kept it a secret from almost all of my friends and family until 2008 .
It was five full years of living a double life .
Was your mom shocked ?
I do n't think anyone was put - off .
Four years ago , it was just a porn site .
It 's matured a lot into something a little more presentable .
Now I think they can appreciate it as more than that .
One of the most interesting things about 4 chan is that nothing gets archived .
Threads disappear within an hour .
It 's a contradiction -- 4 chan is known for creating memes , yet it 's designed for them to die so quickly .
The lack of retention lends itself to having fresh content .
The joke is that 4 chan post is a repost of a repost of a repost .
There was a guy who was downloading every image from / b/.
He calculated that 80 percent of what 's posted has been posted before .
So it 's survival of the fittest .
Ideas that are carried over to the next day are worth repeating .
The things that are genuinely funny get carried over .
The reason we 're seen as a meme generation factory is because of the unique qualities of the image board and the lack of retention .
On other bulletin boards , threads are archived indefinitely .
All the big threads have been around for months or years .
But with 4 chan , something has to be really good to keep getting posted .
How involved are you with Anonymous ?
I 'm not involved at all .
What do you think about it ?
I think it 's interesting .
When Scientology tried to make the Tom Cruise video disappear , there was this instant mobilization of thousands of people who banded together overnight .
They had plans to stage a worldwide protest .
I thought that was pretty incredible .
I was fascinated by it .
Are there situations where they go too far ?
I would say so .
Submitting bomb threats -- stuff like that is going too far .
You need to be smart about it .
You can't just throw it all away with threats , you have to be proactive and productive .
Because there 's no membership policy , it seems like anything can get attributed to being an act of Anonymous .
Yeah , now it 's become more of a buzzword for the media .
Now anytime something happens , it gets labeled as " an act of international hate group Anonymous . "
That 's why I always personally felt that the movement was destined to fail .
You 've got two types of people :
You have the Anonymous members who are genuinely passionate about dismantling Scientology , but then you have the casual hangers - on who are just there to troll .
Because you can't filter it and because the membership is open , Anonymous will always be held back by the bottom rung who are pelting Scientology with eggs and bomb threats and these mischievous juvenile acts .
They are holding back the people who take it more seriously .
For every step forward Anonymous makes , they can go 10 steps back with one negative headline .
You must feel something similar .
4 chan has a mixed public image too .
4 chan certainly has a stigma .
And Anonymous seemed to emerge out of 4chan .
Yeah , I would say that 's definitely the case .
Anonymous culture emerged out of image boards .
The rules of these communities spawned some of the original thinking behind the group .
But once the Scientology protests started , people outside of 4 chan joined .
At that point it diverged into its own thing .
How much does it cost to run the site ?
About $ 6,000 per month .
That 's actually not too bad for a site that is all rich media and has 300 million pageviews .
I do n't have any overhead past that .
I do n't have any employees .
I do n't have an office .
Are you making your money back ?
Just barely .
We 're trying to convince advertisers that our community is worth their ad dollars .
That 's been a really uphill battle because of our content .
Advertisers will Google us and see that we 're huge , but they 'll also see all these threats and hacks .
It scares them away .
Overcoming that stigma is difficult .
Have you thought about dropping the controversial board ?
People have suggested dropping / b/ , but that 's the life force of the site .
I can't do that .
It was the first board , and it will be the last board to go .
I imagine you 've seen so many strange things doing this site .
What 's the most demented thing you 've seen ?
I 'd be happy to email you something .
[ Laughs . ]
I 've seen some horrible shit .
I like to think that I 've grown as a person , but at the same time I think a little piece of me continues to die every year .
What have you learned from all this ?
I 'm still trying to figure that out .
I need to start thinking about getting a job .
I do n't have a resume .
I 've been asking myself , what have I learned about the internet , what have I learned about myself ?
At this point , I 've been unable to articulate that .

A Citi shareholder making a withdrawal from the ATM on 86th and Lexington would pay the equivalent of 3 shares of Citi in ATM fees .
The fee is $ 3 while Citi shares traded around $ 1 for most the day .
To put it differently , Citi gets a capital injection from each ATM transaction that is three times as valuable as issuing new shares .

Several Blogs have published accounts saying that an Android application called MemoryUp , which is supposed to boost memory , is wiping out personal data from G1 Google phones , spamming people from the phone ’s contact list and corrupting memory .
That accusation seems to be – at the least – overblown .
But there ’s a cautionary tale in how this rumor shot around the blogosphere , and is something to keep in mind when making decisions based on blog entries , even those that show up pervasively ( and yes , that means mine too ) .
Most of the MemoryUp reports are cut and paste jobs , reprinting the same reporting over and over .
This is one of my big gripes with blogging — but I ’ll get to that .
Scanning the forums myself , I expected to find what one site called “ legions ” of people suffering from lost data .
I found one .
Two more are shown on a photo of phone screen accompanying some of the reports .
Contacting Google shed little light .
Its response to questions ( was it removed from the market , if so voluntarily or forcibly ?
etc. ) is the following statement :
Android is designed to minimize the impact of poorly programmed or malicious applications on the device .
Each application runs within an application sandbox which limits an application ’s interaction with user data , system resources and other apps .
When installing an application , users are informed what the program needs to access and then decide whether they allow the application to be installed .
( Translation : Some protection is built - in , but in any case , you were warned . )
Furthermore , if an application is deemed harmful or inappropriate , users can flag it , give it a low rating , leave a detailed comment , and of course , remove it from their device .
Once flagged by users , applications are reviewed and harmful or inappropriate applications are removed from the Market .
Abusive developers can also be blocked from using the Android Market for repeated or egregious violations of our policies .
( Translation : Bad actors will be found out – eventually .
Too bad for the early adopters . )
Lost in the sauce was a statement a Google spokesperson gave Wired.com on January 26 .
“ We have investigated and determined that MemoryUp is not malware . ”
The statement was confirmed to me , although it is no longer being proactively issued .
It should be .
I e-mailed the MemoryUp developer , eMobiStudios .
While waiting for a response , I visited the website , which had no mention of the kerfuffle .
I think good PR dictates getting out ahead of the problem .
The result is a vacuum of reliable information in which the MemoryUp story flourished and spread like mold on month - old bread .
So now it looks as though the program causes no harm .
But , as one Android developer , Sam Abadir of Fly - Cast , told me , Android basically carries out the functions of MemoryUp itself , so it ’s not really helpful either .
Another result of the info -vacuum has been is a minor hit to the credibility of the Android Marketplace .
The rumor put the question of how safe Android ’s open market model is in the spotlight .
Suddenly the hoops
Apple makes developers jump through do n’t seem unfairly restrictive .
Apple should send a muffin basket to MemoryUp .
It also hurt MemoryUp whose reputation has now been smeared around the net .
I did eventually get an e-mail from eMobiStudio CEO Robert Lee , who said that he thinks that people who were angry over his attempt to charge $ 15 for his app slimed the product .
The rumors gained currency because the Android Market removed the paid application ( currently the market is for free apps only ) , then mistakenly removed the free version , he said .
When he reposting the free version , some customers thought he was trying to “ spam the market , ” he said .
It is currently off the market .
I ’ll make a proposal to hem in rumors and save the reputations of companies , bloggers and developers .
1 ) You ca n’t shut down rumors and the damage they cause by clamming up .
Companies , come clean .
2 ) Do n’t be lazy , Bloggers .
Do your own reporting , not just reprinting .
3 ) Rumors love a vacuum .
Developers , return calls and e-mails promptly .
Irresponsible pet owners have abandoned their dogs because they did not match their furniture , an animal charity said today .
Others complained their dog had to go because its different - coloured eyes made it look too much like the singer David Bowie , according to the Dogs Trust .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
One set of owners trying to get rid of their current pet because it was " too old " even asked staff at one of the trust 's rehoming centres for a younger model .
The excuses were revealed as the trust , the UK 's largest dog welfare charity , listed the 10 most irresponsible reasons people have given for abandoning their dogs .
Thirty years on since the charity made famous the trademarked slogan " A dog is for life not just for Christmas " , people are dumping their pets for the flimsiest of reasons - even over the festive period .
One dog was given up for eating the Christmas turkey , while another lost its home because it opened its owners ' presents on Christmas Eve .
Another was abandoned because its owner accidentally knelt in its urine while cleaning up after the animal .
The trust said that although the number of dogs given as gifts has fallen over the past three decades , they amount to 131,400 animals each year .
And with the opening of " stop - and - shop " puppy superstores , people are still taking on the responsibility of dog ownership without enough consideration of what it entails .
In an effort to stop people thoughtlessly buying dogs as Christmas presents , the trust 's 17 centres will stop rehoming dogs over the festive period .
People will be able to visit and reserve a dog , but they will not be able to take it home until the New Year .
Clarissa Baldwin , chief executive of Dogs Trust , said : " The ' A dog is for life , not just for Christmas ' slogan is just as relevant today as it was when I created it 30 years ago .
" Some of the reasons we hear for dogs being abandoned are truly outrageous and saddening .
" Having a dog is a long - term commitment and our anniversary offers the perfect opportunity to remind people that dogs are not fashion accessories or disposable items that can be upgraded or discarded after just a few months . "
The trust cares for more than 16,000 stray , unwanted and abandoned dogs each year and carries out rigorous checks to make sure the dogs are rehomed to responsible owners .
* The 10 most irresponsible reasons given to Dogs Trust staff as to why owners could no longer look after their dog are :
1 . " My dog does n't match the sofa . "
2 . " The dog looks evil and has different coloured eyes , just like David Bowie . "
3 . " My black dog does n't match the new white carpet , can we swap him for a white dog ? "
4 . " My current dog is too old , can we swap for a puppy or younger model ? "
5 . " My dog ate the Christmas turkey cooling on the work - top . "
6 . " My pet guinea pig got worried with a dog in the house . "
7 . " The dog opened all the presents on Christmas Eve . "
8 . An owner accidentally knelt in the dog's urine while cleaning it up so brought the dog in the very next day .
9 . A puppy was bought as a present for an elderly couple with dementia .
10 .
The owner was paranoid about recent bad press on Staffordshire Bull Terriers , and the dog was given up through no fault of its own .
I just got back from shooting for a week in Los Angeles and have to say that the highlight of my trip was shooting industrial stuff down in Long Beach Harbor with Photographer David Sommars .
David is an amazing photographer who regularly shoots industrial stuff around L.A. and he shared with me some of the most fantastic vantage points to shoot this sort of photography in Long Beach .
David also maintains a photography related blog here .
Unfortunately our photowalk around the Port of Long Beach was not without incident .
Three times we were blinted while photographing .
I ’ve been stopped plenty of times while legally shooting in the past .
Most of the times I ’ve been able to be respectful but insistent on my legal rights to shoot wherever I ’m shooting .
Every so often though an incident turns into a more serious altercation .
The first two times Sommars and I were stopped we were stopped by private security agents working for Securitas on behalf of BP ’s Carson Refinery .
They asked us not to shoot the refinery and suggested that it was a “ double standard ” that we ’d insist on our constitutional rights to shoot in public while not honoring BP ’s request that we not shoot their facility from a public sidewalk .
I could n’t quite get my arms around the “ double standard ” argument coming from BP .
Ironically one of the shots that I took of their refinery was probably the largest United States flag I ’ve ever shot .
Let ’s hear it for Patriotism .
The hassle from BP ’s agents though did n’t really bother me all that much .
We were insistent on our rights to shoot the facility and they seemed to understand that in the end there was nothing that they could do about it .
Their security guard snapped photos of both of us with his camera phone ( and I returned the favor of course ) and then they followed us when we left in my car in order to get my license plate , but they seemed to pretty clearly understand that while they were free to ask us not to shoot the plant , it was clearly within our rights to do so .
The more disturbing incident came later when we were atop a bridge , again on a public sidewalk , shooting another plant and long exposure bridge shots .
Here we were stopped by real cops this time , rather than security guards .
The cops in question were from the Long Beach Harbor Patrol .
Their officer explained to us that it was his job to monitor the side of the bridge that we were on while L.A.P.D. had jurisdiction over the other side of the bridge .
Basically the conversation went something like this .
Long Beach Harbor Patrol Officer : “ I ’m going to have to ask you guys to leave . ”
Us : “ But , why , were simply taking art photographs . ”
Long Beach Harbor Patrol Officer : “ You ’re not allowed to photograph these plants . ”
Us : “ But we ’re on a public sidewalk .
What law does n’t allow us to photograph here ? ”
Long Beach Harbor Patrol Officer : “ You ’ll need to come back tomorrow and get a permit if you want to shoot in the Harbor . ”
Me : “ I ’m only down in Long Beach for tonight and wo n’t be able to do that . ”
2nd Long Beach Harbor Patrol Officer ( shrugging her shoulders ) :
Oh , well , you ’re just going to have to leave .
Photography is not allowed here without a permit . ”
During this altercation both David and I were asked to present identification to the police .
They used our IDs to run background checks on both of us .
Now personally I have no problem with the cops stopping to talk to us and check out what we were doing .
I also had no problem with Securitas photographing me earlier or following me to get my license plate number .
But I think that it went too far when the Long Beach Harbor Patrol ran background checks on us and I think it also went too far when they required us to leave our shoot location .
As far as I ’m aware there is no law which requires permits in order to shoot the Long Beach Harbor from a public sidewalk .
And to kick us off of the bridge that we were legally on was not justified and violated our constitutional rights .
We repeatedly tried to argue for our right to shoot at this location for about a half an hour .
The entire time the cops were insistent that we were not allowed to shoot there without a permit .
David showed the cops in question photos of his on his iPhone in order to share the type of photography that we were after , but none of this seemed to matter .
We were on their turf and they were n’t going to stand for that .
He just kept repeatedly bringing up 911 over and over telling us that we were going to need to leave .
What bothers me even more is that this is not the first time that David ( who shoots in Long Beach Harbor more regularly than I do ) has been harassed by the cops there .
David has had lots of previous run ins there .
David told me that he ’s been stopped about 10 times in the last six months while shooting in Long Beach Harbor .
About half of those stops involved actual police in addition to security guards .
On one occasion the cops actually handcuffed him and in another incident 4 police cars and a black SUV converged on him .
He ’s also had FBI agents call on him over his photography .
Personally I think it ’s wrong to handcuff peaceful photographers for the “ crime ” of photography while questioning and detaining .
I ’ve contacted the media relations department at Long Beach Harbor regarding this incident but have yet to hear back from them .
I ’ll post more from them once / if I do hear back .
What I am tired of though is the harassment that photographers face on a regular basis while out documenting our world .
Photography is not a crime .
911 did n’t suddenly magically turn photographers into criminals .
And as long as photography is not a crime , I think that cops , security guards and other authority figures should be required to live within the legal system as it now stands .
Maybe some day they will pass a law that shooting Long Beach Harbor is in fact a crime .
Or maybe they ’ll actually pass a law that permits * are * actually required to shoot there .
But until that day happens ( and I ’d be one vocally opposing any such rule like that ) this sort of harassment ought not take place .
And it ’s unfortunate when it does .
Update : Art Wong from the Port of Long Beach ’s Media Relations Department has contacted me and told me that he ’s asking their officers for information on this incident .
I will post any update from the Port of Long Beach as it becomes available .

Remember the Stardust mission that returned samples of comet dust back to Earth in 2006 ?
The spacecraft dropped off a capsule containing samples of a comet ’s coma and interstellar dust particles , but the spacecraft “ bus ” is still out there in an elongated orbit of the sun .
It will come home again , swinging by Earth on January 14 , at 19:40 UTC ( 12:40 pm PST ) , getting a gravity assist from the home planet as it flies approximately 5713 miles ( 9200 kilometers ) from the Earth ’s surface .
But the spacecraft is n’t just wandering the solar system with nothing to do .
It has a new job and a new mission .
Called Stardust NExT , ( New Exploration of Tempel 1 ) the spacecraft will re-survey comet Tempel 1 – the comet that the Deep Impact mission left a mark on — encountering the comet on Feb. 14 , 2011 .
And remember aerogel – the wispy material that collected the comet dust ?
Turns out this stuff can come home , too : into homes and other buildings as a super - insulating material .
Engineers say using aerogel as an insulator can increase the thermal insulation factor of a wall by over 40 % !
If you ’ve ever had the chance to handle aerogel , you know it ’s really weird stuff .
It ’s fragile , but it ’s also strong .
You can crush it easily in your hand , but it has just the right qualities to be able to capture dust particles zooming in space at extremely high speeds without breaking , and was “ gentle ” enough to preserve the particles .
Engineers say the aerogel insulation technology developed by NASA , is the highest insulating material in existence , and the company Thermablok ( TM ) developed an amazing product that may soon become a requirement in the building industry .
Aerogel , also referred to as “ frozen smoke , ” has been difficult to adapt to most uses because it ’s so fragile
The patented Thermablok material however overcomes this by using a unique fiber to suspend a proprietary formula of Aerogel such that it can be bent or compressed while still retaining its amazing insulation properties .
Aerogel material is 95 % air , and just a 1/4 ″ x 1 - 1/2 ″ ( 6.25 mm x 38 mm ) strip of Thermablok ( TM ) added to each stud in a wall before putting on drywall , breaks the “ thermal bridging , ” increasing the thermal insulation factor of a wall by 42 % .
The U.S. Department of Energy has verified the findings on the producst ’s thermal capability .
Plus its recyclable , fire resistant and not affected by water ( so no mold ) .
Speaking of recyclable , NASA ’s plans for the Stardust spacecraft to revisit Tempel 1 will finish the investigation begun in 2005 when the Deep Impact mission blasted a crater into the comet .
“ The crater ’s there , ” said Joseph Veverka , Professor of Astronomy at Cornell University and Principal Investigator of Stardust - NExT , “ but we ’ve never seen it . ”
That ’s because the cloud of material ejected from the crater obscured the Deep Impact spacecraft ’s view .
By the time the particles slowly settled back down to the comet ’s surface , the spacecraft , traveling at about 10 km ( about 6 miles ) per second , was gone .
Looking into the crater with Stardust - NExT will provide mankind ’s first view of a comet ’s internal structure , information that is not only scientifically interesting , but vital to our future ability to keep a comet from hitting the Earth .
Even the size of the crater will be revealing .
“ That will tell us the mechanical properties of the subsurface of the comet , ” Veverka said .
“ In other words , how does the comet respond to impacts ?
And that ’s one of the fundamental things that you ’d need to know if you were trying to blow up a comet or push it out of the way . ”
Stardust was originally launched in 1999 , and in January 2004 , the spacecraft performed a risky and historic flyby of Comet Wild 2 to capture the samples and take pictures of the comet ’s nucleus .

The new party 's founder has ruled out becoming a subsidiary of Libertas , writes Jamie Smythin Prague
A NEW political party dedicated to campaigning against the Lisbon Treaty in the Czech Republic will be launched today by close associates of Czech president Vaclav Klaus .
But in a blow to the pan-European ambitions of Declan Ganley , its founder Petr Mach has ruled out adopting the Libertas brand to compete in the European elections .
" I tried to explain to him that setting up parties is a different thing than setting up businesses .
If he has a business he can set up subsidiaries and he would then be the main shareholder of it .
It is different with political parties , " said Mr Mach , who held talks with Mr Ganley on whether to join forces and form a Czech Libertas .
The talks broke down because Mr Mach wants to focus his party - which is called the Free Citizens ' Party ( Strana Svobodnych Obcanu ) - on national rather than EU politics and not simply become a subsidiary of Libertas .
It will campaign in the European elections , but its main goal is to become a force in Czech politics that can rival the ruling Civic Democrat party ( ODS ) , which has recently distanced itself from Klaus over his Eurosceptic views ahead of the Czech Republic 's elevation to the position of president of the EU 's council of ministers .
Mr Ganley will now try to set up his own Libertas branch in the Czech Republic without Mr Mach .
" Petr Mach is a Eurosceptic and I am not , " Mr Ganley said yesterday while expressing confidence in his ability to run candidates in the Czech Republic in June .
" Where we run candidates on the ballot paper ; they will be Libertas candidates and they wo n't be Eurosceptic , " said Mr Ganley , who was in Poland at the weekend interviewing potential candidates .
He said Libertas officials would visit the Czech Republic this week .
But Mr Mach said Mr Ganley 's proposal to set up Libertas branches in every EU state was unlikely to work because there was no single European " demos " or public opinion .
" I think his [ Ganley 's ] concept wo n't work .
You simply cannot know the situation in all member states , " Mr Mach said .
" In all countries the public will always consider him a stranger because he speaks a different language .
It is impossible to campaign in a foreign language .
I think you cannot apply a business concept to politics . "
Mr Mach , who is an economist and close associate of Mr Klaus , said he thought Mr Ganley would struggle to attract candidates to set up Libertas in the Czech Republic , as well as votes , because the anti-Lisbon political space was now filled .
But he said his party would be willing to co-operate with any Libertas MEPs elected to the European Parliament in other EU states to oppose the Lisbon Treaty following the European elections in June .
" In principle I think we both share the same goal . . . so it would be practical if he would accept our party as part of a loose alliance , but I have not received a reply , " he said .
He opposes the treaty because he says it substantially boosts the relative voting power of big member states in the EU compared to smaller states .
It also removes member states ' veto over more sensitive policy areas and is far too complex , said Mr Mach , who hopes the Irish people will reject the Lisbon Treaty in the likely second referendum this year .
" It seems the very same treaty will be put to a second referendum and all the concessions [ negotiated by the Government ] will be just virtual . . . it 's just a cheat , " he said .
The Free Citizens ' Party is being set up because Mr Mach believes the ruling ODS party in the Czech Republic have " betrayed their basic principles " by supporting a treaty that they campaigned against in the last election .
" Many members of the ODS feel this is a matter of principle and cannot put up with the change of attitude , " said Mr Mach , who plans to name sitting ODS MP Alena Paralova and prominent writer and political commentator Benjamin Kuras as two of high - profile supporters of his new party .
Mr Mach said his party would not have any formal link with Vaclav Klaus but it would mirror his ideas on the Lisbon Treaty and economics .
" We are in favour of free markets and a low and simple tax system , " says Mr Mach , who admits the Free Citizen 's Party will remain close to the ruling ODS on many basic principles except the treaty .
Czech prime minister Mirek Topolánek has recently called on the ODS to support Lisbon and a majority of its deputies are expected to support the treaty in a parliamentary vote for ratification next month .
A recent opinion poll commissioned by Czech public television found that a new party connected to Libertas , and which campaigned against Lisbon , could attract up to 22 per cent of the vote in the upcoming elections .
" There are a lot of people really frustrated that the party they voted for did n't listen to them regarding the EU or Lisbon , " says Mr Mach , whose first priority is to claim 5 per cent of the vote - the threshold for winning a seat .
Senior ODS politician and Czech minister for the interior Ivan Langer told The Irish Timesthat he relished the competition from the new party , which he predicted would claim 1 per cent of the vote rather than the 20 per cent - plus suggested in the recent opinion poll .
Yet squabbling in the three - party coalition led by the ODS , which could result in a cabinet reshuffle as early as today , is leading to public alienation from politics , say analysts .

A protest over the fatal shooting by a BART police officer of an unarmed man mushroomed into several hours of violence Wednesday night as demonstrators smashed storefronts and cars , set several cars ablaze and blocked streets in downtown Oakland .
The roving mob expressed fury at police and frustration over society 's racial injustice .
Yet the demonstrators were often indiscriminate , frequently targeting the businesses and prized possessions of people of color .
They smashed a hair salon , a pharmacy and several restaurants .
Police in riot gear tried to control the crowd , but some people retreated along 14th Street and bashed cars along the way .
The mob smashed the windows at Creative African Braids on 14th Street , and a woman walked out of the shop holding a baby in her arms .
" This is our business , " shouted Leemu Topka , the black owner of the salon she started four years ago .
" This is our shop .
This is what you call a protest ? "
Wednesday night 's vandalism victims had nothing to do with the shooting death by a BART police officer of Oscar Grant on New Year 's Day - but that did little to sway the mob .
" I feel like the night is going great , " said Nia Sykes , 24 , of San Francisco , one of the demonstrators .
" I feel like Oakland should make some noise .
This is how we need to fight back .
It 's for the murder of a black male . "
Sykes , who is black , had little sympathy for the owner of Creative African Braids .
" She should be glad she just lost her business and not her life , " Sykes said .
She added that she did have one worry for the night : " I just hope nobody gets shot or killed . "
The protest had started calmly shortly after 3 p.m. at the Fruitvale Station in Oakland , where BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle shot 22 - year - old Grant of Hayward a week ago .
BART shut down the station well into the evening commute , although the demonstration there was peaceful .
However , shortly after nightfall , a group of roughly 200 protesters split off and headed toward downtown Oakland , prompting the transit agency to close the Lake Merritt and 12th Street stations .
The group wreaked havoc through much of downtown , drawing hundreds of police in riot gear .
It was n't until roughly 10:40 p.m that police clamped down on the mob , arresting dozens who were cornered near the Paramount Theatre , and bringing an end to the mayhem .
Earlier in the evening , Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums met the mob on 14th Street , urging calm and leading them on a walk to City Hall , where he gave a speech .
" I sense your frustration , " he told the crowd .
" I understand that you 've lost confidence in a process because you 've seen what you believe is a homicide ...
But listen to me , we are a community of people .
We are civilized people .
We are a nation of laws .
" I'm asking people to disperse , " the mayor said to the couple hundred people in the crowd .
" Let 's leave in a spirit of peace . "
But soon after , a man shouted " that 's the modern day lynching " and the mob quickly continued its rampage , smashing at least seven storefronts on 17th street between Franklin and Webster streets .
They also smashed eight cars , including four belonging to the City of Oakland .
Near 14th and Alice streets , Myron Bell was taking dance lessons in " step , " a form of dance popular among African Americans , when he looked out the window and saw people jumping on his Lexus sedan .
Bell , 42 , came out to find that almost all of the car 's windows , including the front and back had been smashed and it appeared that someone had tried to set the car on fire .
" I'm for the cause , " said Bell , who is black .
" But I 'm against the violence and destruction . "
Nearby , Godhuli Bose stood near her smashed Toyota Corolla as a man walked by , repeatedly called her a misogynist slur and then added , " F- your car . "
Bose , a high school teacher , said : " I ca n't afford this . "
Earlier in the evening , when the mob first appeared downtown , Oakland Police Officer Michael Cardoza parked his car across the intersection of Eighth and Madison streets , to prevent traffic from flowing toward Broadway and into the protest .
But he told The Chronicle that a group of 30 to 40 protesters quickly surrounded his car and started smashing it with bottles and rocks .
Cardoza jumped out of the car and said some protesters tried to set the car on fire , while others jumped on top of the hood - incidents repeatedly shown on television .
Cardoza said the protesters " were trying to entice us into doing something . "
A Chronicle reporter saw a fist - sized rock in the back seat .
A group of protesters also set a trash bin aflame , moving it adjacent to the police car .
Police threw tear gas into the group to disperse it , said BART Sgt. Mark MacAulay .
After 8 p.m. , there were numerous arrests .
" When you get that mob mentality , it can be dangerous , " MacAulay said .
Other protesters marched on BART 's 12th Street Station about 7 p.m. , prompting the transit agency to close the downtown hub station even as it was reopening the Lake Merritt and Fruitvale stations .
The mob blocked the intersection of 14th and Broadway , near the downtown BART station entrance .
As police put on helmets and gas masks and stood in a line formation , some demonstrators held signs that read , " Your idea of justice ? " and " Jail Killer Cops . "
One man lay in the intersection with his face down and his hands behind his back - intentionally evoking the position that Grant was in when he was shot .
Some in the mob wore masks over their faces as they yelled at police .
Roughly a dozen stood just a few feet away from police as they screamed at them .
Chants included " pigs go home , " " the fascist police , no justice , no peace " and " we are all Oscar Grant . "
Mandingo Hayes , who is black , said he participated in the protest because " we 're tired of all these police agencies getting away with shooting unarmed black and Latino males . "
Hayes , 36 , downplayed the attack on the police car .
" For a police car to get abused , and for a person to get shot and killed , which would you rather be ? " said Hayes , a construction worker from San Pablo .
As the night wore on , Hayes tried calming people down , asking for peace .
The core group of the mob appeared to be about 40 people , several of whom were with Revolution Books , a Berkeley bookstore .
A man distributed the " Revolution " newspaper - whose tagline is " voice of the Revolutionary Communist Party , U.S.A. " - as he shouted " This whole damn system is guilty ! "
Soo Jung
Sung did n't understand why she was to blame .
She wept as she looked at the shattered front windshield of her Nissan Montero .
" Emotionally , I totally understand them , " she said of the upset over Grant 's shooting .
" But it 's not nice . "
A film director once told Salman Rushdie that all movies made from novels are rubbish .
With so many screenplays based on books triumphing at the Oscars this week and Slumdog Millionaire stealing the show , he asks is there such a thing as a good adaptation
There ’s a new craze hitting the conservative tubes on the Internets these days : “ Going Galt ! ”
While it ’s difficult to identify an exact date of reference or to provide any unique person with credit for the general meme , Michelle Malkin and Helen Smith certainly deserve honorable mention for recently popularizing the phrase .
This movement seems to have manifested itself in two distinct , but related , forms : those who say , more - or - less , that “ I ai n’t gonna produce more that 249,999 dollars and 99 cents of taxable income ” as well as those more accustomed to singing “ Amazing Grace ” than Twisted Sister taking to the streets across America chanting “ we ’re not gonna take it anymore . ”
Here are some relevant ( and hopefully balanced ) quotes I ’ve found on all sides of the aisle regarding this recent phenomenon .
Enjoy !
The Setting :
Stephen Moore laid it out fairly well at the Wall Street Journal : “ The current economic strategy is right out of ‘ Atlas Shrugged ’ :
The more incompetent you are in business , the more handouts the politicians will bestow on you .
That ’s the justification for the $ 2 trillion of subsidies doled out already to keep afloat distressed insurance companies , banks , Wall Street investment houses , and auto companies — while standing next in line for their share of the booty are real - estate developers , the steel industry , chemical companies , airlines , ethanol producers , construction firms and even catfish farmers .
With each successive bailout to “ calm the markets , ” another trillion of national wealth is subsequently lost .
Yet , as ‘ Atlas ’ grimly foretold , we now treat the incompetent who wreck their companies as victims , while those resourceful business owners who manage to make a profit are portrayed as recipients of illegitimate ‘ windfalls . ’
Every Knee Shall
Bow provides a reasonable explanation of the phenomenon : “ I ’ve mentioned more than once that Atlas is shrugging .
What this essentially means is that the producers in society are scaling back on their production purposely .
People are scaling back their income in order to avoid paying higher taxes .
They are at the same time avoiding spending to offset the difference .
This is how producers nearly always respond to looters that come in and make productivity less worthwhile , either due to increased regulation or lower economic incentive .
It ’s a very predictable phenomena .
Usually it ’s not an organized response , just a natural response to circumstances . ”
Who Is John Galt answers his own question : “ Like many of Ayn Rand ’s heroes , John Galt is a creative genius .
He is a man of uncommon reason , but he is also completely free of guilt .
John
Galt is a free man who serves others only as it suits his own needs — he holds no misgivings about his ‘ debt to society . ’
Brilliant and uncompromising , he knows that it is society which in fact depends on him , and he proves it by stopping the creative flow that powers man ’s very world . ”
Jason Pye : “ Atlas Shrugged is prophecy , no doubt about it .
With the rise of economic populism and collectivism , the Individual will be castigated and harassed .
As our incoming president tells us , ‘ Only government can break the vicious cycles that are crippling our economy . ’
Private investment and pro-growth policies will be discouraged and any who who promotes capitalism will be demonized . ”
Reason : “ Forget a run on the banks , we might in danger of a run on Rand . ”
Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights : “ Sales of Ayn Rand ’s ‘ Atlas Shrugged ’ have almost tripled over the first seven weeks of this year compared with sales for the same period in 2008 .
This continues a strong trend after bookstore sales reached an all - time annual high in 2008 of about 200,000 copies sold . ”
The Players :
Rep. John Campbell ( R - Calif . ) : “ People are starting to feel like we ’re living through the scenario that happened in ‘ Atlas Shrugged , ’ ” said Campbell .
“ The achievers , the people who create all the things that benefit the rest of us , are going on strike .
I ’m seeing , at a small level , a kind of protest from the people who create jobs , the people who create wealth , who are pulling back from their ambitions because they see how they ’ll be punished for them . ”
Michelle Malkin at Real Clear Politics : “ Enough .
In a word , that is the message of disgusted taxpayers fed up with the confiscatory policies of both parties in Washington .
George Bush pre-socialized the economy with billion - dollar bailouts of the financial and auto industries .
Barack Obama is pouring billions more down those sinkholes .
It is n’t just the camel ’s back that ’s broken .
His neck and four legs have all snapped , too . ”
Malkin on her own turf : “ Tax hikes have consequences .
Incentives matter .
Only self - deluded wealth redistributors living in la- la - land believe otherwise . ”
Reverse Vampyr : “ I ’ve never been one for protests .
But I ca n’t just stand by and allow my country to be ‘ rebuilt ’ into a replica of Cuba or the Soviet Union . ”
One half of Robert Stacy McCain ’s brain : “ Wolverines ! ”
Additional McCain on “ Wolverines ! ” : “ Friends do n’t let friends peddle defeatist bullshit .
You cannot organize opposition unless you first believe that opposition can be effective and meaningful .
Telling conservatives that there is no point deploying an ambush on the road to serfdom ?
That ’s defeatist bullshit .
If Ho Chi Minh had thought that way , the French would still rule Indochina .
Conservatives are now a guerrilla resistance .
Harassing the enemy — staging raids and ambushes that prevent him from enjoying his conquest at leisure — is basic to guerrilla resistance .
If we are doomed to destruction , as least let it be said that we died fighting .
But those who never fight , never win . ”
Cassy@Wizbang : “ Last week , thousands of first - time protestors gathered in a grassroots effort to make a statement .
And it ’s time to go Galt .
Are we working to make money for ourselves and our families , or are we working to fund the socialist dreams of an out - of - control , radical government ? ”
Some Have Hats : “ But it ’s making me nuts to watch the demonization of the people who have spent their lives working hard and following the rules , and since I only have first - hand knowledge of my own life , I am forced to use my own examples if I want to talk about it .
But I can tell you that from what I know of the stories of other people in my former tax bracket , I am not different or special .
Charities have existed since the country became a country , and they have always been funded by ( apparently this needs to be said loudly ) THE EVIL RICH PEOPLE . ”
Glenn “ Instapundit ” Reynolds : “ Can you say ‘ going John Galt ? ’
Upper -Income Taxpayers Look for Ways to Sidestep Obama Tax - Hike Plan .
‘ A 63 - year - old attorney based in Lafayette , La. , who asked not to be named , told ABCNews.com that she plans to cut back on her business to get her annual income under the quarter million mark should the Obama tax plan be passed by Congress and become law .
So far , Obama ’s tax plan is being looked at skeptically by both Democrats and Republicans and therefore may not pass at all . ' ”
Reboot Congress : “ … my theological reasons for going John Galt are a little different .
First , I feel that socialism violates the ten commandments .
And , second , I believe socialism damages charity . ”
Helen AKA “ Dr. Helen ” Smith : “ Are you ‘ going John Galt ’ and reducing your productivity by choice , or removing yourself from the economy all together , because of the Obama Administration ’s economic and tax plans ?
If so , PJTV may want to interview you .
Watch this video for details .
If you are interested in being interviewed , send an Email to johngalt@pjtv.com . ”
Donald Luskin via Dave Weigel : “ Luskin , who named his daughter Roark after the hero of Rand ’s novel ‘ The Fountainhead , ’ sees basic economic concepts explained through the novelist ’s work .
‘ One of the reasons that the Laffer Curve works is because of the John Galt effect of creative people finding ways to cut back on their output if they know they ’re going to be taxed , and demonized , for their success , ’ he said .
‘ We have these sort of villains , like John Thain at Merrill Lynch , who tried to pay himself a large bonus .
But then in response to that we have [ Sen . ]
Chris Dodd slipping into the stimulus a new rule that in punishing Thain punishes everybody , even the good guys . ' ”
Pursuing Holiness via Glenn Reynolds : “ By going John Galt – reducing my income to the point that I no longer subsidize anyone else via government imposed wealth transfers – I hope to hasten the inevitable collapse . ”
From ABC
News : “ A 63 - year - old attorney based in Lafayette , La. , who asked not to be named , told ABCNews.com that she plans to cut back on her business to get her annual income under the quarter million mark should the Obama tax plan be passed by Congress and become law .
‘ We are going to try to figure out how to make our income $ 249,999.00 , ’ she said . ”
The Skeptics :
Will Wilkinson may be too selfish to be selfish : “ I ca n’t help but feel that threatening to withdraw from economic production , ala Atlas Shrugged ’s John Galt , is a certain kind of libertarian - conservative ’s version of progressives threatening to move to Canada .
For my part , I ca n’t imagine what would make me want to stop working , and each new president makes me want to move to Canada . ”
Doug Mataconis provides some healthy libertarian cynicism : “ By the way , Atlas buffs , the point of Atlas Shrugged is not that you are John Galt .
The point is that you are not John Galt .
The point is that you are , at your best , Eddie Willers .
You ’re smart , hardworking , productive , and true .
But you ’re no creative genius and you take innovation — John Galt — for granted .
You do n’t even know who he is !
And this eventually leaves you weeping on abandoned train tracks . ”
The other half of Robert Stacy McCain ’s brain : “ Rand ’s philosophical radicalism ultimately goes beyond a point I am willing to follow , but in her basic idea — the irreplaceable creative value of the entrepreneur , and the unworthiness of capitalism ’s enemies — she hammers it home . ”
My personal libertarian cynicism : “ I fear that if the Republicans were to suddenly regain political power , all of the cries of ‘ socialism ’ would be buried under the rug as Republican defenders of big government race to outdo the Democrats with additional deficit spending . ”
Megan AKA “ Jane Galt ” McArdle scribes : “ I do n’t think that we will see a mass exodus of productive people to secret hideouts .
I look to Atlas Shrugged more for conveniently totable beach reading than an economic blueprint .
What ’s interesting to me , though , is how many details Rand did get right–like the markets in ‘ unfreezing ’
Ukrainian bank deposits , so similar to the frozen railroad bonds of Atlas Shrugged .
Or the cascading and unanticipated failures , with government officials racing to slap another fix on to fix the last failing solution .
If only the people in her novels had acted remotely like actual people , rather than comic book characters , I , too , would be rereading the thing now . ”
Not PC : “ Now pay attention : these people who are appropriated the symbol of John Galt are not , for the most part , Objectivists .
They simply understand the power of the John Galt character as symbol of their resistance .
As Robert Tracinscki explains excitedly , we ’re seeing cultural change before our eyes in the visceral reaction to the tipping point of Barack ’s Big Government , and the reaching for symbols in that struggle . ”
Additional personal skepticism : “ Why should voters believe Republicans are currently standing up for fiscal principles after taking an eight year vacation from them ? ”
QAndO : “ I ’d be more impressed if they fired a shot across the bow and coordinated a national day for cranking up their withholding allowances , just as high as they can .
They ’re planning their next party on Tax Day , right ?
One might think they ’d be interested in ceasing to lend their earnings interest - free to the government .
They might take some satisfaction in doing something that actually shows up on the government ’s ledger .
I ’d be convinced of their sincerity if they subsequently considered actually not paying their taxes next year if the government did n’t change its policies .
That would be civil disobedience , as opposed to loud - but - obedient .
But still , hold the tea .
The ‘ going Galt ’ thing has been a bit better — at least it involves refusing to produce — but ‘ John Galt ’ is a rather radical standard , ladies and gentlemen .
Reducing your income so that you do n’t pay the higher marginal taxes in the next bracket ; partially shutting down businesses and taking more leisure time ; retiring early .
These are nice , but it ’s like ‘ going Martin Luther King , Jr. ’ without risking jail or invoking the Alamo without risking death . ”
Michael Powell@UnitedLiberty : “ There are far better advocates in literary history for government transparency and efficiency , sound money and freedom than Ayn Rand .
Like other absolutist ideologies , Rand ’s Objectivism preaches contempt for non-believers and an arrogance that comes with a lack of humility and a surplus of righteousness . ”
Jerome Tucille via Dave Weigel : “ This view of ‘ Atlas Shrugged ’ has its detractors .
‘ Ayn Rand romanticized capitalists , ’ said Jerome Tuccille , author of the libertarian history ‘ It Usually Starts With Ayn Rand , ’ in a Thursday interview .
‘ She saw them as great heroes .
She does n’t deal with these corporatists like Thain who were pushing paper around and using regulations to feather their nests .
Some of these bastards like Thain should be in jail .
I mean , I want them carted out of their houses , doing the perp walk at 3 a .m. ' ”
The Observers :
Keith Burgess - Jackson : “ Who knew that Ayn Rand was a revolutionary ?
But seriously , one great thing about being a college professor is that I am paid ( largely ) in leisure rather than money , and leisure is n’t taxed .
I ca n’t imagine working hard to build a business , only to have a huge chunk of my earnings taken from me by the government and given to the lazy , the stupid , the improvident , and the irresponsible . ”
Joseph Lawler at The American Spectator : “ Then again , it does n’t take Nostradamus to predict that eventually government will go awry .
In fact the ultimate riff on government came out roughly 1,957 years ( give or take about 33 years ) before Atlas Shrugged , when someone , probably a clever proto -Objectivist , quipped , ‘ Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar ’s , ’ as if to warn us that eventually the government is going to do what it wants to do , and the rest of us are better off worrying about more important things .
No , if you are looking for the most complete forecast of today ’s economic and political turmoil in 20th century literature you will have to look beyond Rand ’s one - dimensional economic vignettes to a work of scope and sophistication : Douglas Adams ’s all - encompassing masterpiece , The Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy . ”
Doug Bandow@Cato@Liberty : “ The president wants to increase taxes only on those earning above $ 250,000 .
Since most of us are n’t there —
I keep waiting , but for some reason no one yet has offered me what I think I ’m worth to express my opinions on current policy and events — who cares , right ? ”
TheRightRant : “ How bad does it have to get before we throw up our hands and say , enough ?
We ’ll see in 2010 if enough is enough .
Oh , and if you do n’t know what I ’m talking about , go read Atlas Shrugged .
Or you can just look around , because you ’re living it . ”
Jeffrey Lord at The American Spectator : “ The recent spontaneous eruption of impromptu ‘ tea parties ’ — demonstrations modeled after the Boston Tea Party of 1773 to protest against the Obama plan to socialize America — is the first sign that Gandhi - style rebellion against the government is in the American air . ”
The Humorous :
Whiskey Fire : “ The nationalization of Atlas Shrugged may strike Americans as foreign , even Swedish or something .
However , the nation is already subsidizing the book ’s dissemination .
A banking company , BB&T Corp. of North Carolina , has given $ 30 million in grants in the last decade for various universities to teach the book .
Most recently , in March , 2008 , BB&T gave UT - Austin $ 2 million for a Chair in the Study of Objectivism .
Then in October , BB&T took ( wait for it ) $ 3.1 billion in bailout money .
It only seems fair for the nation to recoup some of its investment in future generations ’
Rand - inspired economic havoc by nationalizing Atlas Shrugged now . ”
Michelle Malkin : “ Some tinfoil - hatted kooks are still pimping their conspiracy theories about the movement .
The latest : Aha !
Malkin once gave a speech to Americans for Prosperity and AFP organized the Denver anti-pork protest two weeks ago before Santelli went on his Tea Party rant last week , ergo it ’s all a vast plot !!!!!! ”
Wonkette : “ Today at High Noon , the disciples of CNBC teevee ranter Rick Santelli held teabagging parties around the country .
Apparently they did not pick up on the nonchalance in Santelli ’s voice when he said , ‘ we ’re going to hold a… like a tea party or something because of this Obama , ha ha , weird . ’
Well , the biggest of these parties was in Washington , by the White House , and like 20 people took cabs from CPAC to stand around in poop hats and complain about fiat currency for a few minutes while Michelle Malkin filmed them in various pornographic poses .
Major thank yous to poop operatives ‘ Jamie ’ and ‘ Ethan ’ for sending most of the photos below , as well as to intrepid D.C. blog reporter Dave Weigel , some of whose photos we have stolen . ”
The Opposition :
Steve Benen plays the race card : “ Right , the character John Galt , the hero of the novel , is the wealthy , white , blond - haired guy who convinces corporate leaders to give up their jobs in order to spite society .
As the story goes , these captains of industry were repressed by heavy - handed government , so they walked away and , when society crumbled , taught everyone a valuable lesson about making sure wealthy , white , blond - haired guys do n’t feel unduly put upon . ”
Paul Campos at Lawyers , Guns and Money : “ I ’m sort of tempted to ask Professor Reynolds if this seems plausible to him .
Does it seem plausible to him — a law professor who is probably paid around 200 K a year by the great state of Tennessee to do whatever it is he does while performing what is technically his actual job — that he is ‘ working ’ five times “ harder ” ( using Wingnuttia ’s definition of ‘ hard work ’ ) than a guy roofing houses in San Antonio in July who makes 40 K a year ?
If you think about it for five seconds it ’s actually totally implausible that the correlation between ‘ hard work ’ in this sense and increasing income is even mildly positive .
To believe it is , you have to believe that highly paid high status professionals hate their work far more than working class people who are doing dangerous , physically taxing , and / or extremely boring work for low pay . ”
Nancy Nall :
This is why I chuckle at the current craze among our friends on the right , which they call ‘ going John Galt , ’ a shout - out to one of the worst - written novels in the English language .
The idea is to protest the current legislative proposals by voluntarily reducing their work output .
Withdrawing from the workforce .
Some call it ‘ depriving the world of my talents , ’ which is particularly amusing , as it ’s usually the most untalented who are calling it that .
I encourage them to do so , even in this dicey labor market , nay , especially in this dicey labor market .
A lot of talented people are on the park bench , and would be happy to take your place .
Your bluff is called .
Go John Galt . ”
The title is the story in this Brad Delong posting : “ Memo to Conservative Wingnuts : John Galt Is Not a Christian ”
Eschaton : “ Righteous Bubba informs us that there are ‘ SEVENTEEN videos dramatizing the Galt speech ’ from Atlas Shrugs on You Tube .
‘ It ’s a long speech , so who the fuck knows how many videos are yet to be realized . ’
Indeed .
The punchline : ‘ Views for part one ?
72140 as of this writing .
361 for part 17 . ’
Perhaps there is a lesson here . ”
TBogg : “ Approximately 2 % of the American households make more than $ 250,000 a year and ( you may find this hard to believe ) a very high percentage of these high - earning go - getting producers spend their days commenting over at Michelle Malkin ’s place … when they ’re not busy flying their Lear jets up to Nova Scotia to see the total eclipse of the sun . ”
Additional TBogg : “ Atlas will be dragging ass … ”
James Pearce : “ Why work for the government ?
Because they ’re hiring … ”

UPDATE : Via memorandum.com , here are some new lefty quotes :
Hunter@DailyKos : “ Go live your Randian fantasies , go create that wonderful utopia in which only the most wealthy are permitted entry , and you are not burdened with the outrageous insult of having to contribute back a proportionate share of your income in order to help maintain the very fabric of the nation around you .
I can see now that the thought that you might have to pay the same share of your income in taxes that your housekeeper does has drained your already blanched faces , and the thought of having to pay as much in taxes as your wretched mothers and fathers did , a few decades before you , is nothing less than an armed assault on your beachheads . ”
Matthew Yglesias ( who is cool to drink with and has an open mind ) : “ Just think what kind of nightmare scenario we might be inflicted with if the titans of finance who ’ve made up such a large proportion of high earners in recent years were to pull back on their efforts !
I shudder .
Meanwhile , I have n’t actually read the book but my understanding is that in Atlas Shrugged they ’re actually building a high - speed rail link from Las Vegas to Disneyland . ”
UPDATE II : For those of you coming in from the right , I ’ve got five very earnest questions for you .
Also , you might wish to check out the Instacomment from Instapundit .
UPDATE III ( by Brad Warbiany ) :
This post suggests quite a bit about what we all think of “ Going Galt ” .
But I ’ve got a potential solution .
Taking the suggestion from Bryan @ QandO , I say it ’s time to cut your withholding as much as you can .
Do it by April 15th .
Show the bastards that you ’re not going to let them have that money until the last possible moment .
Anybody who doubts that the global economy is facing its most serious downturn since the 1930s should take a squint at the latest trade figures from Japan .
Exports in January were 46 % lower in January than they were a year ago – a phenomenal drop for a country that is so heavily dependent on sales of its industrial products overseas .
Japan has got used to economic setbacks over the past two decades : it has been in and out of recession on a regular basis .
But make no mistake , this drop in exports does not mean recession : it means depression .
In the circumstances , comments by analysts that the data was " not good " and " seriously bad " were somewhat otiose .
The Office for National Statistics confirmed today that the UK economy shrank by 1.5 % in the final three months of 2008 and is on course for an annual decline in GDP this year of between 2.5 % and 3 % .
But in Japan , things are much , much worse .
Maya Bhandar at Lombard Street Research , says that the economy is contracting at an annualised rate of 14 - 15 % in the current quarter .
Strong exports have tended to disguise the weakness of Japanese domestic consumption in recent years : now that prop has been kicked away , growth is plummeting .
Why is this happening ?
Quite simply , the great engine of globalisation has gone into reverse .
During the long boom , the US acted as the consumer of last resort : it sucked in exports from China and Japan .
As China industrialised , it needed high - grade investment goods from Germany , and as prosperity spread in the world 's most populous country , there was strong demand for Japanese electronics , cars and consumer gizmos .
Now that America has stopped spending , Chinese factories have closed .
The knock - on effects of that are being felt in Tokyo and Hamburg .
In Japan , all the main industries are reporting decreases in exports of more than 40 % .
The big car companies – Toyota , Nissan and Honda – are really feeling the pinch : overseas sales by the transport equipment sector were down almost 54 % on a year ago .
What 's more , car sales are slumping everywhere : J­apanese exports to North America , Europe and the rest of Asia were all down by more than 50 % .
The assumption , since the financial crisis began in the summer of 2007 , has been that lessons have been learnt from the Japanese experience in the 1990s .
Much comfort was taken from the fact that Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the US Federal Reserve , had produced an erudite paper on how to avoid the deflationary problems ­suffered by the world 's second biggest economy .
As things stand , that optimism is starting to look a tad misplaced .
It is not just that the generalised falls in industrial production over the past few months has been far worse than ­anything experienced by Japan in the 1990s ; it is also that policymakers – including Bernanke – do not seem to have fully assimilated the lessons of the Japanese experience .
Japan 's problem in the 1990s was not that the government failed to act : there were any number of emergency packages and bail - outs for the stricken banks .
But nothing Tokyo did got to the heart of the crisis , which was that land prices continued to fall year after year , creating fresh losses for the financial system as quickly as the last batch of toxic waste was cleared up .
Something similar is happening now to Wall Street banks .
With real - estate prices in freefall , the losses just continue to mount and the pressure on the banks remains acute .
You kids were probably asleep while the Rockets and Suns players went at it last night .
Steve Nash , Shaquille O’Neal and Tracy McGrady all received technical fouls in the game between Houston and Phoenix .
Suns’ Matt Barnes and Houston ’s Rafer Alston were ejected after the two got into each other ’s face in a brouhaha that involved about 7 players .
It all started when Houston ’s Tracy McGrady ran down the court , a three - pointer in tow .
Just before the shot , Barnes threw Rockets PG Rafer Alston down to the ground .
After the play , with 27.6 seconds left in the quarter , Alston came back and got in Barnes ’ face in an attempt to retaliate for the shove .
McGrady came in to defend his teammates and shoved Suns guard Steve Nash to the ground .
Big Cactus Shaquille O’Neal immediately rushed in and pushed McGrady .
When Barnes was later asked about Alston ’s reaction after the game , he said “ I do n’t really know what he was thinking , he thinks he ’s tough so … I do n’t know really .
He ran up on me , and , it was really just a bunch of pushes .
No one threw any punches , no one did anything serious .
But the refs had to get control of the game so they figured throwing us out would do that . ”
Luckily for Ron Artest who gets tech ’d up just for walking down the court these days , he was on the bench throughout the melee .
Houston escaped with a 94 - 82 win over the Suns .

With all the problems occurring in the banking system , it is rather astonishing that so few have failed in 2008 .
At least that is the perception being put out there for us to digest .
Yet the failure of one IndyMac or Washington Mutual is the equivalent of 100 smaller bank failures all at once .
It is true that the composition of bank assets is primarily locked up in mortgages .
Yet the true bank failures will be hitting in 2009 with the bust of the commercial real estate market .
In this article , we are going to examine the makeup and anatomy of our banking system with data and charts from the FDIC .
Exhibit # 1 – Composition of Bank Assets
The above chart should first tell you why the banking system has collapsed with the housing market .
Banks rely heavily on mortgages for their asset base .
With the housing market collapsing , it is n’t hard to understand why problems rippled through the core of many bank balance sheets .
In addition , another large part of the composition of bank assets are secured via credit cards .
Bankruptcies are skyrocketing and many people are now relying on credit cards as a last measure .
A country with $ 49 trillion in debt is one that is n’t afraid to take out a loan .
Exhibit # 2 – Number of savings institutions and commercial banks
At last count , there are 8,384 savings institutions and commercial banks backed by the FDIC .
The FDIC recently upped its insurance for individual depositors to $ 250,000 through December 31 , 2009 from the previous $ 100,000 limit .
On face value , this may sound great but as of August 31 , 2008 the FDIC insurance fund is quickly depleting :
Exhibit # 3 – FDIC Insurance Fund
The fund has depleted over $ 17.625 billion in less than one year and we have yet to take into account the forth quarter of 2008 which should be out shortly .
It is stunning that they can simply increase insurance upwards to $ 250,000 while the fund is quickly going to zero .
Of course the implicit guarantee was made from the U.S. government to back up these funds .
The FDIC has been careful about announcing troubled institutions .
In fact , they only have slightly over 100 of those 8,384 institutions on the list which surely will grow .
Let us look at the assets of those trouble institutions :
Exhibit # 4 – Assets of FDIC troubled institutions
From last accounting , $ 115 billion of assets were at risk .
These banks are very likely to have problems and without a doubt , we will exhaust that remaining $ 29 billion in 2009 .
Meaning , the government is going to have to dish out more money .
Money which we do n’t have which of course will miraculously appear from helicopters .
Why am I so certain more banks will fail this year ?
Just look at the composition of banking assets :
Exhibit # 5 – Loan Portfolios
Residential will continue to have problems .
Most of the bailouts have been focused here .
But what about the large portion of commercial loans ?
What about the construction loans ?
What about the consumer loans ?
Credit cards ?
Are we going to bailout all these areas .
Residential only makes up 26 % of the loan composition of banking assets which the FDIC covers .
That $ 29 billion is puny to what is at risk here .
The growth in commercial real estate loans is what is going to sink hundreds of banks in the next few years :
Exhibit # 6 – Construction loans pose biggest problems
As you can see , banks went wild with construction and land development loans .
They hit growth peaks at the height of the housing and credit bubble in 2004 through 2006 .
This is not good .
The rate of growth was actually higher than that with residential loans which we are now seeing blow up .
These construction loans have very little chance of making it through this crisis .
Meaning , many of these loans will default .
Many banks simply do not have the balance sheets to survive 2009 .
And failures are already rising :
Exhibit # 7 – Bank Failures Rising
What you ’ll notice is actual new charters has fallen and mergers and failures have gone up in 2008 .
Expect more of the same in 2009 .
The list of problem institutions grows by the day :
Exhibit # 8 – Problem institutions growing
Many of the banks started holding onto adjustable rate mortgages instead of fixed mortgages over the past few years .
Now , we are seeing a spike in fixed rate mortgages because this is the only thing the government will now back :
Exhibit # 9 – Growth Rate of ARMs
The derivatives market is such a fantasy game .
Take a look at this chart :
Exhibit # 10 – Commercial bank derivatives
This is flat out absurd .
The notional value of swaps is approximately the size of 2 times annual global GDP .
Do n’t expect banks to pay one another .
It is now a race between destroying the U.S. dollar and asset value destruction .
What can you expect in 2009 ?
I think the above charts tell you the entire story .
Expect commercial and construction real estate loans to bust with less of a safety net than residential loans and expect more bank failures and mergers .
There is n’t much that can be done here except to flush the excess out of the system .

A statement from the Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network
November 28 , 2008 --
In the aftermath of the November 23 regional elections , Venezuela ’s right - wing opposition has launched , in the states it won , an all - out assault on grassroots community organisations .
President Hugo Chavez and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) won a clear mandate in the elections for the project to build socialism of the 21st century : the PSUV won 17 states with 5,730,774 votes nationwide , compared to the opposition ’s 3,948,912 votes .
The opposition ’s vote was concentrated in key strategic areas , giving them the governorships of five states and the mayor of Greater Caracas .
In the days following the elections , grassroots activists in Caracas , Miranda and Tachira have reported that the public community health clinics ( part of Barrio Adentro , the free universal healthcare program ) , communal councils and other centres where social programs operate are being shut down or attacked by opposition party , despite the public assurances of at least one right - wing govenor - elect that the legal frameworks would be respected .
Venezuelan radio station YKVE Mundial reported on November 25 that “ people sent by the new authorities of the governorship of Miranda arrived in the early hours of the morning in Baruta , to an Integral Diagnostic Centre [ public health clinics ] , where they shut down a House of Popular Power ” where the local grassroots communal councils operate .
Cleira Ruiz , local coordinator of Mission Ribas in Mariche , reported that people from the far - right Justice First party harassed the centre , and tried to remove the people inside and take the keys .
Gerson Rivas , a representative of Fundacommunal ( communal bank ) in the municipality of Guaicaipuro in the state of Miranda , reported that Cuban doctors were being intimidated by Justice First supporters , who were threatening to kick them out of the Barrio Adentro modules .
William Castillo , vice - president of Venezolana de Televisión , reported that groups have also tried to attack the Caracas office of alternative television channel Avila TV .
More disturbingly , three activists in Venezuela 's national trade union peak body , the UNT , were brutally murdered two days after the elections .
From the state of Tachira , won by the right wing , Ana Rivero reported to YVKE Mundial that , although the new governor , Cesar Perez , had not yet assumed his position , “ functionaries ” had ordered coordinators of the missions to leave the state schools where the missions operate , and that this order is being applied across the whole state .
She said that classes in Mission Ribas in the school Timoteo Chacón de Santa Ana , in the municipality of Cordoba , where she studies , have been suspended until they can find another location .
María Malpica , the PSUV mayor - elect in Colon municipality in Zulia , reported that riots were being promoted by the opposition with the aim of preventing her from taking office , and that eight people were injured in the clashes .
YKVE Mundial reported that street battles broke out in Los Teques , the capital of Miranda , on November 26 .
Carmen Bermúdez , who witnessed the incident , told YKVE Mundial that the violence erupted when right - wing governor - elect Capriles Radonski arrived in Plaza Bolivar in Los Teques accompanied by men on motorbikes and police from the municipalities of Rosales and Carrizal .
The police and Capriles ’ private thugs violently attacked people congregated in the plaza for the inauguration of the new PSUV mayor of Los Teques , Alirio Mendoza .
As well , workers in the Integral Diagnostic Centre in Los Dos Caminos in Sucre municipality reported on November 27 that members of Justice First have threatened to burn down the building and are circulating a petition to remove the Cuban doctors .
Similar incidents have been reported in Carabobo .
In the state of Barinas , which was won by the PSUV , opposition groups have launched violent attacks , refusing to accept the outcome of the vote .
In 2002 the Venezuelan opposition , backed by the United States , launched a military coup against the democratically elected Chavez government .
However , the coup was defeated within 48 hours by a mass uprising of workers and the poor , together with rank - and - file soldiers .
In Venezuela ’s Bolivarian Revolution , major social gains for the poor and working people have been won by the grassroots movements together with the pro-people polices promoted by Chavez .
Extensive education programs have eradicated illiteracy and the introduction of universal healthcare has meant that many poor Venezuelans have been able to visit a doctor for the first time .
Under wealth redistribution policies factories have been nationalised and put under workers ’ control , and unused land has been distributed to peasants .
The US government has given millions of dollars to Venezuela ’s opposition groups in an effort to roll back the democratic revolution in Venezuela .
These latest attacks are part of a broader strategy to get rid of Chavez and reassert imperialist control of the nation .
Responding to the opposition attacks , Jesse Chacon , the PSUV candidate for Sucre , told VTV on November 25 that , “ Any attempt to roll back what the people have conquered is going to generate conflict , because the people are organised …
The people will not allow it ! "
In a televised speech on November 27 , Chavez also responded , stating that the national government and the armed forces , together with the people , would act to defend the missions and social services .
The minister for justice has also made public statements to clarify the obligations and role within the state of the governors - elect , including that they must not abuse the power invested in them .
El Aissami specifically reminded the newest governors - elect of the importance of not abusing police powers .
The Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network stands in solidarity with President Chavez and the grassroots Bolivarian movement against the right wing ’s latest attacks .
We call for the democratic process in Venezuela to be respected by the new oppostion governors , and for an end to all United States interference in Venezuela ’s sovereign affairs .
Stop the opposition attacks in Venezuela !
Stop US intervention in Venezuela !

Defeating another political titan , Rep. Henry A. Waxman , the liberal Los Angeles power broker , captured a House post Thursday that will put him at the center of efforts to advance President - elect Barack Obama ’s proposals to curb global warming , develop alternative fuels and expand health insurance coverage .
Waxman ’s victory , in a secret ballot of his House Democratic colleagues , gives him the chairmanship of the influential energy and commerce committee , which will help shape some of Obama ’s most ambitious domestic plans .
The 137 -122 vote stripped the chairmanship from Rep. John D. Dingell ( D - Mich . ) , the longest - serving member in the House , and marked an unusual departure from the seniority system that usually dictates how the chamber operates .
The changing of the guard has significant implications for Obama ’s environmental agenda .
Advertisement
Dingell , an automobile - industry champion who represents greater Detroit , has been criticized for slowing or blocking action on stricter vehicle emissions standards , fuel - economy improvements and other regulatory efforts .
Those stances have pitted him against Waxman , 69 , for decades , and environmentalists feared that Dingell would be a drag on Obama ’s efforts to curb air pollution .
Dingell , 82 , was elected to the House in 1955 -- six years before Obama was born .
He now becomes part of the wave of congressional “ Old Bulls ” who have retired or been toppled by the tides of change that carried Obama and other Democrats to victory in this month ’s election .
In the Senate , Ted Stevens of Alaska , the longest - serving Republican , lost his bid for reelection after being convicted of corruption charges .
Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia , the longest - serving Democrat , was eased out of his post as chairman of the appropriations committee .
Retirees include such veterans as Sens. John W. Warner ( R - Va. ) and Pete V. Domenici ( R - N.M. ) .
Dingell , who has been traveling the Capitol on crutches or in a wheelchair as he recovers from knee surgery , argued that he was an effective legislator and that the House would suffer from upsetting the seniority system .
His defeat is a sign that , for the incoming generation of politicians , such arguments may no longer hold sway .

“ Well , this was clearly a change year , ” Dingell said after his defeat .
Dingell ’s loss is a blow to the U.S. auto industry at a time when it says it needs additional federal help to avoid collapse .
Some business interests worry that Waxman will steer the committee sharply to the left .
“ Whether you agree with him or not , Chairman Dingell has long been respected as an insightful , reasonable and pragmatic legislator , ” said Thomas Pyle , president of the Institute for Energy Research , a pro-business research group .
“ These are not qualities for which Mr. Waxman is known . ”
Pyle said that Waxman would probably bring “ sweeping changes ” to the committee ’s focus , “ which is n’t good news if you ’re in the business of American energy or other kinds of free - market commerce . ”

By contrast , environmentalists hailed Waxman ’s promotion .
“ It ’s a whole new day for the environment , ” said Dan Becker , director of the Safe Climate Campaign , an environmental advocacy group .
“ The committee through which all major environmental legislation has to pass has gone from someone hostile to environmental protection to a real champion . ”
Bald and mustachioed , Waxman stands 5 feet 5 and is known for a soft - spoken manner .
He has proved to be an aggressive investigator in his current post as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
That panel churned out reports that cast an unforgiving eye on Bush administration programs , and it brought a wide variety of figures -- baseball players , hedge - fund managers and former spy Valerie Plame -- to testify at high - profile hearings .

Waxman , who represents Beverly Hills and West Hollywood , was first elected to the House in 1974 as part of a post - Watergate influx of liberal Democrats .
In the 1980s and 1990s , he took the lead on bills to expand Medicaid coverage for children , help AIDS patients , require warning labels on cigarettes and make generic drugs more widely available .
For years , he battled with Dingell over strengthening the Clean Air Act .
In making his pitch for the energy and commerce post , Waxman was blunt in outlining his policy differences with Dingell .
Dingell had slowed pollution controls , while Waxman wanted to accelerate them , Waxman told House Democrats , according to his prepared comments .
For years , Dingell blocked efforts to increase car mileage standards that Waxman favored .
Dingell opposed Waxman ’s early efforts to combat global warming , the California lawmaker said .

Waxman ’s election suggests that Congress will aggressively tackle climate - change legislation next year and that California will be at the forefront of that effort .
Another California Democrat , Barbara Boxer , is chairwoman of the Senate committee on the environment .
Waxman , Boxer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) have called for tough new limits on emissions from power plants , factories and other pollution sources .
One key dispute with Dingell has involved state efforts to take stronger action than the federal government against global warming .
Dingell infuriated Waxman and Pelosi when he pushed for a single federal rule for vehicle emissions that would have prevented California and other states from enacting tougher standards .
The energy and commerce committee will be a battleground for other Obama priorities , such as requiring utilities to generate more electricity from cleaner energy sources .

It will also consider proposals to make health insurance more available .
But despite their differences on environmental regulation , Dingell and Waxman are both longtime champions of universal access to healthcare .
The committee chairmanship will also give Waxman a louder voice in legislation affecting his hometown industry , entertainment .
As chairman , he will have oversight of the Federal Communications Commission , which in recent years has cracked down on indecent language on broadcast television .
The committee also oversees telecommunications issues related to cable TV and the Internet .
But Waxman ’s new role could be a double - edged sword for Hollywood , as he has a history of conducting hard - hitting hearings on issues and controversies under his jurisdiction .
Waxman will assume the chairmanship with close ties to the White House , as his former chief of staff , Phil Schiliro , has been named Obama ’s liaison to Congress .

Okay , so I have n't posted in a while ...
Shrug .
Here 's something anyway .
Fundamentalists often say things like " Homosexuality is n't found in nature , and is therefore wrong . "
Aside from the fact that homosexuality most certainly does occur in nature ( Let me Google that for you ) , and aside from the fact that some of us consider humans part of nature , and aside from the fact that whether or not something occurs in nature is n't actually a test of its morality by almost any standards , I 'd like to follow this fundamentalist train of thought a little bit .
If we use their definitions and assumptions .
we find that there are many other examples of human behaviour that do n't occur in nature , such as building churches , reading Bibles , and donating 10 % of our income .
By their own logic , these behaviours are unnatural and are therefore also wrong .
And let 's not even get into money , cooking , computers , cars , medicine , science , or politics .
Since these are all human inventions , they are all clearly wrong by this particular set of fundamentalist " logic " .
So in closing , if you happen to believe that homosexuality is wrong because it 's unnatural , I cordially invite you to live consistently with your views and stop cooking , buying , voting , and doing anything else that animals do n't do .
A group of Israeli students and would - be cyberwarriors have developed a program that makes it easy for just about anyone to start pounding on pro-Hamas websites .
But using this " Patriot " software , to join in the online fight , means handing over control of your computer to the Israeli hacker group .
" While you ’re running their program , they can do whatever they want with your computer , " Mike La Pilla , manager of malicious code operations at
Verisign iDefense , the electronic security firm .
The online collective " Help Israel Win " formed in late December , as the current conflict in Gaza erupted .
" We could n’t join the real combat , so we decided to fight Hamas in the cyber arena , " " Liri , " one the group ’s organizers , told Danger Room .
So they created a simple program , supposedly designed to overload Hamas - friendly sites like qudsnews .
net and palestine - info.info .
In recent years , such online struggles have become key components in the information warfare that accompanies traditional bomb - and - bullets conflicts .
Each side tries to recruit more and more people — and more and more computers — to help in the network assaults .
Help Israel
Win says that more than 8,000 people have already downloaded and installed its Patriot software .
It ’s a small part of a larger , increasingly sophisticated propaganda fight between supporters of Israel and Hamas that ’s being waged over the airwaves and online .
Help Israel Win , which has websites in Hebrew , English , Spanish , French , Russian and Portugese , does n’t say much about how the program functions — only that it " unites the computer capabilities of many people around the world .
Our goal is to use this power in order to disrupt our enemy ’s efforts to destroy the state of Israel .
The more support we get , the more efficient we are . "
Analysis from iDefense and the SANS Institute , however , reveals that computer users put their PCs at risk when they run the Patriot software .
The program connects a computer to one of a number of Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) servers .
Once the machine is linked up , Help Israel Win can order it to do just about anything .
The Patriot program does something " fishy , " SANS Institute security specialist Bojan Zdrnja said , by retrieving " a remote file and sav[ing ] it on the local machine as TmpUpdateFile.exe . "
That could easily be a
" trojan , " Zdrnja said , referring to a program that sneaks malicious code onto a computer .
" While at the moment it does not appear to do anything bad ( it just connects to the IRC server and sites there — there also appeared to be around 1,000 machines running this when I tested this ) the owner can probably do whatever he wants with machines running this , " Zdrnja wrote .
Liri , with Help Israel Win , conceded that " the Patriot code could be used as a trojan .
However , " practically it is not used as such , and will never be . "
" The update option is used to fix bugs in the client , and not to upload any malicious code … never have and never will , " Liri said .
" The project will close right after the war is over , and we have given a fully functional uninstaller to [ remove ] the application . "
It ’s also unclear how much the Patriot program is really helping the Israeli side in the online information war .
La Pilla has been monitoring Help Israel Win’s IRC
servers for days .
" They did n’t make us download and install anything .
Did n’t make us [ attack ] anybody .
I was basically just sitting idle on their network . "
The group claims to have shut down sarayaalquds .
or g and qudsvoice .
net .
But , as of now , the rest of the group ’s pro-Hamas targets remain online .
Meanwhile , Help Israel
Win has had to shift from website to website , as they come under attack from unknown assailants .

Today I had the chance to play around with Wizards of the Coast 's newly launched Character Builder .
Basically this program helps you make and store D&D characters .
Big deal , right ?
Anyone with four 6 - siders , a pencil and a paper can do that .
Well , maybe not as easily , or as slickly .
Read on .
First thing you should know is that Character Creator only works on XP and Vista , and for Vista you have to download an additional service pack .
No news on Mac OS and Linux compatible apps , but do n't hold your breath .
Check out the screen shots after the cut , and click on them if you want to see them full size .
So I launched the program and clicked on the button to create a new character .
The first thing you do is choose a race .
As you can see , the available races include many non-standard ones .
I chose Tiefling , an angst - filled and sardonic race of half - demons .
Next , you choose a class .
As with race , many semi-official or non-standard races can be chosen .
I picked Rogue for my tiefling .
When you choose a class , you can also pick what " build " ( flavor of that class ) you 'd like .
I wanted a trickster rogue .
Next you roll up your attributes .
You can either build the character up point by point or roll the old fashioned way .
You can roll as quickly as you click , so it 's easy to end up with very high attributes .
Next , skills .
As with the previous choices , Wizards makes it easy for you by only showing you legal choices .
Once you make a choice , it quickly moves on to the next category .
The same with powers , the Character Builder only shows you powers you 're eligible to take .
Also , and this applies for previous choices as well , the right - hand column gives you information about the whatever power you 've highlighted .
Next , equipment .
The power tool on this one is " auto pick " which chooses your equipment for you if you can't decide how many iron spikes to buy .
Last , important details like name , gender , age , and so forth .
I like how this is the final decision – how often do you evolve your concept of the character throughout the creation process ?
The result : a character sheet !
You can print it out duplex every time you play .
Not only can't you lose it , but it can be continually updated as the character gains levels .
Fine , Character Builder helps you make characters .
But there is a tantalizing possibility as well .
What would your character look like at 10th or 15th level ?
What powers would you choose ?
You can " level up " your PC to whatever you want , in order to visualize how you want him or her to be at that level .
Alternatively , DMs could use the program to create NPCs with minimum fuss .
Now for the bad news : the program is free for levels 1 - 3 , but if you want to make advanced characters , you need to fork over some dough .
You must be a member of D&D Insider to get the full capability – though currently membership is free , though do n't expect it to stay free forever .
Incidentally , Insider membership seems to carry some awesome frills like online access to critical portions of the rules like class and feat details .
It 's not a substitute for the rulebooks , but could save your skin if you 're hunting for a particular rule .
I found the Character Builder to be quick to learn , informative , and fun .
I suggest you check it out while it 's free !
20th Century Fox has beamed The Day the Earth Stood Still into deep space , a first for a motion picture .
The studio ’s press release :
Twentieth Century
Fox makes history by transmitting the first motion picture in to deep space , making THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL the worlds first galactic motion picture release .
The first deliberate deep space transmission of this highly anticipated science fiction thriller will begin this Friday , December 12 , 2008 , to coincide with the films opening day on Planet Earth .
If any civilizations are currently orbiting Alpha Centauri , they will be able to receive and view the film approximately four years from now in the year 2012 .
In a time when global movie launches are now commonplace , Fox is raising the bar by spearheading , with Deep Space Communications Network located at Cape Canaveral , the ultimate in wide release platforms .
As millions of Earthbound movie fans get their first look at THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL , starring Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly , the film will be zipping through space at 186,000 miles per second to a heretofore untapped possible consumer base orbiting the three star system , Alpha Centauri .
Commented Twentieth Century Fox domestic distribution president Bruce Snyder : “ We at Fox always like to think big , and what ’s bigger than a ‘ galactic ’ release of a major motion picture event ?
We look forward to sharing THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL with our galactic neighbors near Alpha Centauri — and look forward to their feedback … eight years from now . ”
Industry watchers and film historians will note that due to the distance between our solar system and the Alpha Centauri system , it will take over eight years ( accounting for a roundtrip communication ) to receive any Alpha Centauri reviews .
The transmission is not a single beam aimed at just the Alpha Centauri system , but can be received by any advanced technologically capable civilization along the way to Alpha Centauri , and beyond .
Prior to its arrival at Alpha Centauri , the transmission of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL can be intercepted and viewed at various points in our own solar system ( Distance from Earth  at the speed of light  and transmission time , as follows ) :
Moon : 0.000000038 , 1.1991888 seconds
Sun : 0.000016 , 8.41536 minutes
Mercury : 0.0000095 , 4.99662 minutes
Venus : 0.00000476 , 2.5035696 minutes
Mars : 0.0000076 , 3.997296 minutes
Jupiter : 0.0000666 , 35.028936 minutes
Saturn : 0.000135 , 1.18341 hours
Uranus : 0.000285 , 2.49831 hours
Neptune : 0.00046 , 4.03236 hours
Pluto : 0.0006183 , 5.4200178 hours
“ We are thrilled about beaming this film into space .
This will be our first full length movie transmission .
And what could be more relevant to send into Deep Space than a movie about the Earths acceptance of visitors from outer space , ” commented Jim Lewis , Managing Director , Deep Space Communications Network
About DEEP SPACE COMMUNICATIONS
NETWORK :
Deep Space Communications
Network is a private organization located east of Orlando .
DSCN was formed specifically to communicate with outerspace by a group of broadcast engineers and communications experts who regularly transmit from the space center .
The beam transmitting THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is by redundant high - powered klystron amplifiers connected by a traveling waveguide to a five meter parabolic dish antenna .
Republican senators have a modest proposal for Hilda Solis : that if she ’s confirmed as Labor Secretary , she recuse herself from any advocacy for the Employee Free Choice Act .
That ’s quite the suggestion .
Rather like asking Robert Gates not to advocate for the armed forces , or Judd Gregg not to champion American business , or President Obama ’s environmental picks not to support stricter fuel - efficiency standards .
But then , Republicans ’ opposition to unions is close to clinically pathological .
SAMSON , Ala . 
The gunman , wearing a vest loaded with ammunition and carrying four guns , went from town to town , leaving a trail of gruesome crime scenes over 20 miles of rural southern Alabama .
He first killed his mother and the family dogs in Kinston , Ala. , the authorities said , then drove 10 miles to Samson , where he shot five members of his extended family , including the uncle who had raised him .
Next , his violence became random , as he sprayed bullets at cars , stores and police officers , killing neighbors , a man walking down the street , a woman at a convenience store and a passing motorist , they said .
All told , the gunman , identified as Michael K. McLendon , 28 , killed 10 people , in what law enforcement officials called the worst mass shooting in Alabama history , and wounded six before fatally shooting himself .

“ He never said a word , all the time he was doing this ; never said a word , ” said Tom Knowles , a neighbor who saw Mr. McLendon pull up in front of his uncle ’s house Tuesday afternoon and begin shooting at family members sitting on porch swings .
“ He had no look on his face , no look at all , ” said Mr. Knowles , 51 .
Mr. McLendon ’s reign of terror , staggering to the close - knit communities here , lasted about 50 minutes , said Kirke Adams , the district attorney for Geneva and Dale Counties .
“ Crime scenes littered this city , ” he said .
“ Obviously , this man had some major problems , ” Mr. Adams added .
“ And this town was made to suffer . ”
Gary McAliley , the district attorney for Pike and Coffee Counties , which includes Kinston , said witnesses had seen Mr. McLendon become upset with his family ever since his parents divorced .
Recently , he had refused to go to a relative ’s funeral , Mr. McAliley said , telling a co-worker that the rest of the family had not been supportive to him and his mother .
He had also aggressively tried to get a family Bible , but recently received a letter from a lawyer representing another family member telling him to back off .
“ He was excessively upset about that , ” Mr. McAliley said .

Mr. McLendon was described by those who knew him as a quiet , shy man who had few friends and stayed out of trouble .
He had a lifelong fascination with guns , said Cecil Knowles , a classmate and Tom Knowles ’s son , and got his first hunting rifle at age 11 .
Co-workers called him “ doughboy , ” Mr. McAliley said .
“ Everywhere that he went that he could tote a gun , he would , ” Mr. Knowles said .
On Tuesday he was armed with a handgun , two assault rifles and a shotgun .
In his house , investigators found survival and military paraphernalia , including bulletproof vests , Mr. McAliley said .
And on the dresser in Mr. McLendon ’s bedroom they found several lists .
One included the names of two dozen employees at Kelley Foods , a sausage maker and food distributor where Mr. McLendon had worked until he quit last week .
The list was marked with specific complaints against individuals , like “ Reported me for not wearing earplugs , ” and “ Made me spend four hours clearing out the meat grinder . ”
Another law enforcement official cautioned that the list may have been a year old and was not considered a hit list .

A second piece of paper listed the names and addresses of three companies : Kelley ; Reliable Products , a metal fabricator where Mr. McLendon worked until 2003 ; and Pilgrim ’s Pride , a meat and egg processing company where his mother worked until she was suspended for an unspecified cause on March 8 , Mr. McAliley said .
Mr. McLendon ’s shooting spree ended at Reliable , where he killed himself , the authorities said .
No one knew why he quit his job at Reliable , where employees said he had a good record .
“ He came to work one day and left , ” said George Helms , the plant ’s human resources manager .
“ He did n’t have anything to say . ”
In 2003 , he tried to become a police officer in Samson .
He passed the necessary background check but failed basic training .
“ He did n’t make it past the first day , ” said Becky Payne , an assistant to the director of the Alabama Advanced Criminal Justice Academy .
Clay King , the mayor of Samson , said Mr. McLendon had been a well - behaved child .
“ I ’ve known him most of my life , ” he said .
“ I coached him in Little League baseball . ”

No one considered it unusual that Mr. McLendon collected guns , Mr. King said .
“ People here hunt a lot , ” he said .
“ They collect a lot of guns .
I ’ve got probably 30 guns .
It ’s just kind of a hobby .
That part of it was n’t concerning to me . ”
Mr. McLendon was not licensed to carry the automatic weapons but was licensed to carry a pistol , said Chief Frankie Lindsey of the Geneva Police Department .
Mr. McLendon had purchased ammunition for the automatic weapons that morning in Daleville .
He began his rampage at the remote ranch - style house in Coffee County where he lived with his mother , Lisa White McLendon , 52 .
It appeared he shot her and her dogs , then laid them on and around the couch and soaked them with paint thinner , officials said .
“ He put a pile of clothes and stuff on her , then set the clothes on fire , ” said Robert Preachers , the county coroner .
“ I reckon he thought it would make her burn faster . ”

From there , Mr. McLendon drove his Mitsubishi Eclipse south to Samson , to the white frame house where neighbors said he had lived for years with his uncle , James A. White , 55 , and aunt , Phyllis White .
The Whites were on the porch with their daughter , Tracy M. Wise , 34 , her son , Dean , 15 , and a family that lived across the street : Andrea D. Myers , 31 , the wife of a local sheriff ’s deputy , and her two children , 4 - month - old Ella and 18 - month - old Corrine .
Mr. McLendon ’s great - aunt , Virginia E. White , 74 , was in her trailer parked in Mr. White ’s side yard .
Moments later , all but Ella and Phyllis White were dead .
Mr. McLendon chased Ms. White , who ran through the house , out the back door , and to a neighbor ’s , witnesses said .
One witness said Ms. White was saved when Mr. McLendon ’s gun jammed .
On Wednesday , with law enforcement officials guarding the house , a handful of people came out the front door to inspect the porch , which had been cleansed of blood .
The swings were gone .
A woman in a pale green housecoat touched a wall , then bowed , leaning her head against it .
After Mr. McLendon sped off , spraying bullets , Cecil Knowles ’s wife , Alina , ran to rescue Ella , who was crying and covered in blood .
But Mr. McLendon circled the block and returned , the Knowleses said .
Ms. Knowles , a certified nursing assistant , and her father - in - law , Tom Knowles , each hid behind a parked car as Mr. McLendon pointed his gun out the window of his car .
Fennec , the mobile version of the Firefox browser from Mozilla , has reached a milestone release with a version for the HTC Touch Pro , though initial reports seem to indicate it lacks key functionality .
The milestone release is intended for Windows Mobile devices with VGA screens , though the Fennec blog mentions the HTC Touch Pro specifically .
Readers of WMExperts are apparently unable to get the browser to load so much as a static HTML page , belying claims that the browser is largely functional .
The release does lack an update mechanism , and plug-ins are n't supported as yet , along with soft keyboards - so Touch users need to pull out their sliding keyboard to enter a URL .
Lacking a handy HTC
Touch we 've not been able to verify the functionality , but the team promises the UI is working properly and most pages should be rendering accurately .
While the desktop browsing market is pretty much sewn up , with Firefox chewing away at the IE / Safari duopoly , on mobiles things are a lot more fluid .
Opera already offers a remarkable browsing experience for free , while the Iris browser offers Windows Mobile users an alternative and Microsoft seems to have given up on mobile browsing completely , for the moment at least .
Safari underlies the browsing experience on top-end Nokias , but the iPhone offers an unparalleled browsing experience - as long as you 've got two hands free .
With such an open playing field Fennec has a real chance of finding itself as the default browser , embedded in devices at manufacture , something of which its bigger brother can only dream . ®
What are the origins of life ?
How did things go from non-living to living ?
From something that could not reproduce to something that could ?
One person who has exhaustively investigated this subject is paleontologist Andrew Knoll , a professor of biology at Harvard and author of Life on a Young Planet : The First Three Billion Years of Life .
In this wide - ranging interview , Knoll explains , among other compelling ideas , why higher organisms like us are icing on the cake of life , how deeply living things and our planet are intertwined , and why it 's so devilishly difficult to figure out how life got started .
A bacterial world NOVA :
When people think of life here on Earth , they think of animals and plants , but as you say in your book , that 's really not the history of life on our planet , is it ?
Knoll :
It 's fair to say when you go out and walk in the woods or on a beach , the most conspicuous forms of life you will see are plants and animals , and certainly there 's a huge diversity of those types of organisms , perhaps 10 million animal species and several hundred thousand plant species .
But these are evolutionary latecomers .
The history of animals that we 've recorded from fossils is really only the last 15 percent or so of the recorded history of life on this planet .
The deeper history of life and the greater diversity of life on this planet is microorganisms — bacteria , protozoans , algae .
One way to put it is that animals might be evolution 's icing , but bacteria are really the cake .
NOVA : So we live in their world rather than the other way around ?
Knoll :
We definitely live in a bacterial world , and not just in the trivial sense that there 's lots of bacteria .
If you look at the ecological circuitry of this planet , the ways in which materials like carbon or sulfur or phosphorous or nitrogen get cycled in ways that makes them available for our biology , the organisms that do the heavy lifting are bacteria .
For every cycle of a biologically important element , bacteria are necessary ; organisms like ourselves are optional .
NOVA : What is your definition of life ?
Knoll : I think you can say that life is a system in which proteins and nucleic acids interact in ways that allow the structure to grow and reproduce .
It 's that growth and reproduction , the ability to make more of yourself , that 's important .
Now , you might argue that that 's a local definition of life , that if we find life on Europa at some time in the future , it might have a different set of interacting chemicals .
“ The short answer is we do n’t really know how life originated on this planet . ”
People have tried to find more general , more universal definitions of life .
They 're speculative , because we do n't know about any life other than ourselves .
But one definition that I kind of like says life is a system that 's capable of Darwinian evolution .
What does it require to have a system that evolves in a Darwinian fashion ?
First , you have to be able to reproduce and make more of yourself , so that fits with our local definition .
You also need a source of variation so that all of the new generation is not identical either to the previous generation or to all its brothers and sisters .
And once you have that variation , then natural selection can actually select , by either differential birth or death , some of the variants that function best .
That may turn out to be a fairly general definition of life wherever we might find it .
Launching life NOVA :
What do you think was the first form of life ?
Knoll :
It 's pretty clear that all the organisms living today , even the simplest ones , are removed from some initial life form by four billion years or so , so one has to imagine that the first forms of life would have been much , much simpler than anything that we see around us .
But they must have had that fundamental property of being able to grow and reproduce and be subject to Darwinian evolution .
So it might be that the earliest things that actually fit that definition were little strands of nucleic acids .
Not DNA yet — that 's a more sophisticated molecule — but something that could catalyze some chemical reactions , something that had the blueprint for its own reproduction .
NOVA : Would it be something we would recognize under a microscope as living , or would it be totally different ?
Knoll :
That 's a good question .
I can imagine that there was a time before there was life on Earth , and then clearly there was a time X - hundred thousand years or a million years later when there were things that we would all recognize as biological .
But there 's no question that we must have gone through some intermediate stage where , had you been there watching them , you might have placed your bets either way .
So I can imagine that on a primordial Earth you would have replicating molecules — not particularly lifelike in our definition , but they 're really getting the machinery going .
Then some of them start interacting together and pretty soon you have something a little more lifelike , and then it incorporates maybe another piece of nucleic acid from somewhere else , and by the accumulation of these disparate strands of information and activity , something that you and I would look at and agree " that 's biological " would have emerged .
NOVA : In a nutshell , what is the process ?
How does life form ?
Knoll :
The short answer is we do n't really know how life originated on this planet .
There have been a variety of experiments that tell us some possible roads , but we remain in substantial ignorance .
That said , I think what we 're looking for is some kind of molecule that is simple enough that it can be made by physical processes on the young Earth , yet complicated enough that it can take charge of making more of itself .
That , I think , is the moment when we cross that great divide and start moving toward something that most people would recognize as living .
Recipe for life NOVA :
Is this an inevitable consequence of the conditions and chemicals and stuff that existed on early Earth ?
Knoll :
We do n't know whether life is an inevitable consequence of planetary formation .
Certainly in our solar system there is no shortage of planets that probably never had life on them .
So it 's a hard question to answer .
I think the way I 'd be most comfortable thinking about it is that you probably have to get the recipe right .
That is , you need a planet that has a certain range of environments , certain types of gases in the atmosphere , certain types of geological processes at work , that when you have the right conditions , life will emerge fairly rapidly .
I do n't think we need to think about inherently improbable events that eventually happen just because there are huge intervals of time .
My guess is that it either happens or it does n't .
NOVA : Has there been a change in thinking about this over the years ?
Knoll : People 's ideas on the circumstances under which life might emerge have really changed and developed over the last 30 or 40 years .
I think it 's fair to say that when I was a boy those few people who thought about the origin of life thought that it probably was a set of improbable reactions that just happened to get going over the fullness of time .
And I think it 's fair to say that most of those people probably thought that we would find out what those reactions were , that somehow we would nail it in a test tube at some point .
“ To a first approximation you ’re just a bag of carbon , oxygen , and hydrogen . ”
Now I think , curiously enough , both of those attitudes have changed .
I think that there 's less confidence that we 're really going to be able to identify a specific historical route by which life emerged , but at the same time there 's increasing confidence that when life did arise on this planet , it was not a protracted process using a chemistry that is pretty unlikely but rather is a chemistry that , when you get the recipe right , it goes , and it goes fairly quickly .
NOVA : What is the recipe for life ?
Knoll :
The recipe for life is not that complicated .
There are a limited number of elements inside your body .
Most of your mass is carbon , oxygen , hydrogen , sulfur , plus some nitrogen and phosphorous .
There are a couple dozen other elements that are in there in trace amounts , but to a first approximation you 're just a bag of carbon , oxygen , and hydrogen .
Now , it turns out that the atmosphere is a bag of carbon , oxygen , and hydrogen as well , and it 's not living .
So the real issue here is , how do you take that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ( or methane in an early atmosphere ) and water vapor and other sources of hydrogen — how do you take those simple , inorganic precursors and make them into the building blocks of life ?
There was a famous experiment done by Stanley Miller when he was a graduate student at the University of Chicago in the early 1950s .
Miller essentially put methane , or natural gas , ammonia , hydrogen gas , and water vapor into a beaker .
That was n't a random mixture ; at the time he did the experiment , that was at least one view of what the primordial atmosphere would have looked like .
Then he did a brilliant thing .
He simply put an electric charge through that mixture to simulate lightning going through an early atmosphere .
After sitting around for a couple of days , all of a sudden there was this brown goo all over the reaction vessel .
When he analyzed what was in the vessel , rather than only having methane and ammonia , he actually had amino acids , which are the building blocks of proteins .
In fact , he had them in just about the same proportions you would find if you looked at organic matter in a meteorite .
So the chemistry that Miller was discovering in this wonderful experiment was not some improbable chemistry , but a chemistry that is widely distributed throughout our solar system .
NOVA : So life is really chemistry .
Knoll :
Life really is a form of chemistry , a particular form in which the chemicals can lead to their own reproduction .
But the important thing , I think , is that when we think about the origin of life this way , it is n't that life is somehow different from the rest of the planet .
Life is something that emerges on a developing planetary surface as part and parcel of the chemistry of that surface .
“ Life is really part of the fabric of a planet like Earth . ”
Life is also sustained by the planet itself .
That is , all of the nutrients that go into the oceans and end up getting incorporated into biology , at first they 're locked up in rocks and then they are eroded from rocks , enter the oceans , and take part in a complex recycling that ensures that there 's always carbon and nitrogen and phosphorous available for each new generation of organisms .
The most interesting thought of all is that not only does life arise as a product of planetary processes , but in the fullness of time , on this planet at least , life emerged as a suite of planetary processes that are important in their own right .
We 're sitting here today breathing an oxygen - rich mixture of air .
We could n't be here without that oxygen , but that oxygen was n't present on the early Earth , and it only became present because of the activity of photosynthetic organisms .
So in a nutshell , life is really part of the fabric of a planet like Earth .
Building a being NOVA :
To get back to these basic chemistry building blocks , is everything from a mouse to a bacterium to you and me made from this simple set of ingredients ?
Knoll :
All life that we know of is fundamentally pretty similar .
That 's why we think that you and I and bacteria and toadstools all had a single common ancestor early on the Earth .
If you look at the cell of a bacterium , it has about the same proportions of carbon and oxygen and hydrogen as a human body does .
The basic biochemical machinery of a bacterium is , in a broad way at least , similar to the chemistry of our cells .
The big difference between you and a bacterium in some ways is that your body consists of trillions of cells that function in a coordinated manner .
Bacteria are single cells , although they 're not free agents .
In fact , bacteria working in a sediment or in the sea actually live in consortia as well .
They 're not really lone operators .
They work in these very , very highly coordinated communities of organisms that help each other to grow and prosper .
NOVA : Is it hard to go from these little building blocks to a full - fledged organism ?
Knoll :
Well , we do n't know how hard it is to go from the simplest bricks , if you will , in the wall of life to something that is complicated , like a living bacterium .
We know that it happened , so it 's possible .
We do n't really know whether it was unlikely and just happened to work out on Earth , or whether it 's something that will happen again and again in the universe .
My guess is it 's not too hard .
That is , it 's fairly easy to make simple sugars , molecules called bases which are at the heart of DNA , molecules called amino acids which are at the heart of proteins .
It 's fairly easy to make some of the fatty substances that make the coverings of cells .
Making all of those building blocks individually seems to be pretty reasonable , pretty plausible .
The hard part , and the part that I think nobody has quite figured out yet , is how you get them working together .
How do you go from some warm , little pond on a primordial Earth that has amino acids , sugars , fatty acids just sort of floating around in the environment to something in which nucleic acids are actually directing proteins to make the membranes of the cell ?
Somehow you have to get all of the different constituents working together and have basically the information to make that system work in one set of molecules , which then directs the formation of a second set of molecules , which synthesizes a third set of molecules , all in a way that feeds back to making more of the first set of molecules .
So you end up getting this cycle .
I 'm not sure we 've gotten very far down the road to understanding how that really happens .
Through a glass darkly NOVA :
In your book , you liken the study of the origin of life to a maze .
Knoll : Yes .
There are multiple doors that enter the maze , but there 's really only one historical path that life took .
I think that while we 've had some very clever entryways into several of these doors , at this point we still do n't know which of these pathways ultimately will thread us through the maze and which end up in a blind alley .
NOVA : So at this point we 're seeing the origins of life through a glass darkly ?
Knoll :
If we try to summarize by just saying what , at the end of the day , do we know about the deep history of life on Earth , about its origin , about its formative stages that gave rise to the biology we see around us today , I think we have to admit that we 're looking through a glass darkly here .
We have some hints , we have a geologic record that tells us that life formed early on the planet , although our ability to interpret that in terms of specific types of microorganisms is still frustratingly limited .
“ I imagine my grandchildren will still be sitting around saying that it ’s a great mystery . ”
There are still some great mysteries .
People sometimes think that science really takes away mystery , but I think there are great scientific mysteries and causes for wonder and , most importantly , things that will , I hope , stimulate biologists for years to come .
We do n't know how life started on this planet .
We do n't know exactly when it started , we do n't know under what circumstances .
It 's a mystery that we 're going to chip at from several different directions .
Geologists like myself will chip at it by trying to get ever clearer records of Earth 's early history and ever better ways of interrogating those rocks through their chemistry and paleontology .
Biologists will chip at it by understanding at an ever deeper level how the various molecular constituents of the cell work together , how living organisms are related to one other genealogically .
And chemists will get at it by doing new experiments that will tell us what is plausible in how those chemical correspondences came to be .
NOVA : Will we ever solve the problem ?
Knoll : I do n't know .
I imagine my grandchildren will still be sitting around saying that it's a great mystery , but that they will understand that mystery at a level that would be incomprehensible to us today .
This is a topic the Burning Question crew takes very seriously .
Over the years we 've encountered , with great concern , people who waive off tequila " because it gets me too wasted , " or those warning against brown liquors and the " mean drunks " that ensue -- and so on .
Yet they make these claims while slurping martinis , pounding down rum and Coke ... It just does n't make sense .
" I hear it all the time , mostly with tequila , gin and bourbon , " says Danny Versfelt , bartender at Al Biernat's .
The phenomenon even affects him .
" To this day I can't drink shots of tequila straight . "
Could something in tequila or the other spirits really push you over a line you wo n't cross drinking vodka ?
To find out , we polished off almost a case of Sauza Hornitos one evening and about the same amount of Boodles the next -- such was our commitment to finding an answer .
We would have addressed the bourbon theory , as well , if our editor had n't raised serious budgetary questions ... and brought up the women 's undergarments left dangling from trees in his front yard two nights running .
But all alcoholic beverages derive their punch from the same source : ethanol .
Assuming you order 80 proof spirits , bourbon and vodka distilled from grain differ mostly in color , derived in the case of bourbon from a period of rest in charred barrels .
The rich amber hue can hurt you -- in the form of a wicked hangover .
Otherwise , whether you drink tequila , bourbon , gin or vodka , you 're drinking ethanol .
And we say this with some authority , being mostly degreed scholars with one or two science credits .
" The basic molecule of alcohol is the same , " explains Terry Mumford , science - savvy bartender at The Porch .
" You could mix it with gasoline -- that would make you feel bad , but it would n't be because of the booze .
" Most of it is psychological , " he concludes .
Bartenders blame a patron 's behavior not on what they drink , but how much .
Other associations , such as fear of a specific type of alcohol , may stem from a person 's first bad drinking experience , along with the tendency of novices to order cheap , gut - wrenching brands .
" It 's how you drink it , " Versfelt warns .
" If you throw it back with reckless abandon , it will hurt you . "
Will cause you to spend several hundred bucks at TJ Maxx then drive by your editor 's house , too .
So that 's it -- our answer to this week 's Burning Question .
Alcoholic content , the amount you consume , the speed in which you consume it -- all bear more of the blame for late night misdeeds than the particulars involved , whether they be gin , vodka , tequila or even vermouth .
If one could stomach that much vermouth .
Or , as Versfelt says , tapping on his noggin : " it 's all up here .
Just thank God there 's so much other booze around . "
I was saddened to read Hannah Whittaker ’s article on The F Word
about her eating disorder a while back .
I did , however , want to share
the experiences of someone from the other side of the fence .
I have
what , for many women , is an extremely enviable figure .
If I open a copy
of FHM , the models do n’t look like unattainable visions of
tiny - waisted pneumatic perfection .
They look like me .
With my size 6 ,
30E frame I could easily be a glamour model if I wanted – although of
course I am probably over the hill at 25 .
And if I had a pound for
every time I ’ve heard a female acquaintance tell me I have " the perfect
figure , " whatever that is , I ’d probably have enough money for a breast
reduction .
I must say straight away that I am happy with the way I look .
There are
things that I would change if it were easy to do so .
I would like to
have longer limbs and yes , smaller breasts .
But I quite like my body .
It ’s mine and it ’s familiar .
It ’s good at martial arts and playing the
cello and giving hugs .
This happiness and acceptance however has been
hard - won .
I liked my breasts when they first appeared .
I was a 28A for a long
time and , while I felt a little self - conscious about these new
additions to my physique simply by virtue of the fact that most other
12 - year - olds did n’t yet have any at all , I liked them .
They were small
and perky , in proportion with the rest of me and did n’t get me any
unwanted attention .
All of this changed virtually overnight when I was
14 .
In the space of about three months , I went from an A to an E cup .
The way I was treated by both people I knew and by strangers completely
changed .
My peers began to see me as " slutty , " despite the fact that I
had never even kissed a boy .
The bitchy , popular clique of girls at
school tried to recruit me , not seeming to understand why I had little
interest in wearing a truly hideous amount of make - up to school and
making other girls ’ lives hell .
Teachers began to see me as
troublesome , giving me detention for minor things .
And overnight , I
went from being able to walk down the street without even being looked
at , to having strangers lean out of car windows to inform me that they
would like to fuck my brains out .
Groping my breasts became almost a sport among the boys at school .
It
would happen in class , during break times , while I passed them in the
corridor – any time that I was within groping distance .
Typically , a
boy would grab my breasts while his friends whooped and hollered .
Occasionally the friends would be holding me down .
I would scream and
hit them , but this seemed only to increase their enjoyment .
Nobody ever
came to my rescue : not the girls , not the other boys whose opinions
these male chauvinist piglets probably would have respected the most ,
and not the teachers whose job it was to intervene .
It simply was not
regarded as important .
It was seen as an inevitability of my figure ,
and if I had the temerity to walk down the corridors looking like I
did , what did I expect ?
A boy once told me about a specific sexual
fantasy he had , involving tying me up , beating me and raping me .
He
apparently used to crack one out while imagining this every night .
Another boy once asked me , “ Has n’t anybody ever told you a handful is
enough ? ” as if I ’d deliberately inflated them myself .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .

It was n’t just the boys .
A campaign of complete lechery from one of my
teachers distressed me sufficiently for me to bunk off lessons .
He
stared at my tits in class , made lewd comments about me in front of
everybody and , when I lost weight as a result of being so anxious and
upset , chided me because he “ liked his women with curves . ”
When I
finally plucked up the courage to complain to my ( female ) head of year
I was simply told : “ Do n’t worry dear , I ’m sure he did n’t mean it . ”
As I spent many break times hiding in the toilets , the girls would try
to say helpful , supportive things .
The general consensus was that I
should be glad of having big breasts , that I should be happy with them
because boys liked them , that perhaps I ought to chill out and enjoy
the attention , and that putting up with groping was just the price I
had to pay for being hot .
I do n’t lack respect for these girls ( they
were after all only between 14 and 16 at the time ) , but it ’s hugely
worrying that their kind words did n’t consist instead of : “ You
should n’t have to put up with this , ” “ It ’s not your fault ” or , “ Let’s
talk to the headmaster and make sure the governors hear about this
because that teacher ought to be fired immediately . ”
My male friends
trivialized the situation , possibly simply fearing the scorn of their
classmates , but , for whatever reason , they were disinterested in
sticking up for me and generally adopted the same “ chill out and enjoy
the attention ” attitude as the girls .
As for the teachers , they turned
a blind eye whenever possible , pretended they had n’t noticed when I was
assaulted in their classes and did as little as possible when I
specifically asked for their support .
Of course , it was n’t just at school that my mammary tissue provoked so
much humiliation .
As soon as my large breasts appeared , I had to deal
with grown men leering at me , propositioning me and telling me what
they wanted to do to me .
I do n’t honestly know if I looked much older
than I really was , but as a general rule , I ’d say that inviting a girl
in school uniform to provide you with a “ tit wank ” is n’t really
appropriate .
And no , this was not an isolated incident .
My youth orchestra held an annual awards ceremony , one of the awards
being the “ Mammoth Melons Award , ” for which the girl with the biggest
breasts would be presented with two enormous watermelons and everybody
would have a good laugh about it .
Every year I would spend the morning
of the awards ceremony hiding in the bathroom hyperventilating at the
prospect of being so humiliated ( I never got the award – either I
was n’t popular enough or one of my friends tipped off the organizers
about how upset I ’d be ) .
When I look back on this now , I ’m completely
appalled that it was allowed to happen .
Making fun of a teenage girl’s
breasts in an official awards ceremony approved by the teachers is just
not cool .
Something else that made me feel very uncomfortable about my new assets
was the extent to which I was stared at , not just by sleazy men , but by
other women .
My breasts were given disparaging stares , envious stares ,
and stares whose motivation I could n’t work out at all .
I was also
given some very unpleasant verbal abuse by other women .
I very rarely
received compliments about my breasts from anyone other than close
friends – whenever anyone made a comment , it was nasty .
Unsolicited
comments
I ’ve received from other women include “ That ’s SO not
attractive , ” “ You do realize they ’ll be down to your ankles by the time
you ’re 30 , ” and , “ You think you ’re something really special , do n’t
you ? ”
And , of course , apart from the unpleasant comments themselves , a
lengthy disparaging stare speaks a thousand vitriolic words .
I believe that the reason that so many women feel that it ’s acceptable
to mock large breasts is that there is an underlying assumption that
all women want larger breasts .
Women ’s magazines are full of tips on
how to “ make the most of your assets . ”
In trashy chick - lit novels , the
protagonist with whom we are supposed to identify always has small
ones .
Because there is an assumption that all women want bigger
breasts , women who actually do have big breasts are assumed to be in a
state of extreme smugness .
And because it ’s entirely unacceptable for a
woman to be happy with her appearance , anyone with big tits needs
taking down a peg or two , the conceited bitch .
Therein lies the sting in the tail .
As the girl with the oh - so - envious
figure , you will receive no sympathy .
If you ever , ever express any
discontent with the unwanted attention and discrimination you receive
as a result of looking like the “ ideal woman , ” or if you ever express a
dislike of the aesthetic appearance of that part of your anatomy , you
will be shot down with cries of , “ You BITCH ” ( this is a compliment –
confusing , I know ) .
You will be cheerfully informed that you ought to
be glad of the attention .
And people will say charming things like :
“ It ’s a good thing you ’ve got big boobs , because otherwise nobody would
like you . ”
It ’s as if women ’s breasts are public property – the bigger they are ,
the less they belong to the person to whom they are attached , and the
more it is seen as acceptable to stare , make comments and to
de - humanise their owner .
It was n’t until I was in my 20s that I finally
started coming round to the idea that my breasts were my own , not just
unwanted appendages attached to my body .
Until then I had n’t seen them
as a part of me at all .
I had thought of them almost as a deformity .
They did n’t seem like mine .
I fantasised that one day I would wake up
and they would be gone , and I ’d go back to being treated as a human
being .
Nowadays things are much better .
I ’ve got better at dressing to make my
breasts look smaller ( not that I should have to , although I would
choose to anyway ) , and looking older means that I get less unwanted
attention ( not that I should have received unwanted attention when I
was younger either , and not that I am exactly geriatric at 25 ) .
I no
longer feel like a sex object every waking moment .
I no longer hate my
breasts and I no longer feel that they ’re unwanted appendages .
I would
definitely like them to be smaller and I wo n’t pretend otherwise , but
they feel like part of me , rather than the disembodied udders that they
used to feel like .
I ’m still not happy though .
Why should I ever have
felt that way ?
Why should I have had to have struggled so hard to be
respected and taken seriously ?
It ’s incredible to me that any woman would want large breasts when they
examine what the media at large seems to think of women so afflicted .
Just take a look at FHM .
They ’re all “ hot and ready ” bimbos presented as receptacles existing
solely for male entertainment .
Even women in high - powered positions
are n’t immune – witness the treatment of Harriet Harman after being
photographed a few months ago from an angle that grossly exaggerated
the amount of cleavage she was showing .
Poor Harman .
I know from bitter
personal experience just how difficult it is to dress " modestly " when
you have large breasts .
Dressing " modestly " means wearing something
that conceals the size of your large breasts – the actual size of them ,
not just the amount of flesh on show , otherwise you risk looking as if
you ’re actually dressing to make them look bigger .
It ’s a Catch - 22
situation that reaches whole new dimensions if , like me , you are only
5 ’2 ” and have to consider that most people will be able to see down
your top .
Because there are such limited representations of women in the media ,
and so many stereotypes associated with particular looks , this creates
unfortunate associations for women who happen to resemble any one of
these particular looks .
Tall , slim , young women for example are
stereotyped as bitchy fashionistas .
Women above a size 10 who – gasp ! –
do n’t hate themselves are " confident , real women . "
Overweight ,
middle - aged women are regarded as barely deserving of existence until
they give up carbs and get Botox .
And young , petite women with big
breasts are regarded as " easy . "
My classmate ’s “ a handful is enough ” comment succinctly demonstrates
the phenomenon of people thinking that women choose the size of their
breasts , or at least treating them as if they do .
Sometimes I feel as
if I have the words ARROGANT SLUT tattooed across my forehead .
Given
what men seem to think about my sexual availability and the judgements
that women seem to make about my " morals " and self - image , it really
does seem that having big breasts is equivalent to this .
I think that the crux of all of my breast - related problems was very
well summarized by a perceptive comment made by a friend of mine when I
was sixteen : “ The problem is , your breasts just do n’t suit your
personality . ”
She was right : people had gone from seeing me as I really
was – just another shy , geeky teenager who spent entirely too much time
in the library – to seeing me as a bimbo who would definitely want to
suck their dick .
My breasts were a mask that seemed to prevent people
from actually bothering to get to know me .
It seems that often women have the biggest problems with their breasts
when this happens , and when the treatment that they receive from other
people is related to their tits rather than to who they actually are as
a person .
All people are to some extent judged on their looks ; this is
unfair .
Women are judged on their looks much more than men ; this is
even more unfair and makes looks - based discrimination very much a
feminist issue .
Women with big breasts are in my opinion subjected to
many more negative snap judgements than most , perhaps even on a par
with fat women and women who explicitly fail to comply with society ’s
standards of beauty by doing horrific things like failing to remove
their armpit hair .
This is horrendously unfair , not to mention bloody
stupid .
I ’m not saying : “ Boo hoo , look how difficult life is for gorgeous
women , do n’t hate me because I ’m beautiful ! ”
Being regarded as
attractive generally makes life much easier and puts one in a position
of privilege , an unfair and wholly undeserved privilege that I am aware
of having .
But being seen as extremely sexually
attractive is massively problematic for the individual in question .
In
such a deeply sexist and heteronormative culture , looking like the
personification of “ sluttiness ” is seen as an invitation for sexual
harassment .
It ’s bad enough when people think you are inviting sexual
harassment because of how you happen to be dressed that day , but at
least mini skirts and high heels come off .
Breasts do not .
The size of
a woman ’s breasts , surgery notwithstanding , is not a personal choice .
Forget “ This is what a feminist looks like ” – I think I need a t- shirt
that says , “ These came with my body . "
For any girls or women who think that they would like to look like a
glamour model , I would like to say that you are fortunate not to .
Not
because there is anything at all wrong with being petite with big
breasts in itself , but because a woman who looks like a Nuts
pin-up is constantly assumed by most people to be an airhead .
Your life
will be much easier if you have a more average figure .
Consider how
healthy your self image would be by now if you had endured being
groped , being automatically regarded as unintelligent , being seen by
other women as the enemy , being regarded as nothing more than your
body , every day of your life .
You ca n’t take the breasts off .
They ’re
not like accessories that you can choose to put on when you feel like
having lots of attention and take off when you feel like being
respected or just simply able to run around without having to wear a
sports bra made of reinforced concrete .
For the love of God , why would
you wish that upon yourself ?
I have always thought , even as a child , that small and medium - sized
breasts were more attractive than large ones .
But were it not for the
judgements , the harassment , the objectification and the pure hatred
that my breasts have caused me , they ’d be no different from my short
legs or my frizzy hair – something that I ’d change if it were easy to
do so , but which does n’t really bother me .
Things are much better for
me now because I have a good academic career behind me and a
high - status job that explicitly requires intelligence .
I have proved
myself as not an airhead .
But why should I have to do so ?
Why should
the underlying assumption be that I am ?
It ’s stupid and unfair and I am
angry about it .
It ’s not my problem that my breasts “ do n’t suit my personality . "
The
problem is that there is a personality type associated with having big
breasts in the first place .
We do n’t need implants and breast
reductions .
What we need is to cure our society ’s complete obsession
with breasts .
We need somehow to do away with the idea that breast size
is directly proportional to sexual attractiveness , and that a sexually
attractive woman is somehow deserving of harassment and contempt .
Surely breasts are n’t the only beautiful thing about an attractive
woman ?
As a heterosexual female I appreciate that it ’s difficult for me
to comment meaningfully on what makes a woman sexually attractive , but
really , it ’s the equivalent of a man ’s attractiveness being judged
solely by the size of the bulge in his pants , which is surely not an
attitude that anybody with any aesthetic taste or basic respect for
their fellow humans would take .
I do still have some residual shame about my body .
I know this because
I cringed when writing the opening paragraph of this piece , describing
my appearance .
I was shocked at just how much I cringed .
After all , I
happily walk down the street every day looking like I do .
But
nevertheless , admitting that I have a 23 - inch waist and E - cup breasts
( look , I just wrote it again , how brazen ! ) gave me visions of lots of
angry women scowling at their monitors and fuming , “ The stuck - up bitch !
Who does she think she is ?
I mean , it ’s as if she ’s actually PROUD of
her goddamn ‘ perfect figure . ’
Who ’d have thought it , Barbie writing for
The F - Word … ” I know that this is irrational , but I share my paranoia to
illustrate that , despite the fact that I do n’t usually think about my
body much and never diet , I do still have quite a complicated
relationship with my figure and what I think people ’s reactions to it
might be .
I have cringed at every point at which I have stated or
implied that I am generally regarded as attractive from the neck down .
It feels like an extraordinarily arrogant thing to admit .
I feel as if
I ought to be simultaneously raving about having an ugly face or bad
hair just to balance things out .
It ’s stupid and irrational , but it ’s
the way I feel .
It ’s the way that mainstream , female , male and even
feminist culture seems to conspire to make me feel .
We can not win .
Whatever size our breasts are , there is something wrong
with them .
Whatever body type we have , even the most
conventionally - attractive kind , we are encouraged to be unhappy with it
somehow .
So quit worrying .
Stick two fingers up at society rather than
down your throat .
And if you think I ’m an airhead , please let it be
simply because you think I ’ve been talking complete bollocks for the
last 3,000 words .
Anyway , Samir devotes quite a bit of space in chapter 2 of his book to Hume ’s problem of induction , which is fundamental to our understanding of how science -- indeed , reasoning in general -- works .
Seems like the kinds of things that readers of this blog enjoy sinking their teeth into , so here we go .
The problem itself is well known : induction is the most common type of reasoning we all use ( the other fundamental kind , deduction , is used largely within formal logic and mathematics ) , and it consists of generalizations from a series of observations .
So when we say , for instance , that we are confident that the sun will rise tomorrow , this is not because we have a logical proof that it cannot be otherwise , but because we have seen it rising every day and we have no reason to think that tomorrow it will be otherwise .
I have been downloading a cartload of books on my new Kindle lately , since I really enjoy the idea of walking into the subway carrying a rather inconspicuous , very light , yet incredibly large library with me .
One of these books is Samir Okasha ’s Philosophy of Science : A Very Short Introduction , which I ’m reading because I intend to review and promote it .
Samir writes very clearly , and this short introduction is very useful for the general curious reader ( and , frankly , some scientists of my acquaintance could use it too ) .
Anyway , Samir devotes quite a bit of space in chapter 2 of his book to Hume ’s problem of induction , which is fundamental to our understanding of how science -- indeed , reasoning in general -- works .
Seems like the kinds of things that readers of this blog enjoy sinking their teeth into , so here we go .
The problem itself is well known : induction is the most common type of reasoning we all use ( the other fundamental kind , deduction , is used largely within formal logic and mathematics ) , and it consists of generalizations from a series of observations .
So when we say , for instance , that we are confident that the sun will rise tomorrow , this is not because we have a logical proof that it cannot be otherwise , but because we have seen it rising every day and we have no reason to think that tomorrow it will be otherwise .
As Okasha points out , we literally stake our lives on this sort of inductive reasoning , for instance every time we bet that a car will turn to the left if we rotate the steering wheel counterclockwise .
( By the way , it wo n’t do to claim that you expect the sun to rise or the wheels to turn because you understand the mechanism : your understanding of the mechanism is itself built on a series of inductions , it is not that there is a logical necessity for solar systems or cars to work in the particular way they do work . )
The problem is that , according to Hume , there is no rational justification for induction !
You see , if I ’d asked you why you use inductive reasoning , pretty much the best you can do is to reply that it has worked in the past .
Which is an argument based on induction .
Which means you are begging the question , in philosophical terms , engaging in circular reasoning .
This may seem yet another example of philosophers engaging in intellectual masturbation , but the more you think about it the more Hume ’s problem grows on you , and becomes disturbing .
To quote Okasha : “ If Hume is right , the foundations on which science is built do not look quite as solid as we might have hoped . ”
Oops .
Several ways have been proposed out of Hume ’s dilemma , none of them particularly successful .
I ’d like to briefly discuss here the idea -- presented by Okasha in some detail -- that the concept of probability might rescue science and reason from the problem of induction .
It goes something like this : granted that induction ( unlike deduction ) does not guarantee truth .
Perhaps , however , we can rephrase what induction allows us to do in terms of probable statements .
That is , we do n’t really mean that we know that the sun will rise tomorrow , or that the car will turn to the left .
We mean to say that , based on past experience , we think there is a high probability that those events will happen again in the future .
( Incidentally , since deduction does guarantee truth , why not use it instead ?
Because deductive reasoning has to start with two or more premises , and at least one of those premises is arrived at via experience , not from first principles .
Which means that even deduction itself has to rely on induction , at some point or another .
The mystery deepens ... )
Now , the problem is that philosophers have pointed out that there are at least three concepts of probability , so we have to see which , if any , of them is going to be helpful to dispel Hume ’s ghost .
The first way to think about probability is as a measure of the frequency of an event : if I say that the probability of a coin to land heads up is 50 % I may mean that , if I flip the coin say 100 times , on average I will get heads 50 times .
This is not going to get us out of Hume ’s problem , because probabilities interpreted as frequencies of events are , again , a form of induction -- we generalize from a few observations to a broader range of events instead of all possible events , but the type of reasoning is the same .
Secondly , we can think of probabilities as reflecting subjective judgment .
If I say that it is probable that the coin will land heads up , I might simply be trying to express my feeling that this will be the case .
You might have a different feeling , and respond that you do n’t think it 's probable that the coin will lend heads up .
This is certainly not a viable solution to the problem of induction , because subjective probabilities are , well , subjective , and hence reflect opinions , not degrees of truth .
Lastly , one can adopt what Okasha calls the logical interpretation of probabilities , according to which there is a probability X that an event will occur means that we have objective reasons to believe ( or not ) that X will occur ( for instance , because we understand the physics of the solar system , the mechanics of cars , or the physics of coin flipping ) .
This does n’t mean that we will always be correct , but it does offer a promising way out of Hume ’s dilemma , since it seems to ground our judgments on a more solid foundation .
Indeed , this is the option adopted by many philosophers , and would be the one probably preferred by scientists , if they ever gave this sort of thing a moment ’s thought .
( The statistically savvy among you may have noticed that this concept of probability is not the standard frequentist one common in classical statistical analysis , but more akin to either likelihood or Bayesian methods . )
Okasha warns his readers , however , that even the logical interpretation of probabilities runs into both philosophical and mathematical problems , but we shall leave that for another time .
Let me conclude with another quote from Samir ’s book , which to me encapsulates the whole point of doing philosophical analysis :
“ Like most philosophical questions , these questions probably do not admit of final answers , but in grappling with them we learn much about the nature and limits of scientific knowledge . ”
Indeed .
From Happstack :
“ [ If HApps does n’t do anything … ] the project will eventually be superceded by other Haskell frameworks like Turbinado which are not nearly as innovative ”
Woohoo !
People are talking about Turbinado !
err … Wait !
Turbinado is being dissed !
Turbinado vs. HApps
Each project is valid and valuable , so I ’m hesitant to get to far into a X vs. Y discussion , but here are some aspects that I thought about when evaluating HApps and developing Turbinado :
Turbinado is built on top of Nicklas Broberg ‘s HSP / HSPR , which I consider to be an innovative - port of ASP to Haskell …
HApps is a much bigger project with many more features ; Turbinado is small and needs your help [ shameless plug : help here ] .
HApps seems more like a library of really useful functions which is very flexible ; Turbinado is more like a web app framework and provides a web server along with defined mechanisms for adding Controller , Views and Components .
Convention over Configuration = different styles , not better styles .
HApps seems less than simple ( see here ) ; Turbinado is all about simple ( see here )
HApps has an aversion to relational databases ; Turbinado observes that lots of people use relational databases and supports them .
Turbinado vs. HApps , again
To me , it seems as though the choice between HApps and Turbinado depends more on orientation than on functionality .
If you are interested in : opposing RDMBSs , but are into something like Sinatra , then HApps is probably the best choice ; if you ’re interested in writing web apps in the style of Ruby On Rails , then Turbinado ( though young and pretty ) may be the best choice , especially given the simplicity of building Turbinado ( newly cabal installable !
to be described in a forthcoming post with tutorials , install details , singing , dancing , high kicks , etc ) .
Here ’s To Success
Most successful languages have more than one web framework , so I hope for success for both HApps and for Turbinado .
They ’re very different frameworks and serve very different needs .
The Haskell community would be well served if both frameworks survived and thrived .
As Merb and Rails have demonstrated , cross-pollination is excellent ; the stronger HApps and Turbinado are , the more they can benefit each other .
Two Japanese boys have brought a World War II bomb to class , flustering teachers on the island of Okinawa , which was the scene of the Pacific conflict 's bloodiest battle .
The two 12 - year - old boys said they found the bomb last week in a yard near the school in Okinawa , where residents still unearth hundreds of dud explosives six decades after the war .
" We immediately realised the blasting fuse had come off the bombshell , " said Yoshiyasu Henzan , vice principal of Shonan elementary school .
" We reported it to police through the local education board .
" The children apparently thought the bomb would be good study material at school , " he said , adding that the school has given a special class in peace studies for students .
The US - made bombshell of about 30 centimetres in length was swiftly taken away by the Japanese bomb - disposal squad , the teacher said .
Okinawa was the bloodiest battle of the Pacific war , with US forces unleashing an 83 - day air and amphibious assault dubbed the " Typhoon of Steel " by locals .
Some 190,000 Japanese died , half of them Okinawan civilians .
Earlier this month , an Okinawan resident working on an underground water pipe was severely injured in the face when another World War II bomb went off .
The bomb - disposal squad of the Japanese military unearthed 445 bombs in Okinawa in just two weeks after the explosion , the local Ryukyu Shimpo daily reported .

The Taleban say they will release all prisoners they are holding Taleban insurgents in the troubled north - western Swat valley of Pakistan have announced an indefinite ceasefire .
The announcement follows a deal struck last week between a radical cleric and authorities that brings Sharia law in return for an end to the insurgency .
The Taleban have been assessing that deal and Tuesday 's move followed a meeting held by the group 's leader in the region , Maulana Fazlullah .
The scenic valley of Swat has long been blighted by militant violence .
The latest truce announcement comes a day after militants in Bajaur district called a unilateral ceasefire with security forces there .
The government responded on Tuesday by ceasing military operations in Bajaur for four days .
' Goodwill gesture ' " Today the shura [ consultative council ] met under Maulana Fazlullah and decided to hold a ceasefire for an indefinite period , " Taleban spokesman in Swat , Muslim Khan , was quoted by the news agency AFP as saying .
" We are releasing all prisoners unconditionally .
Today we released four paramilitary soldiers and we will release all security personnel in our custody as a goodwill gesture , " he said .
A previous 10 - day truce announced by the militants was set to expire on Wednesday .
Will Sharia law bring order ?
Diary of Swat schoolgirl
The announcement comes a day after the army confirmed it was halting military operations in the region , although not leaving .
The cleric , Sufi Mohammad , who is also Maulana Fazlullah 's father - in - law , has been mediating between the government and the militants .
On Monday , he urged the militants to end the patrolling of streets and to allow the government to set up the Islamic courts they have been fighting for .
Swat has been the scene of bloody clashes between militants and government forces since November 2007 .
More than 1,000 civilians have died in shelling by the army or from beheadings sanctioned by the Taleban .
Thousands more have been displaced .
The Taleban have also destroyed nearly 200 schools , most of them for girls , during a sustained campaign against secular education in Swat .
An earlier peace agreement broke down in mid-2008 .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says there is concern that this peace deal will also not last , with some analysts believing the Taleban want to control territory , not just amend the legal system .
Earlier this month , the North West Frontier Province government signed an agreement with Sufi Mohammad 's proscribed Tanzim - e - Nifaz - e - Shariat Mohammadi ( TNSM ) for the implementation of a Sharia justice system in Swat .
Sufi Mohammad , who opposes militancy , led thousands of TNSM workers into Swat to set up a peace camp there and to start talks with Maulana Fazlullah .
Preconditions
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan , who was recently in Swat , says the militants are now likely to close their checkpoints in the region as the first step towards the new justice system .
The Pakistan army 's battle in Swat since 2007 has been bloody On Monday , the TNSM announced 10 preconditions for its successful implementation .
These included the evacuation of all schools and hospital buildings by the army and an end to all security checks that hamper the movement of people .
The TNSM has called on the government to station troops away from civilian areas .
It urged the government to compensate families that suffered human and material losses and called on thousands of displaced people to return to their homes .
The ceasefire moves in Swat have been echoed in Bajaur .
However , the unilateral truce called by the Taleban there follows a series of strategic gains by the military .
On Tuesday , local government official Shafirullah Khan told AFP the security forces would observe a four - day ceasefire across Bajaur in response .
A senior security official confirmed the move , saying it was a " goodwill gesture " .
Correspondents say the truce deals have caused disquiet in the US and the issue will be high on the agenda as Pakistan 's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and army chief Ashfaq Pervez Kayani meet US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and joint Pakistan - Afghan envoy Richard Hobrooke in Washington this week .

MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif .
GOOGLE recently set the blogosphere abuzz by announcing that it was pulling the plug on several products .
The victims included Lively , a virtual world that was Google ’s answer to Second Life ; Dodgeball , a cellphone service aimed at young bar - hoppers who wanted to let their friends know where they were hanging out ; Catalog Search , which scanned paper product catalogs so they could be searched online ; and Notebook , a simple tool that allowed people to take notes on Web sites they had visited .
Google also said it would stop actively developing Jaiku , a microblogging service similar to Twitter , and instead turn it over to its users as an open - source project they could tinker with as they wished .
What ’s that , you say ?
You do n’t care ?
You could n’t tell a Jaiku from a haiku , and the last time you thought about dodgeball was in elementary school gym class ?

Andy Card has some serious nerve .
When I heard he criticized Barack Obama for not wearing a suit coat in the Oval Office , I dismissed it without a second thought .
Formal dress codes seem to me to be the product of little minds ; anyone who thinks good work ca n’t be done in casual or business casual clothes needs to visit Silicon Valley .
And anyone who thinks that a building or space can be disrespected by whatever clothes are worn within it needs to get over themselves .
But then I actually read Card ’s comments .
Get a load of this guy :
“ The Oval Office symbolizes … the Constitution , the hopes and dreams , and I ’m going to say democracy .
And when you have a dress code in the Supreme Court and a dress code on the floor of the Senate , floor of the House , I think it ’s appropriate to have an expectation that there will be a dress code that respects the office of the President . ”
Oh , I see .
By not wearing a jacket in the Oval Office , Barack Obama disrespects the Constitution .
Extraordinary rendition , black sites , torture , indefinite detention , warrantless wiretapping and wholesale data collection on American citizens — none of these things gave Andy Card pause .
For five years , he cheerfully served a president who used the Constitution like an inconvenience , but that joker Obama better put on a damn coat or our democratic system is suddenly in peril .
I mean , how uppity can Obama get , right ?
What unctuous crap .
And by the way , here ’s a photo collection of presidents , including Mr. Dress Code himself , George W. Bush , wearing shirtsleeves in the Oval Office .
An immutable object never changes .
You can bet your program on it .
As I explained in my previous post , the same is not true for const objects ( or readonly objects , in dialects of Java ) .
They may be changed through mutable aliases .
An immutable object has no mutable aliases .
Ever !
Small print : this guarantee is predicated on the programmer not overriding the type system with casts and other escape mechanisms .
To my knowledge , immutability is currently available in the D programming language and in a Java dialect called IGJ ( Immutability Generic Java ) .
It is the default in functional languages .
The closest you can get to immutability in C++ is by using const as a storage class :
const double pi = 3.141592 ; const char ERRORMSG [ ] =
" Your bank went belly up . " ;
Here , the value of pi or ERRORMSG is guaranteed to never change .
Global or static immutable values can be used at compile time ( for instance as labels in a switch statement ) .
Creating Immutable Objects
Defining immutable numbers , arrays , or POD structs is pretty straightforward .
But what about more complex objects that do n’t have static initializers ?
How do you create an immutable linked list ?
In functional languages , lists are treated as built - in types ; like arrays in general purpose languages .
They can be statically initialized .
But in C++ or Java the creation of a list involves memory allocations and reference manipulation .
Since , by definition , we can’t manipulate an immutable list , it seems like we can never create one !
How about relaxing the constraints a little to allow mutation inside the constructor of an immutable object .
Here ’s a hypothetical example of a list in D ( the current D compiler does n’t fully implement immutability , so my examples are written in pseudo - D ) :
class IntList { public : // default constructor this ( ) {} // _head is default - initialized to null // one element constructor this ( int i ) { _head = new IntLink ( i ) ; // mutates _head } private : IntLink _head ; } // will this work ?
immutable IntList oneList= new immutable IntList ( 1 ) ;
There is a significant problem with this solution .
If this is not considered immutable inside the constructor then there is no guarantee that a mutable reference to this or any of its subobjects wo n’t escape its scope .
Consider this example :
IntLink globalLink ; // mutable !
IntList . this( int i ) { _head = new IntLink ( i ) ; globalLink = _head ; // escape ! } immutable IntList immList= new immutable IntList ( 1 ) ; globalLink.setValue( 2 ) ; // mutates immList !
Here , an immutable object immList has been mutated through an alias globalLink .
We ca n’t allow this !
It ’s true that a compiler could perform escape analysis on the constructor of IntList , provided it has access to its source code ; which might not always be true when it ’s compiling the statement that creates the immutable object .
After all , class IntList might be implemented in a third - party library .
In the absence of source code , the only other possibility is to include immutability information in the type signature of the constructor .
When an immutable object is created , the compiler would use an immutable constructor , and it would fail if one did n’t exist .
Conversely , an immutable constructor would not compile if it allowed a mutable reference to escape .
This bad code would not compile :
IntList . this( int i ) immutable { _head = new IntLink ( i ) ; globalLink = _head ; // error ! }
Of course , no mutable methods may be called from inside an immutable constructor–they could n’t guarantee the non-escape of mutable aliases .
This solution works , even if it ’s not perfect .
It often leads to code duplication ( the immutable constructor being identical to the mutable one , as in the IntList example ) .
Moreover , it prevents some forms of refactoring .
Even though , inside an immutable constructor , you may initialize an object ’s fields , you ca n’t delegate this task to a ( perforce immutable ) method of the object .
Assignment is not the same as Mutation
The key to immutable construction is the observation that , when constructing an immutable object , it ’s okay to assign the object ’s fields but not to mutate them .
During construction only such “ shallow ” mutation should be possible .
In my example , the assignment to _head is okay , but the mutation of the IntLink object attached to it should be prohibited .
Indeed , I do n’t need to mutate the head link once it ’s constructed .
Of course the construction of an immutable IntLink follows the same rules .
Here ’s the relevant code :
class IntLink { this ( int i ) immutable { // _next is default - initialized to null _val = i ; // field assignment } int _val ; IntLink _next ; }
With this understanding , it ’s actually possible to minimize code duplication .
To this end , IGJ introduces a new type modifier , AssignFields .
A constructor or a method that performs no other mutation but field assignment may be declared AssignFields .
Since AssignFields methods and AssignFields constructors can also be used in mutable contexts , they do n’t have to be duplicated .
Expanding on the above example :
class IntLink { this ( int i ) assignfields { // _next is default - initialized to null SetValue( i ) ; //
Ok : it 's an assignfields method } void SetValue ( int i ) assignfields { _val = i ; // field assignment } int _val ; IntLink _next ; }
As you can see , I was even able to refactor the part of the constructor that does the assignment to _val .
I can now use the same constructor in both , mutable and immutable , contexts .
The SetValue method can only be called in a mutable or assignfields context .
immutable IntLink iLink = new immutable IntLink ( 1 ) ; IntLink m Link = new IntLink ( 2 ) ; mLink.SetValue( 3 ) ;
Subtyping relationships
It is okay to pass an immutable object to a function that expects a const object .
After all , such a function will not mutate the object .
If a reference to the object escapes the function , it can only be a const reference .
And again , const reference cannot be used to mutate the object , so we ’re fine .
The compiler will allow this subsumption if we establish that immutable is a subtype of const ( more precisely , for any type T , immutable T is a subtype of const T ) .
This is very similar to the compiler allowing the passing a derived class object to a function that accepts a base class objects –the Liskov substitution principle .
The full subtyping hierarchy between various mutability annotations is as follows :
immutable is a subtype of const :
You can pass an immutable object to a function taking a const argument .
assignfields is a subtype of const :
You can call a const method from an assignfields method ( subsumption of this ) .
) . mutable is a subtype of assignfields .
You can call an assignfields method on a mutable object ( as in mLink. SetValue ( ) ) .
Because of transitivity , mutable is also a subtype of const .
You can pass a mutable object to a function that takes a const argument ( you do it in C++ without much thinking ) .
Conclusion
There is some advantage to introducing yet another type modifier , assignfields , to smooth out the process of constructing immutable objects .
On the other hand , is it worth additional complexity ?
How often does one construct non-trivial immutable objects ?
If it ’s not a common programming pattern then maybe we can live with current restrictions and some code duplication .
We still have very little experience in using immutable in D , so we might have to wait and see .

Beam me up : Scientists left baffled as mysterious columns of coloured light appear in the night skies
These stunning images show mysterious columns of light streaming into the sky above the town of Sigulda in Latvia at the end of last month .
Taken by designer Aigar Truhins with a standard digital camera , the photographs have prompted excited online discussions among amateur astronomists all over the internet .
' My son exclaimed , ' The aliens are coming ! ''
Truhins was quoted as saying .
Beam me up : Mysterious columns of light stream into the air above the town of Sigulda
The mysterious lights prompted excited discussion on the internet
' It certainly looked that way , ' he added .
But experts are agreed there may be a more prosaic explanation - ice crystals in the air .
The air above the town was notably cold and filled with suspended ice crystals .
It is believed that the columns were formed by those reflecting light from the bright streetlamps and other lights on the ground - beaming it back downwards again .
Skies all over Europe have been filled with such natural phenomena during the cold snap of recent weeks .
But finally the experts agreed on one explanation ...
The lights were said to be a reflection caused by the light from streetlamps on the ground hitting ice crystals suspended in the cold air
Scientists at the website spaceweather .com said : ' Truhin ’s pillars are not the ordinary kind .
Even eading experts in atmospheric optics can’t quite figure them out
' These pillars are mysterious .
They have unexplained curved tops and even curved arcs coming from their base .

Hello ,
As far as I know , at the origin Yn(x ) is singular .
Consequently , the result you get for x=0 is wrong anyway .
There is a recursion relation for J , n/xJn=1/2( Jn - 1 + Jn+1 ) , so once
you have calculated two Jn=0, 1 you can reuse these to calculate the Jn n>1
Use M_PI instead of your own definition .
Hope this helps .

Space may be the final frontier , but scientists who recently discovered a hidden forest in Mozambique show the uncharted can still be under our noses .
BirdLife were part of a team of scientists who used Google Earth to identify a remote patch of pristine forest .
An expedition to the site discovered new species of butterfly and snake , along with seven Globally Threatened birds .
The team were browsing Google Earth – freely available software providing global satellite photography – to search for potential wildlife hotspots .
A nearby road provided the first glimpses of a wooded mountain topped by bare rock .
However , only by using Google Earth could the scientists observe the extent of woodland on the other side of the peak .
This was later discovered to be the locally known , but unmapped , Mount Mabu .
Scientific collections and literature also failed to shed light on the area .
“ This is potentially the biggest area of medium - altitude forest I ’m aware of in southern Africa , yet it was not on the map ” , related Jonathan Timberlake from the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew ( RBG Kew ) , who led the expedition .
“ Most Mozambicans would not even have recognised the name Mount Mabu . ”
Following scoping trips , a team of 28 experts from the UK , Mozambique , Malawi , Tanzania , Belgium , Ireland , and Switzerland ventured into it last autumn .
They included scientists from BirdLife .
The group was able to stay in an abandoned tea estate where the road ended , but had to hike the last few kilometres into the forest to set up camp .
They had to contend with steep terrain and dense vegetation .
Inside , they found a wealth of wildlife , including three new species of butterfly and an undiscovered species of adder .
The scientists believe there are at least two novel species of plant and perhaps more new insects to identify .
They took home over 500 samples .
“ The phenomenal diversity is just mind - boggling ” , exclaimed Jonathan Timberlake .
Despite civil war from 1975 to 1992 ravaging parts of Mozambique , the landscape was found virtually untouched .
The site also proved to be important for birds , especially Endangered Thyolo Alethe Alethe choloensis , which is common throughout .
“ This may be the most important population of Thyolo Alethe known ” , remarked Dr Lincoln Fishpool , BirdLife ’s Global IBA Co-ordinator , who joined the expedition .
“ At other sites , forest is rapidly being lost or much of the habitat is sub-optimal ” .
There were six other Globally Threatened birds among the 126 species identified .
Of these , Vulnerable Swynnerton 's Robin Swynnertonia swynnertoni is particularly significant - bridging a large gap between known populations .
Mozambique ’s only endemic species , Near Threatened Namuli Apalis Apalis lynesi , was also seen .
This was the first record of it away from nearby Mount Namuli .
Conserving Mount Mabu is now a priority .
The forest ’s value as a refuge to villagers during the war has thus far helped to protect it , along with poor access and ignorance of its existence .
However local people are returning to the area and Mozambique ’s economy is booming .
There is a risk the forest will come under pressure to be cut for wood or burnt for crop space .
RBG
Kew is working to protect the forest , as part of ongoing efforts with the Mozambique government .
BirdLife has plans to recognise it as an Important Bird Area ( IBA ) , “ Mount Mabu effortlessly qualifies as an IBA ” , said Dr Fishpool .
Ground - level measures could be most effective conservation for the immediate future : “ Remoteness is currently its best protection .
We hope to work alongside the local tea-estate managers who are conservation - sympathetic and want to maintain the status quo of the forest ” .
As for Google Earth , Jonathan Timberlake says the digital imagery has helped scientists realise more about the world .
It may reveal further unnoticed pockets of diversity , especially in areas like Mozambique or Papua New Guinea .
“ We can not say we have discovered all the biodiversity areas in the world ” .
The expedition was led by RBG Kew and involved scientists from the Mozambique Agronomic Research Institute and the Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust in Malawi , as well as BirdLife International .
It was funded by the Darwin Initiative .
Budget or not , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is all set to send layoff notices ( warnings ) to 20,000 state workers .
According to the Sacramento Bee , " those with the least seniority among the approximately 100,000 state workers employed at General Fund units , " will get the notice come tomorrow morning .
" In the absence of a budget , the governor has the responsibility to realize savings any way he can , " said Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear , defending Arnold 's menacing , mass layoff plan .
While he has n't said exactly how many notices will actually result in layoffs ( we going to go ahead and guess most of them ) , 2,000 layoffs would " save an estimated $ 150 million , according to the Legislative Analyst 's Office . "
Media ACTRA : We Don't Understand the Internet By Ryan McGreal
Published February 19 , 2009
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) opened hearings today on whether to regulate online content the way radio and television content is currently regulated .
The first presenter was Richard Hardacre , national president of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema Television and Radio Artists ( ACTRA ) , the union representing 21,000 Canadian actors and other media artists .
Hardacre argued that Canadian online media should be have to follow the same content rules as television and radio .
Hardacre explained :
This is a battle for the future .
What we want is a place for Canadian storytellers and our stories .
We want to share our talents with Canadians and with global audiences .
We need to get it right now .
Tomorrow is too late .
Huh ?
There has never been a better time for " Canadian storytellers and our stories " .
The original impetus for CanCon rules was based on the fact that traditional broadcast media are inherently scarce .
There are only so many channels , and only so many people who can afford broadcast licences and radio transmitters .
In that environment of scarcity , it made sense to ensure that at least a certain proportion of the bandwidth be reserved for Canadian content - TV shows , radio programs , songs , whatever - so that they at least had a chance to be heard in a market that would otherwise be dominated and monopolized by content from the ( much larger ) American media conglomerates .
However , the internet - the medium in which online content is published and distributed - is characterized not by scarcity but by abundance .
In practical terms , there is no limit to the number of websites , and the cost of producing and publishing content has collapsed .
Anyone can produce content , and anyone can publish it .
Just as important , that content has never been more findable .
The extremely clever indexing systems we content consumers have available to use ( Google and the other search engines ) mean we can easily find any content using any dynamic combination of keywords .
I just can't make sense of this argument from Colin Mochrie , a comedian with This Hour has 22 Minutes :
The space for content is practically endless ; however , being endless , content can get easily lost .
So how do we make sure Canadians can find their own content ? ...
When I star in a movie or a TV show , I do it because I want to work , I want people to see the show , to experience it .
They can't do that if they are n't given the choice .
I can only come up with two possibilities : either Mochrie , Hardacre and ACTRA simply do n't understand how the internet works ; or they recognize that the end of scarcity also means the end of their special positions of privilege as employees of traditional content publishers and have chosen to place their professional interests ahead of the public interest .

More than £ 1 m is to be spent over the next three years on saving Scotland 's red squirrels and protecting routes into their northern strongholds .
The number or reds has been in decline since the arrival of the grey squirrel from North America in the 19th Century .
Greys compete with reds for food and can also carry the squirrel pox virus , which can kill reds in about 14 days .
There are currently about 121,000 red squirrels in Scotland and the country is home to 75 % of the UK 's reds .
There are thought to be between 200,000 and 300,000 greys in Scotland .
The £ 1.3 m Saving Scotland 's Red Squirrels ( SSRS ) project has been launched in Dunkeld , Perthshire .
See a map of shifting red and grey squirrel territories
It will develop habitats in which the red squirrel can flourish but will also try to control the greys , which will involve killing them .
The Scottish Wildlife Trust ( SWT ) , Scottish Natural Heritage ( SNH ) , Forestry Commission Scotland ( FCS ) , and the Scottish Rural Property and Business Association ( SRPBA ) are involved in the project .
Mike Russell , speaking while he was still environment minister , said : " The red squirrel is one of our most beautiful and valuable native species .
Therefore its loss would be absolutely unforgiveable .
" Saving Scotland 's Red Squirrels is a true partnership organisation and I am hopeful that its activity will see the red squirrels able to thrive once again in this country and ensure that future generations are able to enjoy them . "

Ron McDonald , from SNH , said that grey squirrel control would be focussed on the key routes being used by grey squirrels to spread north .
" Greys have already displaced red squirrels from most of England , Wales and Scotland 's central belt , but much of the north still remains grey - free , " he said .
" With sightings of greys becoming more frequent in northern Perthshire and Angus , and a population of grey squirrels already established in Aberdeen , it is imperative that we act quickly to protect red squirrels north of the central belt and prevent the grey 's further migration . "
Stuart Brooks , from SWT , added : " I can understand and empathise with those people who do not like the prospect of killing wild animals , but it is disingenuous to say that there are viable alternative solutions to saving the red squirrel in Scotland .
" Work is under way on a vaccine for squirrel pox but it is not around the corner and habitat improvements are a key component of our longer - term strategy .
" To do nothing now will certainly consign our native squirrel to a painful and lingering death . "
The SSRS project is expected to start work properly in April .

In Bill O'Reilly 's new Talking Points Memo he uses Fox News ' ratings to justify his ludicrous position that America thinks they are the only fair and balanced news outlet in town and the other networks are sucking up to Obama 's agenda .
My God , since Barack Obama became President , O'Reilly is only getting nuttier .
The lunatic fringe will do everything they can to smear Obama because they fear his success tremendously .
O'Reilly is worried about the " nanny state , " a typical right - wing term , but whatever solutions Obama is implementing it's all because conservatism was such a failure .
He reads off the FOX lineup and touts the diversity they have .
Alan Colmes is no longer even host of a Fox show ....
Glenn Beck , Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity and Greta , " the Sarah Palin Stalker , " make up most of their prime time coverage .
It 's filled with anti-Obama , pro-Republican propaganda .
Hey Bill , everybody knows it .
Give up with this " Man of La Mancha " act .
He also believes Barack Obama 's popularity is diminishing because people are scared over the state of the economy .
In a new Gallup poll , President Obama 's approval ratings just went higher .
But O'Reilly says that while Obama is popular , it 's still not fanatical .
What does that mean ?
Who would want a fanatical relationship with the president ?
I do remember members of the religious right believing George Bush was the Messiah .
President Obama has an incredible amount of support from the American people , and for Bill O'Reilly to justify his position by claiming that Fox News ' solid recent ratings means that Obama is somehow slipping in the minds of the American people is pure nonsense .
Bill O'Reilly is becoming more and more ludicrous every day .
He blames himself for not being on top of the housing bubble as a journalist .
Yet he always tells his audiences that he had a PDA either .
As most rational people know , we can expect interest in politics to rise doing a presidential election .
So it was not surprising that MSNBC and CNN trounced Fox news in the months leading up to November 4 .
What we have now is a typical cycle of average American families returning to the struggles of their daily life .
What the ratings show is that Fox News has not lost their wingnut base .
Congratulations to Rupert Murdoch , who by the way has just lost billions of dollars .
But Bill O'Reilly will never tell you that .
Here 's more of his drivel from his column on BillO 's website : " The End of Obama - Mania " .
Right .
BY all accounts , Tatum T. Bass seemed like the quintessential Miss Porter ’s girl .
She was pretty , popular and athletic , running track for the school even before track became an official school sport .
She had good grades and consistently made the honor roll .
Then , somewhere along the line , everything unraveled .
By her own admission , she skipped classes and cheated on an art history test .
And while the school cited those transgressions when it expelled Miss Bass in November , her side of the story is much darker : in a lawsuit against Miss Porter ’s , Miss Bass says she was driven to a nervous breakdown by constant harassment from a secret society of girls who call themselves the Oprichniki , taking their nickname from a 16th - century Russian torture squad .
Although students are often expelled from elite boarding schools , seldom do they sue .
And while neither she nor the school will discuss the case , her complaint offers a tantalizing window into a world that has been glamorized and vilified by everything from “ The Official Preppy Handbook ” to “ Gossip Girl . ”
As two pictures emerge in this case , the question is : how much of this world really existed ?
Parts of Miss Bass ’s story seem fairly straightforward .
In the fall of 2005 , she left her parents ’ home for Farmington , Conn. , and the bucolic campus of Miss Porter ’s , an all - girls boarding school best known for its roster of illustrious graduates : Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , Gloria Vanderbilt , Dorothy Walker Bush and many others .

Yes , times are tough .
The big banks are on life support .
Home prices are in the pits .
The stock market 's tanked .
Unemployment 's way , way up .
And … uh - oh .
How are you doing ?
What about your home ?
Your investments ?
Your job ?
How safe is it ?
What 's the worst that can happen to you ?
We put that question to the expert -- Joshua Piven , author of the best - selling " Worst - Case Scenario Survival Handbook " series .
His tongue - in - cheek answer is not pretty : " You lose your job , you run out of savings or a safety net , have to sell [ your ] home , it 's a down market and you can't sell your house , you move , pull the kids out of school , it 's not easy to get another job and your whole lifestyle has to change .
" Then there 's homelessness , maybe spiraling alcoholism , and then living on the side of the train tracks . "
Ugh .
More people are facing an extended period of joblessness and the potential financial difficulties that go along with it .
Unemployment hit 7.6 % last month , with 11.6 million people out of work , and the number of people experiencing joblessness for more than six months has continued to increase , growing to more than 2.6 million in January , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
As jobless rates go up , duration usually follows , says Katharine Abraham , a University of Maryland economist .
With the Federal Reserve forecasting that the unemployment rate could hit 8.8 % this year , the number of people unemployed for longer stretches of time is expected to increase as well .
Conventional wisdom has long called for you to stash away up to six months of living expenses to carry you through a financial emergency or job loss .
But with more job hunts lasting longer than half a year , backup funds can dwindle , and you will have to make more and more tough financial choices .
" It may be painful to think about bad things happening , but you have to make sure you are budgeting appropriately and living below your means , " says Liz Davidson , CEO of Financial Finesse , a financial - education firm .
Here are some things to keep in mind , starting now :
While You 're Working
Double that emergency fund .
One way to do this is by making minimum payments on your credit cards .
That runs counter to the usual advice , but for those worried about losing a job , these are n't usual times .
Take the remaining money you would use to pay off the whole bill and stash it in a money - market or high - interest savings account , suggests June Walbert , a financial planner with USAA , which mainly serves military members and their families .
Consider downsizing your living quarters .
For example , after business began to slow at Saxon Anderson 's teeth - whitening kiosk at a Los Angeles area mall , the 26 - year - old downgraded from a nice single apartment to a house with five roommates .
Since it 's easier to get credit while you 're employed , look into opening another credit card or a home - equity line of credit as a precaution in case money becomes hard to access if you are unemployed .
But use this credit only as a last resort .
When the Word Comes Down
File for unemployment benefits immediately , says Linda Robertson , a senior financial planner with Financial Finesse .
A severance package from your employer could delay your eligibility , but " so many of the unemployment offices are overwhelmed right now and are behind , " she says .
Call your landlord or lender if your layoff results in immediate financial instability .
Ask about deferred - payment plans for rent or find out if your lender offers programs to restructure any loans , says Ms. Robertson .
If you 're financially stable , you may still want to alert your landlord or lender to your employment situation in case you have trouble making future payments .
Look into all your health - insurance options .
The government made some modifications to the federal COBRA law , which allows people to extend their previous coverage , but know that this is n't always the most affordable plan .
Young and healthy ?
A high - deductible plan might still be more affordable .
The First Six Months
Develop a bare - bones budget -- and stick to it -- so your severance or emergency funds will last as long as possible .
Prioritize your debts .
When the bills come , pay the big ones -- such as rent or mortgage , utilities and car payments -- before making minimum payments on your credit cards , suggests Ms. Robertson .
If money starts getting tight , consider further downsizing your home or selling any nonessential cars , electronics , jewelry or other valuables , says Dan Houston , president of retirement and investor services at Principal Financial Group .
Six Months and Beyond
De-invest .
Start by looking for securities you might liquidate in nonretirement accounts .
Potential tax write - offs could help make the losses easier to stomach .
" If they 've got a capital loss , they can write that off against any gains , " says Ms. Robertson .
" Or they can write off up to $ 3,000 of a capital loss against any other income . "
Then tap your Roth IRA .
Money grows tax - free in these retirement accounts , and you can usually withdraw contributions with no tax liability .
" That should be one of your measures of last resort , because we want that money to remain in that tax shelter , " says Ms. Walbert .
Keep your hands off your traditional IRA or 401 ( k ) until the very last moment .
" You 'll not only have to pay taxes on those withdrawals , but you 'll also pay penalties , " says Mr. Houston .
" You 'll lose all of the compounding interest and yield .
Plus , the probability of you replacing those dollars down the road is pretty remote , since the tendency for most is to spend instead of replace . "

Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors .
Dilbert is holding an ice cream cone .
Dilbert says , " I can remember when these were only fifteen cents . "
Dilbert continues , " But I 'm really dating myself now . . . "
Dogbert says , " Well , it 's not as if anybody else would date you . "
There are many movie scene lists out there that use different subject matter or situations to define the list .
I was surprised that no one had ever put one together involving swimming pools so I thought I would give it a try .
It should be noted that I tried to stay away from films where swimming pools were the main focus of the movie .
So without further ado here are 10 movies with memorable swimming pool scenes .
I ’m sure you will not be shy to share your favorite pool scenes in the movies in the comments section .
10 Harold and Maude 1971 , Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon
This is a terrific movie about a 19 year old young man named Harold ( played by Bud Cort ) who develops a relationship with a woman named Maude in her late 70s ( played by Ruth Gordon . )
Harold fakes his suicide numerous times throughout the movie in a desperate attempt for his mother ’s attention .
In this scene we see Harold ’s mom swim right past him during another one of his fake suicides .
Interesting Fact : Harold and Maude is number 45 on the American Film Institute ’s list of 100 Funniest Movies of all time and was also a play on Broadway .
9 Mommy Dearest 1981 , Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford
Faye Dunaway ’s over the top performance as Joan Crawford is evident in this pool scene as she easily beats her daughter in a swimming - pool race and then brags about her victory by proclaiming “ You lost again ” .
She then becomes enraged at her daughter when she reacts with childish disappointment .
Interesting Fact : Joan Crawford once said in an interview in the early 1970s that of the current young actresses only Faye Dunaway had “ what it takes ” to be a true star .
The movie Mommy Dearest ended up damaging Dunaway ’s career , and Dunaway later stated that she wished she had never appeared in it .
8 National Lampoon ’s Vacation 1983 , Chevy Chase and Christie Brinkley
Who can forget this famous pool scene as Chevy Chase and the sexy Christie Brinkley whom he sees throughout the entire vacation in different spots along the way end up skinny dipping together ?
The pool scene starts about 2/3s into this clip .
Interesting Fact : Brinkley was never actually nude in the film , though it was reported the producers hoped she would be .
Christie Brinkley recently recreated this famous swimming pool scene with Chevy Chase for a DirecTV commercial .
7 Fast Times at Ridgemont High 1982 , Phoebe Cates and Judge Reinhold
This film has made it into the listverse lists 3 times .
Top 15 Movies about High School , Top 10 Badass Druggies in Movies , and Top 15 Iconic Teen Movies .
I had no choice but to include it in this list as well .
This famous pool scene starts after Reinhold ’s character Brad arrives back home and hits the bathroom after a long hard day at Captain Hook ’s Fish and Chips .
Phoebe Cates then catches his eye through the bathroom window .
Interesting Fact : Phoebe Cates was initially reluctant to go through with her character ’s pool side topless scene because she thought the neighbors might be spying on the set from the surrounding rooftops .
Not that it ’s like the birth place of William Shakespeare or anything but according to the address given in Wikipedia and thanks to Google street maps you can see the front of the house that was used for the pool scene here .
6 Meet The Parents 2000 , Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro
This is a very funny pool scene where Gaylord Focker played by Ben Stiller is having a bad game at a pool volleyball game .
Desperately trying to impress his girl friends parents and their friends he overcompensates and ends up spiking the ball into the face of the bride to be .
Interesting Fact :
At one time Jim Carrey was slated to star as the lead and even contributed to the screenplay , such as the main character being named ‘ Focker ’ .
The MPAA would not allow the name ‘ Focker ’ unless the film makers could find an actual person with that surname .
5 Back to School 1986 , Rodney Dangerfield
This is a very funny film but you have to be a Dangerfield fan to enjoy it .
Rodney has some classic one - liners throughout the movie .
In this pool scene Dangerfield ’s character Thornton Melon performs his famous “ Triple Lindy . ”
Interesting Fact :
The movie was filmed at the University of Wisconsin - Madison which was called Grand Lakes University in the movie .
However the swim stadium scenes were filmed at a Country Club in the City of Industry , about 25 miles southeast of Hollywood , California .
4 Bathing Beauty 1944 , Esther Williams
You ca n’t have a top 10 memorable swimming pool movie list and not include Esther Williams .
This grand water ballet became famous and is the scene most people associate with her .
This was also her first staring role .
Interesting Fact :
The movie was initially to be titled “ The Co - Ed ” with Red Skelton having top billing .
However , once MGM executives watched the first cut of the film , they realized that Esther Williams ’ role should be showcased more and was then changed to “ Bathing Beauty ” ,
3 It ’s a wonderful Life 1946 , James Stewart and Donna Reed
“ Did you know there ’s a swimming pool under this floor ?
And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up ?
And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack ? ”
Interesting Fact :
The swimming pool used during this famous scene is located at Beverly Hills High School and is still in operation .
Director Frank Capra agreed to pay a bonus of $ 25 to any teen willing to jump into the pool on cue during the scene ’s memorable climax .
2 Caddy Shack 1980 , Bill Murray
If you hear the words Baby Ruth candy bar and swimming pool in the same sentence and you do n’t smile a little you probably did not see this movie or have no sense of humor .
This scene contains around 2 seconds of nudity .
Interesting Fact :
The famous pool scene was filmed at Plantation Country Club in Plantation , Florida and was based on a real - life incident at Brian Doyle - Murray ’s ( one of the movies writers ) high school .
1 The Graduate 1967 , Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft
Not only is this a great pool scene but it ’s also a great movie .
This memorable pool scene starts with the song “ Sound of Silence ” ( not quite half way through this clip )
Make sure you watch this scene through the end of the second Simon & Garfunkel song ( “ April Come She Will ” ) where Benjamin ( Dustin Hoffman ) re-enters the pool and is looking up from his raft at the Robinsons .
Interesting Fact : The “ Taft Hotel ” scenes in this movie were filmed at the famed Ambassador Hotel , the same hotel in which U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate Robert Kennedy was assassinated less than six months after the film ’s release .
+ Something ’s Got to Give 1962 , Marilyn Monroe
A previous list called “ Top 10 Great Movies That Were Never Finished ” showed the fist 10 minutes of this unfinished film .
This clip shows the now famous swimming pool scene that was shot just before Monroe was fired from the movie which caused the film to be cancelled .
Monroe died just a few months after this raw studio footage was taken .
Notable Omissions : The Thrill of It All , The Last Picture Show , Cocoon , Drowning By Numbers
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration intends to provide some $ 900 million to help rebuild Gaza after the Israeli incursion that ended last month , administration officials said Monday .
In an early sign of how the administration plans to deal with Hamas , the militant Islamist group that controls Gaza , an official said that the aid would not go to Hamas but that it would be funneled through nongovernmental organizations .
By seeking to aid Gazans but not Hamas , the administration is following the lead of the Bush administration , which sent money to Gaza through nongovernmental organizations .
In December , it said it would give $ 85 million to the United Nations agency that provides aid to Palestinian refugees in the West Bank , Gaza , Jordan , Lebanon and Syria .
The United States considers Hamas a terrorist organization , and the Bush administration refused to have any formal dealings with the group .
BP gas stations are making vast improvements to its locations all across North America in an attempt to transform the company into a recognizable " one - stop shop " for travelers .
For the modern patron , this means getting WiFi access free of charge .
Of course , BP does have a hidden agenda when offering free Internet service : entice people to stay for longer periods of time in the hopes of checking out the other services the station has to offer .
Over 90 % of all BP locations will be given major upgrades in the service department , including on - site restaurants , video arcades and a well - stocked convenience store .
( Source : usatoday.com )
WiFi providers in some locations charge a set price for hourly usage .
For the consumer , this marks a tremendous waste of money if the service is required for only a few short minutes .
BP hopes that people will stop to use the Internet access free of charge for a short period of time and fill - up their tanks and stomachs all in one location .
Travelers ( and local businesses looking to make a few extra bucks ) will be happy to find online advertisements suggesting places to visit and activities to enjoy while in the area .
BP owners can also use these advertisements to suggest in - store sale items , DVDs and snacks .
( Source : nytimes.com )
One potential problem , of course , is attracting deadbeats who sit around surfing all day without spending a dime .
BP representatives remain unfazed at this potential situation .
One of the reasons for this may be because attracting these types of people ( at least in the short - run ) could prove to have a positive effect on the nature of the service .
When travelers come into a BP gas station and see others already using the free WiFi service , the uncomfortable vibe associated with sitting around and surfing the Internet in a gas station will soon be alleviated .
Will the trend catch on ?
Only time will tell .

It is the first conviction against the former foreign minister and deputy PM Tariq Aziz , for many years the public face of Saddam Hussein 's Iraqi regime , has been jailed for 15 years for his role in the execution of 42 merchants .
Aziz had denied any role in the summary trials of the men accused in 1992 of profiteering during economic sanctions .
Two of Saddam Hussein's half - brothers were also found guilty and sentenced to death by a court in Baghdad .
Another top official , Ali Hassan al - Majid - commonly known as Chemical Ali - was jailed for 15 years .
Two other Iraqi officials were jailed for six and 15 years , while a former governor of the Iraqi central bank was acquitted .
Although Aziz was a world - renowned politician in his time , the BBC's Mike Sergeant in Baghdad says this trial is not viewed by Iraqis as a big political event ' Poor health ' TARIQ AZIZ Born in 1936 , near Mosul , northern Iraq Studied English literature and became a journalist
The most senior Christian in the toppled regime Enlisted US support for war on Iran Met US President Ronald Reagan at the White House in 1984 In US custody since April 2003
Public face of Saddam regime Profile : Tariq Aziz
This is Tariq Aziz 's first conviction in the controversial Iraqi High Tribunal process , which has been criticised by human rights groups on a number of counts .
He could also have received a death penalty .
Last week he was acquitted in a separate trial over the killings of Shia Muslim protesters in 1999 .
Aziz , a Christian , was Iraq 's foreign minister during the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 , later becoming the deputy prime minister .
He had argued that his work was political and he bore no responsibility for the deaths of the flour merchants .
Aziz surrendered to US troops on 24 April 2003 , shortly after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and has been in custody ever since .
In recent years , he has reportedly suffered from poor health in prison awaiting trial .
His Amman - based lawyer Badea Aref told AFP news agency that he had expected his client would be acquitted for a second time as he had not been in Iraq at the time of the killings .
Mr Aref said he would appeal within the statutory 30 - day period , and added that Aziz is awaiting verdicts in two further trials .
' Flawed ' process Sabawi Ibrahim said he would be proud to die a martyr
On Wednesday , two of Saddam Hussein 's half - brothers - former presidential adviser Watban Ibrahim and former intelligence chief Sabawi Ibrahim - were sentenced to death by hanging .
As his death sentence was read out , reports say Sabaawi Ibrahim stood up and proclaimed " God is great " and that he was proud to be a martyr .
The judge told him to sit down .
Co-defendant Majid was jailed for 15 years .
Majid had faced his fourth capital conviction in the merchants ' case , having already been sentenced in the Anfal campaign against the Kurds in the late 1980s , the crushing of a Shia uprising in 1991 and the 1999 killings .
Saddam Hussein himself was hanged in December 2006 in a separate case .
Human Rights
Watch issued a report into the trial of Saddam Hussein , concluding that the process was flawed and its verdict unsound because of " serious administrative , procedural and substantive legal defects " .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Solomon Moore in the New York Times :
For the cartels , “ marijuana is the king crop , ” said Special Agent Rafael Reyes , the chief of the Mexico and Central America Section of the Drug Enforcement Administration .
“ It consistently sustains its marketability and profitability . ”
Marijuana trafficking continues virtually unabated in the United States , even as intelligence reports suggest the declining availability of heroin , cocaine and other hard drugs that require extensive smuggling operations .
If marijuana is now the main drug that is sustaining the Mexican drug gangs that are causing so much chaos in our neighbor to the south that they could potentially cause it to collapse overnight , might n’t it make strategic sense to take some steps to bring the marijuana trafficking into the light ?
Of course , if marijuana is especially debilitating or toxic or dangerous or addictive , this strategic advantage might not be enough to justify it ’s decriminalization .
But it is none of those things .
Which just goes to prove my previous thesis – that the War on Drugs is making America less safe .

Iceland 's government was last night scrambling to avoid becoming the first administration to be ousted by the global financial crisis , as ministers huddled to try and hold together a coalition in the face of some of the biggest protests the country has seen for 60 years .
Protesters who have mounted vocal demonstrations in recent weeks against the collapse of the economy squared up to police , spattered parliament with eggs and paint , and at one point surrounded the prime minister 's car as he tried to leave his office .
They pelted Geir Haarde 's car with eggs and banged on the windows , shouting " resign " , in a sign of mounting exasperation at the government 's failure to prevent the economy from imploding under a mountain of billions of dollars of debt .
" These men bankrupted Iceland .
It 's ridiculous that they continue as if nothing happened , " the writer Hallgrimur Helgason said .
" I want the government to resign and an emergency government to be proclaimed , preferably made up of women .
They can't do worse than men . "
Haarde 's press secretary said some demonstrators " came quite close to him and they did n't look all that peaceful " .
Last night , the government 's supposed political ally , the Alliance party , was meeting to discuss the future of the coalition .
Options on the table included a motion calling for early elections , or even a vote of no confidence in the government .
After fleeing the government building , Haarde went to a meeting of Independence party MPs at their headquarters .
He later emerged to insist that he could hold the coalition together .
Protesters have been rallying outside the parliament since October , when the credit crunch ripped the heart out of Iceland 's financial system .
The protesters have begun referring to their daily attempt to oust the government as a " fleece revolution " , because of the sweaters worn .
After a midwinter hiatus , several hundred protesters returned en masse on Tuesday , as parliament was preparing to return from recess .
Some clashed with police who used pepper spray and batons to drive them back .
" The USA is getting rid of Bush today , we want to get rid of you " and " Yes , we can " were among banners carried by thousands of protesters .
The protesters banged pots and pans , wheelbarrows and a drum set .
" We are protesting against useless ministers , " said one of three ladies who were beating teapots with spoons .
They , like many others , had taken time off from work .
" We are taking a long lunch break , " they said .
The latest protest rally is thought to be the biggest since 1949 , when Iceland joined Nato .
On Tuesday night , the crowds lit a bonfire and once it ran out of fuel , the Christmas tree in the town square was torn down and used as firewood .
Nearby benches were also thrown into the pyre .
Iceland 's financial collapse was triggered when a huge housing and consumer bubble burst last year under the weight of foreign debts that at one point amounted to 10 times the country 's GDP .
The economy is expected to contract sharply this year and unemployment is soaring .

Ho la pelle abbastanza scura , olivastra direi , per cui non mi è mai capitato di bruciarmi o di avere il bisogno di creme abbronzanti .
Fino ai più o meno 5 anni fa , dove ho cominciato con le prime protezioni solari , tutto perché avevo sviluppato una sorta di dermatite solare .
Ero davvero molto sorpresa , soprattutto perché non avevo mai pensato al fatto di dover aver bisogno di comprarne una , per cui mi sono subito documentata sui motivi che scatenano questa allergia , nella maggioranza di casi la pelle dovrebbe essere chiara e molto sensibile al sole , la mia non rientra in nessuna di queste due categorie .
Per di più , non ho veramente mai sofferto di nessuna allergia alla pelle , per cui avevo bisogno di indagare più a fondo .
Ho poi scoperto che il sole in questi ultimi anni è cambiato , ovvero , il modo in cui i raggi vengono filtrati dall ’atmosfera è cambiato , e il sole si è ammalato .
Quindi io ho bisogno della crema perché il sole picchia più forte rispetto a prima , o la nostra pelle lo percepisce come tale e vengono le allergie .
Il sole non cambia , beh , lui non ha subito l’intervento umano per fortuna , mentre l’atmosfera si , ma in maniera diversa , indiretta , tramite l’inquinamento dell ’aria , quindi tutto ciò che entra nell ’atmosfera aiuta a modificare il buco dell ’ ozono , che si assottiglia sempre di più , e in questo modo i tiraggi solari penetrano senza schermo .
Se tu cerchi di considerare l’atmosfera senza schermo protettivo , allora puoi immaginare cosa voglio dire quando parlo di buco dell ’ ozono , perché manca quella pellicola che avvolge il sole e lo rende non nocivo per la nostra pelle .
Tutto quello che sta succedendo non è che il risultato di tutto l’inquinamento atmosferico che abbiamo riversato nell ’aria , per cui si tratta di tutti i gas e i materiali che vengono bruciati nell ’aria , la inquinano e fanno diminuire lo spessore di questa pellicola importantissima , così il sole diventa più pericoloso .
L’inquinamento atmosferico !
A pensarci bene , la terra viene bombardata dall ’inquinamento atmosferico .
La maggioranza delle cose che utilizziamo come le macchine , motorini , e le cose che abbiamo costruito come le fabbriche rappresentano uno dei modi peggiori per inquinare l’aria .
Forse ci siamo dimenticati che viviamo di aria , e anche le piante tramite la fotosintesi , quindi si tratta di inquinare tutto ciò che respiriamo e di cui ci nutriamo .
Se utilizzi macchine elettriche per esempio aiuti a mantenere l’aria pulita , anche il fatto di utilizzare la macchina quando serve e non in caso contrario .
C’è sempre un modo per aiutare a migliorare il uno ambiente basta solo volerlo .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Two - thirds of U.S. adults today perceive that the influence of religion in American life is waning , while just 27 % believe it is rising .
This represents a sharp decline in the image of religion compared with only three years ago , when 50 % thought its influence was on an upswing , and marks one of the weakest readings on the influence of religion in Gallup 's five - decade history of asking the question .
The percentage of Americans saying religion , as a whole , is increasing its influence on American life was 50 % in April 2005 , 39 % in May 2006 , 34 % in May 2007 , and 30 % in May 2008 .
The 27 % recorded in the new Dec. 4 - 7 Gallup
Poll thus marks a continuation of the recent downward trend .
The current weak image of religion stands on par with the low ebb recorded in the first half of the Clinton administration in the mid 1990s , but is still not quite as low as it was during the late 1960s and Vietnam War .
The record low came in a 1970 Gallup Poll when only 14 % of Americans said religion was increasing in influence at that time , while 75 % thought it was losing influence .
Indeed , this measure of public perceptions about religion has been quite volatile over the forty - plus years of its existence , with shifts in perception often corresponding to major political events .
The pinnacle for perceptions of religious clout came in Gallup 's initial asking of the question in March 1957 .
At that time , 69 % of Americans thought religion was gaining in societal influence while only 14 % saw it declining -- resulting in a net 55 percentage point advantage for those saying the influence of religion was increasing .
This was nearly matched in a December 2001 Gallup Poll -- just three months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks -- in which 71 % said religious influence was increasing and 24 % decreasing -- a net 47 - point advantage to those saying religious influence was on the rise .
After a long period of doubt about the influence of religion during the Vietnam War era -- from 1965 through 1975 -- a December 1976 Gallup Poll found nearly as many Americans saying religion was increasing in influence , as disagreed ( 44 % vs. 45 % ) .
This relative high point for perceptions that religion was on the rise could have been associated with the election a month earlier of Jimmy Carter as president , an avowed born - again Christian .
Religion rose even higher in perceived prominence in the 1980s during the presidency of Ronald Reagan , when religious conservatism -- also known as the " religious right " was in ascendance as a potent political force .
From 1983 to 1986 , Gallup consistently recorded more Americans perceiving religion to be on the rise than in decline .
Given this historical context , it is possible that the recent decline in perceptions that religion is increasing in influence is partially a result of the decline of Republican political strength throughout President George W. Bush 's second term , a trend that was punctuated by the election of Democrat Barack Obama last month .
Differences
Large majorities of all gender , age , and political groups perceive religion to be losing influence , but that view is higher among men than women ( 70 % vs. 64 % ) and is particularly prevalent among regular attendees of their church or other place of worship .
Is Religion Old - Fashioned ?
Public perceptions about the influence of religion have varied widely over the last half - century , and may be more a reflection of changing political realities than of personal beliefs about religion .
However , the new poll also finds the percentage of Americans believing that religion can answer society 's problems is at an all - time low .
Although still a majority , just 53 % of Americans say religion " can answer all or most of today 's problems . "
While 28 % say it is " largely old - fashioned and out of date . "
The current 53 % affirming religion as a relevant tool for solving today 's problems is not much different from the 55 % recorded a year ago , but is below the 57 % to 66 % range seen earlier this decade .
It comes at a time when the vast majority of Americans perceive the U.S. economy to be the nation 's greatest challenge -- and perhaps one that religion is not particularly well suited to address .
The vast majority of Americans who attend church or another worship service weekly ( 82 % ) say religion can answer today 's problems , as do 59 % of those attending at least monthly , but only 27 % of those who rarely or never attend agreed .
Confidence in religion to solve problems increases with age , but even young adults ( aged 18 to 34 years ) are more likely to affirm the value of religion than reject it ( 44 % vs. 36 % ) .
Bottom Line
At the close of 2008 , few Americans perceive that religion is thriving in U.S. society , and a relatively small majority believe religion is relevant to solving today 's problems .
These perceptions may stem in part from the political climate -- characterized by a weakened Republican Party and the incoming Democratic administration -- as well as from the overwhelming consensus that the main problems facing the country today are economic .
At the same time , a solid majority of Americans ( 56 % ) , largely unchanged from recent years , say that religion plays a very important role in their own lives .
Also , Gallup Poll Daily tracking data shows no decline in the percent of Americans ' self - reported church attendance this year .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,009 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Dec. 4 - 7 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

The economic cost of methamphetamine use in the United States reached $ 23.4 billion in 2005 , including the burden of addiction , premature death , drug treatment and many other aspects of the drug , according to a new RAND Corporation study .
The RAND study is the first effort to construct a comprehensive national assessment of the costs of the methamphetamine problem in the United States .
" Our findings show that the economic burden of methamphetamine abuse is substantial , " said Nancy Nicosia , the study 's lead author and an economist at RAND , a nonprofit research organization .
Although methamphetamine causes some unique harms , the study finds that many of the primary issues that account for the burden of methamphetamine use are similar to those identified in economic assessments of other illicit drugs .
Given the uncertainty in estimating the costs of methamphetamine use , researchers created a range of estimates .
The lowest estimate for the cost of methamphetamine use in 2005 was $ 16.2 billion , while $ 48.3 billion was the highest estimate .
Researchers ' best estimate of the overall economic burden of methamphetamine use is $ 23.4 billion
The study was sponsored by the Meth Project Foundation , a nonprofit group dedicated to reducing first - time methamphetamine use .
Additional support was provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
" We commissioned this study to provide decision makers with the best possible estimate of the financial burden that methamphetamine use places on the American public , " said Tom Siebel , founder and chairman of the Meth Project .
" This is the first comprehensive economic impact study ever to be conducted with the rigor of a traditional cost of illness study , applied specifically to methamphetamine .
It provides a conservative estimate of the total cost of meth , and it reinforces the need to invest in serious prevention programs that work . "
The RAND analysis found that nearly two - thirds of the economic costs caused by methamphetamine use resulted from the burden of addiction and an estimated 900 premature deaths among users in 2005 .
The burden of addiction was measured by quantifying the impact of the lower quality of life experienced by those addicted to the drug .
Crime and criminal justice expenses account for the second - largest category of economic costs , according to researchers .
These costs include the burden of arresting and incarcerating drug offenders , as well as the costs of additional non-drug crimes caused by methamphetamine use , such as thefts committed to support a drug habit .
Other costs that significantly contribute to the RAND estimate include lost productivity , the expense of removing children from their parents ' homes because of methamphetamine use and spending for drug treatment .
One new category of cost captured in the analysis is the expense associated with the production of methamphetamine .
Producing methamphetamine requires toxic chemicals that can result in fire , explosions and other events .
The resulting costs include the injuries suffered by emergency personnel and other victims , and efforts to clean up the hazardous waste generated by the production process .
Researchers caution that their estimates are in some cases based on an emerging understanding of methamphetamine 's role in these harms and should be further refined as understanding of these issues matures .
The RAND report also identifies costs that cannot yet be adequately quantified .
" Estimates of the economic costs of illicit drug use can highlight the consequences of illegal drug use on our society and focus attention on the primary drivers of those costs , " Nicosia said .
" But more work is needed to identify areas where interventions to reduce these harms could prove most effective . "
Methamphetamine is a highly addictive substance that can be taken orally , injected , snorted or smoked .
While national surveys suggest that methamphetamine use is far from common , there is evidence that the harms of methamphetamine may be concentrated in certain regions .
One indicator of the problem locally is treatment admissions .
Methamphetamine was the primary drug of abuse in 59 percent of the treatment admissions in Hawaii in 2004 and accounted for 38 percent of such admissions in Arizona in 2004 .
The report , " The Economic Costs of Methamphetamine Use in the United States - 2005 , " is available at www.rand.org.
Other authors of the report are Rosalie Liccardo Pacula , Beau Kilmer , Russell Lundberg and James Chiesa .
The RAND Drug Policy Research Center is a joint project of RAND Health and the RAND Safety and Justice program within RAND Infrastructure , Safety , and Environment .
The goal of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center is to provide a firm , empirical foundation upon which sound drug policies can be built .
Five wrong reasons to use eval ( ) in an extension · 2009 - 02-06 13:35 by Wladimir Palant
One of the most overused JavaScript features is the eval ( ) function .
I have seen it used in very many extensions but only a few actually had a good reason to use it .
So I want to go through all the wrong reasons one would use eval ( ) .
1. Processing JSON data
The JSON format got popular for storing data lately .
Its most convenient feature : it is so easy to parse !
I mean , all you have to do is to write data = eval ( json ) and you are done .
What ’s the catch ?
Right , json variable might contain something like {foo : " bar " + alert ( Components.classes ) } and then you will end up running JavaScript code , something that you did n’t intend .
So this way of parsing JSON data is absolutely unsuitable for data coming from untrusted sources .
And guess what : if you are a Firefox extension , data coming from any web server is untrusted .
Even if it is “ your ” web server , it might be hacked or the data might have been manipulated on its way to the user ( especially for unencrypted connections ) , and you really do n’t want to put users at risk when something like that happens .
But there is more : even the data that your extension wrote itself ( e.g. extension state saved on browser shutdown ) cannot be always considered trusted .
Often it will write out data that it received from the web in one way or other .
If there is a bug in the way JSON is written and that data breaks out of JavaScript strings you will unintentionally run JavaScript code when you “ parse ” that JSON .
This means that it is always better to use methods dedicated to processing JSON that will no longer run JavaScript when receiving invalid data .
2 . Using object properties when property name is determined dynamically
What if your code needs to access obj .
fooN where “ N ” is the value of the variable n ?
Meaning that the name of the property you have to access is not known in advance but has to be determined dynamically .
Extensions will sometimes do things like eval ( " obj.foo " + n ) to solve this problem .
Here the extension would need to verify that the value of n cannot contain anything malicious — but how ?
Fortunately , that question does n’t need to be answered .
There is a better way , one only has to remember that all objects in JavaScript are associative arrays .
In other words , obj.foo and obj [ " foo " ] are exactly the same thing , each property is at the same type an array member .
So to solve the problem above you simply need to write obj [ " foo " + n ] and that operation will always access a property , never do anything else .
But what about methods ?
Methods in JavaScript are properties as well , only difference is that their value is a function .
You can use the method Function.call ( ) to call that function with the correct value of the this pointer :
var method = obj [ " foo " + n ] ; method.call ( obj , param1 , param2 ) ;
Or in a more compressed way :
obj [ " foo " + n]( param1 , param2 ) ;
Same approach can even be applied to global variables and functions .
Those are all properties of the “ global object ” which can usually be referenced by the name window .
So window.foo or window [ " foo " ] will give you the value of the global variable foo .
3 . Telling functions what they should do when they are done
One pattern that I would occasionally see is calling a function like this :
foo ( " window.close ( ) " ) ;
On other occasions the same function would be called with different JavaScript code as parameter .
And when the function is done it would call eval ( ) on its parameter to run the specified action .
Obviously , there are no security issues here , so what ’s wrong with that approach ?
Actually , several things :
This code will not be compiled until eval ( ) is called .
That means that while the JavaScript interpreter will report syntax errors for the rest of the code immediately when the script is loaded , syntax errors in the function parameter will be reported late and might go unnoticed simply because you never tested the code path that will run that code .
is called .
That means that while the JavaScript interpreter will report syntax errors for the rest of the code immediately when the script is loaded , syntax errors in the function parameter will be reported late and might go unnoticed simply because you never tested the code path that will run that code .
Another consequence is that for errors in that code the JavaScript interpreter cannot report the correct source file and line number , it simply does n’t know where that code came from .
Debugging such errors is no fun .
Finally , passing parameters between foo ( ) and the executed code is non-trivial and requires ugly workarounds .
Fortunately , all these problems go away if you use closures .
Here is a rewritten an slightly extended version of the code above :
foo( function ( error ) { alert ( error ) ; window.close ( ) ; } ) ;
And the function foo ( ) would look like this :
function foo( callback ) { ... callback ( " Full success " ) ; }
4. Triggering inline event handlers in HTML or XUL
Let ’s assume we have a button like this :
< button id =" button " oncommand = " doSomething ( ) ; " />
Then why not do eval ( document.getElementById(" button " ) .getAttribute ( " oncommand " ) ) to trigger that event handler ?
Typically , extensions will do this to trigger event handlers on elements that are n’t their own .
However , generating a “ command ” event is much easier and will work regardless of how the event handler is defined :
document.getElementById(" button " ) .doCommand ( ) ;
The method doCommand ( ) is available for all XUL elements .
As to other events , it is better to generate a real event object using document.createEvent ( ) — because the event handler might expect one .
For example :
var event = document.createEvent( " MouseEvents " ) ; event.initMouseEvent ( " click " , true , true , window , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , false , false , false , false , 0 , null ) ; document.getElementById(" button " ) .dispatchEvent ( ) ;
But what if you defined your own custom attribute “ onfooaction ” that is n’t associated with any real event ?
Even in that situation using eval ( ) is n’t the best choice because then the code will execute in the context of the function calling eval ( ) .
So if the event handler is using the global variable foo but your function calling that event handler has a local variable foo — the event handler will inadvertently access the local variable .
And of course you cannot pass parameters to the event handler then .
A better solution would be creating a function for the event handler :
var handler = new Function ( " param1 " , " param2 " , document.getElementById(" button " ) .getAttribute ( " onfooaction " ) ) ; handler ( " foo " , " bar " ) ;
In this scenario the event handler will get “ foo ” as parameter param1 and “ bar ” as parameter param2 ( this is how the usual inline event handlers get the event parameter ) .
5 . Rewriting browser ’s functions
Occasionally I see code that goes like this :
gBrowser.foo = eval ( gBrowser.foo.toString ( ) .replace ( " foo " , " bar " ) ) ;
I recommend a public spanking for everybody who is rewriting browser ’s functions like this .
It is only slightly better than the extensions that simply replace browser ’s functions by their own .
The assumption in both cases is that the code of the function being rewritten never changes — but what if it does ?
In the best - case scenario the extension will simply stop working , not much damage done .
But it could just as easily break the browser .
Or , if the browser function changed to fix a security issue , the extension could reintroduce that issue .
In other words — do n’t do this .
In most cases the idea is not to change the way the browser function works but to insert additional code before / after it runs .
Fortunately , there is a less dangerous way to achieve just this , you simply wrap the original function in your own , using closures again :
var origFoo = gBrowser.foo ; gBrowser.foo = function ( param1 , param2 ) { if ( param1 == " top secret " ) doSomething BeforeFoo( ) ; var result = origFoo.apply ( this , arguments ) ; if ( result == null ) doSomething AfterFoo( ) ; return result ; }
Note how Function.apply ( ) is used to call the original function will all parameters you got .
Even if that function receives only two parameters now this might change in a future browser version .
Your extension might now know what to do with the new parameters but it should still pass them to the original function to avoid breaking it .
What about the valid uses of eval ( ) ?
I do n’t think there are all that many valid uses for the eval ( ) function .
Some extensions allow users to enter JavaScript code that will be evaluated .
Here eval ( ) is justified though it might still be better create a function using Function ( ) constructor and pass any variables that script might need explicitly as function parameters .
Another possible use of eval ( ) is declaring constants conditionally :
if ( typeof MY_CONSTANT == " undefined " ) eval ( " const MY_CONSTANT = ' foo ' " ) ;
That way if another script decides to declare the same constant you wo n’t get a syntax error .
I still consider this approach a hack however : if you are afraid of clashing with unknown scripts running in same namespace you should make sure that your constants ( as well as global variables ) have unique names that other scripts wo n’t use .
And as to your own scripts , making sure that the script containing constant declarations is n’t loaded more than once should n’t be too hard .
Finally , there are those obfuscated or “ packed ” scripts that make heavy use of eval ( ) to generate their code at runtime .
While I see the value of “ compressing ” scripts on the web , doing the same in extensions makes very little sense .
Extensions are downloaded only once so saving two seconds of download time wo n’t help anybody .
On the other hand , the “ packed ” script will cause delays every time it needs to be loaded which might be pretty often .

CHICAGO --
A plan to curb the number of beds available to emergency - room patients at one of the nation 's most prestigious hospitals has spurred a divisive internal debate that is being closely watched by hospital physicians across the country .
At issue at the University of Chicago Medical Center , located in the South Side 's Hyde Park neighborhood , is a proposal that could limit the number of beds available to emergency - room patients .
In February , two high - ranking doctors quit their administrative posts to protest the plan , ...

Some time between 9/11 and now America became a police state .
I cannot pinpoint the tipping point because the last several years are a blur of laws and policies that were passed so quickly and in such volume that no one could track them , let alone provide analysis .
Even lawmakers did n't read what they were passing .
Moreover , I am not sure how to define " a police state " as opposedto a quasi one ... so pinpointing is a term of accuracy that does n't apply .
But , like pornography , I know a police state when I see it and I see everytime I glance State - side .
And the collapse of the American dollar has not even occurred yet .
When that happens -- and it will be as swift as the mortgage collapse -- the fear and panic generated could well allow / encourage the establishment of one of the worst totalitarian states the world has seen in a developed nation .
People who value their freedom and safety should leave ... if possible .
Having said this , I cannot fault those who stay to be near family and friends or a business that took a decade to establish .
Nor can I blame anyone who says " Hell , no ! " and draws a line against surrending their freedom on the soil of their birth .

At the end of the 2 - 3 hours of daily news surfing , I am heartsick and / or numb .
I do not search for stories about government 's growth and abuse -- I skim for ifeminist topics -- but there are so many of them as to be avoidable .
Here are just two items I tripped over this morning .
John Berlau of the Competitive Enterprise Institute offers an analysis entitled " Nationalizing the cars and bikes of rock collectors â€ ” Pending Omnibus land billâ€™s forfeiture provision has broad reach . "
Berlau writes ,
In the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 , which passed the Senate ( S. 22 ) in January and is up for a vote in the House as early as this Wednesday , a â€œforfeitureâ€  provision would let the government confiscate â€œall vehicles and equipment of any personâ€  who disturbs a rock or a bone from federal land that meets the billâ€™s broad definition of â€œpaleontological resource .â€ 
The seizures could take place even before a person and even if the person didnâ€™t know they were taking or digging up a â€œpaleontological resource .â€ 
And the bill specifically allows the â€œtransfer of seized resourcesâ€ to â€œfederal or non-federalâ€ institutions , giving the government and some private actors great incentive to egg on the takings .
Tracie Bennitt , president of the Association of Applied Paleontological Sciences , states that the billâ€™s language is so vague and the penalties so severe that well - meaning scientists could end up in jail .
That 's one of the possible penalties : 5 years in jail .
Indeed , Sec. 6306 ( b ) of the Act states that â€œa person may not make or submit any false record , account , or label for , or any false identification of , any paleontological resource excavated or removed from Federal land .
â€ 
I daresay that most museums with a collection of any size has labeling errors from time to time .
The " false " label would be a matter of little import if the Act did not state 6306 ( b ) that a false labeller " shall be fined in accordance with title 18 , United States Code , or imprisoned not more than 2 years , or both.â€ 
In other words , even mislabelling a fossil could result in a two year sentence .
This article from KMOV4 in St. Louis , " Mo. lawmakers support bill allowing classroom spankings . "
The Missouri House has passed a bill that approves the spanking of children as long as 2 adults are present .
Although it is a criminal offense for parents to beat a child , as long as a teacher has another adult for company , he or she can legally beat that same child .
And , in case the assaulting teacher breaks a child 's bones or otherwise causes extreme harm , the Bill also immunizes teachers from lawsuits .
So ... why do 2 adults have to be present , you ask ?
In order to prevent spankings that are sexually motivated .
So ... this is the class lesson for today : violence is good but sex is bad .
Oh , and the teacher your friend .
The measure was approved by a 160 - 0 vote and now proceeds to the Senate .
What disheartens me the most is the lack of opposition to such measures .
Indeed , people seem to cheer on even the most vicious penalties and laws in much the same way ancient Romans must have cheered the throwing of innocents to lions .
These are the crazy years ( as Heinlein would have said ) and the best thing you can do is get out of the way of Leviathan .

Updated 1:05 p.m. ET
After President Obama 's speech on the economy last night , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal criticized government spending in the stimulus bill , citing examples including " $ 140 million for something called ' volcano monitoring . ' "
The $ 140 million to which Jindal referred is actually for a number of projects conducted by the United States Geological Survey , including volcano monitoring .
This monitoring is aimed at helping geologists understand the inner workings of volcanoes as well as providing warnings of impending eruptions , in the United States and in active areas around the world where U.S. military bases are located .
Most of the money from the stimulus bill earmarked for monitoring ( only about a tenth of the total going to the USGS ) will go to modernizing existing monitoring equipment , including switching from analog to digital and installing GPS networks that can measure ground movements , said John Eichelberger , program coordinator for the USGS 's Volcano Hazards Program .
Much of the expense of this technology comes from the manpower required to make and install it , he added .
" Ultimately most of this creates jobs or saves jobs that would have been lost " to recent budget shortfalls Eichelberger told LiveScience .
When he heard Jindal 's remarks , Eichelberger said he " was frankly astonished " that the governor would use this particular example , given his own state 's recent brush with a catastrophic natural disaster .
Among the scenarios in which the USGS ’s monitoring can assist — the catastrophic eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18 , 1980 , which killed 57 people ( including a geologist monitoring the mountain ) and was the deadliest and costliest volcanic eruption in U.S. history ( $ 2.74 billion in 2007 dollars ) .
This event was preceded by thousands of earthquakes in the two months before the volcano blew its top ; some of these prompted the governor of Washington to declare a state of emergency and many residents were evacuated from a designated danger zone .
" This is a hazard we can do something about , " Eichelberger said .
" We can spend a modest amount of money and prevent a tragedy . "
About 50 volcanic eruptions occur around the world every year , according to the USGS .
The United States ranks third , behind Indonesia and Japan , in its number of historically active volcanoes ( those for which written accounts exist ) .
Most U.S. volcanoes are located in the Aleutian Islands , the Alaska Peninsula , the Hawaiian Islands , and the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest , with the rest distributed around the West .
About 65 volcanoes in the United States are considered active ; most of these are in Alaska , where an eruption occurs almost every year .
Hawaii's Kilauea volcano is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth and has been erupting continuously since 1983 .
The USGS has three volcanic observatories — in Alaska , Hawaii and the Cascades — set up to monitor volcanoes for signs of impending eruption .
USGS scientists are currently monitoring Alaska 's Mount Redoubt , which has been threatening to erupt since late January .
Seismic rumblings from the volcano have alerted geologists that magma might be moving around underneath the surface , preparing to make a potentially explosive appearance .
Redoubt last erupted on December 14 , 1989 , for the fourth time in the 20th century , creating large ash clouds that clogged the air around Anchorage for days .
Monitoring of Redoubt 's latest threat of eruption has been hampered by the lack of a GPS network which could not be put in place before because of a lack of funding , Eichelberger said .
" We 're kind of half blind there , " he said .
In addition to listening for rumbling of the Earth , researchers survey the surfaces of volcanoes , map volcanic rock deposits , and analyze the chemistry of volcanic gas and fresh lava to detect warning signs of eruptions and to determine what type of eruption is most likely to occur .
The USGS has issued several warnings over the past 10 years , though predicting the timing and size of eruptions remains a difficult task .
Volcano monitoring likely saved many lives — and significant money — in the case of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines ( where the United States had military bases at the time ) , according to the USGS .
The cataclysmic eruption lasted more than 10 hours and sent a cloud of ash as high as 22 miles into the air that grew to more than 300 miles across .
The USGS spent less than $ 1.5 million monitoring the volcano and was able to warn of the impending eruption , which allowed authorities to evacuate residents , as well as aircraft and other equipment from U.S. bases there .
The USGS estimates that the efforts saved thousands of lives and prevented property losses of at least $ 250 million ( considered a conservative figure ) .
Volcanoes , of course , are n't the only potential natural disaster that scientists monitor to give people warnings of imminent danger .
Hurricanes , tornado - producing storms , earthquakes , tsunamis and flooding events are also watched and forecast .
While those predictions can result in mitigating the damage and losses that result from natural disasters , the research is only useful in a practical sense for residents if authorities pay heed to it .
For instance , in the case of Hurricane Katrina , the Natural Hurricane Center was watching the situation like a hawk , but the subsequent preparations and responses by authorities was insufficient to prevent wholesale destruction of large parts of New Orleans and the loss of more than 1,800 lives .
Jindal 's comment comes at a time when President Obama has pledged to return science to the White House , an effort widely applauded by scientists who felt shunned by the previous administration .
The criticism of government funding of scientific research was similar to remarks made last fall during the presidential campaign by vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin , who was dismissive of fruit fly research .
All the right factors came together to produce today ’s action .
Megabears Nouriel Roubini and Meredith
Whitney were out in full force , forecasting the worst possible scenario for the markets .
Roubini said the Dow would drop straight to 5,000 , while Whitney announced in Wall Street Journal article that credit - card debt was the next great trial we ’d endure .
Newspapers , too , have been calling a 5,000 level for the Dow , and Senator Richard Shelby , ranking Republican on the Banking Committee , has been calling for the liquidation of the banks .
Moody ’s even put out a death - watch list .
This kind of overwhelming bearish sentiment , Cramer said , is always the first part of any big move higher .
Then news that the uptick rule would be reinstated hit the wires .
Lack of regulation on this specific point has allowed short sellers to hammer down stocks with impunity .
But the uptick ’s return puts a stop to that .
It also stifles the UltraShort Financial ProShares fund , which bears have been using to sidestep SEC margin rules and do even more damage to stocks .
This development traps the bears , Cramer said , something that ’s essential for a nice rally .
Three big positives will keep this rally going , namely in tech , oil and financials .
Texas Instruments ’ good news about lower inventories and increased demand for 3G cell phone components should ripple out to others in the business .
Think Research in Motion , Analog Devices and Skyworks Solutions .
Oil in the $ 40s is attracting money back to the sector , Cramer said .
Some overly negative sentiment here – such as The New York Times story “ Wondering if Crude Could Fall Even More ” – indicates that crude should continue higher .
Also , Chevron ’s doing well .
The strength in oil , like TI ’s good news , should work its way into energy infrastructure companies , who ’d lost projects because the price per barrel was so low .
The financials play a part here as well .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke seems ready to adjust the mark - to - market accounting that ’s so devastated the institutions holding asset - backed mortgage paper .
If this happens , Cramer said , the banks look cheap and it finally frees them up to move higher .
Other events of note : Citigroup ’s quarterly numbers should mean that the Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reports would be even better .
Cramer thinks we could see some upside surprises .
These all add up the material positives Cramer said he ’d need before changing his mind about this market .
They indicate a genuine rally that should go much higher .
Cramer 's charitable trust owns Chevron , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley .

Update from October 2009 : this blog post is of historical interest only , the updated , official instructions on how to install Rakudo can be found here .
If you want to build Rakudo , that 's where you should look these days .
There has been some profund confusion over the whereabouts of the Rakudo source code repository .
Since we 've seen no official announcement on rakudo.org I wrote a short guide on how to build Rakudo .
The Parrot svn repository move to parrot.org ( formerly perl.org ) , and at the same time Rakudo left the Parrot repository .
It now lives on Github ( and has been migrated to git ) .
You can obtain a copy with
git clone git://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git
( Please note that the http :// currently does not work , you have to use git :// ) .
For people with commit access it is recommended to use the clone URL git@github.com :rakudo/rakudo.git instead .
Building Git
There are two ways to build Rakudo .
First way : Rakudo under Parrot
First obtain a copy of parrot ( if you already have one , you may of course omit this step ) and build it .
svn co https://svn.parrot.org/parrot/trunk parrot cd parrot / perl Configure.pl make
Then clone Rakudo to the subdirectory languages / rakudo , configure and build it :
cd languages / git clone git://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git cd rakudo perl Configure.pl make make spectest # please report any failures from this # step to rakudobug@perl.org
Second way : Parrot under Rakudo
You can reverse the order of the nesting of Parrot and Rakudo directories :
git clone git://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git cd rakudo svn co https://svn.parrot.org/parrot/trunk parrot cd parrot / perl Configure.pl make cd .. # back in Rakudo 's clone perl Configure.pl make make spectest
Update : : Chris Dolan also provided a nice explanation of how to use github's " fork " feature to create patches .
That 's the gittish way , and very convenient .

Yesterday , we told you about how a hastily assembled Prop. 8 related press conference staged by El Coyote , a dive Mexican restaurant in L.A. that ’s been a longtime gay watering hole , went about as well as the invasion of Iraq .
We now have video of the event , in all its sad , emotionally charged glory .
Above is Marjorie Chrisofferson , partial owner of the restaurant , talking about the $ 100 contribution she made to the Yes on 8 campaign .
Below is the aftermath .
It turns out the person who asked Marjorie whether she would be willing to donate money to repeal the amendment is none other than Sam Page , co-founder of the long shuttered gay mag , Hero .
Anyway , if you ’re like me , you ’ll feel conflicted watching the tape as people rightly point out that Marjorie “ is not our friend if she votes to take away civil rights ” and another owner despairs “ This was not the way it was supposed to go ” as Marjorie is quickly shuffled out of the restaurant .

Inquiring minds are looking into details of Asia ’s Export Economies .
Staggering falls in exports across Asia have shocked economic analysts and ended all claims that the global slump may be nearing its bottom .
The IMF 's growth forecast for Asia this year is just 2.7 percent — less than a third of the 9 percent growth rate of 2007 .
The prediction is a full percentage point less than during the 1997 - 98 Asian financial crisis .
IMA Asia analyst Richard Martin commented in the Australian : " It 's a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion .
North Asia is suffering the biggest collapse in demand since World War II . "
Westpac bank 's Richard Franulovich said that the " speed of the decline embedded in the latest Asia data is on par with the collapse in the US during the 1930s Depression . "
Asia Export Economy Details
Japanese exports fell 35 percent in December from a year earlier .
Industrial production plunged a record 9.6 percent , month on month , in December .
Chinese exports declined for the third consecutive month in January , falling 17.5 percent from a year earlier , after a 2.8 percent decline in December .
Imports plunged even further — 43.1 percent , twice as much as December 's 21.3 percent year - on - year drop .
More than 20 million Chinese migrant workers have lost their jobs so far , with some analysts warning of 50 million more job losses if the economy deteriorates further .
India exports fell 24 percent in January .
According to official data , one million Indian workers in the export sector have lost their jobs since September .
Another half a million workers are expected to lose their jobs by March .
New Delhi's public debt stands at 75 percent of its GDP , compared to just 18.5 percent in China , leaving less room for large stimulus packages .
South Korea 's exports , the main driving force of the economy , plunged 32.8 percent in January .
Finance minister Yoon Jeung - hyun warned on Tuesday that the fourth largest economy in Asia would shrink by about 2 percent this year .
Credit Suisse has projected as much as a 7 percent contraction .
Taiwan , the sixth largest Asian economy , saw its exports fall 44.1 percent in January from a year earlier — the biggest fall since records began in 1972 .
Imports plunged 56.5 percent in the same month .
For an economy where exports account for 70 percent of GDP , the impact is devastating .
Protectionism On The Rise
Statistics released Thursday by the European Union 's Eurostat agency reveal that production plummeted across Europe at the end of 2008 .
The figures announced were far worse than analysts had anticipated .
Industrial production declined across Europe by 2.6 percent in December compared to the previous month .
On a year - to - year basis , European production has slumped 12 percent .
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) also issued a warning that the recession gripping Europe will not be short - lived .
Rather , it will be a " long - lasting and clear downturn , " the ECB said .
The response of the individual European nations to the growing crisis has been to embrace a raft of protectionist measures .
Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi recently warned appliance maker Indesit SpA not to transfer production and jobs to Poland , and in Britain , trade unions and politicians are demanding " British jobs for British workers . "
On Wednesday , the acting EU Council president , Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek , appeared before the press in Brussels and warned of a " protectionist race " in Europe , while acknowledging that national economies in the European Union were being hit hard by the international crisis and losing ground with unanticipated speed .
Last Wednesday , the French automaker Peugeot announced it was shedding at least 11,000 jobs , and one day later , Renault announced its own plans to cut its workforce by 9,000 .
These job cuts have been agreed to by the French government and trade unions and are bound up with the announcement by French President Nicolas Sarkozy that he plans to subsidise domestic automakers with the sum of € 6 billion .
Sarkozy declared that , in his opinion , it was irresponsible " to continue to manufacture French cars in the Czech Republic . "
He demanded a halt to the transfer of production to other countries .
" If we give financial aid to the automotive industry , " he said , " we do not want them to set up a factory in the Czech Republic again . "
He also urged the carmakers to support French industries involved in supplying parts and services to French auto companies .
Czech Prime Minister Topolanek reacted sharply to this openly protectionist policy and called for a special European summit to block it and similar policies .
The conflict between Berlin and Paris runs deep .
In his role as EU Council president last year , Sarkozy repeatedly raised the demand for an " economic administration " for the eurozone .
He made it quite clear that he regarded himself as best suited to head such an administration .
Backed by the country 's business federations , the Merkel government is seeking to exploit the crisis to strengthen Germany 's dominant role in Europe .
Berlin is vehemently opposed to taking any responsibility for Europe 's " weak states " — i.e. , those countries that have thus far failed to implement drastic social and welfare cuts .
In view of increasing tensions , the EU presidency and the European Commission have announced plans for no fewer than three separate summits in the coming three months .
Behind this summit frenzy are fears of a possible break - up of the European Union and an escalation of working class resistance to mass unemployment and growing poverty .
US Protectionism and Hillary 's Asian Mission
When Hillary Clinton arrives in East Asia next week on her first trip as secretary of state , she will discover there are limits to what the U.S. can expect of China , the region ’s rising power .
With policies under review and top advisers not yet in place , the greatest value of Clinton ’s seven - day trip to Japan , Indonesia , South Korea and China will be symbolic .
As the world is dragged into a recession driven by a credit crisis in the U.S. , policy makers point to China ’s new clout : an economy now bigger than Germany ’s and the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury bills , with $ 682 billion .
The two economies are interdependent as never before : China is the U.S. ’s second - largest trading partner , buying $ 71.5 billion in U.S. exports last year as the U.S. took $ 337.8 billion in Chinese imports .
Following on the Bush administration ’s policy , the Obama team wants China to allow its currency to appreciate or float freely and to avoid protectionism .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said this week that the U.S. will look at the broad global picture in the coming months and judge “ carefully ” whether China is manipulating its currency .
Geithner upset China by saying it is “ manipulating ” the yuan in a written answer last month to the Senate Finance Committee .
Officials said Geithner merely repeated comments Obama made as a candidate and was n’t stating official policy .
“ The Chinese are in no position to help anyone , ” says Derek Scissors , Asia economics fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington .
The most they can be expected to do is to avoid protectionism and export promotion , keep their currency stable , and stimulate demand through expanded consumer lending , he says .

Meet Suraya Brown – the little girl who is baffling doctors by refusing to grow .
The brown - eyed youngster is now 14 - months - old and should weigh at least 20 lb .
Yet she is still the size of a newborn baby , tipping the scales at just over 7lb and a mere 19in .
Suraya has been examined by a whole team of specialists including paediatricians , nutritionists , geneticists and hormone experts .
But doctors say they still have no idea why she wo n’t grow – describing her condition as a “ real conundrum ” .
Mum Atlanta Ruzman , 24 , said yesterday that her daughter was like a real - life baby doll .
She said : “ The doctors have n’t got a clue what is wrong with her .
“ They ’ve consulted international experts about her case but her condition seems to be a complete mystery .
“ She can not sit , talk or crawl and she has to be fed through a tube to keep her alive .
But she just has n’t been putting on any weight .
“ She is way behind other youngsters of her age and when they mark her growth chart they have to plot her off the graph .
She is a just like a real - life doll .
In fact my other daughter has a doll that is bigger than her . ”
Suraya was born four weeks early weighing 2.6lb .
But specialists say nine out of 10 babies born at this stage will immediately start growing and put on weight .
In Suraya ’s case she stayed at her birth weight for the first eight months and has only put on a small amount over the past six .
Experts at various hospitals in London have carried out all kinds of tests on Suraya to find out what could be wrong with her .
These have included checks to see whether she is suffering from some form of dwarfism .
But so far these have brought no positive results .
Even being fed in hospital direct by tube failed to put on significant weight .
Her condition is in stark contrast to that of elder sister Akilah , who is two - and - a - half .
She was walking early at nine months of age and is now a big child for her age .
Atlanta , of Hayes , Middlesex , added : “ Akilah is a huge child .
Yet I still have to carry Suraya like a newborn baby the whole time .
“ It ’s very difficult because we do n't know what the future holds for Suraya .
“ But we are hoping the doctors will soon be able to find out and she will be able to live a normal life . ”
Suraya has now been admitted to
London ’s renowned Great Ormond Street Hospital for three months for further tests .
Doctors will investigate a theory that her body has become resistant to its own growth hormones .
Consultant paediatrician Dr Jide Menakaya , who has known Suraya since birth , said : “ She is a very interesting little baby .
“ Her case is highly unusual .
I have certainly never seen anything like this and I have been in paediatrics for nearly 17 years .
“ A whole range of specialists have been involved in her care but she has been a real conundrum .
“ The fact that she still did not grow after we put the feeding tube directly into her veins was unexpected and surprised us greatly .
“ This is incredibly rare .
We have run many tests but we have n’t had a firm reason as to why she is not growing .
“ Now we are working on a theory but more investigations need to be carried out . ”

" I use Kindle on my iPad and Kindle for PC on my laptops and desktops .
Wheelock 's Latin is formatted fine and works like a charm .
Since I also have the companion reader Scribblers , Sculptors and Scribes , carrying an iPad around is much easier than carrying the books and I can easily switch from one book to the other with the Kindle app ; I would recommend the Kindle edition for anyone who has a PC or iPad and will be using the Amazon Kindle book reader application . "
- R. Mark Jones , Bethel , Alaska When Frederic M. Wheelock ’s Latin first appeared in 1956 , the reviews extolled its thoroughness , organization , and conciseness ; one reviewer predicted that the book “ might well become the standard text ” for introducing students to elementary Latin .
Now , nearly six decades later , that prediction has certainly proved accurate .
This new edition of Wheelock ’s Latin , has all the features , many of them improved and expanded that have made it the bestselling single - volume beginning Latin textbook : 40 chapters with grammatical explanations and readings drawn from the works of Rome 's major prose and verse writers ;
Self - tutorial exercises , each with an answer key , for independent study ;
An extensive English - Latin / Latin- English vocabulary section ;
section ; A rich selection of original Latin readings — unlike other textbooks , which contain primarily made - up Latin texts ;
; Etymological aids , maps , and dozens of images illustrating aspects of the classical culture and mythology presented in the chapter readings .
Also included are expanded notes on the literary passages , comments on vocabulary , and translation tips ; new comprehension and discussion questions ; and new authentic classical Latin readings , including Roman grafitti in every chapter .
MORE Praise for Wheelock 's Latin :
One of the new features of the 7th ed. is the introduction of Pompeian graffiti ( Scripta in Parietibus in each chapter ) which provide accessible texts with opportunities for discussion of Pompeian society , handwriting , spelling and other linguistic features .
This is a considerable enhancement and along with the section Latina Est Gaudium – et Utilis , introduced by L. in the 5th ed , makes the book more lively and engaging .

Do n’t forget to read the follow - up to this article :
Since I ’ve been a computer geek , I ’ve heard many horror stories of people buying a slow video card , thinking that they were getting a fast model .
In general , people make the same several mistakes when they buy their video cards .
Have they been with me , I ’d have helped them avoid these 6 mistakes when buying a video card :
1- Buying a video card based solely on the amount of memory .
More is better , right ?
That ’s their excuse when you have to justify your purchase to yourself or to your geek friend .
Well yes , but not if you base your purchase solely on the amount of RAM .
A video card performance is based on many other factors , such as the GPU chip model , the frequency of the GPU / memory , the memory bus width , etc .
A good example of this would be someone buying a 8600 GT 512MB over a 8800 GT 256MB .
Sure , it may have more memory , but every other factor will limit the card performance in comparison .
Also keep in mind that you wo n’t need the extra memory unless you play at very high resolutions , such as 1920 ×1080 and / or with AA / AF quality filtering .
Why ?
Because your video card wo n’t need / use it .
2- Buying a lower - end new generation model over a higher - end old generation model .
It ’s newer , so it must be faster !
Not so quickly .
When in the majority of cases , this is true , it is not always true .
So ?
Well , you might miss out on a really good deal , as stores tend to lower prices on older generations , to get rid of their old stock , to make space for the new stock .
Now , the mistake some of you make is to choose your card by using the generation number first .
You ’d think that a 4xxx card from ATI is automatically faster than a 3xxx model .
If you take a Radeon 3870 , it ’d trash a Radeon 4350 or be faster than a Radeon 4650 .
Let me quickly explain how model numbers work , using ATI ’s 4850 model as an example .
4850 : The first number refers to the generation of the card .
A higher number there means that the video card is based on a more recent generation , which always brings in improvements over the previous generation .
4850 : The second number refers to the range of that card .
Same here , higher is better .
In Ati ’s case , for the 4xxx series , it goes mostly like this :
3 : Low end
6 : Mid range
8 : High performance
4850 : The last two numbers refer to the place of that model , within the hierarchy of that range of video cards ( See second point , for the “ 8 ” ) ; within a generation ( See first point , for the “ 4 ” ) .
In the vast majority of cases , a higher number means higher performance , but both ATI and Nvidia tricked people in the past with crippled GS / SE models , so keep an eye open for the suffix if there ’s one .
No , SE does not mean special edition !!
Although ATI do n’t really use suffix on their newer models , Nvidia still are .
Here ’s a quick reference , from slowest to fastest , when you compare two identical models otherwise :
GS < GT < GTS < GTX .
Now , even this is not always true , if you take the 8800 model example .
Some of the older GTS models are slower than the newer GT .
Confusing , is n’t it ?
Just keep in mind that many older generation , higher - end models are often faster than some of the newer models , so make sure to google benchmarks and to compare prices !
3- Not considering the space / power requirements .
So you ’ve avoided the two first mistakes , ended up buying a Geforce GTX280 , are eager to play the newest games … only to realize that it does n’t fit in your case !
Good job =P
This is especially true when you have a small format case , a HTPC or if you buy a high - end video card .
Lesson here : Measure the space available for the video card in your case ( Usually from the back of the case to the hard drive cage ) and double - check the length of the card , which is usually found under the specs , before buying it .
Check reviews and / or contact the store if you ’re unsure .
You ’ve bought a great card , it fits in your case , but now you ’ve one or several of the following problems ? :
Your video card needs extra power connectors and you do n’t have them .
Your computer wo n’t boot .
Your computer boots but crashes under games .
I ’m afraid that your power supply may not up to the task of powering your new video card .
Now , that ’s most probably it , but it might not be it , make sure to troubleshoot before buying a new power supply .
4- Teaming a powerful video card with a slow Cpu
Yay , you ’ve got that new Radeon 4870X2 and you ’re ready to dominate the virtual world .
Only to see that you ’re framerates are no where what you expected to be , according to all those reviews .
Well , if you ’re using such a powerful gpu with a slow cpu , lik an Intel E4300 , it just wo n’t work as you want it to .
Your cpu will bottleneck your video card performance , which mean that it wo n’t be able to keep up with it and your video card performance will be reduced as it always waits on the CPU .
Simply try to keep your cpu performance in balance with your video card .
If you get a midrange video card ( 9800 GTX , 4850 ) , try to team it with a midrange CPU ( E7400 and such ) .
If you use SLI / Crossfire or even better ( or worse in this case ) , make sure to team up your video cards with a blazing fast quad - core CPU .
Most games may not benefit from quad - core yet , but the video drivers and the cards themselves will .
The new Core i7 cpus are a perfect fit here .
5- Buying an overkill video card for the games that you play .
If you play is Counter - Strike 1.6 , WoW or the majority of games that are 2 years or older , you probably do n’t need the lastest and fastest video card .
If you play on a 17 ″ or 19 ″ screen , you probably do n’t need the lastest and fastest video card .
This is just like someone who buys a Mustang simply because they want more horsepower .
Could they travel to work and do their everyday activities with a Honda Civic ?
Most probably .
You will waste a lot of money , both on purchase , power consumption and on upgrading the rest of your system ( Cpu and power supply ) if you buy a video card that is overkill for your needs .
Learn to listen to your wallet , think with your head and figure out how much power you really need for the games that you play !
Now , some of you may not agree with this , as you ’ll say that it ’s good to have headroom for future games .
I do n’t think so .
Why ?
By the time that the new game is out , your video card will still be able to handle it , perhaps at lower settings but newer video cards that offer higher performance for the same price will most probably be out by then .
I think that it is better to upgrade at a low cost every so often than to buy some of the most expensive video cards all the time .
Not to mention that higher - end cards tend to devalue faster than mid-range video cards .
Just like higher - end cars .
Now , if you absolutely need the fastest and most powerful video card with every new release , just to strike your ego and brag about it , go ahead , just be prepared to pay the price !
6- Listening to the recommendations of only one person .
The last , but certainly not the least of the common mistakes done when buying a video card : Listening to the opinion of a single person .
What ’s wrong with that ?
The person may be a fanboy , who would recommend an inferior product from Nvidia or from ATI simply because they prefer that company .
The person may not have a clue of what they ’re talking about .
Not everyone have vast knowledge on video cards .
That person ’s information may be outdated .
After all , new video cards are released on a regular base ( every couple of months , or even less )
Always make sure to get the opinion of many trusted people , ask around on forums , contact me , read plenty of reviews and comparisons .
You ’re going to spend a lot of your hard earned cash on that card , so make sure it is the right one for you .
Same goes for me .
Do n’t just listen to me , I ’m human too hehehe .
Conclusion :
Buying a video card requires thoughtful thinking .
With such a variety of cards available on the market , it may be confusing , so remember to avoid these mistakes , ask as many opinions as you can and shop around for good prices !
What has been your experience when buying video cards ?
Have you made any of the mistakes or were you going to ?
Do you have any tips to share with us or any mistake that I ’ve not mentionned that you think we should know of ?

When John Smith started his job as the IT Manager / Network Admin / Webmaster for a small , sixty - employee subsidiary , he thought that he had found a pretty sweet gig .
Everybody from his boss on down seemed reasonable , plus he got a laptop and a nice 19 " LCD monitor .
And best of all , the vending machine gave out drinks for $ 0.25 .
Overall , things went along pretty smoothly and , once he got to understand how everything was connected at the company , he brought up some very good suggestions on how to improve things further .
Including his idea for an VPN to secure transactions between his and the parent company .
But instead of a round of applause , John got a nervous " Well , your VPN idea sounds pretty solid , but ..... you 're going to need to run that past Dave first . "
Who 's Dave ?
If every silver lining has a dark cloud behind it , John 's dark cloud was Dave .
Hailing from the parent company in California , Dave was in a similar position as John , only the slightly larger scale of 500 or so employees .
However , unlike John , he had the annoying quirk of treating everyone as though they were beneath him both organizationally and intellectually .
While Dave did have seniority within the company , what made him " officially l33t " was his thirty - year friendship with the parent company 's CEO .
This volatile combination essentially made anything that Dave said " law " and , as such , Dave 's word was to be followed to the letter .
This was immediately to John when he pitched Dave on setting up a VPN during a conference call .
" What kind of suggestion is that to come from a rookie ?
I 've spent the better part of a half - decade shoring up our network , " countered Dave , " The network is secure .
Period .
End of story . "
" What about hackers ?
Viruses ?
Trojan hor --"
" You need to have outside access to the internet to be able to give a virus or hacker a foothold in .
My network design as tight as a steel drum and , besides , only I choose who is allowed access to the outside world .
There 's no way that I 'd chance some seventeen - year intern downloading some garbage off of FaceTube to ruin our network . "
Just as John was about to interject with the fact that the companies were connected by an unsecured link over the Internet , his manager quickly hit the mute button .
Based on previous experience , his manager realized that this was the part of the conference call where Dave would deliver an uninterruptable five - minute tirade that can be loosely translated as " No chance in hell " .
Once in a Million Years is Today
A few weeks after the ill - fated VPN discussion , John got an early afternoon call from a low level tech at the parent company .
The tech stated that they were experiencing some minor " technical difficulties " and were shutting down their entire network .
Shortly thereafter , John sent out a broadcast message to the employees that everyone would need to disconnect from the CRM system until further notice .
Later in the day , John got another call advising that the parent company 's network would be down for the entire weekend .
As a network admin , these two phone calls really piqued John 's interest .
What would cause a network admin to shut down a network in the middle of the business day , and then shut it down for an entire weekend ?
Only two things came to mind : they had been hacked or they got a virus .
But still , John wondered , what sort of attack could have penetrated Dave 's impenetrable security ?
John had no luck getting any information from the rank - and - file technicains , as they kept insisting that the " technical difficulties " were behind the shut down .
To address his curiosity , John decided to go straight to the top : the CEO .
He crafted a clever query with the honest intent “ to prevent this from happening here ” .
The CEO took the bait and said that he would try to find out why , but that he may not be able to get a straight answer right away , as things were still pretty hectic .
After waiting for two days with no answer , John received a voice mail message at home one evening .
It was the CEO .
He called to say that their network had been brought down by a virus but did n't provide any additional information .
At this point , John 's mind was full of questions :
Which virus ?
How did it get past the anti-virus ?
What did it affect ?
The bottom line was that this was huge and now John simply HAD to know the whole story .
The Truth Revealed
The next morning , hoping to soothe his mounting curiosity , John called the CEO back .
This time , he was going to ask specifics and he was n't going to take " technical difficulties " for an answer .
John was surprised to find that the CEO was remarkably forthcoming about the outage .
In fact , he sounded somewhat proud .
The CEO began , " Yeah , the funny part of it all , it turned out that someone within the company received a fake email from CNN , clicked on a link , and caused a virus spread like wildfire . "
" How did it get past the antivirus ? "
" Our servers and desktops did n't have any antivirus installed .
Dave does not believe in it . "
With John 's jaw now touching the floor in disbelief , " W - well , how did they remove the viruses from the computers ? "
" Dave went out and bought every copy of Norton Antivirus at the local Best Buy , installed it on the servers and desktops , cleaned the virus , and then uninstalled the software .
They have the servers done and have less than a third of the PCs to go .
We should be back to full capacity soon . "
The CEO continued , " This was a tragedy , but Dave has been doing this for twenty years now .
I trust that he knows what he 's doing . "
Gathering himself , John replied , " Oh ... Okay - well , that explains things .
Thank you for your time . "
As he hung up the phone , John could n't help but smile to himself a little .
The next time that Dave would take his holier - than - thou attitude , all that John would have to do is imagine Dave fumbling around with a handful of retail Norton discs , managing a corporate - wide install and uninstall of anti-virus software .
Though John had yet to earn the seniority , at least he no longer felt beneath Dave .
I 've always wanted to have the ability to make nice comic strips like this one .
Well done mate !
HOUSTON — While the Obama administration is stressing the need to diversify America ’s fuel supplies and wean the nation from its dependence on foreign oil , Saudi Arabia , the world ’s biggest oil exporter , is warning about a “ nightmare scenario ” if consumers seek to speed up the development of alternative fuels .
Ali al - Naimi , the Saudi oil minister , said Tuesday evening at an oil industry conference in Houston that a push to develop more renewable fuels might jeopardize investments in conventional fuels .
“ While the push for alternatives is important , we must also be mindful that efforts to rapidly promote alternatives could have a chilling effect on investment in the oil sector , ” he said .
“ A nightmare scenario would be created if alternative energy supplies fail to meet overly optimistic expectations , while traditional energy suppliers scale back investment due to expectations of declining demand for their products . ”
Saudi Arabia , along with other oil exporters , has long complained about what they view as the uncertainty of energy policies in Western nations .
This uncertainty , oil producers argue , hampers their ability to make long - term plans to develop their resources .
Mr. Naimi ’s comments came as the new administration considers ways to diversify the nation ’s fuel supplies and reduce oil consumption .
The United States is the world ’s top oil consumer .
At the moment , the slowing economy and collapsing demand for oil is freezing investments around the world .
The secretary - general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said recently that cartel members had canceled 35 drilling projects because of lower prices .
Over the past five years , Saudi Arabia has been spending billions to significantly increase its production capacity .
By the end of 2009 , it will be able to pump 12.5 billion million barrels a day , up from around 9 million barrels a day just a few years ago .
Mr. Naimi said that the expected growth in energy demand over the coming years meant that more supplies will be needed in future years .
He also stressed the need for consumers to be more efficient in their energy needs .
Renewable fuels also have a place , he said .
But he cautioned that the scale of the energy system was so large that , so far , only oil can meet the world ’s thirst for energy .
“ Over time , the world will likely transition away from the current fossil fuel - based energy economy , ” Mr. Naimi said .
“ However , we do n’t yet know which fuels or technologies will emerge on the path ahead .
Nor can we accurately predict how long this transition will take .
Recognizing the inherent uncertainty in the process of transition to new forms of energy , we must pursue an ‘ inclusive ’ energy strategy . ”
Mr. Naimi said that all forms of energy are required to meet the needs of a growing global population and the aspirations of billions of people in developing countries for greater prosperity .
“ All B.T.U.’s are welcome and needed — whether they come from renewable energy , nuclear power or fossil fuels , ” he said .

Server side JavaScript technology has been around for a long time .
Netscape offered server side JavaScript in their server software back in 1996 , and Helma has existed for a number of years as well .
But , server side development has changed a lot over the past few years .
Aptana ’s Jaxer gives an innovative view of how you can leverage a JavaScript environment running on both sides of the wire ( client and server ) .
Very convenient communication and the ability to easily share code between client and server are big benefits of running JavaScript on the server .
Jaxer and Helma are interesting projects , to be sure ( and there are many others ! ) .
But what I see missing from JavaScript on the server is not interesting projects , but rather a useful ecosystem .
People working in Python like to talk about the fragmentation of web frameworks and whatnot , but that ’s nothing compared to the fragmentation of JavaScript .
For example , JavaScript needs a cross-interpreter standard library .
Thankfully , some amount of standard library exists ( the part inherited from the browsers ) .
So , you get regular expressions and dates .
But , what about files and directories ?
Why ca n’t the same API be made to work in Rhino , Spidermonkey , V8 and JSCore ?
A handful of standard interfaces .
Connecting to a database and running queries is a well understood and common problem .
In Rhino , you get to use JDBC .
But , JavaScript really should have its own cross-interpreter standard like Python ’s DBAPI .
It should also be possible to take a webapp that was originally deployed behind an Apache module running Spidermonkey and then put it behind Jetty thanks to a standard web server / web app interface .
JavaScript needs a standard way to include other modules and for those modules to live in discreet namespaces .
There are easy ways to do namespaces , but there ’s no standard programmatic way to load a module ( once ! ) .
This is really important , because server side apps can include a lot of code and will likely mix and match parts that meet those standard interfaces .
There needs to be a way to package up code for deployment and distribution and further to install packages .
Linux people will correctly point out that they can just type “ apt get ” ( or yum , or whatever ) and their work is done .
But there are a lot of people using Macs and Windows who need a convenient way to get their development environments set up and to package up the code they write for deployment and for other people to use .
Part of the distribution and installation problem is a package repository .
I do n’t know if JSAN is the answer there , but I do know that an easy way to install a package and its dependencies makes a huge difference in how many libraries people will likely pull together in their apps .
And , on top of all of this goodness , we ’d get template engines , object relational mappers , middleware , packaged apps , etc .
In fact , many of those things already exist .
But , the problem is that they have no common basis to sit on .
And that ’s what prevents an ecosystem from growing .
If you search the Python Package Index for WSGI ( the Python standard for connecting webapps with web servers ) , you ’ll find 180 packages today … servers , middleware , full blown applications .
And those are just the packages that have “ WSGI ” in their listings .
That ’s what an ecosystem looks like .
And Java has one , and Ruby has one , and JavaScript needs one .
It ’s also worth noting that many of those WSGI components can run unchanged on CPython , Jython and IronPython , thanks to a common standard library .
JavaScript has a collection of implementations in C , as well as Java and .
Net implementations and there just needs to be a little agreement on some interfaces and such .
Libraries that run in all of those places can attract more users and , hopefully , more committers to help the libraries grow .
What I ’m describing here is not a technical problem .
It ’s a matter of people getting together and making a decision to step forward and start building up something bigger and cooler together .
To that end , I ’ve set up a new ServerJS group in hopes of getting the interested parties talking and maybe even to get us together face - to - face to produce some code and settle on some interfaces .
There ’s a tremendous collection of JavaScript code out there already , and let ’s see if we can make all of that code that much more valuable .
In the web developer tools group at Mozilla , we have a wide open charter to help software developers make the best use of the open web .
Doing our bit to help the server side JavaScript community grow and flourish can certainly be a part of that .
( Before someone says “ why not just use Ruby / Python / Java / C# ? ” let me just say that that is an entirely different question and I wo n’t address that in this post . )
Update :
The group is now called CommonJS .
The new film from Elton John 's Rocket Pictures will have the seven - foot extraterrestrial give the characters from Pride and Prejudice something more immediate to worry about than making advantageous marriages
It might prove something of a boon to those who reach for the remote control when yet another costume drama comes on television : Elton John 's Rocket Pictures is developing a new spin on Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice , this time featuring a nefarious seven - foot extraterrestrial with hideous mandibles and a penchant for human blood .
Yes , it 's Pride and Predator .
Will Clark , best known for his award - winning gothic comedy short The Amazing Trousers , will direct the film , which is being produced by Rocket partners Steve Hamilton Shaw and David Furnish .
" It felt like a fresh and funny way to blow apart the done - to - death Jane Austen genre by literally dropping this alien into the middle of a costume drama , where he stalks and slashes to horrific effect , " Furnish told Variety .
Both Pride and Prejudice and Predator have been twisted into a variety of new forms over the past two decades .
Gurinder Chadha 's 2004 musical Bride and Prejudice saw Austen 's romance transplanted in Bollywood , while Alien vs Predator saw the monster from John McTiernan 's 1987 original taking on Ridley Scott 's murderous horrors .
The news does come as something of a surprise , however , as 20th Century Fox had reportedly been planning a solo reboot for its Predator franchise , following critical scorn for 2007's Aliens vs Predator – Requiem .
Rocket is n't averse to adding its own spin to iconic titles : it also has the animated Shakespeare spoof Gnomeo and Juliet in the works , featuring the voice of James McAvoy as a lovelorn pixie .
Check out this awesome video of last Saturday ’s 2nd Annual Minneapolis Art Sled Rally held at Powderhorn Park .
The creativity and fun totally blew me away , and even better than art cars , catastrophic crashes are encouraged !
There were awesomely geeky sleds like the above 20 - sider , a Star Wars landspeeder , and a great sisyphean Viking warrior rolling downhill with his boulder .

South Sixteenth Hi Jinks , a group of artists and neighborhood residents , organized the rally to get people out into the tundra and as a tribute to winter activities of yore :
We chose to create a mass sledding spectacle , in part , for the history of mass winter events at Powderhorn Park that began around a hundred years ago .
You will find pictures of incredible pageantry , throngs of people and fantastically sculptured luge tracks in Powderhorn from the early 1900s on up through the sixties .
We would like to see this organized enthusiasm for winter activities continue .

Midweek Mental Greening
Last week , I told you about a Boston Globe article that discussed the negative mental health effects global warming is having on some people , and promised you some tips on how to deal with those kinds of effects – whether the issue is global warming , poverty , animal rights or any other matter that has you upset .
Check them out below .
Take action and get involved .
As I mentioned last week , sitting around and twiddling my thumbs has never been my thing .
One of the best ways you can ensure something is being done is to do something .
Whether it ’s as easy as making sure your signature is on the petitions for causes you believe in or as involved as organizing a local chapter of your favorite nonprofit , you ’ll feel better about yourself and the problem or issue with which you ’re concerned .
But remember , the goal is to make a difference and help you decrease some of your stress and worries – not add to them – so whatever you do , make sure it ’s within your means and abilities .
In other words , do n’t go out and commit yourself to a new hybrid ( and the extra monthly payments and insurance costs ) if you ca n’t afford it .
Instead , consider walking , taking the bus , or getting a bike .
Understand that you are not all - powerful .
Nearly two years ago , I became a vegetarian – not because I did n’t like meat ( though I can say I do n’t now ) , but because I just could n’t stand what I ’d been learning about the meat industry .
Upon hearing about my new lifestyle , people kept asking me , “ Do you honestly think you ’re making a difference ?
You ’re just one person – you ’re probably not even making a dent . ”
I thought long and hard about this and eventually realized my answer : “ I understand that I ca n’t control the actions of others , but I can control my own .
I can say I am making sure that I am doing what I feel is right . ”
You are not the god to whom you pray , and you do not have control over every single thing .
No matter how convincing you are , there are always going to be people who just do n’t see things your way , and no matter how hard you work , you ca n’t do it all .
You do , however , have control over yourself .
You can control your own actions .
Relish that control , and use it well .
It does make a difference .
Share the burden .
This may mean talking with a therapist , getting some free counseling from your friends , or even soliciting the help of others when it comes to an event you ’ve planned or a cause in which you believe .
Keeping things all bottled up , and placing all the responsibilities on your own shoulders , is n’t healthy and can wreak potentially devastating havoc on your psyche .
Learning how to vent in a healthy way or delegate tasks to others who share your concerns and goals will help reduce your stress and anxiety .
Do n’t neglect yourself .
It ’s possible to become so involved with whatever cause you ’re promoting or worries you have that you forget to take care of both your physical and mental well - being .
Whether they ’re basic things like nutrition and plenty of sleep or treats like long , relaxing baths and much - needed vacations , do n’t forget to work them into your schedule .
Remember :
You wo n’t be any good to anyone else if you are n’t good to yourself .
Cliché , yes – but true nonetheless .
Do n’t forget to enjoy the present .
I did n’t agree with his overall opinion , but American Thinker ’s Matt Spivey did make an excellent point in regard to the things that could happen “ in the next 100 years . ”
Be careful not to get so absorbed in the future that you forget to enjoy the present .
Your loved ones , your pets , your hobbies , snowy hills perfect for sleighs and warm sunshine that feels great on your face – these things are here today .
Now .
In the present .
They wo n’t be around forever , so do n’t forget to enjoy them while they are here .
So , what do you think ?
Are these tips you ’ve used already , or do you have a few more to share that might help others ?
It ’s Possible to Nurture Yourself and Mother Nature
The statement “ beauty is only skin deep ” is generally treated as a proverb .
What the adage so pithily implies is that the outward appearance of a person counts for nothing , that what lies beneath our skin – ie , our minds / personality - is what really matters .
I say , not necessarily .
Physical beauty may be literally superficial but beauty is actually a talent , no different from any other talent .
Hear me out .
A talent is a natural aptitude .
It is neither learned nor earned .
You ’re born with it .
It ’s a gift .
I fail to see the inherent difference between being born naturally athletic or musical , and being born extraordinarily attractive .
I ’m not suggesting that what ’s “ inside ” a person does n’t matter , nor am I saying we should obsess over physical appearance .
I ’m just bothered by the deeper implications here .
Beauty is often resented , the very attractive seen as undeserving of their gift because they generally are n’t required to cultivate interesting personalities as a result of being so beautiful .
Sure .
But here ’s where my problem is , and it ’s twofold .
One , the concept of “ deserving ” an ability only seems to apply to beauty , even though athletes , rockstars , artists , can all be “ undeserving ” assholes and idiots .
The beautiful must self - deprecate their looks in order to seem worthy , yet Lebron James does n't need to act like being badass at basketball is meaningless .
Could a model get away with saying “ I want to be the hottest girl in the world ” without a backlash ?
Kinda hypocritical I think .
Two , is n’t what ’s “ inside ” us a talent too ?
You ’re either born with an aptitude for learning , or not .
With an aptitude for humor , or not .
People with amazing personalities are special and rare too .
Most people are just as average inside as they are out .
Is being ugly and stupid better than being hot and stupid ?
No .
So our little proverb is just saying that someone who is unattractive and smart is better than someone who is attractive and dumb .
What I ’m saying is : why must they be ranked ?
Are n’t both great ?
I ’m sorry that some people get eating disorders , but the demonization we place on aspiring to be beautiful – developing a skill for those not “ gifted ” - is really just choosing to embrace mediocrity for the sake of boosting people ’s self - esteem .
It ’s sour grapes .
If a guitar player said they wanted to get as good as Clapton , would you say , “ That ’s awful .
I think that sort of thing gives other guitar players an unhealthy image to live up to . ”
Of course not .
I do n’t want ugly smart people modeling underwear , just like I do n’t want supermodels writing the novels I read or programming my computer software .
Appreciate excellence where it ’s due .
If you ca n’t be happy about the way you look without shitting on hot people , I not sure you qualify as having “ inner beauty ” anyway .
Those who are inspired by a model other than Nature , a mistress above all masters , are laboring in vain .
– Leonardo Da Vinci
Biomimicry –
The practice of developing sustainable human technologies inspired by nature .
Sometimes called Biomimetics or Bionics , it ’s basically biologically inspired engineering .
1. Velcro
The most famous example of biomimicry was the invention of Velcro brand fasteners .
Invented in 1941 by Swiss engineer George de Mestral , who took the idea from the burrs that stuck tenaciously to his dog ’s hair .
Under the microscope he noted the tiny hooks on the end of the burr ’s spines that caught anything with a loop – such as clothing , hair or animal fur .
The 2 - part Velcro fastener system uses strips or patches of a hooked material opposite strips or patches of a loose - looped weave of nylon that holds the hooks .
Coolest application : Championship Velcro Jumping , first made popular in 1984 by David Letterman .
2. Passive Cooling
The high - rise Eastgate Centre building in Harare , Zimbabwe was designed to mimic the way that those tower - building termites in Africa construct their mounds to maintain a constant temperature .
The insects do this by constantly opening and closing vents throughout the mound to manage convection currents of air – cooler air is drawn in from open lower sections while hot air escapes through chimneys .
The innovative building uses similar design and air circulation planning while consuming less than 10 % of the energy used in similar sized conventional buildings !
3. Gecko Tape
Ever wanted to walk up walls or across ceilings ?
Gecko
Tape may be the way to do it .
The tape is a material covered with nanoscopic hairs that mimic those found on the feet of gecko lizards .
These millions of tiny , flexible hairs exert van der Waals forces that provide a powerful adhesive effect .
Applications include underwater and space station uses , so researchers from a number of institutions are working hard .
They wo n’t be mass producing gecko tape sneakers and gloves any time soon , so Spiderman wannabes will have to wait awhile longer , while hoping other biomimetic researchers get around to inventing the necessary web - throwers .
4. Whalepower Wind Turbine
Inspired by the flippers humpback whales use to enable their surprising agility in the water , WhalePower has developed turbine blades with bumps called tubercles on the leading edge that promise greater efficiency in applications from wind turbines to hydroelectric turbines , irrigation pumps to ventilation fans .
Compared to smooth surface fins , the bumpy humpback ones have 32 % less drag and an 8 % increased lift in their movement through air or water .
Using such blades to catch the wind as communities and nations switch to renewable sources could provide a 20 % increase in efficiency that will help to make wind power generation fully competitive with other alternatives .
5. Lotus Effect Hydrophobia
They call it “ superhydrophobicity , ” but it ’s really a biomimetic application of what is known as the Lotus Effect .
The surface of lotus leaves are bumpy , and this causes water to bead as well as to pick up surface contaminates in the process .
The water rolls off , taking the contaminates with it .
Researchers have developed ways to chemically treat the surface of plastics and metal to evoke the same effect .
Applications are nearly endless , and not just making windshield wipers and car wax jobs obsolete .
Lots of researchers are working on it , and General Electric ’s Global Research Center is busy developing coatings for commercial application right now .
6. Self - Healing Plastics
Consider the body ’s power to heal itself of scrapes and cuts .
The value of the same sort of process in light polymer composites that can be used to produce things like aircraft fuselage becomes obvious .
The new composite materials being developed are called self - healing plastics .
They are made from hollow fibers filled with epoxy resin that is released if the fibers suffer serious stresses and cracks .
This creates a ‘ scab ’ nearly as strong as the original material .
Such self - healing materials could be used to make planes , cars and even spacecraft that will be lighter , more fuel efficient , and safer .
7 . The Golden Streamlining Principle
A company called PAX Scientific out of San Rafael , California has been developing air and fluid movement technologies based on such beautiful and recurring natural designs as the Fibonacci sequence , logarithmic spirals and the Golden Ratio .
These shapes align with the observation that the path of least resistance in this universe is n’t a straight line .
Put all this together and you get the “ Streamlining Principle , ” being applied to fans , mixers , impellers and such that move air and liquids around in systems .
Such fans on motors , compressors and pumps of all sizes and in all applications could save at least 15 % of all the electricity consumed in the US .
8. Artificial Photosynthesis
We all learn about photosynthesis in school , the way that green plants use chlorophyll to convert sunlight , water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen .
The quest to reproduce the process technologically is called Artificial Photosynthesis , and is envisioned as a means of using sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for use as a clean fuel for vehicles as well as a way to use excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
The process could make hydrogen fuel cells an efficient , self - recharging and less expensive way to create and store energy applicable in home and industrial systems .
9. Bionic Car
In another biomimetic development on the automotive front , DaimlerChrysler has developed a new concept car from Mercedes - Benz based on the shape of an odd tropical fish – the Bionic Car .
Using the shape of the tropical boxfish , designers achieved an aerodynamic ideal that boasts 20 % less fuel consumption and as much as an 80 % reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions .
The diesel - powered compact will get about 70 miles per gallon , and can run just fine on biodiesel fuel .
It ’s been a few years since development , so we can hope this car will be available soon !
10 . Morphing Aircraft Wings
Using inspiration from both birds and fish , scientists from Penn State University developed Morphing Airplane Wings that change shape depending on the speed and duration of flight .
Different birds have differently shaped wings useful for the speeds at which they fly , as well as for sustaining flight speeds over long distances using the least amount of energy .
The scientists built a compliant , shape - changing truss understructure for the wings , then covered it with scales that can slide over one another to accommodate the in - flight shape changes .
When deployed in new aircraft ( and drone ) models , the wings are expected to conserve fuel and enable faster flights over longer distances .
11 . Friction - Reducing Sharkskin
One of the best ways to reduce reliance on fossil fuels is to achieve more efficient use of the energy we do consume .
Inspired by the evolved ability of shark ’s skin to reduce drag by manipulating the boundary layer flow as the fish swims , researchers are developing coatings for ship ’s hulls , submarines , aircraft fuselage , and even swimwear for humans .
Based on the varying shape and texture of shark ’s skin over its body , Speedo ’s Fastskin FSII swimsuits made their appearance at the Bejing Olympics and may have helped US swimmer Michael Phelps to his record eight gold medals in that competition , and the rest of the team as well .
12 . Diatomaceous Nanotech
They call it Biosilification , and it ’s the genetic engineering of the tiny , single - celled algae known as diatoms in order to mass produce silicon - based nanodevices and nanotubes for specific uses .
Living diatoms reliably manufacture working valves of various shapes and sizes that can be used in nanodevices to deliver drugs to specific targets in the body , as chemostats in chemical engineering applications , and in colonies as nanotubes for solar collectors and artificial photosynthetic processes .
Their silicon skeletons can provide specialized sensors and filters for uses in chemical engineering and defense applications .
13 . Glo-Fish
Glow - in - the - dark aquarium fish may not fulfill a needful ecological role at the present time , but they ’re a fun – and lucrative – application of fluorescent proteins discovered in jellyfish while researchers are busily developing further biochemical tools from this Nobel Prizewinning discovery .
The protein can be attached to other molecules of interest so they can be followed for understanding of their functions in living organisms , very useful in medical research .
For the fish , the proteins serve the purpose of simply being very cool – they come in several colors !
14 . Insect - Inspired Autonomous Robots
While most of us are accustomed to thinking about futuristic robotics as something that looks and moves just like a human , humans are probably not the best biological model for really useful robots .
For mobility , insect - like ability to cover varied terrain , climb surfaces and provide stability seems to work better .
Insect eyes offer greater resolution and panoramic range for exploring places people cannot go , and the ability to quickly adapt to changing environments ( or even to spy on enemies undetected ) make those annoying toy insect robots a forerunner for future applications in exploration and defense .
15 . Butterfly - Inspired Displays
By mimicking the way light reflects from the scales on a butterfly ’s wings , the Qualcomm company has developed Mirasol Displays that make use of the reflected light principle with an understanding of how human beings perceive that light .
Using an interferometric modulator [ IMOD ] element in a two - plate conductive system , the display uses near - zero power whenever the displayed image is static while at the same time offering a refresh rate fast enough for video .
Perfect for ‘ smart ’ hand - held devices , already deployed in many , and a battery - saver extraordinaire !
To the untrained ear , riot grrrl music sounded like tone - deaf girls shrieking obscenities into a microphone .
To alienated teenage girls ’ ears , however , it sounded like a revolution .
Riot grrrl was an underground punk movement : it was a subculture , an ethos and a music scene .
Riot grrrl 's most celebrated musicians were novices with little musical experience who compensated for it with enthusiasm and a powerful feminist message .
It may have been mediocre music , but riot grrrl gave young women a place in the greater punk scene , an arena from which they had traditionally been excluded .
Like thousands of other teenage girls coming of age in the early 1990s , I first caught wind of riot grrrl via Sassy magazine , where Bratmobile guitarist Erin Smith had interned .
Bratmobile 's 1993 album Pottymouth was mind - blowing for me .
Much like the Ramones singing about wanting to sniff glue , Bratmobile carried the punk torch in singing inane lyrics that sort of addressed deeper issues .
" We 're so cool yeah , yeah , fuck you too , cool schmool , " they sang in the song " Cool Schmool , " and I was entranced .
Finally , a band that spoke my language .
Having spent most of my life listening to slick studio productions by Vanilla Ice , Nirvana and Debbie Gibson , I was gobstruck the first time I listened to Pottymouth .
With no particular musical talent to speak of , Bratmobile managed to make an album that inspired legions of girls to start bands and write bold statements on their shirts with Sharpie markers .
This is what it would sound like if all of my 13 - year - old friends and I had a band .
It was unabashedly adolescent and snotty , just like I was .
Listening to Bratmobile opened up a whole new world to me , as well as introducing me to countless other bands .
Later , when I was in high school , I went to see Sleater - Kinney play at San Francisco 's Epicenter Zone .
The Epicenter was a record store and a tiny all - ages music club .
It was incredibly youth - centric , as was the riot grrrl movement that had been the backdrop for Sleater - Kinney 's creation .
Sleater - Kinney was formed during the tail end of the riot grrrl movement , and stood apart from other bands in that they had serious musical chops and crossover appeal .
By the time they broke up in 2006 they had received widespread critical acclaim , much of it from male rock critics like Greil Marcus , but that night , in 1995 , the Epicenter was filled with teenage girls .
I stood up front in my Dr. Marten Mary Janes and crossed my arms uncomfortably , bobbing my head awkwardly to the music .
I did n't know what to do at a show like this — I was used to being pressed uncomfortably against a sea of men , spending my time trying not to get hit by the mosh pit or groped .
But this was different .
The music was just as angry and insistent as any of the other punk shows I had ever been to , except that here I was accepted , I was safe .
I think it 's hard to remember how self - conscious and even frightening , being a woman at that age is .
That night , though , I was able to delight in being a teenage girl .
The Sleater - Kinney show was one of the first spaces I had been in that seemed to help relieve some of the uncomfortability of being a girl , if only because of the nearly all - female audience and the fact that I was about a foot away from the band .
" Girls up front " was something that many riot grrrl bands took seriously — they would disband the all - male mosh pits and encourage girls to move closer to the stage .
Most girls , myself included , had grown used to associating creeping towards the front with increasing acts of male aggression and were thrilled to get to finally get to have unobstructed views of our favorite bands .
The riot grrrl scene gave teenage girls access to feminism , a word that many did n’t fundamentally understand or had been taught was derogatory , something to be avoided .
Feminism seemed like something that was rooted in a former time and belonged to our mothers and grandmothers .
Riot grrrl , though , was feminism designed for a young audience .
Feminism and access to the male - dominated punk scene were riot grrrl ’s most obvious focus , but so was fighting racism , classism , homophobia , domestic and sexual abuse , ageism , sexism , and eating disorders .
Although detractors have pointed out that the riot grrrl movement was comprised almost entirely of white , middle or upper class women in their teens and early 20s , it nevertheless inspired those same young women with political awareness that they may not have been exposed to in the suburbs otherwise .
So maybe I would n't go to a Gay - Straight Alliance meeting today ( my own teenage naïveté is sort of adorable now ) but being exposed to the politics that I was as a teenager positively shaped my political beliefs as an adult .
In addition , riot grrrl gave us something to do .
Hundreds of girls were publishing zines , which usually involved a lot of glue sticks and Xeroxing .
They were the blogs of the pre-broadband generation where girls cut-and - pasted drawings and wrote stories about their lives .
They were starting bands and doing stand - up poetry and screen printing t- shirts and reclaiming words like “ whore ” and “ slut ” by writing them on their stomachs in magic marker .
They were eschewing the usual teenage hobby of taking drugs in favor of destroying the patriarchy and making out with each other .
More than just a feeling of empowerment , riot grrrl created a community .
When I went away to college at 17 I was terrified .
On the first day , as I sat waiting for my roommate to arrive I flipped through the pages of The Village Voice and saw a listing for a Sleater - Kinney show , a small comfort .
When the girl across the hall starting moving her stuff in , I took note of her choppy a - line bob fastened with a bobby pin and giant creeper shoes and with feigned casualness , went and stood in her doorway .
After introducing myself , I asked if she liked Sleater - Kinney .
Like , duh .
As it turns out , Fran played the guitar and her Long Island band , The Rulers , had opened for Sleater - Kinney earlier that year .
A few weeks later , as an assignment for a web design course , Fran and I started creating a fan site called The Sleater - Kinney Media Empire .
When we heard that a girl at Syracuse University had somehow managed to get the university to put on a show with Sleater - Kinney and Lois , an Olympia folk - punk musician , as part of the " Symposium on Women in Rock , " we drove eight hours , in what could be considered a riot grrrl pilgrimage , to see them .
It is with great shame I admit that I wore a shirt that Fran had screen - printed in her high school art class that said " I hate danger , I love fucking " — the name of a Bikini Kill 7 " — and a Harley - Davidson cap to the gig .
I look back on this ensemble with a mixture of awe and shame ; I must have thought that is what one wore to these sorts of feminist events .
The DIY , anti-celebrity ethos of riot grrrl gave us unique access to our favorite bands .
The scene was so small and welcoming that because of our fan site , we put on the guest list for all of Sleater - Kinney ’s shows .
Nattles of the Cold Cold Hearts made me a t- shirt .
Squid , the bass player of the Lunachicks and also a tattoo artist , tattooed lines of cartoon skulls that Fran had drawn across my back .
When we went to Portland , the burgeoning queer - punk mecca , we stayed with a zine - maker and the queercore band The Third Sex .
Just days ago I had been listening to their album , and now their drummer , Killer , was making me banana pancakes for breakfast .
Later , we drove to Olympia , the riot grrrl motherland , and found that Sleater - Kinney ’s publicist had left us a package with an advance copy of their upcoming album for us .
It was n’t because we had done anything particularly important , it was just because we were there and we were excited .
And that was what I loved about the girl punk scene : it was inspiring and accessible .
But there were things I did n’t love , too .
After riot grrrl started to fade out , the queercore scene was still going strong and straight girls were often taken less seriously , as if you could n’t be a feminist if you were still screwing men .
It became more about identity politics and less about fun and music .
But even the music started to lose its appeal as I got older .
In retrospect , maybe the music was lousy , but that 's exactly what was so terrific about it .
It was loud , it was fun , it was girls shrieking " fuck you . "
It was rebellious and inspiring and gave me encouragement to try creative endeavors of my own .
But as an adult , I find the bands of my girlhood — Bratmobile , Heavens to Betsey , Bikini Kill , Excuse 17 — nearly unlistenable .
That may be because I ’ve already gotten what I needed from riot grrrl , and can now keep those fond , nostalgic memories far away from my stereo .
Ann Coulter gets a verbal smackdown on The View .
Ann Coulter is on TV blabbling about how the liberals are responsible for the things that are happening .
We know she always try to push boundaries always writing provocatively to get attention .
Whoop called her out on that during the episode , saying “ its an act ”
Watch and enjoy !
Binyam Mohamed , a former UK resident who is flying home after four years of incarceration at Guantánamo Bay , today accused Britain of involvement in his alleged torture .
" I have to say , more in sadness than in anger , that many have been complicit in my own horrors over the past seven years , " he said in a statement his lawyers released shortly before the chartered plane bringing him back from the US detention camp in Cuba was due to land at RAF Northolt , near London .
" For myself , the very worst moment came when I realised in Morocco that the people who were torturing me were receiving questions and materials from British intelligence , " he said .
" I have met with British intelligence in Pakistan .
I had been open with them .
Yet the very people who I had hoped would come to my rescue I later realised had allied themselves with my abusers .
" I am not asking for vengeance , only that the truth should be made known so that nobody in the future should have to endure what I have endured . "
The Ethiopian - born 30 - year - old has previously accused the UK of having knowledge of what he says was widespread torture during his time in detention , and of being involved in the interrogation process by providing and receiving information .
The Metropolitan police said officers from its anti-terrorism unit were on board the plane with Mohamed , as well as uniformed police acting as an escort .
Mohamed 's plane is expected to land at around 1 pm .
He will be met by a doctor and his UK lawyers , Clive Stafford Smith and Gareth Peirce , along with family members .
Mohamed was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and then secretly flown by the CIA to Morocco where he says he was brutally tortured .
He was subsequently flown to Afghanistan and then to the US camp in Cuba .
In his statement today , Mohamed said he would not be able to speak publicly about his experiences for some time .
" I hope you will understand that after everything I have been through I am neither physically nor mentally capable of facing the media on the moment of my arrival back to Britain , " he said .
" I have been through an experience that I never thought to encounter in my darkest nightmares .
" Before this ordeal , torture was an abstract word to me .
I could never have imagined that I would be its victim .
It is still difficult for me to believe that I was abducted , hauled from one country to the next , and tortured in medieval ways - all orchestrated by the United States government .
" While I want to recover , and put it all as far in the past as I can , I also know I have an obligation to the people who still remain in those torture chambers .
" My own despair was greatest when I thought that everyone had abandoned me .
I have a duty to make sure that nobody else is forgotten . "
Mohamed ended a month - long hunger strike 10 days ago after visits from his lawyers , Foreign Office officials and a UK doctor , who passed him fit to travel .
He has agreed to abide by several voluntary security measures in Britain including regular reports to a police station , the Guardian has learned .
His lawyers readily agreed to the undertakings as Mohamed " has nothing to hide " , said Stafford Smith , director of Reprieve , the human rights group that represents him .
Mohamed and his lawyers rejected a gagging order the US tried to impose on him , the Guardian understands .
Stafford Smith , said he was " absolutely " convinced of Mohamed 's innocence .
" If anyone wants to put him on trial , in the immortal words of George Bush , bring them on , " he said .
Mohamed 's return to the UK after seven years in custody comes as pressure is building on the British and US governments to disclose evidence of his alleged torture and what the UK agencies MI5 and MI6 allegedly knew about it .
There is a growing belief that documentary evidence exists pointing to Downing Street 's awareness of allegations of the serious mistreatment of Mohamed between 2002 when he was first seized in Pakistan and 2004 when he was abducted and flown to Guantánamo Bay .
US documents that high court judges say contain " powerful evidence " relating to Mohamed 's allegations are being suppressed because , the judges said this month , David Miliband , the foreign secretary , argued that their disclosure would damage Britain 's national security .
It would do so , he argued , because the US had warned it might cut off intelligence co-operation if the papers were released .
The documents may show how British officials allegedly co-operated with the CIA even though they did not know where Mohamed was being held and in what conditions .
The CIA refused to tell MI5 of his whereabouts – it is now known he was being held in Morocco – after an MI5 officer questioned him when he was being detained incognito in Pakistan .
Lord Carlile QC , the government 's independent reviewer of terror laws , yesterday called on Miliband to release details from the documents about Mohamed 's treatment .
Carlile told the Sunday Telegraph : " If wrong has been done by any British official it would be better to say so now than after a lengthy period of attrition .
If there is a sore here it should be lanced as soon as possible .
This has gone on for a long time . "
Ubuntu 9.04 is getting closer and closer to the final release and we thought that it would be nice to give you guys a sneak peek at some of the upcoming features .
The new version of Ubuntu will be released in less than two months , on April 23rd , and it will be dubbed Jaunty Jackalope .
One of these new features was introduced with tonight 's updates and it is a brand new login screen a.k.a. GDM ( GNOME Display Manager ) theme , which is black and has a nice Ubuntu logo in the right bottom corner .
The new login screen is entitled " Human " and it was created by Kenneth Wimer and Mat Tomaszewski for Canonical .
Later edit :
The login screen was slightly modified on March 19th .
Therefore we 've replaced the screenshots with the new design !

Talking about new features ... here 's another sneak peek at the revamped " Where are you ? " step of the Ubiquity installer ...
Last but not least , here 's a screenshot of the new notification system implemented last week in Ubuntu 9.04 ...
Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha ( Daily Build 20090221 ) showcasing the new notifications .
This is NOT the default look of Ubuntu 9.04 .
The theme and wallpaper are third - party !
For the Jaunty Jackalope , the development team will focus their efforts to fulfill certain tasks that are intended to make Ubuntu 9.04 the reflection of the most efficient understanding of the open source ensemble .
One of these is the boot time decrease , mostly when the OS is tailored to a specific device , but also in the standard case .
This decrease has also been made possible thanks to the evolutionary EXT4 file system .
Among other new features in Ubuntu 9.04 is the famous GNOME 2.26 desktop environment , which brings lots and lots of improvements in many areas , such as Evolution , GNOME Control Center , GNOME Media , GNOME Power Manager , etc. Ubuntu 9.04 's kernel will be based on the latest version of Linux kernel 2.6.28 , which will offer support for many new devices .
Moreover , applications such as OpenOffice.org 3.0.1 , The GIMP 2.6.6 , Mozilla Firefox 3.0.7 and Thunderbird 2.0.0.21 , Transmission 1.51 Pidgin 2.5.5 will also be present in the final release of Ubuntu 9.04 ( Jaunty Jackalope ) .
Do n't forget to visit our website on Friday for the usual Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha 5 Screenshot Tour , where we will unveil more of Jaunty 's new features .

Hello !
Deep freeze ===========
As you 've probably read by now , the Installer Team has announced [ 1 ] the availability of the second , and hopefully final , release candidate for the Lenny installer .
Testing of these images is highly encouraged .
Following the plan outlined in the previous release update [ 2 ] , we are now in deep freeze , which means that we 'll only be migrating to testing packages that fix RC bugs .
Please do n't send other types of unblock requests , unless you assess that our time hearing your reasons will be time well spent ; thanks in advance .
( If you sent a request some time ago , please follow - up to the original mail as soon as possible , in case it has been forgotten . )
We 're also deactivating the " freeze - exception " hint file , which provided automatic freeze exceptions for package versions that were uploaded prior to the start of the freeze .
A total of 1197 exceptions were automatically granted , of which 983 managed to migrate in time for Lenny . [ 1 ] :
http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/01/msg00009.html [ 2 ] : http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/12/msg00006.html
Schedule ========
The weekend of February 14th is going to be our tentative target for release .
We 've checked with all the involved teams ( which are many ! ) , and the date works for all of them .
The intention is only to lift that date if something really critical pops up that is not possible to handle as an errata , or if we end up technically unable to release that weekend ( eg. , a needed machine crashes ) .
Every other fix that does n't make it in time will be r1 material .
Please be sure to contact us about the RC fixes you 'd like included in the point release !
( As an example of this , the new archive key [ 3 ] did not came in time to make it into the d-i rc2 images .
We assessed the situation , and this only poses a problem for installing testing / squeeze with the Lenny installer , and once the new key is in use .
So , we 'll be updating the installer in 5.0r1 for this .
[ NB : the key will be in Lenny in the debian - archive - keyring package ; only in the installer images is missing . ])
Also , our intent is that there will be a " Lenny and a half " release half - way through the Squeeze release cycle , similarly to what was done for Etch , where additional hardware support will be considered . [ 3 ] :
http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/01/msg00008.html
Remaining RC bugs =================
So , as hinted in the previous release update , it 's time to run really fast towards a release .
Here 's what we 're going to propose regarding the remaining RC bugs .
We 'll be working against the list of RC bugs affecting Lenny that are not fixed in unstable : http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php?bydist=both&sortby=bugnr&new=7&refresh=1800
Members of the Release Team will be adding comments to that list , in the form : Lenny : can - defer Lenny : will - remove Lenny : is - blocker
Which mean , respectively , that a fix can be deferred to r1 ( we expect most of the bugs will fall in this category ) , or the package will be removed prior to the release ( if having it ship with Lenny hurts more than the package being absent from the release ) , or that it must absolutely be fixed .
When we add an " is- blocker " tag , we 'll send a mail to - devel as well , though it is our hope that there wo n't be any .
Also , if you disagree with any of the labellings , please send your rationale to - release .
Nevertheless , fixes for " can-defer " or " will - remove " bugs will be * very * welcome .
In fact , you are very much encouraged to go over the list yourself , and apply * your * judgement as to what bugs should be blockers , and then fix them , or convince somebody to fix them .
We 'll be doing our best to ensure all uploaded fixes make it into Lenny r0 .
As always , you need not send unblock requests for RC bug fixes , but you 're welcome to if you prefer to receive an explicit ACK that it 's been unblocked .
Finally , if you can't fix RC bugs , maybe you can help with the Release Notes .
A call for help was sent back in November [ 4 ] , and this is the last opportunity to provide any patches before the coordinators set a freeze date for translators to work . [ 4 ] :
http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/2008/11/msg00034.html
( Note that since that announcement , the Release Notes have moved from / branches / lenny to / trunk . )
Cheers , -- Adeodato Simó Debian Release Team

CENTCOM Commander Gen. David Petraeus and Multinational Force Iraq ( MNF - I ) Commander Gen. Ray Odierno have submitted assessments of Iraq combat - troop withdrawal plans to President Barack Obama based on the premise that his 16 - month withdrawal plan would pose significantly greater risk to " security gains " than the 23 - month plan they favor .
But a senior commander in Iraq appeared to contradict that premise last week by declaring that security gains in the Shi’ite provinces of Iraq are " permanent , " and a field commander in Iraq says there is no objective basis for any Petraeus - Odierno finding that Obama ’s plan carries greater risk than their 23 - month plan .
Maj . Gen. Michael Oates , U.S. commander for the eight southern provinces of Iraq , denied in remarks to reporters Feb. 12 that the security gains in that region were fragile , contrary to the premise that Odierno has publicly asserted .
Oates cited the dramatic reduction in activities by Shi’ite militia fighters and the holding of the Jan. 31 elections without any major attacks .
In a previous press briefing Jan. 14 , Oates had told reporters that , even if violence were to break out after provincial elections , Iraqi security forces " are well prepared to handle that . "
He also cast doubt on Iranian involvement with Shi’ite militias in the south , saying he had " no evidence or reports of people training in Iran , " despite periodic " anecdotal intelligence reports " of such training camps .
Oates said he had already reassigned combat forces in the region to non-combat missions , either training or economic development , despite grumbling by soldiers .
Although Oates did not explicitly address the issue of drawdown plans , he has been known to favor a more rapid withdrawal from Iraq than Petraeus and Odierno for some time , according to a military officer who served under Odierno and is familiar with Oates ’ views .
" His belief is that we need to get out of the country and let the Iraqis take responsibility for their areas , " the officer , who asked not to be identified , told IPS .
A field commander in Iraq , who spoke with IPS on the understanding that he would not be identified , asserted flatly that there is no greater risk associated with President Obama ’s 16 - month withdrawal plan than with the 23 - month plan , contrary to Petraeus and Odierno .
The officer said that the U.S. military presence has already " passed the tipping point of diminishing returns " in relation to stability and security in Iraq .
" The longer we stay now , the less we achieve , " he said .
Neither Petraeus nor Odierno has offered any public explanation for their argument that a 16 - month drawdown plan would pose greater risk to stability and security than one lasting seven months longer .
However , Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations , an adviser to Petraeus , argued in Foreign Affairs last fall that the U.S. military presence is " essential to stabilize a system of local ceasefires " between Sunnis and Shi’ites and between the militias loyal to Moqtada al - Sadr and the Shi’ite - dominated government .
But the field commander now serving in Iraq told IPS that the U.S. military mission in Iraq has " little correlation " with the present cease - fire between Sunnis and Shi’ites .
The Sunni-Shi’ite conflict , said the officer , " is now one for political supremacy , not a counterinsurgency as defined in the Army ’s counterinsurgency manual . "
He said he had been briefed recently on the U.S. mission in Iraq and had been told it is still a counterinsurgency mission , as it has been for several years .
There was " no mention of any peacekeeping function aimed at maintaining cease - fires , " the officer said .
The idea of enforcing ceasefires is advocated by some in the U.S. command , he said , but that would be " a very different mission from counterinsurgency . "
Biddle confirmed in an interview with IPS that the U.S. military peacekeeping role he advocates has not been adopted by the MNF - I command .
A number of officers in the command , he said , still believe the U.S. objective in Iraq is " the gradual elimination " of all forces competing with the Iraqi government ’s security forces .
Ironically , it was Biddle who revealed in congressional testimony last April that the reduction in sectarian violence in and around Baghdad beginning in 2007 for which Odierno had credited the U.S. troop surge was actually the result of the heavy defeat of Sunni insurgent forces in a year - long battle with Shi’ite militias for control of Baghdad in 2006 .
Biddle observed that the U.S. military tried to stop the sectarian violence but played " no decisive role " in the ultimate cease - fire between Sunni and Shi’ite .
In an online discussion on the Washington Post Web site Feb. 9 , Biddle conceded that U.S. troop strength had been insufficient in 2006 to prevent the sectarian violence in Baghdad .
That revelation undercuts the Petraeus - Odierno argument that keeping combat troops in Iraq longer than 16 months would help maintain the present cease - fire between Sunni and Shi’ite forces .
In 16 months , U.S. combat troop strength will be only a fraction of its 2006 level , even under the Petraeus - Odierno plan .
The U.S. field commander said that , even if U.S. troops were given the mission of enforcing cease - fires , it would not give the U.S. military any additional influence over either side to remain several more months beyond the 16 - month withdrawal period .
" At some point [ U.S. troops ] are going to have to leave , " said the commander .
" The Iraqis are going to resolve political differences without American military muscle to enforce it .
It does n’t matter if that process begins in 16 months , 23 months , or 23 years .
We gain nothing with the additional time . "
" The 1st Cavalry Division cannot make the Shi’ites and Sunnis kiss and make up , " he observed .
" They ca n’t make the problems of oil revenue sharing get resolved .
Those are issues only Arabs and Kurds can resolve . "
A second U.S. officer now serving in Iraq , who also asked not to be identified , expressed doubt that a 16 - month withdrawal is logistically feasible , based on his experience in a specific area south of Baghdad .
But he agreed that it is time to complete the turnover of responsibility to the Iraqi army and rapidly withdraw U.S. combat troops .
" It ’s time for us to get out , " he said in an interview .
" If the U.S. military continues to do the job , the Iraqis are going to be lazy , and they wo n’t do it themselves . "
The officer conceded that the Iraq army " is nowhere near as competent as the U.S. Army , " and that " there may be some breakout of bad things " after the troop withdrawal .
Nevertheless , the officer warned , " If you do n’t give the Iraqis the mantle of responsibility , we will be there for another 25 - 30 years . "

A kilogram of beef is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution than driving for 3 hours while leaving all the lights on back home .
This is among the conclusions of a study by Akifumi Ogino of the National Institute of Livestock and Grassland Science in Tsukuba , Japan , and colleagues , which has assessed the effects of beef production on global warming , water acidification and eutrophication , and energy consumption .
The team looked at calf production , focusing on animal management and the effects of producing and transporting feed .

Review
The venerable Debian Linux distribution has experienced a significant new release with its latest update , dubbed Lenny .
While Debian is still not the easiest Linux distro to install and use , Lenny makes significant leaps forward and remains one of the most powerful Linux options .
Many Linux newcomers stick with popular distros like Ubuntu or Fedora and feel intimidated by the likes of Debian .
As Linux evangelist Mark Pilgrim once quipped , Ubuntu " is an ancient African word meaning ' ca n't install Debian ' " .
But Ubuntu is a Debian derivative .
And Debian 's reputation for being difficult is n't nearly as deserved used to be , so if you 've found Ubuntu getting in your way , the latest Debian release is worth a look - Lenny even offers a graphical installer - which actually arrived with the previous release , called Etch .
Get to grips with the Debian graphical installer
Still , Debian 's main audience is made up of hard - core Linux users and server admins , many of whom scoff at Ubuntu 's decision to " dumb down " Linux and remove - or make it difficult to - tweak the distro to suit their whims .
Debian , on the other hand , prizes personalization and customization , not ease - of - use .
And fear not , Lenny still offers the advanced shell - based install with its myriad of options and packages , as well as all sorts of CLI - only configuration tweaks .
Lenny was released this weekend , but for review purposes , we used the " testing " version ( beta 2 ) , and we did not encounter any significant bugs .
Of course , that does n't mean Debian is a pain - free install .
In fact , if you 're looking for something that just works , better to stick with Ubuntu .
But if you want something that just works your way , and you do n't mind a little bit of pain to get there , then read on because the latest version of Debian delivers .
Among the new features in Debian 's Lenny release are upgraded desktops , the latest version of X.org , IP v6 support , and more .
Debian ships in GNOME , KDE , and XFCE desktop flavors .
The default option is GNOME 2.22 .
Although the GNOME development team has already moved on to GNOME 2.24 , the Debian team has decided to play it conservative and stick with GNOME 2.22 .
Unfortunately , that means you 'll miss out on some nice features , like tabbed windows in the Nautilus file browser .
Safe and stable
The Debian release notes tout native Flash support through the swfdec - gnome codecs ( which , unlike Adobe 's Flash plugin , are not proprietary ) , but we had some trouble getting them to work .
Of course , you can always add the debian - multimedia.org repository to Apt 's repository list and grab all the multimedia codecs you need - Flash , MP3 and more .
While Debian may be playing it safe with GNOME , it has opted for the latest stable release of X.org - version 7.3 .
The latest X.org brings some nice new features like hot - swappable support for input devices such as mice and keyboard and enhanced support for touch screens and tablets .
Debian is perhaps best known as a server operating system , and Lenny has plenty of upgrades for those looking to deploy a Debian server .
The server version of Lenny now features MySQL 5.1 , PostgreSQL 8.3 , webmail IMP 4.2 , and more .
Also worth noting in the server release is that Debian has dropped support for Apache 1.x and moved to Apache 2 .
Debian has always been the ultimate in customization , with the full span of options running to no less than five DVDs - or if you prefer , some 30 CDs .
Lenny continues that trend with an everything - and - the - kitchen - sink approach , however , to get the basic system installed you only need one DVD .
For NBA All - Star Weekend , GEICO will once again be sponsoring a H.O.R.S.E. competition .
This year ’s three entrants are defending champion Kevin Durant , Rajon Rondo , and Omri Casspi .
The game will use a traditional format in which three players will establish the playing order .
Once a shot is made , the next player in the predetermined order will attempt the same shot .
If that player misses , he is assigned a letter ( ex . H for the first miss , O for the second , etc. ) .
The player following the miss can pick a new shot with which to challenge his competitors .
There is no dunking allowed and players will have 24 seconds each to create and mimic shots .
Players remain in the game until they have missed five shots following made baskets , thus spelling the word H - O - R - S - E .
An NBA referee will be assigned to authenticate the new shots ( that the player executed what he announced ) and any mimic shot .
The bonus is that it adds an element of creativity to the shots .
As fans , it should be a treat to watch as we have n’t seen a good shot for shot competition since Michael Jordan and Larry Bird battled it out for a Big Mac :
To give you guys some ideas of what would be great H - O - R - S - E shots , here are ten of the craziest , luckiest , or simply fluky shots that would defeat anyone in a game of Horse :
10 .
Off the bench from a seated position
Paul Pierce demonstrates this one with ease .
9. From Your Back
Going one degree harder , you move from a seated position to a lying down position .
8. Face Shot
You ’ll need some help on this one , either someone to pass off your face , or work a pass to yourself by throwing the ball off an object .
7. The Bounce Shot
Simple idea , harder to execute .
This guys does a great one after a short warm -up .
6. Behind the Back
Like the Bounce Shot , the idea is simple .
You can add distance to increase the degree of difficulty .
5. Kick Shot
Basketball players are not usually noted for their soccer skills , so this one is always a good bet .
4. The No Look
Not the fake Dee Brown no look , but literally running the other direction from the basket ( and yes this guy scored in the wrong basket , but no need to worry about that in Horse ) .
3. Long Distance
It always looks cool , and who ’s going to match you on 90 footers ?
2. Fluke Shot
You could probably never do this one again if you tried .
It ’s no look and behind the backboard , but if you make then you got a letter on everyone .
1. The Combo
Just combine virtually everything on this list into one shot and you get this .
With a little practice , you could get good at it .
Plus , for added difficulty , call “ Glass ” .
And remember , anyone can be good at Horse .
This guy is living proof :

Principled , consistent left - wingers do not base their politics on the unprincipled , inconsistent geo-political manoeuvres of western powers .
We stand with the oppressed against their oppressors , regardless of what the west ( or anyone else ) demands or threatens .
US sabre - rattling against Iran is worrying .
A military attack must be resisted .
However , opposition to Washington ’s war - mongering and neo-imperial designs is no reason for socialists , greens and other progressives to go soft on Tehran .
Iran is an Islamo - fascist state – a clerical form of fascism based on a confluence of Islamic fundamentalism and police state methods .
It differs , of course , from traditional European - style fascism , being rooted in religious dogma and autocracy .
This makes it no less barbaric .
Iran under the ayatollahs has a history of repression that is even bloodier than Franco ’s clerical fascist regime in Spain .
Sadly , it merits far less outrage by the left .
Tehran ’s tyrannical religious state embodies many ( though not all ) the characteristics of classical fascism : a substantially corporatist political and economic system maintained by a highly centralised repressive state apparatus .
This repression includes bans on non-Islamist political parties and free trade unions , and a regime of unfair trials , detention without charge , torture , executions , media censorship , gender apartheid , violent suppression of peaceful protests and strikes , and the persecution of left - wingers , students , feminists , journalists , gay people and religious and ethnic minorities .
Even lawyers and human rights defenders – are imprisoned and tortured .
The government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is also pursuing a racist , neo- colonial policy against Iran ’s minority nationalities , such as the Arabs ( who are abused even more harshly than the Israelis abuse the Palestinians ) , Kurds and Baluchs .
It used to be axiomatic that left and progressive movements fought fascism , wherever it is found and whatever its form .
We do not appease or collude .
Well , not until recently .
Nowadays , there is a whole section of the left that has abandoned the freedom struggle in Iran .
It goes to extraordinary lengths to downplay the excesses of the tyrants in Tehran .
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament invited the Iranian ambassador as a guest speaker to its 2005 annual conference .
It preferred to host the representative of an Islamo - fascist regime , rather than the leaders of Iran ’s left - wing opposition and anti-nuclear peace movement .
Indeed , CND members who objected to the feting of the ambassador of a dictatorship were forcibly ejected from the conference .
A similar fate befell Iranian refugees who joined the Stop the War Coalition marches .
When they backed the call ‘ Do n’t Attack Iran ’ they were welcomed , but as soon as they also condemned Tehran ’s depotism they were denounced by some of the left and shoved out the of the demonstration by thuggish StWC stewards .
No democracy
We are told by these muscular leftists that Iran is a democracy and that President Ahmadinejad is elected .
Nonsense .
But even if this were true , so what ?
Tony Blair was elected but that did not make the Iraq war right .
Israel is a democracy but this is no justification for its indiscriminate bombing of Gaza and its occupation of Palestine .
The truth is that Iran is no democracy .
Liberal , secular , green , socialist and national minority political parties are outlawed .
All candidates for election are vetted by a clerical council and those who dissent from the mullah ’s orthodoxy are barred from standing for public office .
Moreover , the conservative media favours establishment candidates and denies , or restricts , coverage of reformists and progressive ideas .
Human rights abuses in Iran are often dismissed by sections of the anti-imperialist left as ‘ exaggerated ’ or ‘ neo con fiction ’ , despite incontrovertible evidence from Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and from Iran ’s underground left - wing , student and trade union movements .
This shocking denialism is wholly divorced from reality and is a sordid betrayal of the Iranian people ’s struggle for liberty and justice .
Some left - wingers argue that since the US is the main upholder of the unjust global economic system we must therefore support those who oppose the US .
Because Tehran is against the US , we should support , or at least not undermine , the Iranian regime .
The left groups and activists who hold this view are the mirror image of the neo cons .
Their stance on Iran is determined by an international political agenda and power play , not by the interests and rights of the Iranian people .
They have allowed opposition to US imperialism to trump social justice and human rights in Iran .
For nearly 40 years I have campaigned in solidarity with the Iranian people , supporting their struggle against dictatorship – first against the western - backed Shah and then , since 1979 , against the ayatollahs .
The Shah was bad enough , but the Islamists who overthrew him are far worse .
They have out - butchered the Shah many times over ; executing or assassinating an estimated 100,000 Iranians in the last 30 years .
Many of those murdered – usually after gruesome torture – were left - wingers , trade unionists and other progressive Iranians .
The traditional socialist maxim used to be : fight the tyrants , support their victims ; solidarity with oppressed people everywhere .
This was the response of the entire left to the Shah ’s brutal misrule .
It stood shoulder - to - shoulder with the Iranian freedom struggle .
But in 1979 , defying all its historic values and ideals , large chunks of the Iranian and international left backed the Islamist revolution of Ayatollah Khomeini .
Their reasoning was that by supporting an anti-US movement this would help weaken US global hegemony .
Many of us warned at the time that this opportunistic alliance with fundamentalist Islam would spell disaster for the Iranian left and progressive movements .
Sure enough , beginning a couple of years after the Islamists seized power , tens of thousands of leftists , workers , secularists , students and women ’s rights campaigners were arrested , tortured and executed .
Despite this bloody history of tyranny , some left - wingers and anti-imperialists still shy away from campaigning against the Tehran regime .
The police - state oppression in Iran is some of the worst in the world .
According to Human Rights Watch , in March 2008 an Iranian parliament member , Hossein Ali Shahryari , confirmed that 700 people were awaiting execution in Sistan and Baluchistan province , which is only one of Iran ’s 30 provinces .
Many of those on death row are Baluch political prisoners .
This staggering number of death sentences is evidence of the intense , violent repression that is taking place under the leadership of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The regime ’s terror is wide - ranging .
Student leader Meisam Lofti was executed in 2007 on false charges of being a gang member .
Members of minority faiths , like the Baha\ ’is and , sometimes , Sunni Muslims , suffer severe harassment .
Truly barbaric
The regime ’s crackdown includes the enforcement of harsh morality laws .
In 2004 , in the city of Neka , a 16 - year - old girl , Atefah Rajabi Sahaaleh , who had been raped and sexually abused by men for many years , was convicted of \’crimes against chastity \’.
She was hanged by the method of slow , painful strangulation , hoisted by a crane in a public square .
This strangulation technique , sanctioned by the Iranian President , is deliberately designed to prolong the suffering of the victim .
As you can see here , the hanged person is left dangling and writhing for several minutes before they eventually asphyxiate and die .
Truly barbaric .
On 5 December 2007 , Makvan Mouloodzadeh , a 21 - year - old Iranian man , was hanged in Kermanshah Central Prison , after an unfair trial .
A member of Iran ’s persecuted Kurdish minority , he was executed on charges of raping other boys when he was 13 .
In other words , he committed these alleged acts when he was a child .
According to Iranian law , a boy under 15 is a minor and cannot be executed .
At Makvan ’s mockery of a trial , which was condemned by Human Rights Watch , the alleged rape victims retracted their previous statements , saying they had made their allegations under duress .
Makvan pleaded not guilty , telling the court that his confession was made during torture .
He was hanged anyway , without a shred of credible evidence that he had even had sex with the boys , let alone raped them .
The lies , defamation and homophobia of the debauched Iranian legal system was exposed when hundreds of villagers attended Makvan\ ’s funeral .
People do n’t mourn rapists .
Labour activists are also victimised .
Mansour Osanloo , leader of Tehran ’s bus workers syndicate , remains in jail – together with other trade unionists .
He was sentenced to five years jail in July 2007 for his peaceful , lawful defence of worker ’s rights .
Oppressing his own people is not enough for Ahmadinejad .
His regime also exports terror abroad .
It supports the Hezbollah fundamentalists in Lebanon , who , like Israel , indiscriminately attack civilian areas .
In addition , many of the death squads in Iraq are trained , armed and funded by Tehran .
These include ex-Badr Brigade members who , during the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein , lived and trained across the border in south - east Iran .
Nowadays , they assassinate political , sexual and religious dissidents ; usually gunning them down in their home , workplace or street .
No trial .
No evidence .
Summary execution , aided by Ahmadinejad ’s government .
Regime change from within
The case for regime change in Iran is overwhelming , but it must come from within – by and for the Iranian people themselves – not as a result of US neo-imperial diktat .
Many Iranians hope for a non-violent Czech - style ‘ people power ’ democratic revolution , involving mass strikes and street protests by socialists , liberals , secularists , democrats , women , students , trade unionists , religious dissenters and minority nationalities .
Others believe that the nascent insurrections by Arabs , Baluchs , Azeris and Kurds will burgeon into full - scale revolutionary war that will encircle and topple the Tehran regime .
Progress towards securing a democratic , progressive Iranian government is one of best ways to thwart a possible military strike by Washington .
Such a government would pose no threat to anyone .
This would make it much harder for the neo cons to persuade the American public and military to go to war .
They would no longer have the excuse that Iran is a terroristic , fundamentalist , anti-semitic dictatorship that is striving to develop nuclear weapons and which poses a serious threat to international peace and security .
If Iran ceased to be a fanatical religious tyranny , the case for war would be seriously weakened .
The pro-war Republicans and Democrats in the US would lose the battle for hearts and minds .
Most public opinion would desert them .
Anti-war US politicians and activists would be empowered and enhanced .
In contrast , a US military attack on Iran would strengthen the position of the hardliners in Tehran ; allowing President Ahmadinejad to play the nationalist card and portray himself as a heroic war leader .
It would also give him an excuse to further crack down on dissent , using the pretext of safeguarding national security and defending the country against US imperialism .
This would set back the Iranian struggle for democracy and human rights .
Moreover , a US attack on Muslim Iran would increase the sense of grievance felt by Muslims worldwide ; radicalising Muslim youth , fanning the flames of fundamentalism , increasing support for Islamist parties and resulting in thousands of new recruits to the ranks of Jihadis and suicide bombers .
Tragically , the leadership of the UK and US anti-war movements have been sleep - walking into making the same mistakes over Iran as they made over Iraq .
They are silent about the regime ’s despotism and oppression .
Mirroring the neo con indifference to human rights abuses in Iran , they refuse to show solidarity with the Iranian peoples ’ struggle for secularism , democracy , social justice , human rights and self - determination for national minorities .
There is nothing remotely left - wing about this is sad and cruel betrayal .
Put bluntly : it is collusion with tyranny .

A Conversation with Thanissaro Bhikkhu ( Geoffrey DeGraff ' 71 )
by Rich Orloff ' 73 Photos by Jacquie Lowell ' 69 Several years ago , while I was preparing for a trip to South - east Asia–in part to learn about Buddhism–a friend suggested that I first contact Thanissaro Bhikkhu , the abbot of the Metta Forest Monastery in northern San Diego County .
Despite his imposing
Thai name , this monk was actually raised in rural New York and Virginia under an equally imposing American name : Geoffrey Furguson DeGraff .
As an Oberlin student , Geoff was introduced to meditation during a winter - term seminar in 1969 .
He graduated in 1971 , and then served as a Shansi rep in Thailand for two years .
After returning there in 1976 , he was ordained a monk and spent the next 15 years immersed in the Forest monastery tradition of Theravada Buddhism ( see sidebar ) .
He returned to the United States in 1991 to establish the Metta Forest Monastery , an American equivalent of the Thai Forest retreats .
Known informally as " Than Geoff , " Thanissaro Bhikkhu has written several books on Buddhism and Vipassana ( Insight ) meditation .
Fluent in Thai and Pali , the languages of early Buddhist writings , he has translated the writings of two noted Thai abbots and four volumes of the Pali Canon .
In short , he knows his Buddhism .
Although I was anxious during our first phone call , Than Geoff was relaxed and friendly .
He started me on an exploration into Buddhism that I 've both embraced and tried to avoid almost every day since .
Over the years , we 've had lengthy conversations about almost everything .
But I still had countless questions for him–personal questions I suspected other people also would like to ask a monk .
When I suggested an interview , Than Geoff replied instantly , " Sounds like fun . "
A few months later , on a warm September afternoon at his monastery , Than Geoff and I began to talk .
You arrived at Oberlin as a freshman in 1967 .
I assume you chose Oberlin because you knew it would give you the best undergraduate training possible to become a Buddhist monk .
That was the last thing on my mind .
As a junior in high school reading American history , I read how Oberlin was among the first coed and integrated colleges in the country , and that interested me .
I also liked that it had classical music .
I was a classical music fanatic .
The Thai Forest Tradition , founded in the late 19th century , is known for its strict adherence to monastic discipline and its emphasis on the full - time practice of meditation .
The tradition derives from the belief that the Buddha himself gained awakening in a forest , gave his first sermon in a forest , and passed away in a forest .
The qualities of mind he developed to survive in the wild –both physically and mentally –were key to his teachings .
Did Oberlin give you your first exposure to Buddhism ?
No .
In high school , I had been an American Friends Service ( AFS ) student in the Philippines .
On the plane coming back home , I met two guys who had been to Thailand and been ordained as novices ( a kind of apprentice monk ) .
They explained the Four Noble Truths , the most fundamental teaching of the Buddha .
It made a lot of sense to me .
Also , my girlfriend 's father was a military man who had been stationed in Thailand .
She had lots of stories to tell about Thailand as well .
I was intrigued .
Did your interest grow at Oberlin ?
During my sophomore year , during Oberlin 's very first winter term , Don Swearer , a professor of religion , brought in a monk from Japan and a monk from Thailand to teach meditation .
I signed up immediately .
I remember thinking , " This is a really cool skill .
You sit down and breathe , and you come up an hour later a much better person . "
That 's what I liked about meditation from the beginning : learning how to bring your mind under control and find happiness inside .

Land earmarked for the construction of Heathrow 's third runway has been bought by anti-expansion protesters .
Land the size of half a football pitch near Sipson village - which would lose hundreds of homes in the expansion - was bought by a Greenpeace coalition .
It has pledged not to sell the land to the government or BAA if the airport expansion gets the go - ahead .
Greenpeace director John Sauven said : " We 've thrown a massive spanner in the engine driving Heathrow expansion . "
Four key Greenpeace campaigners - including actress Emma Thompson and impressionist Alistair McGowan - bought the land for an undisclosed fee .
Tory front bench spokeswoman Justine Greening and Lib Dem MP Susan Kramer were given a piece of the title to the land by Greenpeace and the group hopes to hand more of the land parcel to others in a bid to complicate any attempt to force them to sell .
We 'll stop this from happening even if we have to move in and plant vegetables
Emma Thompson
Battle lines drawn over Heathrow
They have said plans to increase flights at the airport from 480,000 to 720,000 would create unacceptable noise and pollution .
But BBC transport correspondent Tom Symonds said recent planning legislation included clauses that allowed the courts to consider whether or not a land purchase that blocked planned development was " vexatious or frivolous " .
This could , in turn , scupper Greenpeace 's plans to obstruct the construction for years .
Our correspondent said the government was due to rule on the plans as early as this week , but that decision may be further delayed .
The airport industry , business and union leaders have said Heathrow 's expansion is vital for the British economy 's long - term competitiveness and supporters have suggested work on the runway could create up to 65,000 jobs .
Ms Thompson said : " I do n't understand how any government remotely serious about committing to reversing climate change can even consider these ridiculous plans . "
Mr McGowan said he is in the fight for the long term .
" If it gets to the bulldozer stage , we 'll be here getting in the way . "
Protesters , including Mr McGowan , have written the words " our climate - our land " on the plot .
Mr Sauven said the group of new landowners would challenge any attempt by the government to force them to sell : " As the new owners of the land where the government wants to build the runway , we 'll resist all attempts at compulsory purchase .
" The legal owners of the site will block the runway at every stage through the planning process and in the courts . "

Since this blog post is somewhat long and controversial , we offer the highlights of the arguments in this summary below .
Executive Summary 1 . The Internet is about two - way communication ( Clue - Train Manifesto , etc. )
2. Blogging is a perfect vehicle to support that communication .
3 . To support its PageRank - based algorithm given spamming , Google insists blog comments must only have ‘ no - followed ’ URLs .
4 . This removes incentive for people to add comments to blogs
5. Twitter ( micro - blogging ) gives more immediate communication gratification .
6 . Blogging , a major profit - generator for Google , is thus throttled
Background
Internet Evolution has an interesting thread by Andrew Keen asking Did I Just See Eric Schmidt Blink ?
Schmidt was asked a question about Twitter ’s usefulness .
Here ’s how he answered :
Speaking as a computer scientist , I view all of these as sort of poor man ’s email systems .
In other words , they have aspects of an email system , but they do n’t have a full offering .
To me , the question about companies like Twitter is :
Do they fundamentally evolve as sort of a note phenomenon , or do they fundamentally evolve to have storage , revocation , identity , and all the other aspects that traditional email systems have ?
Or do email systems themselves broaden what they do to take on some of that characteristic ?
That may be the technocrat ’s putdown of a competitor , but Twitter is more about sociology than about technology .
Twitter has created a form of social interaction that clearly is extremely well received by a majority of Internet habitués .
Back in 1999 , the Cluetrain Manifesto prophetically suggested this was the strength of the Internet .
Twitter is leveraging that strength .
Google is not on the same playing field .
The nearest Google has got to this is its support of the blogosphere .
Google ’s Blogsearch attempts to help bloggers find others they may be interested in , although of late it has operated somewhat weakly .
That may be because Google now integrates blog posts with all other web pages in its main Web search .
However bloggers usually wish to communicate with their readers as we will show in the next two sections .
Google is less helpful here .
Bloggers want comments
Effective blogs encourage dialogue .
Here are some relevant posts that discuss that topic .
No Comment – Chris Brogan
If your blog gets no comments , or only a few from time to time , I know how that feels .
It ’s hard to keep writing when you feel like no one ’s watching , or that they ’re not engaged .
There are lots of blogs that deserve much more attention .
Comment elsewhere to build relationships .
And do n’t give up .
Blogging is more fun when there are comments , but your ideas are still just as valuable just being out there .
Measuring Student Blog Success – Shelby Thayer
The goal for most blogs is interaction ( on every single page , usually ) – not so with traditional websites like your university website ( again , usually ) .
Most blogs ( whether they ’re student blogs or not ) want engagement … interaction … discussions .
Enrich the web with comments – Ross Bruniges
To ensure that the good stuff gets the credit and exposure that it deserves and likewise so that the bad stuff gets highlighted as bad I believe that we must all comment on the bad that we see so that less experienced people do n’t just blindly copy , paste and use it in their projects .
This is even more of a necessity if the article is being promoted as a good one to read either through a good Google ranking or being linked to from a large magazine site or mailing list .
Rewarding Blog Commenters – Charles Comments add a huge amount to articles and help to differentiate blogs from normal websites .
The comments section is the place that you look to first for a second opinion or confirmation about whether what you ’ve read also works for others .
This feedback is helpful , interesting and this interaction really helps to engage your audience .
People do n’t want to feel that they ’re alone … comments help to build a buzzing community around your blog .
If you need any confirmation , just look at the statistics on that most successful blogger , Darren Rowse .

Newspapers want comments
The same theme is now being taken up by the professional journalists who are active on the blogosphere .
Here is how Mathew Ingram sees it in his piece on Fred Wilson and the power of comments .
Comments are an integral part of a fully - functioning blog .
I ’ve been encouraging writers at the newspaper to not just read the comments but also respond to them .
It helps to improve the tone of the comments , since it helps to make it obvious that a ) someone is reading them and b ) someone actually cares what is being said .
Comments can help to trigger not just an interesting conversation , but one that actually expands and advances the issue in question .
Fred Wilson ’s blog post on the future of newspapers is an excellent example .
It ’s actually a follow - up to a previous post about his use of media , but it has sparked a fascinating debate about the efficacy of blogs as a reporting medium , the utility of editors , and many other topics .
And Fred is right there , as he always is , responding and interjecting alongside them .
What finer explanation could you have for the power of comments on blogs .
Which raises the question , Should comments be the key blog post quality metric ?
Just check out the UK Guardian ’s section , Comment Is Free , and look at the numbers of comments .
Here is what it shows at the time of writing .
Comments
How we all lost when Thatcher won ( 463 )
The return of morality ( 321 ) Never mind the evidence – a drug - free world is nigh ( 256 ) We do things differently in Norfolk ( 460 ) Climate change creationists ( 232 ) Crank up the presses ( 170 ) Opening eyes in Israel ( 289 ) The greening of Mandelson ( 150 ) A vicious reflection of society ( 149 ) Let ’s wipe out toilet paper ( 352 )
Google wants comments ‘ no - followed
Despite this natural dynamic of blogs and conversations with their readers , Google has taken a different stance .
It is partially forced on them by the nature of their search algorithms and the continuing insistence that PageRank ( the number of inlinks to a web page ) is an important factor in determining relevance .
Google suggests that the fail - safe approach is to apply the ‘ nofollow ’ tag to all comments .
A few bloggers disregard this
If you are willing to exercise human discretion in reviewing all blog comments and rooting out those that are clearly spam links , then Google would accept that comment links need not be ‘ nofollowed ’ .
Some brave bloggers are taking Google at its word .
That is the way all SMM blogs are being managed .
Another high profile example is Daily SEO
Tip with posts such as 7 Ways to Turn Your Site into a Link Magnet .
This allows links to commenters ’ blogs and they do not carry the ‘ nofollow ’ tag .
Twitter beats out blogs
Twitter is currently adopting a ‘ nofollow ’ policy on all links added to Tweets .
This should be a policy that Google could hardly object to .
However if Google really is following the dictates of the tag it has recommended , then a large part of the Web activity is not being crawled by Google .
Since Google has set as its mission to catalogue all information accessible via the Web , they are now on the horns of a dilemma .
Will Google Blink ?
Marketing Pilgrim has correctly posed the question that Google , or is it Twitter , should resolve .
Google and / or Twitter Need to Ditch “ Nofollow ” for All Our Sakes !
Which will it be ?
Eighteen - month - old Kristen Hoenshell has a rare and aggressive form of cancer .
What began as a tumor behind her eye has led to surgery and 38 weeks of weekly visits to Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , where she receives powerful doses of chemotherapy that leave her weak and occasionally sick .
Yesterday , when she showed up for another round of treatment , she was greeted by something special .
As her cousin Megan Souza pointed out the window of a third - floor walkway , ironworkers perched on the sixth floor of a partially constructed building nearby hoisted a massive I - beam into place .
It was emblazoned , in bright pink spray paint , with Kristen 's name .
" Look out the window , " Souza said , as she held Kristen in her arms .
" There 's your name up there .
There 's your name , Kristen . "
The girl , bald from her treatments , smiled shyly .
It has become a beloved ritual at Dana - Farber : Every day , children who come to the clinic write their names on sheets of paper and tape them to the windows of the walkway for ironworkers to see .
And , every day , the ironworkers paint the names onto I - beams and hoist them into place as they add floors to the new 14 - story Yawkey Center for Cancer Care .
The building 's steel skeleton is now a brightly colored , seven - story monument to scores of children receiving treatment at the clinic - Lia , Alex , and Sam ; Taylor , Izzy , and Danny .
For the young cancer patients , who press their noses to the glass to watch new names added every day , the steel and spray - paint tribute has given them a few moments of joy and a towering symbol of hope .
" It 's fabulous , " said Kristen 's mother , Elizabeth , as she held her daughter and marveled at the rainbow of names .
" It 's just a simple little act that means so much . "
Most days , the walkway fills up like the passageway of an aquarium , packed with children gazing through the glass .
When a new name goes up on the building , the children cheer and clap .
Yesterday , Juclaubern Palmer Osias , a 16 - year - old from Holbrook who was diagnosed with cancer last year , saw his name immortalized in green paint on a beam on the seventh floor .
" It 's your name , " he said .
" It makes you feel important . "
It 's given a sense of satisfaction to the ironworkers , too .
" Everybody saw the kids smiling , " said Mike Walsh , the foreman for the ironworkers , from Local 7 , whose wife , Sheila , is a nurse at Dana - Farber .
" And that 's what you want to do , is keep them smiling , especially if they 're going for treatment in there . "
The ironworkers made a similar tribute in 1996 , when they painted the names of young cancer patients on beams they used to build the Smith Research Laboratories at Dana - Farber .
For a time , a short film about the project was shown in movie theaters to raise money for the Jimmy Fund .
This time , the ironworkers knew they wanted to honor the children again .
Over the last month , they have painted more than 100 names on the building and emblazoned part of their crane with a likeness of SpongeBob SquarePants .
They have also painted a few special messages on the steel , like " Hi Hanna Get Well ASAP : ) "
Yesterday , crawling on their stomachs in the bitter cold and whipping winds , the ironworkers looked down at the latest batch of names posted in the walkway window .
Looking up at them were Kristen and her sisters , Cathryn , 5 , and Hannah , 3 , who have been accompanying her to chemotherapy .
They pointed as the ironworkers painted the girls ' names onto the side of a 4 - ton I - beam and hoisted it on to the seventh floor .
" She 'll always be a piece of this building , which is a good feeling to have , " Elizabeth Hoenshell said , holding Kristen .
" They do n't have to do this , the guys .
They could just do their job and do a good job at it and give us a building that we can get treatment at , but they go the extra step and that 's huge . "
One day , years from now , Hoenshell said , she hopes to take Kristen back to the clinic , and show her where her name is inscribed .
" I 'm going to stand her right here at this pedestal and say , ' Look right up , ' and ' That was you , ' " she said .
" Maybe I 'll take her over there for a little walk .
She can step on her name , " she said , laughing .

Oregon ’s government is thinking about increasing the state beer tax .
Taxing cigarettes is one thing , but is a beer tax taking it too far ?
The Oregonian reports :
The Oregon state tax on beer is less than a penny a glass .
It ’s among the lowest in the country , untouched in more than three decades and guarded by powerful interest groups .
Never before , it seems , has the climate been so ripe to raise taxes on sin .
Democrats command supermajorities in both chambers , which means they can increase taxes without Republican votes .
Two - term Rep. Ben Cannon , D - Portland , is the chief sponsor in the House of a bill that would raise the tax on a 12 - ounce beer to 15 cents for drug and alcohol abuse prevention and treatment .
Oregon ’s market - small but vocal craft beer makers oppose the bill , arguing that increasing the $ 2.60 tax on a barrel of beer to nearly $ 50 would crimp the industry and result in layoffs .
Kurt Widmer , one of the brothers behind Widmer Brothers Brewing , says the actual tax paid by drinkers will be much higher than legislators claim , after middlemen slice their share .
“ The lie of the 15 cents is that a pint ( actually ) goes from $ 4 to $ 5.50 , ” he says .
Kulongoski wants to raise the tax on a pack of cigarettes from $ 1.18 to $ 1.78 , netting about $ 112 million every two years , most of it for the Oregon Health Plan .
Scott Jantze would be thrilled if somebody – anybody – would price cigarettes so high he would n’t buy them .
The warehouse forklift driver has smoked for most of his 46 years and he hates it .
“ If they were to tax cigarettes really high , that would be the best thing for me to quit , ” says Jantze , parked in front of a television at Claudia ’s Sports Bar on Hawthorne , crunching on potato chips and drinking from a small pitcher of beer .
But a tax on his beloved Budweiser ?
“ I got to draw the line on that one . ”
Oregon ’s KGW
News reports that if the measure passes , a pint of beer will cost $ 6 , with a 1,900 % tax increase .
If the government is willing to consider a beer tax to fund alcohol recovery programs , why does n’t it start taxing junk food , too , in order to combat obesity ?
The beer tax–or a wine tax–just do n’t make much sense .
One of the hardest things to deal with in the current economic depression is the disgusting hypocrisy of the U.S. congress , the new president , and the members of the Federal Reserve System .
It is one thing to be told , as we all are , that we must hand over fat wads of our hard - earned money to these warmongering and thieving snakes or face jail terms , but one feels a whole new level of revulsion when these people make statements to the effect that they , and they alone , are in a position to " save the economy " by " creating jobs . "
These statements are made by people who have done virtually everything in their power to destroy the American economy over the last few decades , but who have now proclaimed themselves to be our saviors .
Only the most naïve and unlearned among us could possibly be falling for the idea that a bunch of self - serving politicians , bureaucrats and bankers are going to " save " us from problems they have caused .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
On its face , the idea that politicians , bureaucrats , and bankers could " save " the economy is laughable .
These are people , after all , who live exclusively at our expense .
That is , these are people whose entire livelihoods are dependent upon taking money away from productive people and spending it on themselves and their favorite wasteful projects .
It ’s true that they do not all share the same ideas about how to spend the money they take from us .
Some prefer to use it to blow up innocent people in foreign lands , while others simply want to take our hard - earned money without our consent and hand it over to other people .
The bankers , on the other hand , merely content themselves with printing vast amounts of new money out of thin air that they either hand over to the Treasury Department , or gift to their other banker - buddies to lend out at a profit at our expense .
Nevertheless , it should be crystal clear that these people do not actually produce anything themselves ( except the bankers , who are very skilled counterfeiters of money ) .
They take money from us through taxation and inflation , ( and threaten us with severe punishments if we refuse to obey ) , and then spend every last penny of it — and more — on war , socialized boondoggles , and welfare .
These are the people who would have us believe that they can " save " the economy ?
How exactly would they accomplish such a thing ?
More taxes , more idiotic socialized projects , more war , and more newly - printed green paper ?
Do these actions really seem likely to produce a vibrant and healthy economy , or do they seem more like the actions undertaken by the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.?
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
They would also very much like for us to believe that they are the only people in the world capable of " creating jobs " in the United States .
A more ridiculous idea would be hard to find .
Again , these people are only in the business of taking money from productive people , and either wasting it entirely ( e.g. , war ) , keeping it themselves , or giving it to other people ( e.g. , entitlement programs , foreign aid , and paychecks for bureaucrats ) .
As such , any actions undertaken by these people will necessarily depend for funding upon those who are forced to pay taxes ; namely , the increasingly - dwindling group of productive people who have not yet lost their jobs in the private sector .
Does it really seem possible that this sort of parasitism on the productive people of the United States really can create jobs that produce the things that people actually want ?
If socialized job creation is the only way out of this economic quagmire , as the politicians would have us believe , then why do n’t they socialize the entire economy ?
If it were indeed the case that the federal government can " create " productive jobs better than the private sector , then why do n’t they take over all aspects of the American economy , and we can all live happily ever - after in a brave , new , socialized America where everyone is enslaved , I mean employed , by the State .
And do n’t think for a moment that the politicians and bureaucrats are themselves going to help the productive people shoulder this onerous tax burden .
On the contrary , politicians and bureaucrats do not actually pay taxes .
As Murray Rothbard has noted in this regard :
" If a bureaucrat receives a salary of $ 5,000 a year and pays $ 1,000 in ‘ taxes ’ to the government , it is quite obvious that he is simply receiving a salary of $ 4,000 and pays no taxes at all .
The heads of the government have simply chosen a complex and misleading accounting device to make it appear that he pays taxes in the same way as any other men making the same income .
The UN ’s arrangement , whereby all its employees are exempt from any income taxation , is far more candid . "
Hence , while Mr. Obama is fond of telling us that " we " are going to have to get out of this recession together , what he really means is that those of us who are employed in productive private lines of work in this country are going to have to hand over more and more of our hard - earned money to those people in this country who pay no taxes at all ; namely , men like Mr. Obama himself and the rest of the fat , parasitic political and bureaucratic class that infests this country .
The Left , The Right an ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr Best Price : $ 7.33 Buy New $ 40.00 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Some of the more shameless of the political class in this country , or their academic lackeys , have even tried to convince us that the trillions of dollars they are wasting in Iraq and Afghanistan are going to help us get out of this depression .
They have been taking our money and blowing it up in these two dreadfully poor countries year after year , and they would like for us to believe that this senseless destruction of wealth is going to make us richer .
Often known as " Military Keynesians , " this group is perhaps more aptly described as the " kill ourselves rich " crowd .
It does n’t take a rocket scientist to realize that neither you nor I are made better off when the federal government steals our money , hands it over to Lockheed Martin to purchase bombs , and then uses those bombs to blow up Pakistani civilians .
The only people who benefit from this forceful expropriation of our money and indifferent murder are the merchants of death occupying lucrative posts at Lockheed , Blackwater and the Pentagon .
Patriots : A Novel of S... Rawles , James Wesley Best Price : $ 1.10 Buy New $ 1.99 ( as of 03:05 EST - Details )
What the political and bureaucratic classes are actually accomplishing very well , however , is creating a veritable army of angry men whose lives have been destroyed by the federal government .
Many have lost their jobs , thanks to the collapse of the largest artificial economic boom in American history — a boom that was directly caused by the actions of the federal government and the Fed .
In addition , thanks to years of merciless and ceaseless money creation by the Fed , this army of men has found that their savings purchase fewer and fewer goods over time .
This depreciation of the dollar will inexorably increase astronomically over the next few years as the massive amount of new money the Fed and treasury have already jointly printed , and are planning to print over the coming months and years , floods the system .
This army of angry men has very little to be optimistic about in the near future .
At best , they might be able to keep their present jobs in the private sector — shouldering a heavier and heavier portion of the tax burden that funds the congress and president ’s wars and socialization schemes , while the value of their savings continues to erode into dust .
Those who have lost their jobs might be permitted to work on Mr. Obama ’s " public works " projects , and thereby become virtual slaves to the whims of the political and bureaucratic classes .
Many others will simply find it easier to start sucking at the state ’s teat in the form of unemployment insurance or food stamps , et cetera , and thereby lose all respect for themselves .
One thing is certain for every member of this army of angry men , though ; every single one of them will now find it very difficult , if not impossible , to carve out a living for himself , on his own terms , and without being at the complete mercy of politicians , bureaucrats , and bankers he has never even met .
The age of the independent , responsible , and free American citizen is now dead .
The hour is fast approaching when each and every one of us will have to decide for ourselves whether we will try to fight this devastating government machine , or join it .

A NASA satellite launching later this month will measure the Earth 's carbon dioxide levels in unprecedented detail , helping inform plans of attack against climate change .
Set to launch on February 23 , the Orbiting Carbon Observatory will map the entire planet from 440 miles up , pinpointing where carbon dioxide is being emitted and where the greenhouse gas is being pulled from the air .
Identifying such sources and sinks will shed light on how carbon circulates from land to air to sea and back again — a process that remains poorly understood .
" We 're extremely excited about OCO , " said atmospheric chemist Charles Miller of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , which designed and operates the satellite .
" We believe it will revolutionize our understanding of carbon cycling . "
Over the last 250 years , atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have risen by about 40 percent , from 280 parts per million to more than 380 .
Climate scientists believe the increase in this heat - trapping gas is a chief driver of the planet 's warming trend .
Earth 's average temperature has risen by 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 100 years .
But things could be much worse if it were n't for what are known as carbon sinks :
Sixty percent of the carbon dioxide emitted by man has been absorbed out of the atmosphere .
But scientists are n't sure where most of the sinks responsible are located , or what determines their efficiency over time .
" The fundamental focus of the OCO mission is the sinks , " said project leader David Crisp , a physicist at JPL .
" If we can't understand the processes controlling the buildup of CO2 in our atmosphere today , it will be impossible to make reliable predictions about how CO2 will affect climate in the future . "
And sampling the entire planet from space is the best way to learn more , Crisp said .
A system of 100 surface sensors scattered around the world makes very precise measurements of carbon dioxide , but the picture it paints is far from complete .
And there are few of these stations in Africa , South America , and other parts of the Third World , meaning much of the planet is not being monitored .
" One hundred stations is just not enough , " Crisp said .
" I could put 100 stations in Iowa and not really have enough to say what 's going on there . "
OCO will measure atmospheric carbon dioxide using spectrometers — precision instruments that can distinguish 17,500 different colors over the spectrum of visible light .
By analyzing the sunlight bouncing off of Earth , the satellite 's spectrometers will identify the telltale wavelengths of light absorbed by carbon dioxide , revealing how much of it is in the air .
The satellite will take 12 readings every second .
Finding sources and sinks is a significant technological challenge , Miller said .
OCO will need to distinguish carbon dioxide levels differing by as little as 0.3 percent .
" This is the most difficult measurement of a trace gas ever attempted from space , " Crisp said .
" It 's my team 's job to prove that this really works . "
Crisp 's team will be able to check the accuracy of OCO 's readings against the ground - based system , and with Japan 's Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite , or GOSAT , which beat OCO into space by a month .
GOSAT is also using spectrometry to measure atmospheric CO2 and methane , another greenhouse gas .
GOSAT will run for 5 years , sharing its data with NASA and other institutions .
Crisp welcomes the opportunity to cooperate .
" About every six months , the two teams are going to get together , and we 're going to compare notes and see how we 're doing , " he said .
OCO is a small spacecraft , measuring 7 feet tall by 3 feet across and weighing about 1000 pounds .
Once aloft , it will join a constellation of five other scientific satellites called the A - Train , which gather data on clouds , aerosols , ozone , and other components of the atmosphere .
The A - Train zips roughly from pole to pole , making a complete trip around the Earth in 100 minutes .
The " A " stands for afternoon , because the spacecraft are all in a sun-synchronous orbit , which means it is always 1:30 p.m. on the ground beneath them , wherever they are .
OCO 's total cost , from design and development to launch and operation , is $ 270 million .
The spacecraft 's mission has funding for two years , but if the telescope produces good data and money can be found , it may get an extension .__ __

First Acceptance , Then Change By Russell Collins , Noozhawk.com , Feb 25 , 2009 A Zen master has this to say about hard times ahead :
It is what it is Noozhawk , CA ( USA ) -- Relationship wisdom can come in many forms .
Not too long ago , I got a dose of it from an unlikely source : a famed Buddhist monk talking about the approaching end of times .
Around the middle of last year , my wife and I drove down to UCLA for a conference on psychotherapy and spirituality .
My wife , Laura , is an attorney , not a psychotherapist , but she was interested in hearing the keynote speaker , Thich Nhat Hanh , the Vietnamese Buddhist monk who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Nhat Hanh is deeply interested in mediation and compromise as an alternative to violence as a solution to conflict .
Nhat Hanh sat among a crowd of robed Vietnamese disciples and lectured from the stage of Royce Hall , a large auditorium filled with mental health professionals — quite a few of us from Santa Barbara — trying to understand how to apply his message to our work .
For me , the most memorable moment of the day came just after the Zen master took a question from the audience about global warming .
The questioner wanted to know what we , as ordinary people , can do .
Nhat Hanh is a proponent of “ engaged Buddhism ” ; rather than live peacefully with his Buddhist community in southwestern France , he travels the world delivering his message of peace , and he ’s an activist on global issues of many sorts .
At the same time , he comes from a Zen tradition of compassion for all beings .
So I was curious how he would straddle that line — issue a call to the barricades or preach compassion and understanding for the polluters of the world .
He went down a road I did n’t expect .
“ I have prayed to my inner Buddha about this ” he said , which suggested to me he had no pat answers .
What his inner Buddha told him , Nhat Hanh said , was that the human race will end , and that perhaps that end is approaching fast .
This alarmed me a little , and caused a buzz in Royce Hall .
Was he saying the tipping point has been reached , we ’re on the downhill slide and that there is nothing we can do ?
This seemed a little fatalistic .
I had expected something more ... actionable .
But as he talked — his quiet voice just barely audible , even with a microphone , so that we had to strain to hear — I began to see some wisdom in his words .
Did I really think the human race was destined to go on forever ?
Not likely on a lot of counts .
And is there a something so special about this moment in history — my moment — that would prevent my generation from being among the last to die ?
Moreover , it ’s pretty clear that the news on climate change seems to be getting worse , not better .
What Thich Nhat Hanh proposed to us , as we sat noiselessly in the great hall , was that the enlightened response to the possibility of climatological Armageddon is exactly the same as that for facing any manifestation of our impermanence .
It is what it is .
And it ’s perfect that way .
On a smaller scale , but one no less important , acceptance can be the key to relationship problems as well .
In one way , I ’m seeing this already during the downturn .
Forced to confront difficulties on the financial front , couples — some couples anyway — are beginning to embrace the life and the relationship they have , rather than some idea of how it could be “ if only . ”
Even among our friends and acquaintances , I see couples cutting each other more slack as partners , making an effort to be less critical and demanding .
There is more interest and more focus on the relationship , and a little less fascination with acquiring the stuff we usually crave : more money , more friends , more California real estate .
Letting go of judgment and expectation this way can infuse day - to - day living with a sense of ease , humor ( often of the gallows variety ) and equanimity .
Paradoxically , this acceptance of just who we are and just what is can set the stage for effortless change .
Many years ago , renowned psychologist Carl Rogers built an entire philosophy of human potential around this single idea : “ The curious paradox is , ” Rogers theorized , “ when I accept myself just as I am , then I can change . ”
This paradox of acceptance as the doorway to change has emerged more and more as an effective model for couples , too .
Relationship pioneers Neil Jacobson and Andrew Christensen have demonstrated through years of research what Rogers and Thich Nhat Hanh seemed to know intuitively :
The pressure to change or be different sends the critical message that there is something wrong with you in the first place , whether the “ you ” is a culture of waste , a marriage , a mate , or just ... you .
This may be why programs for change ( like my exercise program ) that begin with such high hopes and promise never seem to accomplish their goals : what you resist persists , as some sage once proclaimed .
Jacobson and Christensen make two radical recommendations to couples struggling in their relationships : first , embrace your problems ... they are the doorway to intimacy in relationships .
Rather than deny them or try to will them away , talk honestly but responsibly about what happens when your partner ’s words and action seems hurtful .
Second , “ let go ” of both your idealized notions of what your relationship should look like , and all your plans to change your mate .
Accept , or at least entertain , the possibility that your mate , your relationship , and your life together are already perfect ... just the way they are .
There are exceptions to this idea , of course , most notably the acceptance of physical or emotional abuse in a relationship .
Acceptance in these cases probably means acceptance of the complete unworkability of the relationship and the uncomfortable need to move on .
But for many couples who have struggled — sometimes for years — to reshape their relationship according to some ideal or model of relationship perfection , it can be a great relief to step back from the struggle and look at their partner and their lives together and say — this is it !
For all its quirks and idiosyncrasies , for all its failures to live up to my expectations , it is what it is , we are who we are and we can love each other just as we are — and go on supporting each other in continuing to grow in every way we can .

Russell Collins is a Santa Barbara psychotherapist and divorce mediator .
CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) -- Credit - card debt is on the brink of imploding and will be the next storm to hit the fragile finance industry , an investment research firm predicted this week .
According to Innovest StrategicValue Advisors , banks will charge off $ 18.6 billion in delinquent credit - card accounts in the first quarter of 2009 and $ 96 billion in all of 2009 , more than double the research firm 's forecast for all of this year .
Innovest projects that amount would be high enough to damage some of the biggest card issuers .
Credit - card charge - offs are " defying gravity " when compared with the problems in the mortgage market , according to Gregory Larkin , senior banking analyst for Innovest .
But that will change as they catch up with mortgage charge - offs , which have spiked eightfold since the third quarter of 2007 .
" If history is any indicator , there should be an equivalent surge of credit - card charge - offs very soon , " he said , though he concedes that an eightfold increase would be very aggressive .
Comparatively , charge - offs reached $ 4.2 billion in the first quarter of this year and $ 3.2 billion in the same period a year before , according to the Federal Reserve , which only reports non-securitized debt .
Innovest 's projections include all credit - card debt , which the firm believes is double what the Federal Reserve reports .
For all of 2007 , charge - offs tallied $ 26.6 billion , according to Innovest 's calculations , and the firm estimates they will reach $ 41.5 billion at the end of this year .
The jump in credit - card charge - offs is linked in part to the credit crisis now in play .
As banks have tightened lending standards , they have mostly done away with the once - popular roll - over options -- usually at 0 % introductory rates -- that allowed borrowers with delinquent accounts to get new cards elsewhere .
Larkin believes all that bad credit is going to surface quickly and could have a similar impact as the mortgage crisis has had on banking .
A matter of scale
But credit - industry analysts shake those prognostications off , noting that the number of dollars involved in credit cards loans versus mortgages is substantially lower .
" Defaults on $ 2,000 or $ 5,000 in credit - card debt are entirely different than someone defaulting on a $ 500,000 mortgage , " said Greg McBride , senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com .
" I 'm skeptical that the magnitude of credit quality is going to be as severe as some say , " he added .
The average credit - card debt is $ 2,200 , according to the Federal Reserve .
On a revolving basis , there was roughly $ 970 billion owed on credit cards at the end of July .
However , because many people use credit cards for the rewards programs and pay off their debt each month , it 's unclear how much of that total is actually outstanding .
What 's more , as delinquencies rise -- and they will because of the weakness of the economy -- credit - card issuers will take steps to stem the tide .
That will include cutting credit off from problem borrowers and tightening restrictions on new cards .
" Banks already are starting to minimize their risk and drop their credit limits that they extend to people and especially those at a higher risk , " said Bill Hardekopf , a partner at LowCards.com .
Read more .
American Express , for example , upped its loan - loss reserves to $ 2.6 billion in the second quarter compared with $ 1.4 billion in the year - ago period .
In the second quarter , Capital One 's provisions for loan losses nearly doubled to $ 1.1 billion compared with $ 535 million in the second quarter last year .
" There 's no doubt there 's going to be pain in the credit - card markets , " said Justin McHenry , research director with IndexCreditCards.com .
" But I do n't see anything to the magnitude of what we 've seen in the mortgage market .
" This is a different financial animal in terms of how much is being loaned out , " he added .
" And credit - card companies can take that credit and cut it in half .
That 's a tool that they have . "
Larkin admits that Innovest 's projections run against the financial tide : " I think they 're wrong , " he said .
Companies could take a hit
Laura Nishikawa , Innovest 's consumer finance analyst , said the credit - card crisis will hit earnings , in particular at companies that glean high percentages of net revenue from their U.S. credit - card revenues .
" Companies that have pursued aggressive portfolio growth and higher yields at the cost of prudent risk management will struggle to manage rising loan losses , which will definitely cut into earnings or even worse , " she said .
Discover Cards DFS , - 1.45 % , for example , is a pure - play credit - card company with 97.8 % of net revenue from credit cards .
Capital One COF , - 1.23 % gets 62 % of its net revenue from credit cards while American Express ' AXP , - 1.08 % clocks in with 24.5 % .
J.P Morgan Chase's JPM , - 0.84 % garners 20.5 % of net revenues from credit cards .
Nishikawa is also worried about companies that target lower - income consumers and use delinquencies and late payments as a means of making money .
" Delinquent borrowers become cash - flow generators , " she said .
" At the extreme end , the goal becomes , ' How do we get borrowers into delinquent status as soon as possible , in order to maximize returns ? ' "
J.P. Morgan and Amex are what Nishikawa considers best of class , while Capital One has an unsustainable business model that 's based on penalty pricing -- high fees for missed payments , shooting interest rates for surpassing limits -- and that she thinks has a high exposure to subprime credit - card holders and low payment rates .
" When the economy turns bad , this strategy clearly cannot be sustained , " she said .
" While a hit to topple credit cards may not topple the bank completely , it will cut into core earnings , " she added .

I would n’t normally put up another post so early , but with every day pressing us into unknown territory it ’s important to document what ’s happening .
To be honest , I ’m not comfortable with what ’s going on .
I began the weekend thinking that Mr. Harper should be given another opportunity to come forward with a more constructive plan to answer opposition demands .
I even spent part of my Sunday assuring some Liberal supporters to be patient and give the Conservatives a chance to prove themselves .
I had presumed the Prime Minister would have spent the weekend reaching out to opposition leaders to see if another stab could be taken at working out the difficulties .
I was saddened to hear of Conservatives secretly listening in on an NDP conference call .
Worse yet , my staff and I were surprised to discover that a multitude of emails sent to my office complaining of coalition attempts were actually penned by Conservative staff members pretending to be average citizens .
And then of course there was the sight of Conservative MPs fanning across the country , trashing Liberals and accusing them of being traitors .
By the time I arrived in Ottawa on Sunday my thinking had begun to shift .
Instead of showing a certain sense of decorum and humility towards the opposition , the Conservatives were doing exactly what they did when they started this whole thing last Thursday .
It was saddening .
Of course , opposition parties have n’t been pristine either , but it was the PM and his party that opened this gambit and instead of moving quickly to heal the wound , the have torn off the scab once again .
I ’m still not fully sure how I feel about a coalition but I am certain of this one thing : the hyper - partisanship instigated by the Prime Minister three years ago and elucidated so clearly last Thursday has poisoned this Parliament for its duration .
Our political discourse is not an open and honest exchange of ideas and opinions .
It is an exchange of insults and allegations , flowing from all parties .
It is about scoring political points .
It is no longer a debate about ideas to secure our future ; it is about sound bites that ignore and denigrate our past .
And the present ?
Well , it ’s just a mess .
I was approached by three Conservatives today to help support them , saying that I was an honest broker type and that my voice would be respected .
But when I asked them if they would just quit playing this kind of brinksmanship and retreat to a position of non-partisanship and accommodation , they quietly moved away .
And there ’s the problem : if it wo n’t start with the Conservatives , it wo n’t start at all .
They are the government and the responsibility lies with them .
Their lack of refined leadership has ultimately led to a lack of productivity .
This whole thing could have worked if hyper - partisanship had n’t ruled the day .
But , alas , it still does , and the chances of passing legislation in such heavy partisan times are nil because votes are needed from the other parties in a minority government .
How can that happen when a government seeks to wipe out opposition parties at every turn ?
By John Spivey at the Whited Sepulchre :
As Chair of a County Libertarian Party , I ’ve seen tremendous gains in our local libertarian scene .
We ’ve gone from 6 members meeting every two years to affirm a handful of pre-nominated and non-contested candidates to a group whose grassroots ranks are numbering in the triple digits , alliances with philosophically aligned ‘ major ’ political party campaigns and supporting candidates who , doggone it , looks like they have a very legitimate chance to win an election to a high office in the county ’s largest city ( population 700,000 - ish ) !
Libertarian straight ticket voters increased by a greater margin than the overall increase in total voters in this Obama - fueled electionapalooza .
Straight ticket Democrats increased , but not as much as the overall total .
Even with the total turnout increasing by over 60 % in our county , straigh ticket GOP voters , DECREASED by about 4 % .
Seems like the GOP ’s message of warfare state , daddy - state smack downs of civil liberties and personal freedoms , exclusivity and intolerance is wearing thin .
Even in this formerly deeply red county .
However , truth be told , in saying that , it ’s like saying that our regular savage beatings by two large giants are slightly less savage and by slightly smaller giants .
Until we do a few things , we ’re still going to get smacked , but , as you may have read , David gets his eventually .
First , since the LP caters to no special interest group , we ’re not going to get much in the way of mega - corporate / union ‘ sponsorship ’ .
No biggie , since Ron Paul showed that you can raise $ 35 million , one person at a time .
The trick is getting those donors over to our side .
Tough to do when the LP Presidential candidate , Bob Barr , basically bitch slapped the good Doctor during election time .
However , I believe with time , that wound will heal and those Republicans will leave the GOP and find their proper home with us .
They bring money , volunteerism and best of all – infectious and rabid enthusiasm !
Also , we ’re going to have to work to improve our image .
Taking the “ Apple vs. PC ” advertisement as an example , we ’re definitely the ‘ PC ’ guy .
We HAVE to get ‘ cool ’ .
Generally speaking , that means getting celebrities to flog our message .
Penn and Teller are OK , John Stossel is better , but what we really need is a Leo DiCaprio or two to bang our drum like they do for Rev. Al Gore .
Cultural relevancy .
It will take time .
Hopefully not as much time as Cato Insitute studies report that New Deal programs prolonged The Great Depression ( eight extra years ) .
But eventually , our message of sound monetary policy , sane fiscal policies , peace and personal freedom will find its place in the mainstream of American politics .
It may take some failures of nationalized industries first .
Ayn Rand may have not been too far off the mark .
I hope we can get going before Atlas goes into full shrug .
I ’m becoming more and more convinced that we must take a bottom up approach .
We ’re just going to have to win some local races first folks .
That means locally , you ’ll need to support our candidates with your time and money – and of course , votes !
My toast for the new year and for libertarian victory nationally ?
Bottom (s ) up !

Rumsfeld prosecution could set precedent
By CESAR CHELALA
NEW YORK —
There is now enough evidence to try former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for war crimes , Manfred Nowak , the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture , recently told “ Frontal 21 , ” a German television program .
Nowak ’s statement confirms what human rights and legal organizations have been saying for several years , and spotlights one of the Bush administration ’s most controversial decisions regarding the use of torture .
Nowak ’s statement follows a bipartisan Senate Arms Services Committee investigation made public in December .
In scathing and unequivocal terms , the investigation revealed that Rumsfeld and other high - ranking administration officials , including former National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , bore major responsibility for detainee abuse by American troops at Abu Ghraib in Iraq ; Guantanamo Bay , Cuba ; and other military detention centers .
The abuse was not the result of only a few soldiers acting on their own , but the consequence of interrogation policies approved by Rumsfeld and other top officials who “ conveyed the message that physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for detainees . ”
On Dec. 2 , 2002 , following a request by Guantanamo officials that additional techniques beyond those in the U.S.
Army field manual be approved for use , Rumsfeld authorized new interrogation policies for Guantanamo , including placing prisoners in “ stress positions , ” hooding detainees for 20 - hour interrogations , exploiting phobias to induce stress , sensory deprivation , and isolation .
These techniques were later used in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Complaints of abuses at Guantanamo by FBI officials to the Defense Department in December 2002 were disregarded .
According to the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , in January of 2003 senior officers of the Judge Advocate General ’s office repeatedly objected to interrogation techniques used at Guantanamo , but “ Pentagon officials ‘ did n’t think this was a big deal , so they just ignored the JAGs . ’ ”
During this period , Rumsfeld designated a “ Working Group ” to assess legal , policy and operational issues for detainee interrogation in the “ war on terrorism . ”
In April 2003 , the Working Group issued its final report recommending 35 interrogation techniques to Rumsfeld , who recommended 24 of the 35 , including dietary and environmental manipulation , sleep interruption and isolation .
One month later , the Red Cross reported 200 cases of alleged detainee abuse of prisoners in U.S. custody in Iraq to the U.S. Central Command .
Meanwhile , the FBI reiterated its objections to the Guantanamo base commander .
In August 2003 , Rumsfeld sent the Guantanamo commander to Iraq to “ GITMO - ize ” Iraqi detention facilities , promoting wide - scale deployment of more aggressive interrogation techniques in Iraq .
In February 2004 , Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba reported that “ systematic ” and “ sadistic , blatant and wanton criminal abuses ” were taking place at Abu Ghraib .
In May 2006 , the U.N. Committee against Torture issued a strong and thorough critique of the U.S. record on torture .
The U.N. assessment was confirmed by Maj. Gen. Taguba who in June 2008 stated , “ After years of disclosures by government investigations , media accounts and reports from human rights organizations , there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes , ” and called for those responsible to be held to account .
In December 2006 , the ACLU and Human Rights First argued before a federal court that Rumsfeld should be held accountable for the torture and abuse of detainees in U.S. military custody .
Retired military officers and military legal experts filed a legal brief in support of the lawsuit .
In March 2007 , Chief Judge Thomas A. Hogan of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the case .
The Center for Constitutional Rights in New York , the International Federation for Human Rights , and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights have filed three cases against Rumsfeld and others in Germany and France for the alleged torture of detainees in Iraq , Afghanistan , Guantanamo and at secret sites .
They did so under universal jurisdiction laws that would let those countries indict U.S. officials for torture if the United States does not fulfill its obligation .
How the Obama administration handles this issue will signal its degree of commitment to the human rights principles it has promised to uphold .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Accused Wall Street swindler Bernard Madoff has agreed to a permanent freeze on his assets without admitting or denying fraud charges in a civil case against him , a U.S. regulator said on Monday .
Disgraced financier Bernard Madoff is escorted by police and photographed by the media as he departs U.S. Federal Court after a hearing in New York , January 5 , 2009 .

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a court filing that the amount of fines and disgorgement will be decided later against Madoff , the former Nasdaq stock market chairman whose assets were temporarily frozen by court order two months ago .
The development is an indication that Madoff may settle the civil case , according to lawyers who are not involved in the matter .
Madoff has not appeared in court to formally answer civil or criminal charges .
His lawyers have said Madoff is cooperating with investigators , and a hearing is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday in the criminal case .
But it could be postponed by agreement between prosecutors and Madoff ’s lawyers .
It may take several months at least for the initial claims of investors to be fulfilled , according to lawyers overseeing the liquidation of Madoff ’s firm .
Madoff , 70 , is facing criminal and civil charges in U.S. District Court in Manhattan after authorities said in December last year that he admitted to running a Ponzi scheme over many years with losses of $ 50 billion ( 33 billion pounds ) .
He is under house arrest and 24 - hour surveillance in his luxury Manhattan penthouse apartment following his arrest for what authorities have called the biggest Ponzi scheme in history .
In a Ponzi scheme , early investors are paid with the principal received from newer clients .
Madoff ’s lawyer Ira Sorkin said the SEC filing “ means he has been enjoined from engaging in any violations of anti-fraud regulations . ”
The SEC has been severely criticized by members of Congress and commentators for failing to catch Madoff despite receiving tips .
The agency ’s top enforcement official , Linda Thomsen , is resigning less than a week after a congressional panel chastised here for failing to follow up on those tips [ ID:nN09529402 ] .
The SEC said in Monday ’s court filing that “ defendant Madoff will be precluded from arguing that he did not violate the federal securities laws as alleged in the complaint ” .
One white - collar defence attorney not involved in the case said Monday ’s filing indicates Madoff will settle the civil case .
“ It means that he is not fighting .
He is going to be doing what he can to resolve everything , ” the attorney , Bradley Simon , said .
Another securities lawyer , Brian Miller of the Akerman Senterfitt law firm in Miami , said “ It ’s a sign that he may be running out of resources to fight on every single front ...
One would expect he would be concentrating his efforts to fighting the criminal case rather than the civil case . ”
In court documents filed last week , an updated list of customers of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC was peppered with more than 10,000 names of celebrities , financial firms and banks and smaller investors .
The nonprofit Securities Investor Protection Corp ( SIPC ) has set a July 2 deadline for customers to make their claims to a court - appointed trustee .
Court - appointed trustee , lawyer Irving Picard , said in court last Wednesday that $ 946 million has been recovered so far from Madoff ’s firm to be disbursed to defrauded customers .

Health officials have been forced to withdraw 21,000 doses of the meningitis C vaccine from GP clinics around the UK after it emerged that some doses may have been contaminated with a blood - poisoning bacterium .
More than 60,000 doses of the vaccine , which is offered to all four - month - old babies , could be contaminated with the hospital - acquired infection – the Staphylococcus aureus bacterium – and a third of these had already been sent to vaccination clinics before officials became aware of the problem .
Officials within the Department of Health and the vaccine 's manufacturers are believed to have known of the problem since Tuesday but only issued an emergency recall last night after being contacted about the potential contamination by The Independent .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Last night the Tory health team demanded answers about why it had taken so long to withdraw the vaccine and
said there may need to be an inquiry .
It is not known how many children may have received the dose , but one official said that there have as yet been no reports of any adverse reactions .
In a statement , the Department of Health denied that any contaminated samples had entered the UK market .
" Two batches have been identified and are being recalled as a purely precautionary measure .
These two batches passed all routine quality testing , including a sterility test . "
The revelation comes at a critical time given that many parents are still suspicious about childhood vaccinations due to the unfounded scare over the measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine which was incorrectly linked to autism in a study published over 10 years ago and since retracted .
The meningitis C vaccine , sold under the trade name Menjugate , is manufactured and packed in Italy by Novartis , a multinational pharmaceutical company .
One insider told The Independent that any contamination with Staphylococcus – which is related to MRSA – would have occurred during the preparation of the vaccine in the manufacturing centre in Siena .
The company confirmed last night that two lots of the vaccine – some 61,117 doses imported into Britain – could be contaminated and that 21,301 doses have been sent to GP surgeries over the past week for the Government 's childhood vaccination programme .
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) was working last night with Novartis to recall all the remaining doses of vaccine that had been sent to GPs but which had not yet been used .
A spokeswoman for Novartis said that the company 's press office was made aware of the problem on Monday but she could not say when the company had informed the Department of Health .
" Novartis is working with the relevant government authorities including the MHRA and the Italian Ministry of Health to recall two lots of Menjugate distributed in the UK , " the spokeswoman said .
" We are investigating a sterility testing positive result from samples of one lot of aluminium hydroxide solvent which was used in the packaging of two lots of Menjugate .
The solvent lot passed all release specifications .
The subject result was identified during a special study , " she said .
The MHRA said in a statement issued last night that it was first alerted to the problem on Tuesday .
" The tested samples were of one batch of solvent used in two batches of Menjugate Kit , and were identified positive for the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus during the sterility test .
They [ the two samples ] were not distributed to the UK market , " it said .
" However , as a precaution , these two batches of Menjugate Kit which were distributed in the UK are being recalled .
There is at present no evidence that these two batches of Menjugate Kit are affected , " it added .
A spokeswoman for the MHRA said that , despite the recall , there was no evidence of any risk to children from the vaccine but she could not say how many babies could have already been injected with the vaccine .
" The recall is purely a precautionary measure .
There is no reason for UK children to be at any risk from this product .
All vaccine supplied to the UK had passed the tests required for its use , " she said .
Andrew Lansley , the shadow Health Secretary , said : " This is very disturbing news .
We will be looking to the Government to give the fullest possible account of what 's happened .
" Parents who bring their children for immunisation need to have the greatest possible confidence that the vaccines concerned are safe and their children wo n't come to harm .
I will be looking to the Government to provide this specific assurance . "
Mike Penning , a Tory health spokesman , said : " Parents take vaccines to make their children safe , not put them at risk .
They will want answers as to why it took so long to withdraw the vaccine .
The Government has got to come clean about its decision - making and when the Secretary of State was told what happened .
We could need an independent inquiry to establish the facts . "
The Menjugate vaccine – one of two distributed in the UK – was the subject of safety concerns in 2000 soon after it was introduced into Britain .
However , the Medicines Control Agency said at the time that the fears were unfounded .
Pat Troop , then deputy chief medical officer , said in 2000 the meningitis C vaccine was very safe .
The number of adverse reactions – such as headaches , and sore arms – were normal for this sort of vaccine , she said .
Novartis :
The company behind the jab
The Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis is one of the largest medicine manufacturers in the world with 81,000 employees operating in 140 countries .
It was formed out of the merger in 1996 of two " big pharmas " , Ciba - Geigy and Sandoz .
In 2006 , Novartis acquired the US - based vaccine supplier Chiron Corporation .
Two years earlier , Britain 's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency seized more than 48 million doses of Fluvirin , an influenza vaccine made in Chiron 's factory in Liverpool , over concerns they were contaminated .
The seizure caused a major shortage of flu shots in the US market in which Chiron had a near monopoly .
Nonetheless the vaccine market has remained a strong moneyspinner for Novartis .
Last month the US government awarded it a $ 486 m ( £ 342 m ) contract to build a factory to produce a cell - based influenza vaccine which would be capable of churning out 150 million flu shots within six months of Washington declaring a flu pandemic .
In Britain over the past two years Novartis has been trying to create a vaccine for meningitis B , which kills more than 100 children every year .
Novartis , the Health Protection Agency and the Oxford Vaccine Group have been carrying out a joint trial on three different strains of meningitis B with positive results .
Novartis expects to apply for a licence next year and hopes to have it on the market by 2011 .
Currently 10 per cent of the children with meningitis B die and 15 per cent of those who survive are left with severe disabilities .

Workers excavating an underground garage on the site of an old May Co. parking structure in Los Angeles ’ Hancock Park got more than just a couple hundred new parking spaces .
They found the largest known cache of fossils from the last ice age , an assemblage that has flabbergasted paleontologists .
Researchers from the George C. Page Museum at the La Brea tar pits have barely begun extracting the fossils from the sandy , tarry matrix of soil , but they expect the find to double the size of the museum ’s collection from the period , already the largest in the world .
Among their finds , to be formally announced today , is the nearly intact skeleton of a Columbian mammoth -- named Zed by researchers -- a prize discovery because only bits and pieces of mammoths had previously been found in the tar pits .
But researchers are perhaps even more excited about finding smaller fossils of tree trunks , turtles , snails , clams , millipedes , fish , gophers and even mats of oak leaves .
In the early 1900s , the first excavators at La Brea threw out similar items in their haste to find prized animal bones , and crucial information about the period was lost .

“ This gives us the opportunity to get a detailed picture of what life was like 10,000 to 40,000 years ago ” in the Los Angeles Basin , said John Harris , chief curator at the Page .
The find will make the museum “ the major library of life in the Pleistocene ice age , ” he said .
Because of its need for haste , the team also is pioneering a new technique for extracting the fossils .
Most paleontologists spend days to weeks carefully sifting through the soil at the site of a dig .
In this case , however , huge chunks of soil from the site have been removed intact and now sit in large wooden crates on the museum ’s back lot .
The 23 crates -- ranging in size from that of a desk to that of a small delivery truck -- are responsible for the excavation ’s informal name , Project 23 .
The site of the old two - story parking garage , which was used by the now - defunct May Co. department store , is now owned by the Page ’s neighboring museum , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. LACMA had razed the building to construct an underground parking garage that would restore parkland above the structure .
The entire Rancho La Brea area at Hancock Park is a paleontological treasure chest .
Petroleum from the once - massive underground oil fields oozed to the surface over the millennia , forming bogs that trapped and killed unsuspecting animals and then preserved their skeletons .
It is now a protected site , although dispensation was granted to build the new garage .

Because of the historic nature of the area , the work had to be overseen by a salvage archaeologist .
In this case , the work fell to Robin Turner , founder of ArchaeoPaleo Resource Management Inc. of Culver City , which previously had overseen work on other sites at or near the tar pits .
Her group hit pay dirt when the excavation got about 10 feet below the surface .
“ I knew we would find fossils . . . but I never expected to find so many deposits , ” Turner said .
“ There was an absolutely remarkable quantity and quality . ”
There were 16 separate deposits on the site -- an amount that , by her estimate , would have taken 20 years to excavate conventionally .
But with LACMA officials prodding her “ to get those things out of our way ” so they could build their garage , she had to find another way .
Her solution was a process similar to that used to move large living trees .
Carefully identifying the edges of each deposit , her team dug trenches around and underneath them , isolating the deposits on dirt pedestals .
After wrapping heavy plastic around the deposits , workers built wooden crates similar to tree boxes and lifted them out individually with a heavy crane .
The biggest one weighed 123,000 pounds .

“ We designed a crate so that we could take out the entire deposit without disturbing it so that , at a later date , you could do a proper excavation as you would if it were still in the ground , ” she said .
In 3 1/2 months , working seven days a week , she and her colleagues removed the entire collection two years ago and delivered them to the museum .
For some of the deposits , she said , they had to wear oxygen tanks with full gas masks because of unusually high levels of hydrogen sulfide escaping from the soil .
The only exceptions to the crating process were the mammoth named Zed and a horse skull .
Because they were separate from the other assemblages , they were partially excavated and encased in plastic casts for cleaning in the museum -- the conventional technique for recovering fossils .
Curators are excited about Zed because he appears to be about 80 % complete , missing only one rear leg , a vertebra and the top of his skull , which was shaved off by excavation equipment .

Curators collected 34 mammoths in the initial excavations of the La Brea tar pits from 1906 to 1914 .
“ But they were all disarticulated bones , jumbled together , ” said paleontologist Christopher A. Shaw , collections manager at the Page .
Mammoths on display at the museum are assembled from the bones of many animals .
Zed ’s tusks also are nearly intact -- another rarity since they are made of dentin , which is much more fragile than bones .
Zed ’s skeleton is now being cleaned in the museum ’s “ fish bowl ” preparation room , and the team of paleontologists and volunteers has so far completed only his jawbone and some vertebrae .
All researchers know so far is that he stood about 10 feet tall at the hip and was 47 to 49 years old .
Mammoths normally lived to about 60 , so Zed died prematurely .
Curators have found three broken ribs that were healed before his death .
He probably got them from fighting with other male mammoths , “ or he was just clumsy as hell , ” said Shelley M. Cox , who is supervising the cleaning .

The team also has begun digging through the largest crate but has so far excavated only an area about 6 feet by 4 feet and about 2 1 /2 feet deep .
From that small area , they have so far removed a complete saber - tooth cat skeleton , six dire - wolf skulls and bones from two other saber - tooth cats , a giant ground sloth , and a North American lion .
The tar has yielded more than 700 individual plant and animal specimens , 400 of which have been cataloged , Shaw said .
The team does n’t know the ages of the deposits yet .
All previous specimens from Hancock Park date from 10,000 to 40,000 years ago , and there is no reason to suspect these will be any different , but each must be radiocarbon - dated .
Individual fossil deposits in the area generally cover a time span of about 2,000 years , Harris said , and deposits that are just a few feet apart can be separated in time by thousands to tens of thousands of years .
“ Hopefully , the 16 [ new ] deposits will have 16 different ages , ” Shaw said .

BOCA RATON , Florida ( Reuters ) - Food makers who raised prices repeatedly to fight soaring commodity costs in recent years are now battling with retailers to hold onto those increases as the global economy grinds to a standstill .
Many are touting the relative value of their products versus eating out , promoting their products together with retailers ’ own brands and holding extensive conversations to let retailers know that in some cases their costs remain high even though many commodity prices have fallen , industry executives and analysts said .
" We 're all trying to deal with a difficult economic reality where consumers are getting more demanding and competition is increasing to meet the needs of consumers , so it 's just more pressurized , " Campbell Soup Co CPB .
N Chief Executive Douglas Conant said in an interview .
Manufacturers attending the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Florida this week said conversations with retailers are becoming more intense .
And those talks do not always work smoothly .
Last week , grocer Delhaize DELB .
BR stopped stocking about 300 Unilever ULVR.L products in a dispute over price and other issues .
Though that drastic outcome was limited to Belgium , retailers in the United States are also pushing back harder on prices .
The world 's largest retailer , Wal - Mart Stores Inc WMT.N , more than ever is closely monitoring costs and prices .
“ We work with them to understand their costs , ” Wal - Mart CFO Tom Schoewe said .
“ So as they ’re going up , we ’ll do the right thing and we can pass their prices on . ”
At the same time “ we can go back and say -- oh look , those petroleum - based costs are now down 20 percent , ” he said .
“ We need to act as the advocate or the purchasing agent for our customer , so what we need to do is say it ’s only fair we took it up , and now it ’s time to take it back down . ”
The losers are likely to be brands that are not the leaders or a strong number two in their category , analysts and executives said .
" What you 're going to see over time is that the weaker , second or third - tier brands in some of these categories are n't going to perform well in this economy , " Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N CEO Irene Rosenfeld said .
MORE RETAIL POWER
The pressure from retailers comes because they are losing sales as consumers cut back or search for the lowest prices .
“ The problem right now is the grocer wants to deliver more value for their customers and they are still seeing more price increases come through ” from manufacturers , Morningstar analyst Mitchell Corwin said .
Those grocers have also been helped by consolidation in the industry , which has given retailers a stronger hand in dealing with foodmakers .
“ I think at the end of the day , retailers have more power today than they ever had relative to the ” manufacturers , ” Corwin said .
One way foodmakers are trying to work with retailers is by doing promotions that couple a company 's brand , such as H.J. Heinz Co's HNZ.N Classico pasta sauce , with a retailer 's private - label pasta brand .
Manufacturers also are continuing their attempts to develop new products that they hope will command a higher price and more space on retailer ’s shelves .
“ Everybody ’s looking for something that differentiates themselves and will help them attract consumer traffic , ” Heinz CEO William Johnson said .
Most manufacturers at the conference said they were holding on to their price increases and many noted that while prices for energy , grains and other commodities have fallen , commodity costs remain at historic highs .
In the end , retailers want to make sure that consumers are not finding better prices at competitors .
“ They want to hit price points that will drive foot traffic , and they do n’t want to be embarrassed by the other guy , ” ConAgra CEO Gary Rodkin said .

HR departments for many technology firms tend to be a bit backwards in the way they evaluate potential hires .
Early in the process , an HR member or technical recruiter will typically contribute to the never ending stream of listings posted to the popular online job sites , and funnel the subsequent flood of applicants through a filter before passing on candidates to the geeks .
The key issue is that HR cannot realistically be expected to hold all the technical knowledge necessary to appropriately evaluate and filter applicants based on technical criteria .
Many resumes are thus evaluated solely off keywords or ridiculous automated online exams that supposedly quantify a candidates abilities based off asinine declarative factoids .
My personal hiring strategy , while admittedly skewed towards finding only top tier entrepreneurial people , follows these steps ..
Go to the core of The Right Persons culture .
Forget about the “ Java ” checkbox on Dice.com .
Figure out what The Right Person does online , and go there directly .
Post a Java job to the local JUG mailing list , or a Ruby job to the Ruby talk group , for example .
Only people genuinely into these topics sign up for mailing lists and forums , so by going straight to the cultural center of the ideal candidates interests you ’ve already filtered out the dingbats who would apply just for the sake of applying .
The Right Person is probably already employeed and thus would not be checking monster.com anyway .
Allow HR to apply their own filters after you ’ve identified the right culture .
Evaluate their communication skills via email and phone .
When was the last time you read an uber - competent technologist who ended every sentence with three exclamation points and a smiley face !!! 🙂
Yeah .. me neither .
The subtleties of written language reveal how in touch one is with technical culture .
They might have extensive experience with 16 different databases on their resume , but if they ca n’t explain — in layman ’s terms — what a database driver does , I ca n’t see him / her being able to produce well - documented results or be terribly useful in business meetings .
Ar - tic - u - la - tion of one ’s thoughts in both written and spoken word is critical to effectiveness .
Talk about technology in general .
I do not expect you to know the internals of the JVM to be qualified for a Java developer position .
I do expect you to keep current on general technology trends and always have your ears open .
I expect you to constantly learn and get your hands dirty , and I expect you ’ve done some of it on your own time .
Ask the right questions .
“ What type of Exception does Socket.close ( ) throw ? ” would be the wrong question .
Phrase your technical inquires such that they are open ended , recognize that He / She Is Not Google , and allow the respondent to give an intelligent response even if they do not know the answer .
Example : “ How would you describe the lifecycle of a network connection ? ”
The question is specific enough such that a knowledgeable person can immediately give a thorough answer , but not overly so such that it is a miniscule factoid you ’d see on Jeopardy .
Also ask questions which are subjective or provide incomplete information , such as , “ Which Java OR / M technology would you use in a new web application ? “ .
You ’re not looking for a “ correct ” response , but to gauge how ’ll they ’ll react when prompted with incomplete , unclear or clearly stupid business requests .
Just like the real world .
Arrogance and stubbornness can often show through with a definitive answer to such questions , whereas a more pragmatic person might say “ It depends . ” followed by a diatribe on the pros and cons of various options , none of which a singularly “ correct ” .
Invest the time .
Many large companies outsource recruitment because they see it as a secondary distraction to the organizations primary tasks .
But the thing is … putting the right people in the right roles is as core to your business as it gets .
And for the prices charged by technical recruiters , the $ 20 K + per head can easily be spent on competent geek personnel dedicated to networking in the correct communities for purposes of recruitment .
But do n’t fret : there are companies trying to change the system .
For the time being , however , keep this mind next time you hear an interview going on down the hall …
Organization and role - specific cultural requirements come first ; HR policy requirements come second .

South Asia has a cloud over its head  an unpleasant , unhealthy and climate - affecting soup of sooty haze that envelops the region , particularly in winter .
Scientists have studied what ’s called the “ brown cloud ” for years , yet there has always been uncertainty about it .
How much of the soot and other carbon - containing aerosols that make up the haze comes from the burning of fossil fuels in cars , power plants and the like , and how much comes from burning wood and other biomass for cooking and agriculture ?
Image Researchers found that the burning of biomass was the top culprit behind a brown haze in South Asia .

Orjan Gustafsson of Stockholm University and colleagues have now removed the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the brown cloud .
Burning of biomass , they report in Science , is the greater culprit .

( MENTAL FLOSS ) --
Most of the world seems to think that America invented obesity sometime in the last century , but the truth is , fat has always been a part of life ( witness Hatshepsut , one of the great ancient Egyptian queens who reigned in the 15th century BC -- despite her svelte sarcophagus , modern archeologists believe that she was pretty obese and may have suffered from diabetes ) .
Goldfish may have delivered a dubious dietary aid -- tapeworms .
So it stands to reason that dieting has been around just as long .
Some historians credit William the Conqueror with starting the first fad diet .
Having grown too fat to ride his horse , William went on a liquid diet in 1087 -- or , rather , a liquor diet , since all he did was drink booze .
The story might be apocryphal -- William , still fat , actually died after falling from his horse and there was no word on whether he was drunk at the time -- but it's a good one , and it sets the tone for the next 1000 + years of dieting .
Throughout history , people have been looking for some kind of magic that will allow one to eat and live as one pleases , but still look emaciatedly gorgeous .
And they 've come up with some pretty dubious theories that somehow took hold in the public consciousness and became fads .
Here are a few of our favorites .
Location , location , location
" The Causes and Effects of Corpulence " was a treatise penned in 1727 by one Thomas Short , in which he observed that larger people were more likely to live near swampy areas .
His advice ?
Fat people should move to more arid climes .
Improbable side effects
The namesake of the graham cracker -- ironically now an integral part of that deliciously fattening treat , the ' smore -- was a Presbyterian minister who claimed that overeating could not only make you fat , it could make you lecherous , too .
In the 1830s , Sylvester Graham ran health retreats for like - minded parishioners featuring a strict meat - free , incredibly bland diet .
Chew yourself thin
Horace Fletcher , a turn of the century San Francisco art dealer , became known as the Great Masticator after he claimed he lost more than 40 pounds by chewing his food until it was essentially liquefied and spitting out all the bits that were n't .
Fletcher 's scheme became incredibly popular -- novelist Henry James and industry titan John D. Rockefeller were reportedly fans , as was John Harvey Kellogg .
Kellogg , of the cereal fame , was a health nut who ran a sanitarium in Michigan , where he encouraged his visitors to " Fletcherize " with a little song he wrote called " Chew Chew . "

How cereal transformed American culture
The parasite diet
In the early part of the 20th century , the weight loss industry allegedly found a tiny little helper in the form of a tiny little parasite -- the noble tapeworm .
According to product advertisements of the day , tapeworms were being sold in pill form as a weight loss tool .
While whether or not those pills actually contained a real live tapeworm is certainly debatable , however , there is evidence that jockeys , who frequently needed to lose a lot of weight fast , would try to induce tapeworms .
Another favorite weight loss tool of the Lilliputian equestrians : Burying themselves in piles of horse manure , which acted as a kind of natural sauna .
Introducing the calorie
In 1918 , Dr. Lulu Hunt Peters introduced a new word to the world lexicon --" calorie " ( may she be forever cursed for it ) .
Peters ' book , " Diet and Health , With a Key to Calories , " which helpfully included a phonetic spelling of the word " calorie , " as so many people were unfamiliar with it , sold more than 2 million copies and established calorie - counting as the framework of a good health .
This diet regime was n't particularly dubious , but it did lend a potentially dangerous new tool to those looking for a way to quantify and reduce their food intake .
Case in point :
The Scarsdale Diet of 1979 , a strict 700 - calorie a day diet that works -- because you 're starving .
Mental Floss : Quiz :
Which item has more calories ?
The goldfish diet
OK , this one was n't so much about weight loss as it was fame gain , but in 1939 , it was a fad that swept the nation .
Like most good things , it all started with a bet -- a Harvard University undergrad won $ 10 after swallowing an innocent fishy .
The story spread from there , prompting a countrywide goldfish slaughter .
Goldfish swallowing became so popular that not only were pet stores running out of the indigestible comestibles , but the New York Times published warnings from doctors that swallowing goldfish , which are known to carry tapeworms and other parasites , could be very harmful to one 's health .
The nicotine diet
By the middle of the 20th century , dieting had become such a major economic , social and cultural force in the Western world that cigarette companies , not wanting to miss the money boat , jumped on board promoting cigarettes as a weight - loss tool .
It 's a belief that persists today -- ask any supermodel .
The master cleanse
In the 1940s , nutrition guru Stanley Burroughs created the Master Cleanse , a fast during which the dieter subsists solely on a mixture of cayenne pepper , fresh - squeezed lemon juice , maple syrup and water .
The Master Cleanse is still popular today , especially among anorexics and aspiring anorexics , despite the fact that most nutritionists and doctors say that " detoxing " is a nonsensical and potentially harmful idea .
The Sleeping Beauty diet
Then there 's the Sleeping Beauty Diet , a regime that allows the dieter to literally sleep off the pounds while under heavy sedation for several days .
Elvis was reportedly a fan of that one , right about the time when he was having a little trouble squeezing into those trademark white jump suits , as was a character in the landmark beach read , " Valley of the Dolls . "
Mental Floss : 7 simple rules for how to take a nap
The monotony diets
The 20th century also brought us back to a concept allegedly pioneered by William the Conqueror -- the single food or drink diet .
There 's the Grapefruit Diet , which alleges that eating a lot of grapefruit and drinking a lot of grapefruit juice , in conjunction , of course , with a very low - calorie diet , is the way to weigh less ; the Cabbage Soup Diet , which is said to cause serious gas with a side of nausea ; the Popcorn Diet , which is pretty much undercut by all the tasty things one puts on popcorn to make it palatable ; and the Chocolate Diet , which , though tempting , is just plain silliness .
Memorable dieting paraphernalia
And let 's not forget about the gadgets that went along with these suspect food fads , like the Vision - Dieter Glasses , which made food look unappealing , or the Mini - Fork system , which encouraged people to eat smaller portions by supplying them with -- you guessed it -- smaller forks .
Or how about slimming soaps , popular in the 1930s , which promised dieters that they could just wash the fat away ?
And then there 's the perennially popular vibrating machine , which promised to melt off pounds by a few minutes of intense body vibration -- and which is actually enjoying a comeback now at gadgetry stores like Brookstone .

Motorhomes
Futurliner : the baddest bus ever ?
The monster Class A motorhome you see trundling down the interstate has an ancestor .
It ’s GM ’s wild Futurliner , over 11 feet tall and weighing around 13 tons .
And guess when this baby first appeared ?
These awe - inspiring vehicles were designed by the legendary Harley Earl .
Their story begins in 1933 , when General Motors was persuaded to create a traveling technology roadshow .
The first ‘ Parade of Progress ’ hit the road in 1936 , and in 1940 twelve ‘ first generation ’ Futurliners appeared .
Are they still around ?
Fo ’ shizzle .
In 2006 , one sold for a cool US$ 4 m at a Barrett - Jackson auction in Arizona , and earlier this year , another was delivered to a new owner in Sweden .
The Futurliners carried up to 90 gallons of gas — oh , those were the days — but the first incarnations only had four - cylinder diesels for motive power .
World War II put the brakes on the Parade , and the Futurliners were mothballed .
After the war , they resurfaced in Detroit for another parade , this time commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the invention of the automobile .
In ’53 , no doubt embarrassed by the lethargic performance of its dream machines , the General sent the Futurliners back into the workshop .
They were rebuilt and upgraded , and the Parade of Progress started up again .
This time , the Futurliners had a more appropriate 302 cubes , and four - speed Hydramatics to drive through .
But three years later , television provided a better window on the world than the Parade , and GM sold or gave away its Futurliners .
For some of these vehicles , the history is a little murky : most are accounted for , but four are apparently beyond restoration .
Much as we like originality , we ’d love to see one of these RV forerunners given a modern drivetrain , and a chassis to match the extraordinary looks — top speed in original trim is only around 40 mph ( 65 k ph ) .
And then perhaps Airstream interior design guru Christopher Deam could weave his magic on the interior …
In fact , one Futurliner has already been converted into a motorhome by a guy called Bob Valdez , who did most of the work himself .
Bob put his rig up for sale earlier this year , and if you ’ve got more than a million in the bank and a taste for leather , chrome and maroon velvet , it might not be too late to call him .

Editor 's note : Jeffrey A. Miron is senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University
Economist Jeffrey Miron says the stimulus guideline should be -- first , do no harm .
CAMBRIDGE , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
When libertarians question the merit of President Obama 's stimulus package , a frequent rejoinder is , " Well , we have to do something . "
This is hardly a persuasive response .
If the cure is worse than the disease , it is better to live with the disease .
In any case , libertarians do not argue for doing nothing ; rather , they advocate eliminating or adjusting policies that are bad for the economy independent of the recession .
Here is a stimulus package that libertarians can endorse :
Repeal the Corporate Income Tax : Repeal would spur investment , improve the transparency of corporate accounting , slash compliance costs , and avoid the distortions caused by the special - interest provisions in the tax code .
Repeal can work fast , by raising companies ' share prices , increasing cash flow , and allowing corporations to lessen their need for bank lending .
Another way to boost economy Watch Jeffrey Miron explain on " American Morning " how to add jobs without more spending .
Friday 6 a.m. ET see full schedule »
Thus repeal provides short - run stimulus and enhances long - run efficiency .
Recent estimates suggest that tax cuts are at least as effective as spending increases in raising GDP .
The adverse impact on the deficit is likely to be less than the $ 300 - $ 350 billion in revenue the corporate tax takes in per year , since repeal spurs growth and therefore the revenue from other taxes .
Increase Carbon Taxes While Lowering Marginal Tax Rates : Reasonable people disagree about how much the U.S. should reduce its use of fossil fuels , but crowded highways , air pollution , and global warming all suggest that some reduction is desirable .
The effective way to accomplish this is higher gasoline or other carbon taxes , not the messy , complicated green spending in the Obama plan that will morph into pork in many cases .
If higher carbon taxes are combined with lower marginal tax rates , the private sector faces better incentives on both counts .
This approach avoids the higher deficits implied by Obama 's green initiatives .
Moderate the Growth of Entitlements :
The elephant in the room amidst the stimulus debate is the impending imbalance in Social Security and Medicare as the baby boom generation moves into retirement .
Without reductions in benefits , taxes will have to increase substantially , generating a major drag on the U.S. economy .
A reasonable response is to raise the age of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare , consistent with the increases in life expectancy and health that have occurred in past decades .
This restructuring would reassure markets about the U.S. 's long - run fiscal balance .
This means foreigners will continue to be willing to hold U.S. debt , so U.S. borrowing costs will remain moderate .
Eliminate Wasteful Spending : Most discussion of the stimulus focuses on areas where , according to proponents , government spending should be higher .
Much current expenditure , however , is wasteful .
Examples include agricultural subsidies , bloated transportation projects like the Big Dig in Boston , misguided infrastructure projects like the New Orleans levees ( why encourage people to live below sea level ? ) , ineffective weapons systems , pork barrel spending , and subsidies for Amtrak and the Post Office ( buses are more efficient than railways , and Fedex is more efficient than the Post Office ) .
Everyone knows the U.S. 's long - run deficit picture is dismal .
We should address this by cutting inefficient spending now .
Withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan : President Obama plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq over the next eighteen months , while expanding U.S. involvement in Afghanistan .
It is hard to see , however , that any good arises from dragging out our Iraq exit or from staying in Afghanistan .
The government should move toward faster withdrawal , and from both countries .
The U.S. can redeploy these troops where useful , or release the resources to civilian uses .
Limit Union Power : Later this year , Congress is likely to vote on the card check bill , a new law that facilitates unionization .
The law eliminates the presumption of a secret ballot , which means union organizers can pressure employees into accepting representation .
Laws that protect unions are problematic .
Unions raise wages above market levels , increasing unemployment .
Thus the Obama administration can signal American business that it cares about efficiency , not just redistribution of wealth , by opposing the card check bill .
Better yet , it can repeal the Davis - Bacon Act , which inflates labor costs in federal contracts .
Renew the U.S. Commitment to Free Trade :
One crucial danger in the current environment is that the U.S. and other countries will embrace protectionist policies .
The U.S. enacted prohibitive tariffs during the Great Depression , and many trading partners retaliated .
World trade plummeted , contributing to the economic misery .
The Obama fiscal stimulus risks reviving this insanity , since both the House and Senate bills require that certain stimulus - funded projects use U.S. equipment and goods .
The administration should oppose these provisions .
More generally , President Obama and his economic advisors should state -- no , scream -- that America is unambiguously committed to free trade .
Expand Legal Immigration : Radical changes in immigration policy seem unlikely in the near future , but one specific change is compelling : an increased quota for H - 1B visas , which go to workers with technical skills seeking employment in U.S. industry .
The annual quota for such visas was 195,000 as recently as 2000 , but it now stands at only 65,000 .
A major increase in this quota would be a boon to American scientific and engineering productivity .
More broadly , expanding immigration is the most effective method the U.S. has for aiding poor citizens of foreign countries and for influencing repressive governments .
Stop Bailing out Businesses that Took on Too Much Risk : Popular opinion blames deregulation and private sector greed for the financial meltdown , but the reality is more subtle .
Existing regulation was ineffective at preventing excessive risk - taking , and the private sector did its best to profit from the incentives that were in place .
The extreme increase in risk - taking , however , would not have occurred absent policies that encouraged such risk ( e.g. , Fannie Mae or the Fed 's reassurances about housing bubbles ) or past bailouts that cushioned the losses from private risk - taking .
One crucial response to any crisis is learning to avoid the next one .
The lesson this time is that rewarding risk generates more risk .
The U.S. should therefore stop bailing out banks , automakers , homeowners , or anyone else .
The libertarian view , then , is that many desirable policy changes involve less government , not more .
Even changes that are inconsistent with the Keynesian stimulus framework , such as reductions in military spending , make sense when the spending is wasteful .
It is tempting to believe that every problem has a solution , but the reality is not so nice .
It is possible , even likely , that the best we can do is fix things we know how to fix , and then get out of the way .
This may not ameliorate the current situation , but it avoids making things worse .
In economics as in medicine -- first , do no harm .

Consider the last time you bought a bag of coffee .
Perhaps it ’s wrong of me to assume , but would I be correct in guessing the coffee you purchased was a “ dark roast ” ?
By watching coffee commercials and reading the ads , without hesitation , one would easily believe the dark roast is a superior coffee .
When it comes to the roast of your coffee , while a great deal of it simply has to do with personal taste , do n’t believe mass marketing that says the dark roast is the ultimate expression of quality coffee .
It ’s not .
There are reasons the dark roast has become so popular .
For one thing , the coffee industry is extremely large , the second largest industry next to oil .
Think of the massive volume of coffee that hits the consuming market each year .
Then consider this : only 10 percent of that coffee qualifies as excellent in quality .
The remaining 90 percent is considered somewhere between average to poor .
Meaning there ’s nothing very special about it , no inherent flavors that set it apart from any other coffee .
And if there are intriguing flavors , most likely they are n’t desirable .
For instance , a typical low - grown Robusta coffee can taste medicinal , even rubbery .
So , if so much of the coffee grown is of mediocre quality , why is it that people so happily consume so much each and every day ?
The answer : The Ubiquitous Dark Roast .
( Well , and a lot of cream and sugar too .
I ’ll cover that some other time . )
Light to Dark Roast Progression
Dark roast simply means that the coffee bean has been roasted to a higher temperature and typically for a longer period of time .
This causes all of the flavor molecules stored within the coffee beans - both the good and bad flavors - to be burnt away .
By roasting so dark , the end consumer ( you ) ca n’t tell whether it ’s a good bean or a bad bean because all the natural flavors have been turned to charcoal .
Think of it this way : a fine filet mignon and a strip of utility beef ; if they ’ve both been very overcooked , even a culinary expert would never be able to tell the difference between the two .
Same with coffee .
So if you ’re a large coffee company , what do you do ?
You roast dark , then market the heck out of it and try to convince the mass market that it ’s a wonderfully rich and complex coffee .
You ca n’t really blame them now can you ?
What else are they supposed to do , tell you that because they ’re so big they are unable to guarantee quality , they do you a favor and roast dark so you ca n’t taste how bad it is ?
Not to be misunderstood , I ’m not saying a dark roasted coffee is always a poor coffee .
There are some wonderful dark roasted single - origin coffees and blends out there .
Just do n’t assume the dark roast is as “ rich and flavorful ” as many roasters say it is .
Most of the time there is a reason it ’s roasted so dark .
Instead of going with a dark roast next time you ’re picking up your bag of coffee , consider trying a freshly - roasted bag of something slightly lighter , perhaps a city roast or even a full city roast ( almost a dark roast ) if you ’re not feeling terribly adventurous .
When shopping , keep in mind that the lighter the roast , the more confidence the roaster is showing in the quality of the raw bean .
There ’s a whole world of coffee out there ( quite literally ) and so many natural flavors to experience , do n’t settle for the mediocre stuff .
The darker the roast , the less likely you ’ll experience the subtle apricot flavors in a great Ethiopian Yirgacheffe , or the blueberry notes in a wonderful Harrar , or the earthy , ripened notes of a great Sumatran Mandheling .
Armed robbery in the Parliament ING branch robbed ; robber remains at large .
A man wielding a gun robbed a branch of the ING bank in the Brussels building of the European Parliament this afternoon .
The robbery happened on the ground floor of the Parliament ’s Paul - Henri Spaak building , adjoining the Léopold park .
One report said that the robber then ran up the stairs .
A spokesman for the Parliament said that the perpetrator might still be at large inside the building .
A coat believed to belong to the perpetrator has been found .
He said the records of security cameras were being checked .
Emergency procedures have been set in motion and security staff are now checking people ’s bags as they leave the building .
Neither the Brussels police nor ING would make any comment .
Tony Robinson , spokesman for the socialist group in the Parliament , says on Twitter that the robber wore make - up and wig .

The book was declared " the most important Arabic novel of the 20th Century " in 2001 by the Damascus - based Arab Literary Academy .
Dr Khaled Mubarak , who is the press officer at the Sudanese embassy in London , paid tribute to the writer , whom he knew personally , and his most famous book .
He said : " Long before the term ' clash of civilisations ' became known , Tayeb Salih has written about co-existence of civilisations because in the end , his novel ends actually in a tone of possible co-existence , possible enrichment of the two civilisations and the idea that both can look forward to stronger relations in the future , so it was a very positive novel in this sense . "
Sudanese literary groups have long called for Salih to be nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature .
Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz is the only Arab writer ever to have won the prestigious prize , in 1988 .

“ We cannot successfully address any of our problems without addressing all of them . ”
Barack Obama , Feb. 21 , 2009
When I was a freshman in college , I was assigned “ Reflections on the Revolution in France ” by Edmund Burke .
I loathed the book .
Burke argued that each individual ’s private stock of reason is small and that political decisions should be guided by the accumulated wisdom of the ages .
Change is necessary , Burke continued , but it should be gradual , not disruptive .
For a young democratic socialist , hoping to help begin the world anew , this seemed like a reactionary retreat into passivity .
Over the years , I have come to see that Burke had a point .
The political history of the 20th century is the history of social - engineering projects executed by well - intentioned people that began well and ended badly .
There were big errors like communism , but also lesser ones , like a Vietnam War designed by the best and the brightest , urban renewal efforts that decimated neighborhoods , welfare policies that had the unintended effect of weakening families and development programs that left a string of white elephant projects across the world .
These experiences drove me toward the crooked timber school of public philosophy : Michael Oakeshott , Isaiah Berlin , Edward Banfield , Reinhold Niebuhr , Friedrich Hayek , Clinton Rossiter and George Orwell .
These writers  some left , some right  had a sense of epistemological modesty .
They knew how little we can know .
They understood that we are strangers to ourselves and society is an immeasurably complex organism .
They tended to be skeptical of technocratic , rationalist planning and suspicious of schemes to reorganize society from the top down .
I am not sure if this Blood spill pillow design is horrifying or hilarious , but one thing is for sure .. it is creative .
It could definitely be a great way to prank and scare all your friends , or even cause your Mom to get a severe heart attack .
Fromkeetra has presented amazing pillow designs entitled Blood Puddle Pillow that show as if the people pictured have been shot in the head and have mass blood loss .
Some of the images look pretty real , while others let us see it is some form of funny prank .
They claim that it is a project that was inspired when loved ones sleeping by you are in a moment of complete stillness , making you wonder of their wellness .
In this morbid interpretation , they combined both fear and humor into one comforting pillow .
I would love to get my hands on this pillow and play a trick on a friend or relative , but I ’m afraid that some may not be too happy with such a joke .

Amid an aggressive push to bolster its ranks with thousands of new deputies , the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department loosened its hiring practices and gave jobs to recruits who in the past would have been rejected , according to a department watchdog report released Thursday .
Among those hired were applicants with criminal records , drug and alcohol problems and financial woes .
One recruit , for example , had been released from another police agency after using excessive force .
Another candidate had abused marijuana and steroids and been convicted of underage drinking shortly before he applied to become a deputy .
The report , written by the county ’s Office of Independent Review , criticized the department for its 2006 decision to abandon a strict hiring policy , in which aspiring sheriff ’s deputies were automatically disqualified if they failed to pass an exacting background check or any other part of the application process .
In its place , the report found , the department adopted a more liberal approach that allowed applicants to be hired if officials determined they had reformed themselves or that past mistakes were insignificant .
The change came as the department was working to increase its ranks .
Coming off several years of budget constraints during which the size of the department shrank significantly , sheriff ’s officials set out to make up for lost ground .
In 2006 , the department more than doubled the number of applicants it conducted background checks on and hired twice as many candidates over the year before .
In the last three years , the agency has hired more than 2,700 deputies .
Advertisement
“ They had a mission and that mission was to hire deputies , ” said Michael Gennaco , head of the Office of Independent Review , which oversees the department .
“ Unfortunately , it may have come at a price in the quality of people they hired . ”
Sheriff ’s officials , Gennaco said , failed to lay out clear guidelines on who made for an acceptable candidate under the more accommodating hiring strategy .
“ They changed their philosophy , but then said nothing else about what that means . . .
What does it mean to take a ‘ holistic ’ approach to hiring ? ”
Gennaco said , using the department ’s description of its recruitment practices .
“ It means whatever you want it to mean .
That is not a very principled way to do business . ”
The problems were compounded when overworked and insufficiently trained staffers struggling to handle the dramatic increase in applicants failed in some cases to sufficiently investigate potential problems uncovered during background checks , the report found .

Sheriff Lee Baca acknowledged the report ’s basic findings , saying there was “ human error in people judging other people for their suitability . ”
Many of the problems , he said , arose after a panel of commanders that used to review questionable candidates was dismantled without his knowledge .
“ There is no excuse for hiring a problematic person , ” Baca said .
The report highlights the troubling profiles of nine deputies hired under the new guidelines .
Six have since been fired or resigned and three have been relieved of duty pending investigations into misconduct .
One man was hired even after he lied in an interview , telling investigators that he had never been arrested or had any encounters with law enforcement agencies .
In fact , investigators discovered that he had repeatedly been stopped by police for driving with a suspended license and that a judge issued a warrant for his arrest after he failed to appear in court .
The background check also found that the recruit had disappeared from his base for three months while serving in the military and had been a suspect in a police investigation after he borrowed a friend ’s car and then refused to return it .
The man ’s time in the department was short - lived .
He resigned during his first year on the job after being arrested on assault charges , the report found .

Another applicant came looking for a job several years after he was fired from another California police agency , where he had been investigated several times for excessive force and other misconduct .
In one instance , he drove his knee into the back of a 60 - year - old woman and twisted her arm .
He also was found to have been arrested for driving while under the influence .
Several other police departments had refused to hire the man , but the Sheriff ’s Department offered him a job .
During his first year working in the county jail , several inmates and others complained that he was prone to “ blow up at others ” and “ fly off the handle . ”
He was eventually dismissed after throwing a shoe at an inmate .
A female candidate was admitted to the sheriff ’s academy despite nearly failing high school and dropping out of a community college before earning a degree .
A subsequent investigation unearthed a web of gang affiliations and led to accusations that she was using her position in the department to access databases and provide information to gang members .
She was allowed to withdraw from the academy .
County supervisors responded with concern .
“ The consequences of erring , the consequences of not being thorough and vigorous are horrific .
One case can do a lot of damage , ” Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said .
“ No matter how many officers we want to hire . . . coupled with that goal is the presumption that the integrity of the ferreting process will not be compromised . ”
The department , Baca said , was in the process of adopting one of the many recommendations made in the report .
Going forward , he said , prospective deputies would once again be automatically rejected if they are found to have been fired from a previous law enforcement agency , or have serious drug offenses or other major transgressions .

China says it wants stronger military ties with the new US administration China wants improved military relations with the United States when Barack Obama becomes president .
But a senior military official made it clear that it wants the US to stop selling arms to Taiwan , a self - governing island that China considers its own .
The comments came at an event to unveil a biennial military report .
This says that China 's security situation is improving , although it still faces a number of threats .
At a press conference to release the report , Colonel Hu Changming , noting the changes in Washington , said : " In this new period , we hope that both China and the US can make joint efforts to improve and promote military - to - military relations between the two countries . "
Serious harm Col Hu , also the spokesman for China 's ministry of defence , admitted that current military ties between the two nations were " faced with difficulties " .
Last October , the US announced it was selling $ 6.5 bn - worth of military hardware to Taiwan .
In response to a question about the sale , Col Hu said : " We call upon the Department of Defense in the US to remove the obstacles to the growth of military relations between the two countries . "
The report itself , entitled China 's National Defence in 2008 , made a similar point .
" The United States continues to sell arms to Taiwan ... causing serious harm to Sino - US relations , as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait , " it says .
The paper gives an overview of China 's armed forces , its development and recent military events .
It says the country 's security environment continues to improve , particularly its relations with the island of Taiwan .
We call upon the department of defence in the US to remove the obstacles to the growth of military relations between the two countries
China 's defence spokesman Col Hu Changming China wants reunification with Taiwan , which has been self - ruled since 1949 , and believes it is making headway .
" The attempts of the separatist forces for ' Taiwan independence ' to seek de jure Taiwan independence have been thwarted , " the report says .
But it also notes that China continues to face threats , notably from independence forces in the western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang .
Economic insecurity caused by the slowdown in growth could also cause problems , it says .
A number of Chinese leaders have recently warned that an economic downturn could lead to more social unrest .
The report gives no information about China 's military spending - a subject which concerns the US .
The amount Beijing spent on its military increased by 18 % last year , according to official figures .
But the report reiterates a point often made by Chinese officials - that the country spends less than others on its armed forces .
In 2007 , China 's military spending was just 1.4 % of gross domestic product .
That figure was 4.5 % in the US and 2.7 % in the UK , according to China .

The Swiss banks are renowned for their secrecy and their lenient stance when it comes to tax evasion and this makes Switzerland into the top destination for money from all kinds of sources .
Websites like www.swiss-offshore-banking.com praise the advantages of the system :
The Swiss Banking system is second to none .
Revered the world over , Swiss Bankers are known for their privacy , professionalism and discretion .
Swiss banking laws are very strict and it is illegal for a banker to reveal the personal details of an account number unless ordered to do so by a judge .
This is long established in Swiss law .
Any banker who reveals information about you without your consent risks a custodial sentance if convicted , with the only exceptions to this rule concerning serious violent crimes .
Swiss banking secrecy is not lifted for tax evasion .
( emphasis by me )
The reason for this is because failure to report income or assets is not considered a crime under Swiss banking law .
As such , neither the Swiss government , nor any other government , can obtain information about your bank account .
They must first convince a Swiss judge that you have committed a serious crime punishable by the Swiss Penal Code .
No more .
In a landmark development the Swiss Bank UBS has agreed to hand over data of about 300 US citizens and their banking accounts to the IRS and pay a $ 780 mn fine on top of that .
This hit Switzerland where it hurts most .
The finance industry is one of the most important contributors to Swiss wealth the outcry is immense :
The Zurich based NZZ writes :
Wenn die Schweizerische Finanzmarktaufsicht ( Finma ) tatsächlich , wie das Gerücht geht , unmittelbar davorsteht , in einer bisher einmaligen Aktion Daten von einigen hundert Kunden der UBS an die amerikanischen Behörden auszuliefern , oder dies womöglich schon getan hat , ist dies ein folgenschwerer Schlag für den Finanzplatz Schweiz , aber auch für den Rechtsstaat Schweiz .
If the Swiss financial oversight agency ( Finma ) , as rumours have it , is set to hand out data on several hundred customers to US authorities , or possibly has already done so , this is a severe blow to Switzerland ’s finance market as well as it ’s legal system .
( my translation and in case of errors , my bad ) ( article )
Well , it ’s not an “ if ” anymore here ’s the text of the agreement .
Switzerland ’s neighbours , namely the Germans are waiting for a crack in the armour of the Swiss banking secrecy for quite a while now and the pressure on Switzerland was growing during the last months .
After the fall of the tax haven Liechtenstein in the wake of the arrest of former Deutsche Post boss Zumwinkel , it looks as if Switzerland could be next .
This comes at a most inconvenient moment .
Swiss banks have suffered greatly from the banking crisis and there is a credit bubble in Eastern Europe on the verge of bursting which may lead to another wave of write - downs and will bring the Swiss economy and currency to the verge of desaster .
I ca n’t wait to read tomorrow ’s newspaper and I brace for the opening of the Swiss stock exchange .

New NYPD Data Shows Record Number of Stop- and - Frisks in 12 - Month Period
Sony says PlayStation 3's
Home is a value - added component of PS3 ownership , and the company believes the social virtual world can fundamentally change the way gamers play online .
At the Gamasutra - attended Engage !
Expo in New York City , SCEA 's Jack Buser discussed the strategic goals behind the creation of PlayStation Home , rather than comparing it to other virtual world offerings .
" Home is a really important strategic move for us at Sony , " said Buser .
" Early on , we saw a real need to bring the PS3 community together with a social network . "
According to Buser , Home was designed to replicate the social interaction that has been lost in current online play .
Back in the old days , console gamers would have friends come over and play multiplayer games by plugging in controllers .
During that play time , they would negotiate who would play what and which game was next .
In the same way , gamers in Home can go to the Warhawk sand table , discuss strategies , and then launch into the game together .
Furthermore ,
Home provides gamers with a social setting so that people can get to know each other naturally .
People 's friends lists , said Buser , are populated with friends from real life and friends gained through online play , but the online play is not enough to really get to know a person .
Just as in real life , Home has social icebreakers like bowling alleys , hangouts , and house parties .
Currently at 5 million users while still in beta , Home also provides each avatar with an apartment .
That 's where Buser feels
Home really differentiates itself from social networks on other console platforms .
" An avatar without a space is pointless .
The space around the avatar actually says more about that person than an avatar in isolation can , " said Buser .
" People will go around Home , meet someone , and then say , ' Hey , do you want to go back to my apartment ? '
That 's where you see the true engagement and that 's how people make friends . "
To decorate their living quarters , players have access to a variety of virtual wares , from ninja suits to samurai sword racks .
Some are free , while others are available at a cost of $ .50 - $ 1 .
Brands have been especially interested in Home , said Buser , but Sony has been careful to partner only with brands that have credibility with the user base and add value to the community .
In addition , there 's content on Home that 's not available elsewhere .
For instance , Resident Evil has a space on Home that looks like a scene from the game , but when inspected closer , it 's a faux film studio set that looks as if the game 's footage was shot there .
For 2009 , Home is focused on putting up content as quickly as possible and is looking to third party providers for help .
" The # 1 lesson we learned is that the game community has a voracious appetite for content , " said Buser .
" They want more , more , more more stuff to do . "
Therefore , Home 's strategy is to continually provide new experiences , new contests , and new activities .
The bulk of the content requests come from the community .
" We 're constantly in dialog with the consumer , " said Buser .
For Buser , Home has accomplished its aims in that it has become the community for PS3 owners .
In addition , partners are pleased with the amount of interaction with their brands .
" It 's becoming a core part of the PlayStation experience .
That 's what we set out to do . "

Scrap metal was once a lucrative trade for Eastern European Gypsies but as Nick Thorpe reports , this has been devastated by the global economic crisis .
The global financial collapse has hit the scrap metal trade Melting snow has turned the unpaved roads of Zizin into streams of mud , ankle deep .
Wading through it , in search of drier ground , your ears grow accustomed quickly to the gentle murmur of the wintry village , dogs barking , cocks crowing , neighbours calling out to each other through hazel fences .
There are sharper sounds too , like the fireworks set off by children in far - off cities .
But there is no money for such frivolities in this predominantly Gypsy village .
The sounds are made by bull - whips , lengths of rope with horse - hair tied in knots at the end .
Scrap scarcity Cracked incessantly by the kids at the end of streets , in the yards of houses , but above all on a small hill which overlooks the village .
Splitting the sky apart for a split - second , as though in the space created , poverty might be transformed into wealth , tin into gold .
Zizin - the name itself sounds like sheets of tin falling on tin .
And that is how many of the Gypsies here made a living , until the global financial crisis struck .
Like millions of scrap-metal hunters and gatherers around the world , the Gypsies of eastern Europe did well from the tinkers ' trade in recent years , as the price of metals soared .
A huge hunger for metal in the construction industries of India , and China in particular , fuelled the price rises .
But that has all changed now .
Bridge stolen Gypsies and non-Gypsies alike snapped up every scrap as it fell by the wayside , and today , it seems , there is little left for anyone to gather up .
As scrap became scarcer in recent years , the theft of metal became more common in eastern Europe and beyond .
One of the first Soviet locomotives in Ukraine , all 14 tonnes of it , and a metal bridge which connected a village in the west of the country to the outside world , were the most brazen thefts .
I 'd like to work as a welder but there 's no work for welders round here , still less for Gypsy welders

In Hungary , the re-opening of the Freedom Bridge over the Danube in Budapest , closed for many months for repairs , was postponed after thieves in eastern Hungary went off with hundreds of steel girders prepared for it .
The guttering and even the roofs of churches , and bronze plaques to Holocaust victims have all disappeared overnight .
And copper wire , used in railway signalling , was especially prized .
Sixty three trains were disrupted in one day alone near Prague , when a length went missing between two main city stations .
Prices plummet Both the Czech Republic and Hungary have now passed laws imposing strict controls on the operation of scrap metal yards .
Hungary alone has 20,000 .
Now everyone selling is obliged to record their identities , and full details of their loads .
But the new legislation may prove redundant .
The economic downturn means people are not spending on scrap metal .
Prices paid for it have fallen in some places by 90 % .
From Zizin , Ion Ocelas , a father of five children with a sixth on the way , used to make the trip to the scrapyard in the nearest city , Brasov , almost daily .
Now he says it is hardly worth it .
He used to get 33 euro cents ( £ 0.29 ) for each kilogramme he brought in , now he is getting three cents .
Even if his horse - drawn wagon was piled high , he would only come back with a handful of small coins , less than a beggar might make for a day 's pleading on the pavement outside the famous Black Church in Brasov .
As scrap becomes scarcer metal thefts have increased in Eastern Europe " I 'd like to work as a welder , " he says , as he restacks the last of his metal collection - the twisted blue bonnet of a car , pots and pans , and something white and spiked , like the head of a metallic thistle - " but there 's no work for welders round here , still less for Gypsy welders " " People here have no time to think about the future , " says Father Raia , an Orthodox priest of Gypsy origin , when I ask him what hope he sees .
" They have to eat today . "
At the main scrapyard in Brasov , buried deep in waste land beneath the girders of a new road , the manager refuses to talk .
But on the western outskirts of the Romanian capital , Bucharest , the owner of another yard , Ciprian Porumb , is happy to unburden his concerns .
Future fears " I used to get the $ 450 ( £ 300 ) a tonne for this , " he waves his hand at a mountain of scrap , still being unloaded from lorries .
" That fell to about $ 150 ( £ 100 ) , but I dare to hope it will improve again soon . "
As he speaks , a four - piece Gypsy street band , blasting on trombones and drums , marches boisterously by , serenading the ladies at the upstairs windows of the drab flats which overlook the scrapyard .
Back in Zizin , Ion 's seven - year - old daughter , Rebecca , is feverish .
The doctor has been called .
We leave the village as darkness falls , and an ambulance siren mixes with another orchestra of children crying , horses braying , dogs barking and always the whips , cracking in the frost .

On most evenings you can find South El Monte Mayor Blanca Figueroa in her wood - paneled City Hall office , which is crowded with her personal touches -- figurines , plants , plaques , photographs , three flags , a tattered Bible , a refrigerator , a microwave and two fish tanks housing Ricky , Lucy , Fred and Ethel , her four betta fish .
“ It ’s my home away from home , ” said Figueroa , who admits she ’s often there until the wee hours doing city work .
“ I put on my slippers , put my hair up .
It ’s comfortable . ”
Her fellow City Council members , however , think it ’s too comfortable .
They contend that Figueroa is living in the office because her own home is not fit to be occupied .
“ The mayor has been living at City Hall for the last eight months , ” said City Councilman Hector Delgado , who added of her office , “ Does it look like a professional office or does it look like somebody ’s bedroom ? ”

Delgado has been leading an effort to limit the amount of time Figueroa can spend at the office .
He says he has surveillance video that shows Figueroa there at night , kicking back , cooking dinner and watching Mexican soap operas .
That ’s because her own house , he says , lacks heat and air conditioning .
Delgado ’s charges this week are the latest salvo in a public battle that has drawn international attention since he and his fellow council members voted last week , with Figueroa in mind , to prohibit all city workers from being in City Hall after 11 p.m .
Figueroa , 53 , calls the allegations “ ridiculous and preposterous , ” and says Delgado has never been to her “ absolutely livable ” home .
Besides , she says , “ There ’s no place to sleep at City Hall , and it ’s too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter . ”

Since the council ’s curfew vote Dec. 9 , reporters from all over the world have been calling , and the City Council has been barraged with hundreds of e-mails from far and wide .
Residents in the city of 20,000 hardly seem to have noticed .
“ I have n’t talked to my neighbors about it , and I ’m not really interested , ” said Jody Bush , 74 , who has lived in the city for more than half a century .
“ I saw CNN was doing it .
I was surprised by the interest in it . ”
South El Monte is a tight - knit , no-fuss , blue - collar town , and people ’s minds are on the ailing economy , which has hit local families and industry hard .
And even though it has changed a lot over the years , it ’s still the sort of place where people have known each other for years .

On Monday , after giving an interview to NPR about the curfew , Figueroa walked the two blocks from City Hall to the South El Monte Senior Center to help preside over the annual Christmas luncheon .
She was welcomed like a celebrity by the senior citizens , many of whom she greeted by name .
“ Hola ! ” she said again and again as she made her way slowly through the crowd .
The mood at the party was convivial .
There was a raffle , a performance by a local cheerleading troupe and a big spread of turkey , sweet potatoes and green Jell -o .
Many of the 300 or so seniors at the party had lived in South El Monte most of their lives and saw it grow from farmland to a place of light industry such as window , door and shoe manufacturing .
Today , nearly 70 % of South El Monte is industrial , with the rest a grid of residential neighborhoods with modest houses and neat lawns .

“ Where the school is , there was a pig farm when I moved here , ” said Nadine Martin , 87 .
“ It ’s been built up a lot , but I would n’t want to live anywhere else . ”
When Figueroa moved to South El Monte from East Los Angeles with her parents and five brothers in 1960 , the town was still very rural .
The family raised cows , goats and chickens at the home where Figueroa still -- at least by her own account -- lives .
Back then , the mayor says , her family was discriminated against because they spoke Spanish .
Today , more than 80 % of the town is Latino , and business is sometimes conducted in Spanish at City Hall .
There ’s also a sizable population of Chinese , Vietnamese and Cambodian residents .
Figueroa got her political start in the ‘90s .
She was teaching at the local high school at the time and was outraged when she learned that a developer had planned to build a casino near the school .
She formed a committee to fight the casino , won that fight and then decided to run for a council seat .
She was elected to the panel in 1997 and elected mayor in 2003 .

Figueroa says she spends most of her days in meetings , so she needs her evening hours to catch up on e-mail and paperwork .
And she has to do that work at the office , she said , because she does not have a fax machine or a copier at home .
The workload , she says , has been especially heavy during the last six to eight months -- something she blames on the economy .
More and more South El Monte residents are being laid off from their jobs and losing their homes , she said .
Council members do n’t deny that there ’s more work to do of late .
They just question when and where she ’s doing it .
Advertisement
“ I ’ve gone in there , and she ’s watching TV and eating her dinner , ” said Councilman Joseph Gonzales .
“ She ’s been using the office as a living space , and that ’s not what the offices are intended for . ”
They also have raised safety concerns , pointing out that a car was burglarized in the parking lot recently on a night when the mayor was alone in her office , just a few hundred feet away .
In South El Monte , as in many cities , the mayor is a member of the council .
Figueroa was the only council member to vote against the curfew last week .
Gonzales said that the council ’s five members are meant to share two offices .
As for Figueroa ’s lair , he said , “ It used to be a generic office for all City Council members to use .
Our office has been made into her office . ”
Figueroa , who frequently refers to herself in the third person , has been saying in recent days that she will try to comply with the wishes of her colleagues .
But she makes no firm promises .

“ The mayor ’s work is never done , ” Figueroa said .
“ The mayor ’s got to burn the midnight oil . ”

Twitter was born about three years ago , when @Jack , @ Biz , @ Noah , @ Crystal , @Jeremy , @Adam , @TonyStubblebine , @ Ev , me ( @Dom ) , @ Rabble , @RayReadyRay , @ Florian , @TimRoberts , and @Blaine worked at a podcasting company called Odeo , Inc. in South Park , San Francisco .
The company had just contributed a major chunk of code to Rails 1.0 and had just shipped Odeo Studio , but we were facing tremendous competition from Apple and other heavyweights .
Our board was not feeling optimistic , and we were forced to reinvent ourselves .
“ Rebooting ” or reinventing the company started with a daylong brainstorming session where we broke up into teams to talk about our best ideas .
I was lucky enough to be in @ Jack ’s group , where he first described a service that uses SMS to tell small groups what you are doing .
We happened to be on top of the slide on the north end of South Park .
It was sunny and brisk .
We were eating Mexican food .
His idea made us stop eating and start talking .
I remember that @ Jack ’s first use case was city - related : telling people that the club he ’s at is happening .
“ I want to have a dispatch service that connects us on our phones using text . ”
His idea was to make it so simple that you do n’t even think about what you ’re doing , you just type something and send it .
Typing something on your phone in those days meant you were probably messing with T9 text input , unless you were sporting a relatively rare smartphone .
Even so , everyone in our group got the idea instantly and wanted it .
Later , each group presented their ideas , and a few of them were selected for prototyping .
Demos ensued .
@ Jack ’s idea rose to the top as a combination of status - type ideas .
@ Jack , @ Biz , and @ Florian were assigned to build version 0.1 , managed by @ Noah .
The rest of the company focused on maintaining Odeo.com , so that if this new thing flopped we ’d have something to fall back upon .
The first version of @ Jack ’s idea was entirely web - based .
It was created on March 21st , 2006 .
My first substantive message is # 38 :
We struggled with a codename and a product name .
“ It ’s FriendStalker ! ” joked @ Crystal , our most prolific user .
The userbase was limited entirely to the company and our immediate family .
No one from a major company of any kind was allowed in .
For months , we were in Top Secret Alpha because of competing products like the now - defunkt Dodgeball .
The original product name / codename “ twttr ” was inspired by Flickr and the fact that American SMS shortcodes are five characters .
We prototyped with “ 10958 ” as our shortcode .
( We later changed to “ 40404 ” for ease of use and memorability . )
@ Florian was commuting from Germany , so in order to operate with him we secured a “ long code ” , or a full 10 - digit phone number linked to a small - potatoes gateway .
Twttr probably had about 50 users in the 10958 days .
I was following everyone on the system .
We had an admin page where you could see every user .
As Head of Quality for the company , it seemed like my duty to watch for opinions or issues from our users .
This caused confusion , though , when family members of our team were suddenly being followed by a seemingly random person .
Thus , Private Accounts were born .
@ Jack and @ Florian created a means for users to mark themselves private , and we admins had the ability to tell who wanted to be private so we ’d know not to follow them .
Actual , real privacy with secure protection came a bit later .
I ’d say there were about 100 users when Private was invented .
The interaction model and the visual metaphor for the service were constantly in flux .
The meaning of being someone ’s “ Friend ” versus “ Following ” someone changed regularly .
At that point , you could either get all SMS messages or get none .
There was no Twictionary back then ; data in the system were referred to as “ posts ” or just “ messages ” .
The lack of clear terminology led to some pretty spirited debates leading up to the Spring of 2006 .
We launched Twttr Beta on @ Ev ’s birthday .
We could now invite a slightly larger circle of friends , but still excluding any large companies ( with a few trusted exceptions within places like Google ) .
I ’ll never forget the family - friendly feeling of that day .
We all knew that we were going to change the world with this thing that no one else understood .
That day stands out in memory as the deep breath before a baby ’s first cry .
Meanwhile , Odeo and the corporate board were at a tension point .
Not only was the value of Twttr difficult to describe , the relevance of Odeo was declining monthly .
Drastic cuts were recommended .
One day in early May 2006 , @ Ev let four of us go : @ Adam , @TonyStubblebine , me , and @Rabble .
@ Noah and @TimRoberts would later be asked to leave as well .
It was a tough decision and huge shock to each of us .
We all handled it differently .
Looking back on it , I think Twitter allowed us to stay connected when we might not have otherwise been .
After all , we were n’t even public with the site yet , so each of us continued to add value just by using it with each other .
During this transition , Twttr.com launched to the public .
Still , very few people understood its value .
At the time most people were paying per SMS message , and so would n’t Twttr run up our bills ?
Also , how were we supposed to use this thing and who cares what I ’m doing ?
Each one of us original users became a kind of personal evangelist for Twttr , trying to get our coworkers and friends to use it .
At this point , Obvious Corp was born as an incubator with Twttr as its sole project .
@ Jack was still just an engineer , and the service was only a few months old when the group acquired Twitter.com and re-branded .
Back then , we had no character limit on our system .
Messages longer than 160 characters ( the common SMS carrier limit ) were split into multiple texts and delivered ( somewhat ) sequentially .
There were other bugs , and a mounting SMS bill .
The team decided to place a limit on the number of characters that would go out via SMS for each post .
They settled on 140 , in order to leave room for the username and the colon in front of the message .
In February of 2007 @ Jack wrote something which inspired me to get started on this project : “ One could change the world with one hundred and forty characters . “
Just in time for SxSW , @RayReadyRay rigged a very sweet Flash - based visualizer that ended up on display on the halls of the conference .
I was n’t working there , but I used to visit regularly to see how our baby was doing .
I happened to be at the office in SF when the visualizer went live on site in Austin .
I remember finding a bug just before showtime , as @ Biz and @Jeremy talked over the phone .
Everything miraculously fell into place by the time people filtered out of the sessions to see their comments floating along the hallway screens .
Boom # 1 : Twitter won an award in the Blog category , and @ Jack thanked everyone in 140 characters .
MTV Music Awards : Boom # 2 .
Apple WWDC 2007 , and then TV , and then print and pretty soon Cable news : Boom # 3 .
@ Jack became the CEO of a newly spun - off Twitter , Inc. during the Boom Times .
People still did n’t quite “ get it ” but at least some people had heard about it .
The team created permalinks and RSS feeds .
@ Blaine pushed for IM integration .
Each major feature added tremendous gains in users , and in usage per user .
Still small by social networking standards , Twitter delivered something immediate and vital that no other service could attain .
For a lot of people , the entire API launch was really the time when Twitter first left the nest .
But that is another story , for another time .

We ’re happy to see President Obama getting tough with Congressional Republicans who are trying to sabotage the stimulus and recovery bill and bring even greater ruin on the economy .
Since Mr. Obama campaigned on the promise of bipartisanship , we hope he will also bring his hammer down on shortsighted Democrats who are threatening their own brand of havoc .
Mr. Obama had it exactly right on Thursday when he warned against reducing “ the scale and the scope ” of the economic measure .
If anything , the government should be more ambitious in its spending on economic stimulus , recovery and growth .
Unhappily , there are many Republicans who have not learned the lesson of this last campaign  that Americans rejected their arguments that government is the enemy and tax cuts answer all economic questions .
It would be highly irresponsible for Congress to accept the Republicans ’ wrongheaded calls to cut back on the stimulus portions of the economic package , and shortchange longer - term spending on health care , schools and infrastructure .
We applauded Mr. Obama when he said , “ The time for action is now because we know that if we do not act , a bad situation will become dramatically worse .
Crisis could turn into catastrophe . ”
Best Buy 's zombie - packed Resident Evil 5 launch event will be getting some help from the U.S. Army which will be on hand with M16's for a " staged event " , we 're told .
Advertisement
Earlier this week we reported that the Stroudsburg , Pennsylvania Best Buy would be holding a special Resident Evil 5 premiere event for the launch of the game , filling their store with zombies and bringing customers through a make - shift haunted house .
News of the event has brought a bit more attention to the store and , it sounds like , given them a bit more capital to play with for the event .
Advertisement
Now , I 'm told , the store will be hiring student actors to play the roll of doctors and scientists and instead of just a few ambling zombies there will be staged events both inside and outside the store .
Among the events planned is some sort of major encounter involving members of the U.S. Army complete with M16s firing blanks .
Another event involves live chainsaws and sprayed blood .
Inside the store , quarantined areas will be packed with zombies .
The tours will end , I 'm told , with some sort of big scare .
Drake Cambell , who helped come up with the event , said he went to the local recruiting station to borrow fatigues for some actors .

" I asked for fatigues and they said why do n't we just show up , " he said .
" So we upped the ante . "
While it could have happened earlier I am glad Padre v0.26 was finally released as Jérôme Quelin has announced on use.
perl.org .
It was a longer than usual cycle and many parts of the configuration and plug - in API were broken in the process .
There are some bugs we already found with the new version but I hope in the next few days we 'll be able to fix those issues .
With these configuration and API changes we hope to keep the API stable for a few months so more people can start using Padre and develop plug-ins for it .
We should also make sure that from now on the transition is as smooth as possible between API changes .
Thanks for all the Padre developers who made this happen and thanks to Jérôme for releasing it .

Det er tredje gang , Marie er forbi mellemlederens kontor den dag , " Jeg har set på det projekt , du gav mig , og jeg vil gerne revolutionere måden , man kan gøre det på totalt , og har allerede fat i nogle for at se , hvordan man kunne gøre det , " fortæller hun begejstret , mens hendes nærmeste chef kigger først lidt forstyrret , men hurtigt responderer med ros og anerkendelse .
Fjerde gang og femte gang Marie banker på døren , vil hun have chefens mening om den vej , hun har valgt , nu også er den rigtige .
Senere møder hun mellemlederen , der står og snakker med afdelingens øverste chef ved kaffeautomaten , " Jeg har fået en ny ide med hensyn til det ledelsesseminar , vi talte om i går , " fortæller mellemlederen engageret .
Det er hverdag på en moderne arbejdsplads , og kampen for anerkendelse er i gang .
Og kampen er så heftig , at der på det nærmeste er gået inflation i anerkendelsen .
Alle vil ses , høres og anerkendes for deres særlige kompetencer .
For det er den eneste måde , moderne medarbejdere , der ikke længere har faste parametre for en god præstation , kan sikre sig den flygtige anerkendelse .
Og lederne mærker det .
De er blevet en slags heppekor for deres medarbejdere , der vil have synlige ledere og et konstant sikkerhedsnet omkring sig , samtidig med at de kræver frihed og høj grad af selvstændighed .
Pres på lederne
" Der er sket en anerkendelsesinflation , fordi folk er blevet så fokuseret på at få anerkendt deres kvalifikationer og særlige behov , at det nærmest kan sætte ting i stå .
Behovet for anerkendelse bliver umætteligt , for hvor går grænsen for , hvor meget anerkendelse den enkelte medarbejder kan forvente , " siger lektor i sociologi Michael Hviid Aalborg Universitet .
Også antropolog og ph.d.- stipendiat ved Institut for Ledelse , Politik og Filosofi , Copenhagen Business School Susanne Ekman kan via sit forskningsarbejde på moderne vidensarbejdspladser se en markant tendens til , at lederne i stigende grad oplever medarbejdernes adfærd som et pres .
" Der er mange ledere , der er tyngede af deres medarbejderes krav om anerkendelse , ros og om set blive set konstant .
Næsten alle de ledere , jeg taler med , mener , at det er en af de store udfordringer , som de har svært ved at løse .
Og jeg kan se en begyndende tendens til , at de prøver at introducere nye ledelsesdyder , der handler om at skabe klare rammer for at dæmme op over for den overvældende anerkendelsestrang , som de møder , " siger Suanne Ekman , der bruger teenagepsykologi til at beskrive moderne vidensarbejdere .
" Moderne medarbejdere kan minde om teenagere .
På den ene side er de overansvarlige - eller i hvert fald overengagerede .
På den anden side er der en meget stor ansvarsfralæggelse , hvor man længes efter den autoritære chef , der sætter rammerne .
De er ekstremt grænsesøgende og vil ikke have eksterne kriterier for , hvad der er godt .
Men samtidig vil de gerne have , at chefen er der hvert andet sekund og fortæller dem , om de er gode nok .
Chefen skal gå og blive på en gang .
Det er det samme skisma som hos teenageren ; jeg vil selv bestemme over mit liv , men du skal stadig give mig lommepenge , " siger Susanne Ekman .
I flere undersøgelser peger medarbejdere på danske virksomheder endog på , at de ikke bliver rost nok af deres ledere .
" Der er en række undersøgelser , der tyder på , at medarbejdere ikke mener , at deres ledere er gode nok til at lede og ankerkende , " siger arbejdsmiljøchef i Ledernes Hovedorganisation , Lars Andersen : " Og jeg tror , at der en del ledere , der oplever , at de skal rose for meget .
Det kan blive så selvfedt alt sammen , at man ikke kan kalde en spade for en spade , og det tror jeg egentlig også , at mange medarbejdere kan være trætte af , " siger han .
Obama og Fogh roser ikke
Ifølge prodekan for formidling ved Danmarks Pædagogiske Universitetsskole Claus Holm har den anerkendende og tillidsfulde leder vundet kampen som tidens foretrukne idealfigur .
Og det er utænkeligt , at en dansk leder offentlig ville udtale , at skyldfølelse var en del af hans ledelsesprincip , hvilket den kommende præsident i USA Barack Obama for nylig gjorde i Times Magazine .
Også statsminister Anders Fogh Rasmussen blev ramt af kravet om den glade og rosende chef , da en unavngiven minister i Berlingske Tidende i forrige uge , udtale , at statsministeren ikke er nogen " omsorgsfuld chef " eller " roser , hvis man gør noget godt . "
" Anerkendelsesfilosofien har fået en gennemslagskraft , der gør , at der er gået wellness i den på store dele af arbejdsmarkedet .
Vi har fået et lykkepersonale i form af pædagoger , der skal kredse om den enkeltes selvværd .
Og nu har vi også fået lykkeledelse , der skal bestyre den hyggelige stemning og har ansvaret for , at den enkelte ikke bliver ramt på sin personlighed , som vedkommende investerer fuldt ud i sit arbejde , " siger Claus Holm , der påpeger , at det hele bliver sat på spidsen af den unge generation , som ifølge Holm , er blevet opflasket med anerkendende pædagogik .
" Ledere i dag møder den generation , som er vant til at få ros , men klart ikke er vant til at få kritik .
Får de kritik , går de enten ned eller er selvfede , og tænker , ' det kan godt være , at du ikke synes , at jeg ikke har skruet det ordentligt sammen , men det er alts å den måde , jeg gør tingene på ' .
Sidstnævnte er immune over for ledelsesmæssig intervention .
Når dommer i talentshowet X - Factor Thomas Blachman , siger til en deltager : ' Du skal ikke synge , for det dur du ikke til ' , så går deltageren bagefter ind i et rum og siger til kameraet , at ' Blachman bare er idiot , det har ikke noget med mig at gøre . ' "
Krav på at være unik
Selvom man ikke præcist kan sætte fingeren på , hvornår anerkendelse og ros tager overhånd , er det nemt at beskrive dens følgesvend ; konfliktskyheden .
" Den meget oppustede ankendelsesdiskurs betragter enhver form for kritik som noget destruktivt .
Høflighed bider kritikken i tungen ; fordi vi skal være så høflige , sociale og anerkendende , er det ikke længere muligt at tilbyde sine kolleger , sine medarbejdere eller leder kritik , " siger Michael Hviid .
Det er imidlertid ikke udtryk for en særlig dysfunktion i moderne mennesker , at de angler efter ros og anerkendelse , påpeger Susanne Ekman .
Arbejdspladskulturen i dag kræver , at man skal signalere , at man vil overskride sig selv hele tiden for at være ansættelsesrelevant .
Det er ikke legitimt for en medarbejder at sige , at det hele skal være forudsigeligt .
Vidensmedarbejdere flytter sig desuden meget fra job til job .
Derfor bliver det vigtigt hele tiden at være attraktiv .
Og internt i en organisation kan medarbejderne mærke , at de , der bliver favoriseret , er dem , der skiller sig ud .
Idealet er at være unik .
At kunne bryde det banale i højere grad end den gedigne håndværksmæssige kunnen - den udliciterer man .
Det kan være det basale redaktørarbejde på et forlag , hvor det , som kernemedarbejderen skal kunne , er , at tænke visionært og networke , forklarer Ekman .
Alle de egenskaber , man bliver belønnet for , handler om at skille sig ud og blive set .
" Det er på alle måder truende at være usynlig eller et med mængden .
Kampen for anerkendelse er en basal selvopholdelsesdrift , " siger Susanne Ekman , der beskriver usynlighedsfantom som bagsiden af anerkendelsesdiskursen .
" I forskningen beskæftiger man sig med at manglende anerkendelse kan være årsag til sociale og personlige patologier .
Men jeg prøver at vise med min forskning at selve anerkendelsesdynamikken kan gå ind og feede nogle af de skrøbelighedsmønstre .
Anerkendelse fungerer ikke kun som noget , der øger velbefindende , tryghed og sikkerhed .
Det kan blive benzin på en accelerationsmaskine , der ikke har nogen stopklods . "
Frygt er ikke svaret
Samtidig understreger Suanne Ekman , at det vil være forkert , ikke at se ledernes egen rolle i kampen om anerkendelse , og give moderne medarbejdere ansvaret for deres egne krav om forkælelse .
" Lederne rekrutterer ud fra idealer om højt engagement og kreativitet , snarere end ud fra stabile håndværksmæssige færdigheder .
Men så synes de altså , at det er besværligt at skulle håndtere bagsiden af disse super - medarbejdere , som på fire af ugens fem dage præsterer det umulige - og på ugens femte dag har deres akutte selvværdskrise med dertil hørende monumentale behov for anerkendelse .
Så der er ikke nogen good guys og bad guys her .
Der er tale om et arbejdsmarked , der er skruet ind i urealistiske og gensidigt udelukkende forventninger omkring nyskabelse , forandring og profit , " siger Susanne Ekman , der opfordrer medarbejdere til at tænke i andre strategier end anerkendelse og blive i stand til at tåle længere perioder af rutinearbejde og uden at blive set og kommenteret .
Lederne skal på deres side sende signaler om , at det lange seje træk - at man kan implementere sine ideer og få dem til at fungere - også har værdi .
Claus
Holm så gerne , at der blev spillet mere - men afbalanceret - på skyldfølelsen og den dårlige samvittighed hos medarbejderne , i stedet for at rosen er i højsædet .
Den megen ros fører nemlig ifølge Holm alt for nemt til ansvarsforflygtigelse .
" Hvad skal ledere gøre i stedet for at rende rundt og anerkende , rose og vise tillid hele tiden ?
De skal ikke skabe frygt , skælde ud og vise skepsis , men i stedet skabe en bedre balance mellem anerkendelse og frygt , ros og skæld ud , tillid og skepsis , " siger Claus Holm , der pointerer , at selvstændighedens styrke netop er , folk indfrier forventninger uden at blive akkompagneret af en leders klapsalver .
Lars Andersen fra Ledernes Hovedorganisation advarer om , at ' mangement by fear ' ikke er gangbar i den særlige danske arbejdspladskultur , der er baseret på dialog og tillid mellem chefer og medarbejdere .
" At skulle rose og anerkende kan være ødelæggende for en virksomhed , for alt er ikke rosværdigt .
Man skal kunne stille bastante krav som leder og også sanktionere .
Men det kommer an på situationen , derfor vil jeg sige , at det ledere skal kunne i dag , det er at lede situationsbaseret .
Brændende platforme virker måske i USA , men på langt sigt , tror jeg ikke , det er konkurrencedygtigt , " siger Lars Andersen .
If you 've never tried Firefox , Safari , Opera Google Chrome or other Internet Explorer alternatives , now might be a good time .
Microsoft 's flagship browser , the default choice on countless Windows machines , currently has a serious security flaw that affects all versions of the browser running on any version of Windows .
The vulnerability allows hackers to gain access to any sensitive data on your PC .
Even more worrying , the exploit is already in the wild and no there 's no fix in sight , leading a number of security researchers to suggested that , in the interest of avoiding malicious software , users switch to another browser .
If you 're the pry - it - out - of - my - cold - dead hands sort of IE fan , there is one bright side to news that some 10,000 sites are ready to pwn your PC : so far the sites are mostly Chinese and the malicious software is mainly after passwords for computer games , which can be sold on the black market .
But given the scope of the flaw and the fact that Microsoft has yet to release a patch , do n't expect that to last .
Eventually far more sophisticated trojans will likely emerge with far more dangerous goals .
Obviously Microsoft is n't recommending you ditch IE ( though the company did n't hesitate to suggest dumping Apple 's Safari browser when it suffered from a far less serious vulnerability ) .
Instead the company has released a security bulletin with possible workarounds , including running IE in Protected Mode and running Windows as an non-administrative user ( to limit the damage an attacker can inflict ) .
Microsoft also says it is investigating the flaw and may push out an emergency software patch , rather than wait for the next monthly patch cycle to roll around .

A sign marks the entrance to Wells Fargo bank in Dallas , Texas October 9 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jessica Rinaldi
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - After canceling employee outings last week in the face of public indignation over lavish ways on Wall Street , Wells Fargo & Co. went on the offensive in a full - age advertisement in Sunday ’s New York Times .
“ Okay , time out .
Something does n’t feel right , ” the ad begins , before attacking “ media stories ” for creating the mistaken impression that every employee recognition event is a “ junket , a boondoggle , a waste , or that it ’s for highly paid executives .
Nonsense ! ”
The ad does acknowledge that all employers , but especially those of publicly traded companies receiving support from the U.S. government , should reexamine how much they spend on recognition events .
Wells canceled its major events , such as trips , for 2009 , and has received $ 25 billion from the government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
But the cancellation of those events hurts those Wells Fargo employees who are “ most deserving of recognition , ” such as tellers , personal bankers , operations clerks and credit analysts , the ad says .
The ad attempts to compensate those employees for the thanks they will not receive this year at their canceled events , said Wells spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard .
“ This advertisement was a way to publicly acknowledge their accomplishments so that all of our stakeholders know how much we value their accomplishments , ” she said .
In January , Wells Fargo reported a fourth - quarter loss of $ 2.55 billion , or 79 cents per share , compared with a profit of $ 1.36 billion , or 41 cents , a year earlier .
The results exclude the bank ’s acquisition of Wachovia Corp .
Wells shares closed at $ 19.14 on Friday , 55 percent off their September high .

Biomaterial helps rebuild broken bones
A synthetic biomaterial that encourages the body to create bone could be the answer to successful bone grafts and treating bone disease , say Australian researchers .
Dr Cameron Lutton of Queensland University of Technology ( QUT ) says the biomaterial activates the initial stages of bone healing .
" The biomaterial interacts with blood and mimics early bone healing events , " says Lutton .
After a bone is broken , there is a fast inflammatory response where blood clots and specialised cells are quickly attracted to the fracture site .
These cells encourage a cascade of proteins , hormones and other cells to create new bone .
But if the gap is too large , due to a large break or removal of a tumour , this natural process can't happen .
" If the chunk of bone missing is too big it can't heal , this is the circumstance that people need assistance , " says Lutton .
Bone grafts or synthetic materials are used to assist in the healing process , but they have their limitations .
" There are several products that fill up bone holes with minerals found in bone .
It looks like bone , but it is n't and it can't be dealt with by the body in the same way , " says Lutton .
The biomaterial created by researchers at QUT and Stryker Australia , encourages the body 's natural clotting process , promoting bone growth .
Encouraging growth
The key to the biomaterial is its surface structure , which is coated by a special arrangement of polymers that attract the right proteins to the wounded bone , explains Dr Ben Goss project researcher .
" There are polymers that attract proteins and those that repel them .
By getting the right balance we can attract and repel the right proteins to create bones , " says Goss .
Under laboratory conditions the biomaterial induces the proteins and hormones needed for the initial inflammatory response .
" We know that it does the right thing to the blood to begin bone regeneration , " says Goss .
The next step is to determine whether later stages in the bone regeneration process are happening .
Successful preliminary results were presented at the Australia New Zealand Orthopaedic Research Society 's meeting late last year , and animal trials are currently underway .
If the trials are successful the biomaterial will move to human trials to treat patients with significant bone defects .
According to the researchers bone disease affect more than a million people worldwide .
They say half a million bone grafts are performed annually in the United States to fill fractures that cannot naturally heal .
Yemen released 170 men once suspected of being members of al - Qaeda just two weeks after the terror group announced that Yemen had become the base of its activities for the whole Arabian peninsula , security officials said Sunday .
Terror Hub Thousands of al - Qaeda supporters active in Gaza Ali Waked
Ynet learns that thousands of Global Jihad supporters currently active in Gaza Strip ; most are Hamas , Popular Resistance Committees members who objected to lull , any kind of compromise , Gaza source says Thousands of al - Qaeda supporters active in Gaza
The announcement also comes as government forces announced they are poised to sweep through the northern city of Marib to combat an entrenched al - Qaeda presence that includes both Yemenis and Saudis , said a security official earlier .
All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to speak to the press .
The suspects were freed Friday and Saturday after signing pledges not to engage in terrorism , a technique the Yemeni government has often used with those suspected of fighting in jihadi causes abroad .
Local tribal leaders are also expected to guarantee the good behavior of the released .
The practice stems in part from the powerful role played by the tribes across the rugged Yemeni countryside as well as the comparative weakness of the central government .
In the past , such release have raised concern in the United States and increased its reluctance to release Yemeni detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility .
Yemen has said it expects most of the 100 remaining Yemenis there will be sent home after President Barack Obama ordered the prison shut .
Yemen has long harbored elements of al - Qaeda in its remote hinterland , but last month Saudi al - Qaeda fugitives in Yemen and their Yemeni associates announced in an Internet video that they were joining forces to form a single group .
On Saturday , Saudi Arabia issued a list of 85 most wanted living abroad , that including two Yemenis .
Many of the Saudis on the list are suspected of hiding out in Yemen as well .
Jeremy Clarkson also accused the prime minister of lying to the public Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has said he is sorry for calling Gordon Brown a " one-eyed Scottish idiot " .
He said : " In the heat of the moment I made a remark about the Prime Minister 's personal appearance for which , upon reflection , I apologise . "
The broadcaster made the comments to journalists in Sydney when he was speaking about the economic crisis .
The Royal National Institute for the Blind said it had offered to meet Mr Clarkson to discuss his comments .
Clarkson later clarified his apology , telling The Sun that he " very specifically apologised for making fun of his personal appearance - very specifically .
I have n't apologised for calling him an idiot . "
' Unforgivable '
The BBC said it noted Clarkson 's apology for the comments and would be taking no further action .
Public figures have reacted angrily to the presenter 's remarks , with Labour MP Gordon Banks saying what Clarkson said was " unforgivable " .
Number 10 would only say that Clarkson " is entitled to his own interpretation of the economic circumstances " .
The spokesperson declined to comment on the specific insult about Mr Brown , who lost the sight in one eye after an accident as a teenager .
But the Royal National Institute for Blind People called the comment offensive .
" Any suggestion that equates disability with incompetence is totally unacceptable , " said chief executive Lesley - Anne Alexander .
" Our offer is still open for Mr Clarkson to talk to us and learn more about the real contribution people with sight loss make to all aspects of society . "
Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray joined in the criticism .
" Such a comment is really a reflection on Jeremy Clarkson and speaks for itself , " he said .
" Most people here are proud that the prime minister is a Scot and believe him to be the right person to get the UK through this global economic crisis . "
Clarkson is in Australia to host Top Gear Live , a stage version of the hit BBC show .
Such a comment is really a reflection on Jeremy Clarkson
Iain Gray
Scottish Labour leader
The controversial presenter compared Mr Brown to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , shortly after Mr Rudd had addressed the country on the severity of the global financial crisis .
Clarkson said : " He [ Rudd ] genuinely looked terrified .
The poor man , he 's actually seen the books .
" In England we have this one - eyed Scottish idiot ... he keeps telling us everything 's fine and he 's saved the world and we know he 's lying , but he 's smooth at telling us . "
Mickey - taking
It had also been reported that Clarkson had called Australians " apes " .
However the BBC press office has strongly denied that this was the case .
They said that the presenter was referring to some of the UK audience members , in keeping with the style of the programme .
" Top Gear is known for its tone - the presenters take the mickey out of each other , and the Top Gear studio audience are n't immune from that either . "
Former BBC director General Greg
Dyke said he did not believe Clarkson should be taken off air .
" The truth is if Jeremy Clarkson worked in news or current affairs he would be fired , he would be out of there because you can't have anybody who is supposed to be impartial making that kind of statement .
" Clarkson 's Clarkson , he says many things that I find deeply offensive quite regularly .
I think that 's life - I think if you take all those people out of the media and off television you get a very boring media . "
In November , more than 1,800 people complained to the BBC after Clarkson made a joke on Top Gear about lorry drivers killing sex workers .
The joke followed the conviction of forklift truck driver Steve Wright for the murders of five prostitutes in Ipswich .
Some 340 people also complained to regulator Ofcom , but it later ruled the joke did not breach the broadcasting code .

Twenty - three dolphins have died after becoming stranded on the Cornish coast .
An RNLI lifeboatman described Porth Creek near Portscatho as a " scene of carnage " after the dolphins died there .
One was believed to be pregnant .
Rescuers helped seven of the animals rejoin their pod out at sea .
Two dolphins had to be put down , one of them was found stranded at Trellisick .
The British Divers ' Marine Life Rescue charity was responding to reports of more dolphins stranded along the coast .
It is thought a few dolphins may have got into trouble and their distress calls lured others into the inlet .
It 's a horrible scene of carnage with bodies everywhere
Dave Nicoll , Falmouth lifeboat Helmsman Dave Nicoll , from Falmouth Lifeboat , said two of his crew got into the water with the dolphins .
He said earlier on Monday : " It 's a horrible scene of carnage with bodies everywhere , but we are doing our best to help and will continue to support the expert groups . "
Coastguards said the dolphins swam up the Percuil River and were beached in Porth Creek on Monday morning .
Details of the dead dolphins were logged before their removal A team from the Divers ' charity worked with vets and coastguards to rescue seven of the stranded mammals .
Another animal had to be put down .
Charity spokesman Tony Woodley said this was the biggest mass stranding of marine life in the UK for many years .
" We have n't seen a stranding anywhere near this scale since 1981 when pilot whales were beached on the east coast .
" This is extremely rare . "
He said the animals were striped dolphins - an ocean - going , rather than coastal breed .
One theory is that a few of the animals may have followed fish , which were feeding on a large algae bloom , into the river mouth .
It is believed their distress cries may have lured other members of their pod to the creek .
The carcasses of the dead animals were removed from the creek and logged by volunteers from Cornwall Wildlife Trust before being taken away for post - mortem examination .

On Bondadagur , or Husband 's Day , the menfolk of Iceland are spoiled by their wives and girlfriends , who serve them with traditional delicacies such as ram 's testicles and sheep 's head jelly , a recipe for which is handily included in the latest online edition of Iceland Review , alongside the latest bulletins on the economic meltdown .
Icelandic women , however , are more likely to be studying the financial news than the recipes - and more likely to be thinking about how to put right the mess their men have made of the banking system than about cooking them comfort food .
The tiny nation , with a population of just over 300,000 people , has been overwhelmed by an economic disaster that is threatening its very survival .
But for a generation of fortysomething women , the havoc is translating into an opportunity to step into the positions vacated by the men blamed for the crisis , and to play a leading role in creating a more balanced economy , which , they argue , should incorporate overtly feminine values .
The ruling male elite is scarcely in a position to argue .
The krona has collapsed ; interest rates and inflation have soared ; companies and households which have borrowed in foreign currency are overwhelmed by their debts and unemployment is at record levels .
An exodus of young people is feared from the capital only recently held up as a centre of cutting - edge cool .
Walking along Laugavegur , touted until a year or so ago as the Bond Street of Reykjavik , the gloom is palpable .
The idea that Reykjavik , an attractive , low - rise provincial place , could be a financial nerve centre on a par with the gleaming skyscrapers of Canary Wharf and Wall Street now seems utterly absurd .
Over the past 10 years , however , little Iceland became a test - bed for the new economic order .
Led by businessmen such as Baugur boss Jón Asgeir Jóhannesson , a nation previously best known for cod and hot springs reinvented itself as an Atlantic tiger .
The Icelanders bought stakes in huge tracts of the British high street , including House of Fraser , Whistles and Karen Millen .
Their banks were equally buccaneering , adopting free market reforms with gusto and moving with relish into financial engineering .
The upshot : they now owe at least six times the country 's income for 2008 and have been taken into state hands .
Unlike in the UK , Iceland 's women are at the forefront of the clean - up .
The crisis led to the downfall of the government and the prime minister 's residence - which resembles a slightly over - sized white dormer bungalow - is now occupied by Jóhanna Sigurdardóttir , an elegant 66 - year - old lesbian who is the world 's first openly gay premier .
When she lost a bid to lead her party in the 1990s , she lifted her fist and declared : " My time will come . "
Her hour has now arrived - and the same is true for a cadre of highly accomplished businesswomen .
Prominent among them are Halla Tómasdóttir and Kristin Petursdóttir , the founders of Audur Capital , who have teamed up with the singer Björk to set up an investment fund to boost the ravaged economy by investing in green technology .
Petursdóttir , a former senior banking executive , and Tómasdóttir , the former managing director of the Iceland Chamber of Commerce , decided just before the crunch to set up a firm bringing female values into the mainly male spheres of private equity , wealth management and corporate advice .
Tómasdóttir says : " Our Björk fund is to focus on sustainable growth .
Iceland was the first in the world into the crisis , but we could be the first out , and women have a big role to play in that .
It goes back to our Viking women .
While the men were out there raping and pillaging , the women were running the show at home .
" We have five core feminine values .
First , risk awareness : we will not invest in things we do n't understand .
Second , profit with principles - we like a wider definition so it is not just economic profit , but a positive social and environmental impact .
Third , emotional capital .
When we invest , we do an emotional due diligence - or check on the company - we look at the people , at whether the corporate culture is an asset or a liability .
Fourth , straight talking .
We believe the language of finance should be accessible , and not part of the alienating nature of banking culture .
Fifth , independence .
We would like to see women increasingly financially independent , because with that comes the greatest freedom to be who you want to be , but also unbiased advice . "
Men are in a minority at Audur , but Tómasdóttir is keen to hire more .
" There are fewer of them , but they are not tokens , we have hired them on merit .
Now , if we have two equally competent people , we would positively discriminate in favour of the man because we want balance , " she says , without a flicker of irony .
Even before the credit crunch , Iceland scored highly on measures of sex equality , coming fourth out of 130 countries on the international gender gap index ( behind Norway , Finland and Sweden ) .
The rate of female participation in the labour force runs at more than 80 % , compared with just over 90 % for men ; there is generous maternity and childcare provision from the state , along with paternity leave .
Most Icelanders remain geographically close to their extended families , making childcare easier , and the distances in Reykjavik are small , so mothers can easily get to their children 's schools in a crisis .
Differences between Iceland and the UK are immediately obvious at all levels : the drivers of the coaches taking me to and from the airport were both female , the massage therapist at the female - friendly health spa , male .
Similarly the debate about how - rather than whether - women should participate in the reconstruction of Iceland 's shattered financial system is a mainstream discussion , whereas it is seen as a fringe issue here .
This egalitarian backdrop has given Icelandic businesswomen a self - confidence their equivalents in the UK quite simply lack , according to one senior British female executive who frequently does deals with Reykjavik .
" There is never a problem with me being a woman , whereas in the UK there is always an undercurrent .
Most Icelandic men genuinely view women as equal .
They are not shackled with our social and class history , and they do n't have all - boys public schools which breed chauvinism .
Corporate women in the UK can be very aggressive , because they are defensive and because they have to be .
I 'm sure Icelandic women will play an even bigger role now because the men have so spectacularly fucked up .
We have a lot to learn from them , but we are so entrenched I do n't know if it will ever happen . "
Jóhanna Waagfjörd , 50 , the chief executive of Hagar , which invests in food and fashion retail , is an economist by training .
Perched in her third - floor office above the shops in the pristine but near - deserted Smaralind shopping mall in Reykjavik , wearing a chic white shirt and trim fitting jeans , she , like the other Icelandic business women I encounter , looks a good decade younger than her years .
If she looks nothing like the standard - issue British woman boss in her sober dress or a navy skirt suit , she sounds nothing like them either .
While senior women in the UK are extremely reluctant to introduce feminine , let alone feminist , themes into the conversation , Waagfjörd and her Icelandic sisters talk openly about the womanly and maternal qualities they bring to the boardroom table .
" I do n't have children - I decided that because I wanted to be free to pursue my career - but motherhood is a value for all women .
Ten or 15 years ago I would n't have wanted to say that motherhood was something important , because that was not the rule of the game .
But the value you bring as a woman is the maternal aspect , the strength that comes from motherhood . "
Tómasdóttir , whose company shares a name with her five - year - old daughter , agrees .
" Audur was one of our foremost Viking women , the name means wisdom , strength and happiness , and a clear space .
We talk of the company as a daughter . "
Tómasdóttir is also unabashed at promoting middle - aged women as a force for good in the boardroom - a taboo in this country , where female executives are more likely to be grabbing , panic - stricken , at the anti-ageing creams than celebrating their midlife energy surge .
" I have recently turned 40 and Kristin is 43 .
We are going through a midlife transition ; for men it is a midlife crisis .
At 40 most women undergo a self - exploration , and they look at everything : they look at their body and ask , 'am I in the shape I want to be ? '
They look at their husband , and ask : ' Is this the guy I want to spend the rest of my life with ? ' , and they look at their career and ask : ' Is this really satisfying ? '
You get to the point where you see there is emotional capital that is never measured or valued in the way it should be .
I just want to live in congruence with that side of myself . "
The British businesswoman , who , tellingly , prefers to remain anonymous , says this Icelandic attitude to midlife femininity is unimaginable in the British boardroom .
" I am in the same age bracket and I cannot conceive of discussing the positive power of the fortyish woman with male colleagues , " she says .
" They would freak out . "
Waagfjörd points a finger at young , inexperienced men who , she says , became too dominant in the boom .
" I was in the US for six years , and when I came back 10 years ago , at the age of 40 , things had really changed .
Suddenly there were a lot of young men about 35 or 30 .
They used to call to try to sell me derivatives which were really complicated .
They thought they were really clever , but they were still living at home with their parents . "
Elín Jónsdóttir , a 42 - year - old lawyer with two children , worked at the Icelandic financial regulator until 2005 and is now managing director of Arev , an investment firm set up by Jón Scheving Thorsteinsson , the former chief executive of Baugur UK .
She believes the boom and bust is not a men versus women situation but a question of different value systems .
" During the boom we saw what we would typically say are masculine values , but it is dangerous to stereotype .
These so - called masculine values are common in women as well , and the variability within each group is much larger then the variability between the groups . "
Nonetheless she believes Icelanders accept women will play a major role in the reconstruction of the economy .
" We all feel it is strange when you looked at the banks and the directors were all male , and this is in Iceland where female participation in the workplace is higher than anywhere else in the world .
We are beginning to look at companies as old - fashioned if they have only male directors .
There is still a bit of a boys ' club , with women as outsiders - people know the rules and are comfortable with that - no one was asking the difficult questions .
But the boardroom should not necessarily be too comfortable . "
Although there is a group of self - confident women taking centre stage in Iceland , the country is still far from being a businesswoman 's Utopia .
Hrund Rudolfsdóttir , a 40 - year - old mother of three , is a director of Milestone , a company specialising in strategic investments in financial services , and sits on the board of Iceland 's confederation of employers .
She is concerned that , although women her age may benefit from the crisis , younger women could suffer .
" Women of my generation with experience will see more opportunities than ever before , because now the whole nation has realised how important it is that you have a diverse group of managers who can ask critical questions .
We are seeing unemployment on a big scale for the first time .
Young women who should be making their way into middle management may be pushed back .
After they have their children they might find it hard to get back into the job market , and some women may choose to opt out . "
There is also a fear of the " glass cliff " : the worry that , if women do win top jobs , they will inherit very difficult situations , some will inevitably fail , and the cause of equality will be set back .
Research from Exeter University has found that companies are more likely to appoint a woman when they are experiencing a crisis , because they are seen as more consensual and less abrasive , though these qualities are not valued so highly at other times .
The danger is that , if women become associated with failure , it could actually hinder their advancement .
But as Rudolfsdóttir says : " There is a risk , but as women we cannot claim we are capable and then turn away because of that risk . "
As the Icelanders are discovering , it can be hard to find women who are entirely unbesmirched by the crisis , since those of sufficient seniority to be credible leaders have themselves come up through the old system ; of the two women recently promoted to run Iceland 's nationalised banks , Landsbanki and Glitnir , one has already been elbowed aside for these reasons .
Not everyone in Iceland has bought into the idea that women will revolutionise capitalism .
" Women would like to think it 's their turn now , but it wo n't be - there will be a bit of fuss for a while but men will keep the real power at the top , " said a local taxi driver in his sixties .
" I 'm not giving you my name , though , because my wife speaks English and she would kill me if she read that . "
That is not a view that gains much traction with Halla Tómasdóttir .
" If the institutions are under the control of a single group - and now it is men - and they all think the same way , we are not going to make positive changes .
For the first time in 100 years we have the chance to create a company , a society , a country , and hopefully a world that is more sustainable , more fair for men as well as women .
If we are not going to do that now , then when will we ? "
( CNN ) -- President Obama on Tuesday outlined an ambitious agenda that requires " significant resources , " even as he aims to halve the deficit by the end of his first term .
President Obama says the United States will overcome its current economic struggles .
In his first speech to a joint session of Congress , Obama said it 's time to act boldly not just to revive the economy , but " to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity . "
" While the cost of action will be great , I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater , " he said .
The president struck an optimistic tone , asserting that " we will rebuild , we will recover , and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before . "
Obama focused on the three priorities of the budget he will present to Congress later this week : energy , health care and education .
The president said he sees his budget as a " vision for America -- as a blueprint for our future , " but not something that will solve every problem or address every issue .
Watch Obama lay out his plan to " save our children from debt " »
" It reflects the stark reality of what we 've inherited -- a trillion dollar deficit , a financial crisis , and a costly recession , " he said .
Obama said his administration already has identified $ 2 trillion in government spending cuts that can be made over the next decade .

The president touted the $ 787 billion stimulus plan he signed into law last week , saying it will invest in areas critical to the country 's economic recovery .
He also made bold promises for what these investments will achieve .
Obama predicted that because of the recovery plan , the United States will double its supply of renewable energy in the next three years .
He also said the country will invest $ 15 billion a year to develop technology for green energy .

Obama also pledged a " historic commitment " to health care and said the recovery plan could lead to a cure for cancer .
He also promised the " largest investment ever " in preventive care .
On education , Obama set a goal of having the highest college graduation rate in the world by 2020 .
He pointed to the billions for education -- from early childhood education expansion to college - loan programs -- in the economic stimulus package to ensure that every child has access to education " from the day they are born to the day they begin a career . "
Obama also said his budget will pay for more soldiers and Marines , increase their pay and expand veterans health care and benefits .

Obama said the recovery plans already in the works are immediate steps to revive the economy in the short - term , " but the only way to fully restore America 's economic strength is to make the long - term investments that will lead to new jobs , new industries , and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world . "
" Slowly , but surely , confidence will return , and our economy will recover , " he said , asking Congress to join him in " doing whatever proves necessary because we cannot consign our nation to an open - ended recession . "
Obama promised to reform the regulatory system to " ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again . "
The president also signaled that he was willing to take on entitlements , saying that Congress must take on the growing costs of Medicare and Social Security .
Obama described the nation 's financial woes as a " reckoning " for poor decisions made by both government and individuals .
Watch what Obama says about the " day of reckoning " »
" A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future , " Obama said .
" Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market .
People bought homes they knew they could n't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway .
And all the while , critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day . "
Noting that is easy to " become cynical and doubtful , " Obama said he has learned that " hope is found in unlikely places . "
Obama avoided lofty rhetoric and instead used examples of specific people to personalize his points .
He mentioned Leonard Abess and Ty'Sheoma Bethea -- two of the Obamas ' invited guests .

All About Barack Obama • National Economy
As of last night , a US marshall , 2 state police and a county police are all over Mr. Hixon 's area , serving notices to farmers that they are being sued by Monsanto .
They arrive in pairs , with two cars parked a quarter mile and half mile down the road .
They 've served 3 so far and said " a bunch more are coming . "
No telling how many will be served since Hixon has between 200-400 farmers he cleans seeds for and these farmers have been repeatedly threatened by Monsanto thugs for the last two months , getting " visits , " letters , and calls daily .
Farmers report that a Monsanto investigator laughed that they were doing " rural cleansing . "
Steve Hixon is a seed cleaner in southern Illinois .
He has equipment that takes the plant materials and " cleans " it so that the seeds are separated out and can be given back to farmers to save for the next season .
It 's a mechanized step up from farmers hand picking seeds off their own plants , which , with hundreds of acres - or even 10 - would not be easy to do .
Mr. Hixon has the non-distinction of being attacked by Monsanto .
He is far from alone .
Monsanto has been picking off seed cleaners across the Midwest , having already done its thuggish thing in Pilot Grove , Missouri , and in Indiana , attacking Maurice Parr , destroying business for all of them .
Mr. Parr reports that when he was sued , the first think out of the judge said was how " honored to have a fine company like Monsanto in my courtroom . "
" Shortly after someone broke into Mr. Hixon 's office and he found his account book on his truck seat where he would never have left it , evey one of his remotely located and very scattered customers had three men ( described as goons with " no necks " ) arrived at each farm , going out onto it without permission ...
Mr. Hixon and state police who were called in , believe a GPS tracking device may have been put on Mr. Hixon 's equipment . "
Click here .
In 2002 , when Mr. Hixon was at the state legislature for a meeting , he said he told a Monsanto representative there , " If you guys wnt to tak over the seed industry so bad , you ought to buy guys like me out . "
The Monsanto agent is supposed to have responded " We 'd rather put you out of business , it 's more fun that way . "
Mr. Hixon says that when he is cleaning seeds , he is pouring $ 13,000 a hour into the local economy , which right now is being hit .
A fence company has gone out of business and other businesses are in trouble .
And in using seeds that have been cleaned , those seeds have carbon footprint , by Mr. Hixon 's figures , less than a fraction of 1 % of that of GMO seeds delivered over 1000s of miles at 5 miles a gallon that semis require to run .
But Monsanto's GM - soy and other seeds have a much heavier carbon footprint that the absurd transport of seed across the country by semis .
Petroleum - based pesticides are the essence of genetic engineering , and Monsanto has a poorly known history of their relation to warfare .
" Huge excesses of nitrogenous compounds that accumulated during World War I provided the basis for the beginnings of the mass production of synthetic nitrate fertilizers .
DuPont -- now the sole owner of the world 's largest seed company , Pioneer HiBred -- was the largest manufacturer of gunpowder in the United States during the early 19th century and the first World War .
Monsanto increased its profits 100 fold during the World War , from $ 80,000 to well over $ 9 million per year , supplying the chemical precursors for high explosives such as TNT .
" In the 1930s , chemists working for the German company Bayer discovered the highly poisonous properties of organophosphate compounds .
....
As all of German industry became absorbed into the growing Nazi war machine , Bayer 's organophosphate compounds were developed simultaneously as agricultural pesticides and as nerve gases for military use .
These included such notorious chemical warfare agents as sarin , soman and tabun gases , all of which are still manufactured today .
...
" In the 1930s , scientists at the Swiss J. R. Geigy Company were searching for new compounds to disinfect seeds and prevent moths from feeding on wool .
...
These researchers ' key discovery was that DDT ... could accomplish both of their desired ends and more .
... DDT was seen as the " atom bomb of insecticides , " capable of permanently eliminating various pest species .
" After World War II , DDT became the most widely applied chemical in human history ....
The widespread use of DDT -- for both agricultural and household uses -- led to a dramatic shift in the chemical industry 's approach to pest control ... was in many ways a direct outgrowth of its wartime origins .
... " During the 1960s , Monsanto was a leading manufacturer of the herbicide ' Agent Orange , ' which was used by U.S. military forces to obliterate the dense jungles of Vietnam .
Today Monsanto's Roundup - family herbicides play a central role in the U.S. " drug war " via its widespread use to eradicate coca and poppy plants in Colombia and other countries .... "
The shift to genetically engineered food seems a welcome change from such a history .
But it appears there has been no change , only a more thorough and disguises means of ensuring its sales .
" Of all of Monsanto , DuPont and Dow 's agricultural products , genetically engineered food crops might appear to be the least tainted with immediate wartime origins .
But this technology emerged from a period when the future of chemical agriculture appeared very much in doubt .
With the rapid expansion of the agrochemical industry during the post - World War II era , these companies and their European counterparts had established a profound degree of control over agricultural practices .

Pelosi vows
Bush probe , open to prosecutions
In a Sunday Fox interview that 's sure to get the attention of box - packers at 1600 , Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated she 's open to backing prosecutions that arise from Congressional hearings into a range of controversial Bush White House actions .
" I think you look at each item and see what is a violation of the law and do we even have a right to ignore it , " the California Democrat told Chris Wallace .
Last week House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) called for criminal investigations of Bush administration Iraq and anti-terror policies .
Pelosi was careful to skate carefully between Conyers and Barack Obama , who has n't foreclosed the possibility of prosecutions while saying he was more eager to look forward than backwards .
But she was far less restrained when asked about the White House role in the firings of eight U.S. attorneys , vowing to push forward on hearings that could lead to prosecutions .
" That 's not up to us to say that does n't matter anymore ...
We cannot let the politicizing of , for example , the Justice Department to go unreviewed , " she added .
" I want to see the truth come forth . "

This week , after 10 years of extensive and thorough scientific enquiry , researchers finally confirmed what many of us have known for years , that " preg head , " otherwise known as " placenta brain " does n't in fact exist , and that pregnancy does not turn women into ditzy absent - minded airheads .
So it 's official then , pregnant women are n't stupid after all : there goes yet another sexist and patronising myth .
The idea that " being with child " has some kind of negative impact on women 's cognitive abilities seems to have originated from a 1997 study by medics at the Royal Postgraduate Medical school in London .
After studying the MRI scans of just 10 healthy women , the good doctors concluded that women 's brains shrink during pregnancy , and linked that shrinkage to pregnant women 's complaints of forgetfulness and poor concentration .
This time around however , scientists at the Australian National University in Canberra studied 2,500 women , and unsurprisingly came up with a completely different set of results .
Not only did they find that there was nothing to support the original theory , they also discovered that far from reducing a woman 's mental faculties , pregnancy appears to increase them , and what 's more , these improvements are likely to be permanent .
Of course that 's not to say that there 's no explanation for why some women feel more distracted and less able to concentrate when they 're pregnant ; just that there 's no physiological cause for it .
Pregnancy can be both hugely stressful and incredibly exciting , and having what sometimes feels like an alien lodged in your abdomen is a pretty mindblowing experience in itself ; it 's no wonder that some pregnant women find themselves unable to focus on other , less important things during this time .
Considering that so much of the guidance and literature aimed at expectant mothers seems to assume that they 're close to being brain - dead , it will be interesting to see if this latest revelation leads to any improvement in the way they 're viewed and treated by those who 've never been in " the family way .
Pregnancy after all , is not only a time in a woman 's life when completely random strangers will feel at liberty to touch her without permission , laying their hands on her stomach and asking inane questions like , " Blimey , how many have you got in there ? " it 's also a time when she 'll find herself lectured and browbeaten like never before .
From government ministers issuing contradictory edicts about what she can and can't ingest , to restaurant staff refusing to serve her alcohol with her meal , any woman opting to join the " pudding club " soon learns that her own wants and needs count for nothing , and as for decision - making , well , that 's best left to the experts : is n't it dear ?
This policing of pregnant women is n't just confined to those who are actually pregnant of course ; nowadays any woman of childbearing age is considered to be in a pre-pregnant state ( pdf ) , whether she plans to have a baby or not , and all are advised to behave accordingly .
It 's not enough that a woman has her own health to look after ; she 's also expected to think about the health of any future offspring , 20 years ahead of conception and sometimes long before she 's even met the child 's prospective father .
And if she can't be relied on to act responsibly , that 's soon taken care of : folic acid can be easily slipped into bread , along with whatever other vitamins and minerals the Food Standards Agency deems necessary for the health of those who are n't yet even so much as a twinkle in their parents ' eyes .
Hopefully that 's all about to change .
Now that it 's been scientifically proven that pregnant women are fully functioning , sentient beings just like everyone else , there 's no justification for continuing to treat them like small children who need everything spelling out to them .
Forget putting warning labels on bottles of booze , for example , these women have only got a bun in the oven , they have n't been lobotomised .

Israelis go to the polls to elect a new government tomorrow in what is becoming a cliffhanger contest between the rightwing opposition leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , and his rival Tzipi Livni , the centrist foreign minister .
Netanyahu , leader of the Likud party , is slightly ahead , and given the combined size of the rightwing parties that would support him he is thought most likely to lead the next coalition government .
But up to a fifth of voters are thought to be undecided , according to opinion polls .
Israel 's proportional representation voting system is complicated and no single party will be able to form a government without bringing four or five other parties into a coalition .
Even if Livni's Kadima party emerges with the largest number of seats most analysts think she would struggle to put together a like - minded coalition with enough seats to have a majority in the Knesset , or parliament .
" It will be very , very difficult for Livni to form a government , even if Kadima turns out to be the bigger party , because every government of Livni would depend on a rightwing party , " said Yossi Verter , a political commentator for the left - leaning Ha'aretz newspaper .
After the final results of the election are formally published in a week 's time Israeli president Shimon Peres will consult with the leaders of all parties and will choose one MP to form a coalition .
That decision will probably be made on Friday next week and whoever is chosen would then have 42 days to form the coalition .
In the past the president has always turned to the leader of the largest party , though the law does allow him to turn to others if they are more likely to form a ­majority coalition .
That means if Netanyahu comes in second but the rightwing parties do as well as the polls suggest , Peres might still call on him to form the coalition .
" Since Likud has such a big bloc , it is not impossible that Peres will give the mandate to Netanyahu even if Likud is smaller than Kadima , " Verter said .
The high level of undecided voters hours before polling begins is unusual in Israel and suggests a broader frustration with many of the country 's political leaders .
Both Netanyahu and Ehud Barak , head of the Labour party , have been prime minister in the past and were generally regarded as unpopular .
Livni has been criticised for lacking experience .
" Just a few weeks ago everyone was happily bathing in the pool of national consensus created by the operation in Gaza , " Nahum Barnea , a leading columnist , wrote in today 's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper .
" How strong we are , everyone said , how united we are .
Now it becomes apparent that underneath this joyful power hides a frightened people , wishing for someone strong and forceful , who will ­miraculously fend off the people 's enemies , real and ­imaginary . "
Barnea argued that the election campaign showed only that Israel 's political establishment " no longer meets the needs of the country and society " .
He wrote : " The larger they are on the billboards , the more they are dwarfed by the country 's problems . "
Only a few weeks ago Netanyahu had a commanding lead in the opinion polls , a lead apparently reinforced by Israel 's devastating war in Gaza .
However , in the final days of the campaign he has begun to lose support to Avigdor Lieberman , a far - right secular politician whose populist tone has captured the public mood like never before .
Netanyahu has made a point of not attacking Lieberman in his campaign .
The last polls , released on Friday , gave Netanyahu between 25 and 27 seats in the 120 - seat Knesset , ahead of Livni 's Kadima party on 23 to 25 seats .
It is widely presumed that if Netanyahu wins he will turn to Lieberman to join his coalition , offering a major cabinet position .
Some reports have suggested Lieberman wants to be defence minister , regarded as perhaps the most high - profile job after prime minister , although his elevation to such a key post is by no means certain .
" He is an enigma in Israeli politics , " Verter said of Lieberman .
" You can never foresee his actions or his next move . "
While Lieberman is loud and aggressive in campaigning and in opposition , Verter said in the past he had remained quiet when in government .
Livni has pointedly not ruled out an alliance with Lieberman herself and was reportedly ready to offer two incentives – a law on civil marriage and a reform of the election system – both of which Lieberman has demanded .
However , any deal with him would probably cost her the support of some of the smaller leftwing parties likely to join her bloc , including the Arab parties and Meretz , leaving her still reliant on at least one other rightwing party to form a majority coalition
Livni spent today on a train journey from Tel Aviv to Be'er Sheva , in Israel 's south and has delivered a determinedly centrist pitch .
" We have proved that security does not belong only to the right and peace does not belong only to the left , " she said at a rally in Tel Aviv yesterday .
Netanyahu has taken a more rightwing position , travelling up to the Golan Heights yesterday with his party 's most hawkish figures to plant a tree and to insist he would never give up that piece of territory – captured by Israel in 1967 from Syria .
" The Golan will remain ours only if Likud is elected , " he said .
Meanwhile in Gaza , fighting continued .
A Palestinian militant from the Islamic ­Jihad was killed early this morning in a clash with Israeli troops .
Israeli aircraft hit two targets overnight in what the military said was retaliation for rocket fire into southern Israel .
ZURICH ( Reuters ) - UBS ’s landmark settlement deal with U.S. tax authorities could be the final nail in the coffin for Switzerland ’s prized bank secrecy and will have far - reaching consequences for the whole offshore financial industry .

Under pressure from Washington , Berne agreed to let UBS UBSN .
VXUBS .N pass on data of certain U.S. clients without waiting for an ongoing appeal process against the data transfer by some of these clients , an unprecedented step in Switzerland .
Switzerland ’s leading newspaper , Neue Zuercher Zeitung , called the $ 780 million ( 545.70 million pounds ) settlement , which UBS agreed with Berne ’s blessing , a “ capitulation ” .
“ For Switzerland , it is a true catastrophe for the country ’s first industry , that is to say the banking sector , ” Geneva lawyer Charles Poncet , a former member of the Swiss parliament , told Radio Suisse Romande .
Switzerland is the world ’s biggest offshore centre , managing about a third of an estimated $ 7 trillion of wealth .
The industry has prospered thanks to undeclared accounts that protect the privacy of ultra-rich customers , whether from potential kidnappers or from tax authorities .
Lawyers say other Swiss banks and all institutions involved in offshore banking should watch out as the U.S. tax axe may continue to grind .
“ This is part of a general move towards greater transparency , ” said Stephanie Jarrett , a tax expert at law firm Baker & McKenzie .
Under Swiss law , bank data can be transferred to foreign tax authorities only in clear cases of tax fraud , not tax evasion .
The latter is not a criminal offence in Switzerland .
Clients have the chance to appeal against a data transfer .
The country ’s financial regulator , FINMA , said last night it had found evidence of some mismanagement at UBS .
It said it had decided to push ahead with the U.S. tax settlement as the investigation had “ put ( UBS ’s ) existence at risk . ”
French - language newspaper Le Temps , which broke the news of an imminent deal late on Wednesday , said the government agreed to lift its bank secrecy rules during an emergency meeting on Wednesday night .
“ This is a political decision .
Berne has reviewed the definition of what constitutes a violation of bank secrecy , ” the newspaper said .

The tax spat had been closely watched by cash - strapped western governments and could set a precedent for similar deals with other banks or by other jurisdictions .
“ Any success by the US tax authority could encourage tax authorities in other jurisdictions to pursue a similar strategy , ” Merrill Lynch analysts said in a note .
Tax experts say Germany and France in particular have been watching carefully and may take action against their own banks .
German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck has taken aim at Switzerland , repeatedly accusing the country of hiding untaxed money .
UBS itself had warned of potential further actions by other states in its latest financial report .
“ Following disclosure of the U.S. cross - border matter , it is possible that tax or regulatory authorities in various jurisdictions will focus on the cross - border wealth management services provided by UBS and other financial institutions , ” the bank said in a note on litigation .
Tax experts say Switzerland will continue to retain some privacy rules , but expect the country and other smaller jurisdictions to co-operate more and more with western tax authorities when required .
“ The offshore industry is dead for customers coming from countries where there is a will to enforce tax obligations , ” said a Swiss tax lawyer involved in the tax dispute .

The Miami Heat have known for weeks that they had the option of sending Shawn Marion to the Toronto Raptors in a deal for center Jermaine O'Neal .
Miami finally took that option Friday , taking the Heat out of the chase for Marion 's ex-Phoenix Suns teammate Amare Stoudemire .
In a deal first reported by ESPN The Magazine 's Ric Bucher , the Heat agreed to trade Marion and guard Marcus Banks to the Raptors for O'Neal and swingman Jamario Moon .
NBA officials approved the swap Friday afternoon by conference call , the Heat said .
The deal also calls for Toronto to get the league 's maximum allowed in cash considerations ( $ 3 million ) and for the Heat to land a conditional first - round pick to come sometime between 2010 and 2015 .
It 's lottery - protected , essentially meaning the first time the Raptors make the playoffs after this season , their first - rounder goes to Miami .
If Miami does not get that first - round pick in 2010 , it will get an additional second - round pick that year .
The Heat also get a $ 4.2 million trade exception , which would allow Miami to make a future trade even if the salaries involved do n't match .
" This is a win -win for both Toronto and Miami and we wish J.O. and Jamario the best , " said Raptors general manager Bryan Colangelo , who is familiar with Marion from his time with the Phoenix Suns .
The deal was struck mere hours after Marion 's dunk with 1.1 seconds to go delivered a 95 - 93 victory in Chicago in the Heat 's final game before the All - Star break .
The Heat and Raptors began discussing a swap featuring Marion and O'Neal in January , but Miami held off in hopes of finding an impact player in better health than O'Neal , who has missed 14 games in his first season in Toronto because of persistent knee trouble .
" I developed an unbelievable relationship with Shawn , " Heat star guard Dwyane Wade said in Phoenix , where he 's part of All - Star Weekend .
" You 're sad to lose a friend on and off the court .
At the same time , Shawn and I just had this conversation that it 's part of the business and we knew it was a possibility . "
The Heat , according to NBA front - office sources , made numerous attempts to acquire Dallas swingman Josh Howard with Marion 's expiring $ 17.8 million salary , and more recently tried to use Marion 's cap - friendly contract to get into the bidding for Stoudemire .
Sources say that the Suns , though , had made it clear to the Heat in recent days they were not interested in reacquiring Marion -- in spite of the financial benefits -- for the rest of the season .
NEW YORK , Feb. 8 ( UPI ) --
An off - duty cop was intoxicated when he drove his vehicle into a young couple crossing a New York street , killing one and injuring the other , sources allege .
The unidentified sources said Officer Martin Abreu of Jersey City , N.J. , was facing criminal charges Sunday after an early Saturday traffic accident that left law school graduate Marilyn Huang Feng dead , the New York Post reported .

Feng and her boyfriend , hedge - fund analyst Dennis Loffredo , were allegedly hit by Abreu 's car in New York 's financial district .
Police said the collision killed Feng , 26 , immediately and left Loffredo , also 26 , in critical but stable condition .
Abreu , who had no reported injuries , was arraigned Saturday night on charges of driving while intoxicated and aggravated vehicular homicide .
Loffredo's mother , Diane , told the Post Feng was to have started a new job Monday .
" She was hoping to just make her life better in the ( United States ) , " she told the newspaper .
Although AT&T and several other iPhone partners joined an industry initiative to standardize mobile phone chargers over the next few years , Apple has yet to follow suit and may remain committed to its proprietary dock - connector interface .
The GSMA and 17 mobile operators plan to develop a universal charging solution that would appear by January 1 , 2012 .
Micro-USB will be the common charging interface .
The group includes AT&T , LG , Motorola , Nokia , Orange , Qualcomm , Samsung , Sony Ericsson , T - Mobile , and Vodafone .
According to the GSMA , which represents the interests of GSM operators , the change would make things simpler for the consumer , who could use the same charger with all future phones and charge anywhere with any available unit .
The chargers will boast a 4 - star or higher efficiency rating in order to be three times more energy - efficient than an unrated charger and consume 50 % less stand - by energy .
The GSMA estimates greenhouse gas reduction by 13.6 to 21.8 million metric tons as the replacement rate for existing chargers decreases .
Noticeably absent from the list of supporters is Apple .
Its ubiquitous dock connector was introduced on the third - generation iPod in 2003 and has appeared on every iPod and iPhone since .
By the time of the 2012 deadline , the dock connector will have been around for almost a decade .

It ’s the extraction lab this week in the OChem lab I ’m TA’ing .
It ’s a straightforward aqueous base extraction of an acidic unknown from a neutral impurity .
Acidify , filter the precipitate , and you ’re done .
I was trying to come up with a demonstration for the lab .
I thought about extracting caffeine from coffee or tea leaves , but that would take a while , and is n’t all that visually appealing .
I ’ve only got a few minutes in my pre-lab lecture time .
So I looked around for a while , and finally found this paper by James Hutchison from the University of Oregon ( doi : 10.1039/b405810k ) .
They suggest a new lab for undergraduates involving the extraction of D - limonene from orange peels using liquid carbon dioxide .
That ’s right , I said liquid carbon dioxide .
The premise : create a removable filter using copper wire and filter paper to jam into the bottom of a disposable centrifuge tube .
Add grated orange peel .
Add crushed dry ice .
Cap the centrifuge tube tightly ( but not TOO tightly !
The tube needs to be able to vent so as not to EXPLODE ! ) and immerse in warm water ( T = 40 - 60 degC ) .
The pressure rises ( naturally ) and the temperature increases and you jump into the liquid portion of carbon dioxide ’s phase diagram ( click for larger )
The liquid carbon dioxide percolates through the orange peels and extracts the limonene .
the oil - in - solvent mixture drains through the filter paper to the bottom of the centrifuge tube .
If you leave the tube in the water long enough , eventually the liquid all evaporates and the pressure decreases .
The goal is that the evaporation of the carbon dioxide leaves the pure oil at the bottom of the tube .
The authors mention that for approximately 2.5 g of freshly - grated orange peel , 0.1 mL of oil should remain after 3 carbon dioxide extractions .
They note this is a yield comparable to typical organic solvent extraction or cold pressing .
I did one extraction on day - old chopped orange peel and did not isolate any oil whatsoever .
Not a drop .
I ’m a little disappointed by that , but not really .
It ’s still an ok teaching point for the students .
Not all experiments work all the time .
I could examine my starting materials and get better quality reagents and it might work .
Now , inside the tube I do n’t think we were past the critical point .
I do n’t think the temperature inside the centrifuge tube actually makes it up to the temperature of the surrounding water .
I say this because after the examining the tube after the experiment , the orange was cold and there were ice crystals in the tube .
There are two possible explanations for this .
One , the temperature inside did n’t make it past the critical temperature .
Two , when I opened the tube after the experiment , some non-trivial amount of pressure was released .
PV=nRT tells us that a sudden drop in the pressure simultaneously lowers the temperature , and I could have frozen the water out that way .
In fact , the authors note that while exact temperature and pressure readings are impossible with this simple setup , they speculate that the conditions approach the triple point .
In any case , it was a very cool experiment to watch , even if it did n’t do what it was supposed to .
Pictures below .
These pictures are from Monday night when I was practicing the demonstration .
It looked much cooler in person .
The first shows the system when first submerged in the water .
The second is about 15 - 30 seconds later .
It ’s hard to see , but if you look closely , all three phases are apparent in the system .
The third is after the dry ice has completely liquified .

Jones , of Gettysburg , was sentenced to one month in jail followed by two months of house arrest and 21 months of probation .
He was also ordered to avoid contact with his neighbors and to pay a $ 200 fine .
Police said Jones emerged naked from his home after consuming alcohol Aug. 1 and approached neighbors Dennis Hucks , Gary Kerns and Andrea Orndorff while Huck 's three children played nearby .
He told the men that he knew karate and asked if any of them wanted to fight .
Jones allegedly told officers that he knew leaving his house naked was illegal , but he came out anyway because he is a " serious martial artist . "

Sayyid Imam al - Sharif , who goes by the nom de guerre Dr Fadl , helped bin Laden create al - Qaeda and then led an Islamist insurgency in Egypt in the 1990s .
But in a book written from inside an Egyptian prison , he has launched a frontal attack on al - Qaeda ’s ideology and the personal failings of bin Laden and particularly his Egyptian deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri .
Twenty years ago , Dr Fadl became al - Qaeda ’s intellectual figurehead with a crucial book setting out the rationale for global jihad against the West .
Today , however , he believes the murder of innocent people is both contrary to Islam and a strategic error .
“ Every drop of blood that was shed or is being shed in Afghanistan and Iraq is the responsibility of bin Laden and Zawahiri and their followers , ” writes Dr Fadl .
The terrorist attacks on September 11 were both immoral and counterproductive , he writes .
“ Ramming America has become the shortest road to fame and leadership among the Arabs and Muslims .
But what good is it if you destroy one of your enemy ’s buildings , and he destroys one of your countries ?
What good is it if you kill one of his people , and he kills a thousand of yours ? ” asks Dr Fadl .
“ That , in short , is my evaluation of 9/11 . ”
He is equally unsparing about Muslims who move to the West and then take up terrorism .
“ If they gave you permission to enter their homes and live with them , and if they gave you security for yourself and your money , and if they gave you the opportunity to work or study , or they granted you political asylum , ” writes Dr Fadl , then it is “ not honourable ” to “ betray them , through killing and destruction ” .
So al - Qaeda ’s co-founder hates Bin Laden ?
And Bush and Cheney hate Bin Laden ?
Holy Crap , they ’ve been “ palling around with terrorists ” this whole time , those two !
Break out Sarah Palin , and string ’em up good !
Veteran actor Christopher McDonald has been cast in a pivotal guest role .
ALSO : Ona Grauer returns to Stargate !
In a final bit of Stargate Universe casting news this week , veteran actor Christopher McDonald has been cast in the role of Senator Armstrong — a pivotal guest character in the series premiere , “ Air . ”
A 30 - year veteran of film and television , you may recognize him as Quiz Show host Jack Barry , Happy Gilmore ‘s nemesis Shooter McGavin , or Veronica ’s ex-husband in Veronica ’s Closet .
But to us he ’ll always be Lt. Richard Castillo in one of the best Star Trek :
The Next Generation episodes of all time , “ Yesterday ’s Enterprise . ”
He ’s also played Ward Cleaver in the 1997 Leave It To Beaver remake , ridden The Perfect Storm in the 2000 George Clooney film , and lent his voice to Jor-El in the animated adventures of Superman .
“ Another experienced Hollywood veteran , Chris brings gravity and charisma to the role of Senator Armstrong , ” consulting producer Joseph Mallozzi wrote on his blog .
“ When I was on set the other day , he approached me , shook my hand , and told me how happy he was to be working on the show .
A class act . ”
The Senator is the father of series regular Chloe Armstrong ( Elyse Levesque ) .
Mallozzi also revealed that actress Ona Grauer will return to Stargate , in “ some heartfelt scenes ” with Justin Louis ( “ Colonel Everett Young ” ) .
She originally played the Ancient Ayiana in SG - 1 ‘s sixth season episode “ Frozen , ” and in the opening scene to Atlantis ‘s “ Rising . ”
Louis ’s character is married , but is forced to live apart from his wife when he is assigned to command a secret off - world base .
Could Grauer be playing Young ’s wife back on Earth ?
Stargate Universe is now filming in Vancouver , B.C. for a fall premiere in the U.S. Learn more about the show at our Stargate Universe Launch Center , and check out the newly completed cast of characters !

Automating an audit trail
As raised in ​a recent discussion on django - developers , this code is one solution for creating an audit trail for a given model .
This is working in multiple production sites , but is still incomplete .
See Caveats below for more information .
The code below requires an SVN checkout as of r8223 or later .
Usage
Copy the code at the bottom of this article into a location of your choice .
It 's just a one - file utility , so it does n't require an app directory or anything .
The examples below assume it 's called audit.py and is somewhere on your PYTHONPATH .
In your models file , there are only a couple things to do .
First , obviously you 'll need to import your audit file , or possibly just get AuditTrail from within it .
Then , add an AuditTrail to the model of your choice , assigning it to whatever name you like .
That 's the only thing necessary to set up the audit trail and get Python - level access to it .
If you need to view the audit information in the admin interface , simply add show_in_admin=True as an argument to AuditTrail .
from django.db import models import audit class Person ( models .
Model ) : first_name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) last_name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) salary = models .
PositiveIntegerField ( ) history = audit .
AuditTrail ( ) def __str__ ( self ) : return " %s %s " % ( self .
first_name , self .
last_name )
This simple addition will do the rest , allowing you to run syncdb and install the audit model .
Once it 's installed , the following code will work as shown below .
As you will see , Person . history becomes a manager that 's used to access the audit trail for a particular object .
The type of manager available depends on how you access the audit trail .
From an instance , the audit trail will automatically be filtered to only return results related to that instance .
From the model class itself , the results will not be filtered in any way , and is the likely approach for doing reporting across several audited items .
>>> from myapp.models import Person >>> person = Person . objects .
create ( first_name = ' John ' , last_name = ' Public ' , salary = 50000 ) >>> < Person : John Public > >>> person .
history .
count () 1 >>> person .
salary = 65000 >>> person . save ( ) >>> person .
history .
count () 2 >>> for item in person .
history . all ( ) : ... print " %s : %s " % ( item , item .
salary ) John Public as of 2007 - 08 - 14 20 : 31 : 21.852000 : 65000 John Public as of 2007 - 08 - 14 20 : 30 : 58.959000 : 50000 >>> person2 = Person . objects .
create ( first_name = ' Tom ' , last_name = ' Smith ' , salary = 25000 ) >>> person2 < Person : Tom Smith > >>> person .
history .
count () 2 >>> person2 .
history .
count () 1 >>>
Person .
history .
count () 3
As you can see , the audit trail is listed with the most recent state first .
Each entry also inclues a timestamp when the edit took place .
Saves and deletes are both tracked , and can be filtered on via Person.history.filter(_audit_change_type='_ ' ) .
Do not use underscore , use ' I ' for inserts , ' U ' for updates , and ' D ' for deletes .
ForeignKeys and OneToOneFields are now supported both for saving and accessing the audit data .
However , it does not archive the contents of the ForeignKey table for the appropriate entries at the same time , and will fail if the ForeignKey a given audit entry is related to is deleted ( including if you 're auditing the Foreign Key table as well , it does not have a way to link the two audit tables together ) .
Tracking Extra Information
Sometimes you need to track more information than is available in just the model .
For instance , you may want to know who is performing the change on a particular entry , or track some sort of state information about the system .
AuditTrail now supports this through the concept of " track fields " .
These can be specified on a per-model basis or a global basis , and the per-model options will stack with the global ones ( but per- model options cannot override global ones currently ) .
Here 's an example :
def some_callback ( instance ) : return `random.randrange (1 , 99 ) ` + ' trackable_val ' class Person ( models .
Model ) : first_name = models .
CharField ( maxlength = 255 ) last_name = models .
CharField ( maxlength = 255 ) salary = models .
PositiveIntegerField ( ) history = audit .
AuditTrail ( track_fields = (( ' extra_1 ' , models .
CharField ( maxlength = 50 ) , ' hardcoded_value ' ) , ( ' extra_2 ' , models .
CharField ( maxlength = 50 ) , some_callback ) , ) ) def __str__ ( self ) : return " %s %s " % ( self .
first_name , self .
last_name )
The track_fields is a tuple of 3 - tuples .
The 3 - tuples are structured ( field_name , type_of_field , value ) .
type_of_field can be any currently functioning field type , although see the Caveats for issues related to ForeignKeys .
value can be either a static value or a callback function , which will get called at the time of the save / delete .
This means that if you want to do something involving threadlocals at runtime ( for getting things out of the request , for instance ) you can do it via this callback .
Assume we ran the example above with this new model .
You could then do the following :
>>> p_hist = person .
history .
all ( ) [ < PersonAudit : John Public as of 2007 - 08 - 27 09 : 29 : 14 > , < PersonAudit : John Public as of 2007 - 08 - 27 09 : 28 : 57 > ] >>> p_hist [ 0 ] . extra_1 ' hardcoded_value ' >>> p_hist [ 0 ] . extra_2 ' 27trackable_val '
Currently , you cannot filter on these trackable columns , this should be fixable .
Global Track Fields
What if you have a field you want tracked on every model that supports history ?
No problem !
In the root of your project , create a file called settings_audit.py , and put something like this in it :
from django.db import models def callback_func_ptr2 ( original_instance ) : import random return `random.randrange ( 1 , 99 ) ` + ' hardcoded_global_2 ' # Populate the fields that every Audit model in this app will use .
GLOBAL_TRACK_FIELDS
= ( ( ' global_1 ' , models .
CharField ( maxlength = 50 ) , ' hardcoded_global_1 ' ) , ( ' global_2 ' , models .
CharField ( maxlength = 20 ) , callback_func_ptr2 ) , )
GLOBAL_TRACK_FIELDS
is set up exactly the same way as the track_fields option passed into AuditTrail , and has the same uses and limitations .
Caveats
This needs testing !
This has only been used in a few cases , there 's plenty of possible room for strangeness .
It has specifically not been tested for things like safe ( de -) serialization .
In order to copy the fields from the original model to the audit model , it uses some hackery I 'm not particularly proud of .
It seems to work for all the cases I would have hoped it would , but it relies on the arguments passed to the Field class being named the same as the attributes stored on the Field object after it 's created .
If there 's ever a time that 's not the case , it will fail completely on that Field type .
It fails completely on ManyToManyField s , something I 've yet to remedy .
That 's definitely a must - have , but I have n't worked out the best way to go about it .
And since this whole things is n't something I 'm particularly interested in , I 'm probably going to leave that up to somebody else to work out .
Likewise , it fails when there are multiple ForeignKeys pointing to the same Model , as it does n't support / compensate for related_name .
It currently copies and overrides the model 's __str__ method , so that it can helpfully describe each entry in the audit history .
This means , however , that if your __str__ method relies on any other methods ( such as get_full_name or similar ) , it wo n't work and will need to be adjusted .

Hopefully there are enough comments to make sense of what 's going on .

About two years ago , my then - 9 - year - old and I worked on a cool project to program Lego Mindstorms to fly a RC plane , which we cheekily called a Lego UAV .
( And were then , even more cheekily , accused of " weaponizing Lego " -- UAVs are export controlled as weapons ! )
It worked , amazingly , and was a lot of fun .
Then , as sometimes happens , I got obsessed , while he moved on to other things .
In the past two years , I 've made cellphone UAVs , Basic Stamp UAVs , autonomous blimps , and a true gyros + acellerometers +
GPS autopilot version of the Lego Mindstorms UAV that 's now in the Lego Museum in Billund , Denmark .
We set up an amateur UAV community at DIYDrones.com , and get thousands of people each day exploring this new dimension of aerial robotics .
Now this project has gone pro .
Our first commercial autopilot , the Arduino - compatible ArduPilot , has been released and our goal of taking an order or two of magnitude out of the cost of an autopilot has been achieved : it 's $ 24.95 !
Combined with a RC plane , this makes it easy to build a complete UAV for less than $ 500 , which is really kind of amazing .
As exciting as that it is , it 's also sobering to know that a technology that was just a few years ago the sole domain of the military is now within the reach of amateurs , so we spend a lot of time educating our community on FAA regulations and safe and responsible flying ( always under 400 feet , stay within line of sight , pilot always able to regain control ) .
As for my kids , well , the technology pretty quickly went over their head ( in all senses of the word ) , but they 're still involved a bit : video taking , pointing the ground - based telemetry antenna at the plane , laughing at Dad when his plane crashes and being bribed with ice cream if they 'll tag along for yet another test flight .
Someday , maybe one of them will want to get involved with some aspect of this again -- programming , hardware design , even piloting .
But until then , this counts as another project that started GeekDad and ended all Geek ;-)
Do a Google search for “ Nutella , ” the Italian hazelnut - chocolate spread that comes in a squat jar like peanut butter and is often found right next to it in grocery aisles , and you ’ll get about 5 million results .
Which is about twice what you get when you Google “ chocolate chip cookies ” -- and several times as many as the phrase “ Valentine ’s Day chocolates . ”
You might want to remember that this weekend .
FOR THE RECORD :
Cookie recipe : A recipe in the Feb . 11 Food section for hazelnut - chocolate Linzer cookies did not include a step for adding the ground hazelnuts .
They should be added to the cookie dough along with the flours . —
Because Nutella is n’t just junk food with a European pedigree .
It can be an obsession , a habit , even a cult .
If you think this is foodie hyperbole , you ’re just not among the initiated .
If , however , you ’re the sort of person who keeps a jar of Nutella hidden under the sink or the mattress ; if you ’ve ever carefully spooned all the Nutella out of the center of the jar so that it still looked full to outside observers ; if you ’ve asked friends to smuggle Nutella back from Europe ( devotees swear European - made Nutella tastes different ) ; if , for heaven ’s sake , you ’ve ever bought 10 pounds of raw hazelnuts to try to make it at home , then welcome .
As members of Nutella ’s secret handshake society will tell you , it ’s a blend of hazelnuts and chocolate -- or rather , nuts , cocoa , sugar , skim milk , oil and a few other flavorings and emulsifiers -- that ’s been ground to a blissfully smooth , creamy spread .
Knifed onto a slice of bread , or smeared over crepes or waffles , it ’s a simple snack that ( as my children and the Ferrero Co. , which makes the product , like to point out ) is even vaguely wholesome .
Maybe it ’s the idea of spreadable chocolate , or maybe it ’s the deeply satisfying combination of chocolate and hazelnuts , but there ’s something about Nutella that inspires the kind of devotion usually reserved for federally banned substances .
Check out some of those Google results and you find eGullet threads , Flickr galleries , MySpace videos and rapturous blog posts , where recipes that make use of Nutella proliferate in a seemingly endless riff , like conspiracy theories or suggestions for what to name the Obama First Dog .
According to allfacebook.com , Nutella ’s Facebook page ranks third in number of fans , having just moved past Homer J. Simpson with a little more than 2 million .
( The two most popular pages , in order : Barack Obama and Coca - Cola . )
Two years ago , bloggers Sara Rosso and Michelle Fabio even designated Feb. 5 as World Nutella Day , which has a growing following .
“ I thought it would be great to have a day where we could eat and cook with Nutella without shame . . . a bit like a meeting of the Nutella minds , or an NAA : Nutella Addicts Anonymous meeting , ” e-mailed Rosso , an American living in Italy .
Famous - fan recipes
All Nutella addicts are not underground -- or online .
French pastry chef Pierre Hermé , English cookbook author Nigella Lawson and Berkeley pastry chef and cookbook author Alice Medrich have all created recipes that feature the spread .
In Southern California , Anisette Brasserie chef - owner Alain Giraud ( who once confessed that his favorite way to eat Nutella was out of the jar ) serves waffles with Nutella on his restaurant ’s weekend breakfast menu .
Spago pastry chef Sherry Yard serves rolled tuilles stuffed with Nutella at Spago events .
Not bad for a children ’s snack that originated in postwar Italy as a thrifty answer to food rationing .
Nutella ’s origins date to 1946 , when Pietro Ferrero , who owned a bakery in Alba , Italy , began grinding the hazelnuts that were plentiful in the Piedmont region to extend his cocoa supply .
This was neither a unique combination nor a unique situation .
Chocolate and hazelnuts have been mixed together ( gianduja , the term given to chocolate - hazelnut paste , is named after a Turin commedia dell ’arte character ) in the region since the 1800s , often to stretch an imported product with a local one .
But Ferrero took things one step further , blending the heady mixture into a spreadable confection that was even more economical and easy to use .
In 1964 , the spread was officially renamed Nutella .
World domination soon followed .
I discovered Nutella at 15 , in the white kitchen cupboard of a suburban house on the outskirts of Hamburg , Germany , where I was a high school exchange student .
We ate it for breakfast , smeared on whole - grain bread , and packed it in sandwiches on a ski trip to the Italian Dolomites or ( this was 30 years ago ) to snack on while driving an aging Volkswagen bus through then - East Germany to the enclosed jewel box of Berlin .
I started sneaking the stuff from the jar within weeks of my first taste .
Maybe because Nutella is n’t exactly cheap these days ( about $ 13 for a 750 - gram jar of the Italian - made import ; about half that for the domestic version , which for the last three years has been produced in Canada for Nutella U.S.A. ) , or maybe because I wanted a version without modified palm oil or soy lecithin , or maybe because I ’m the sort of person who set up my Facebook page only so I could join a Nutella group , I decided to make my own .
Making Nutella at home is a very earnest project , like deciding to mill your own flour or cobble your own shoes .
But it ’s surprisingly easy , and the results are pretty awesome .
I began by toasting hazelnuts in the oven , peeling them , then grinding them in a food processor until they were transformed into a smooth butter .
This took about five minutes of just watching the blades spin around , the earthy smell of hazelnuts filling the kitchen , daydreams of snow filling my head .
( A note about hazelnuts : Because of their high fat content , many nuts turn rancid easily , and it ’s often impossible to tell before you purchase them if they ’ve gone bad .
Buy your nuts from a good source , store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator , and taste them before you roast them . )
Then I added high - quality unsweetened cocoa powder , powdered sugar ( which is not grainy ) and vanilla extract .
The original versions of Nutella , according to Mort Rosenblum ’s chapter on Nutella in “ Chocolate : A Bittersweet Saga of Dark and Light , ” were made with cocoa powder and vegetable oil , not chocolate or milk , so this seemed logical and fit the intrinsically Luddite nature of the experiment .
To get the right consistency -- and to heighten the hazelnut flavor -- I added a few tablespoons of hazelnut oil rather than vegetable oil to the mixing bowl and then briefly continued blending .
The smell of hazelnuts combined with that of chocolate and , Proust - like , I was back in that suburban kitchen , my furtive spoon in the jar , the World Cup announcer yelling over the airways in increasingly breathless German .
Homemade version
The homemade stuff is glorious , neither as sweet as Nutella nor with that vague aftertaste that comes , perhaps , from the oils or emulsifiers .
The hazelnut flavor is more pronounced and the chocolate is a little stronger , with notes that vary depending on which cocoa powder you use ( earthy and slightly chalky with Ghirardelli ; brighter and deeper with Scharffen Berger ) .
The texture is grainier , as it would be without the use of an industrial machine .
It ’s like the difference between the Jif creamy peanut butter of my childhood and the wholesome stuff my mother forcibly converted us to , virtuously ground as we waited at the natural foods co-op .
Making homemade Nutella is n’t really about reproducing something -- the recipe is zealously guarded by the Ferrero Co. , which is now a multinational company based in Luxembourg and owned by Pietro Ferrero ’s son Michele and Michele ’s two sons .
( Last March , according to a Reuters report , Michele Ferrero became the richest man in Italy , overtaking Silvio Berlusconi , with a personal wealth of $ 11 billion . )
A recent telephone conversation with Allessandro Bampa , Nutella category manager at Ferrero U.S.A. in Somerset , N.J. , unfolded like a membership exam for the Freemasonry .
“ I cannot really go into details , ” Bampa said in a thick Italian accent when I asked about the manufacture of Nutella .
“ I cannot confirm that , ” Bampa said to questions about whether Nutella is made with a different recipe depending on its place of manufacture .
And how much Nutella is made , exactly ?
“ We do n’t really disclose volume . ”
Making homemade Nutella is thus an act of homage , a rite of passage or further initiation .
It ’s like visiting the site of Pietro Ferrero ’s bakery or ordering a Nutella pizza from a Nutellaria ( an Italian shop that actually specializes in foods made with the product ) , or bidding on eBay for one of those discontinued Nutella jars with Kobe Bryant on the label .
( Bryant , who grew up in Italy , is the only person to have been pictured on a Nutella jar . )
And with either a batch of the homemade spread or a jar of the real thing , you can delve into the heavily trafficked underground world of Nutella cookery .
If you missed World Nutella Day , it ’s OK : Valentine ’s Day is Saturday .
Here ’s a recipe that ’s essentially a paean to the stuff .
It ’s a traditional ice cream , in which the spread is whisked into the custard base and swirled into the finished ice cream .
Rich and nutty , sweet but not overwhelmingly so , it ’s reminiscent of vanilla - chocolate swirl ice cream , with pretty whorls that look terrific in a bowl or cone .
Riff on the idea of Nutella for breakfast with a bowl of oatmeal laced with it .
Just make a pot of oatmeal , then stir in a generous amount of chocolate - hazelnut spread .
Top a bowlful with a pour of cream , a sprinkle of toasted hazelnuts , a few strawberries or bananas , and a bit of shaved chocolate .
It ’s like a happy medium between cereal and chocolate for breakfast .
And then there are cookies , a very popular way to play with Nutella .
Linzer cookies adapt beautifully to Nutella , as they ’re traditionally made with nuts in the dough and jam spread between two sandwiched cookies .
This recipe capitalizes on those elements , using ground hazelnuts in the cookie dough and chocolate - hazelnut spread instead of jam .
A faint note of orange in the cookies plays against the chocolate ; a dusting of powdered sugar decorates the top .
Of course , sometimes basic is best .
“ Nutella is great as it is , ” points out Ferrero ’s Bampa , “ just spread on a simple slice of bread . ”
Or eaten out of the jar with a spoon .

Conroy Announces Which ISPs Will Be Trialling His Stupid Filter
And the good news is that none of the major players are involved .
If you use Primus , Tech 2U , Webshield , OMNIconnect , Netforce or Highway 1 as your gateway to the world wide wed , you may want to contact your ISP and let them know you do n’t want to play in their filtering sandpit .
It ’s kind of strange that none of the big ISPs were involved – Telstra did n’t offer to partake , so that makes sense , but both Optus and iiNet said they ’d play ( although Optus would n’t test P2P filtering ) , so their omission feels kind of strange .
Maybe it had something to do with iiNet saying they ’d partake just to debunk the filter ’s plausibility ?
The trials are set to run for a minimum of six weeks once all the filtering hardware has been installed .
For customers of these ISPs , I reckon that six weeks wo n’t be over soon enough .

UK Giving Away " Intelligent Fridges "
December 2nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Live in the UK ?
You may be the lucky recipient of a free “ intelligent ” refrigerator .
3,000 fridges that adapt power usage based on the demands of the electrical grid will be given away by the government next year .
According to a report from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change , the dynamic demand fridges could potentially save 2 million tons of carbon each year and £ 222 m .
In addition to saving energy , the dynamic demand fridges will also help ease the transition to intermittently produced renewable energy by reducing the minimum amount of power necessary to keep the electrical grid stable — in other words , the fridges limit the base amount of fossil fuels used in energy creation .
The fridge works by monitoring energy demand with circuitry that keeps track of the electrical grid frequency .
Depending on the ebb and flow of grid demand , the fridge adjusts its energy use — all within normal parameters .
While the UK ’s trial will only look at refrigerators , dynamic demand technology can be used in other electronics as well .
Possible applications include air conditioners , immersion heaters , and electric car chargers .
There is n’t any information available on becoming one of the few to get a free fridge , so you might want to start pestering the government to find out .

Most of the duty staffers were out on a call when their colleague , alone at the station and cooking dinner for the crew , was himself called out .
In his haste to respond to the call , he forgot to turn the stove off , said Seiji Hori , a Nagoya City Fire Department official .
Ten fire trucks from other stations put out the fire , Hori added .
" We are an institute that should be in a position to educate people about fire , so we are extremely sorry that such an incident happened , " Hori said , adding that they would consider ordering - in for dinner from now on .

February 14 , 2009 --
A string of provocations in the days leading up to the constitutional amendment referendum points to the employment of a disturbance plan that could well be followed up with destabilisations attempts after the poll .
Amongst many other things – it would be too tedious to enumerate them all -- those that stand out are the violent actions of pro-opposition student groups , the circulation of a counterrevolutionary proclamation amongst Armed Forces officers , the self - attack on a synagogue , the announcement of a trip by Lech Walesa ( ex - Polish leader , dependent on the Vatican and the CIA ) to coincide with the electoral event and the provocation by Spanish deputy Luis Herrero , from the fascist Popular Party , who on arriving in Caracas as an international observer issued harmful declarations , knowing full well that this would be result in his expulsion by the National Electoral Court .
All this has been accompanied by an orchestrated international media campaign that without any reserve or limit in its distortion of the truth , labours at confusing the real meaning of the amendment in order to present it as a step towards the inauguration of a dictatorship in Venezuela .
As only occurs in exceptional moments of danger for imperialist control , the major US press – especially the Washington Post – has put at stake its credibility , lying and falsifying via editorial notes .
The campaign kicked off after a meeting of leaders of the opposition with US State Department officials , held in Puerto Rico on January 9 , where their destabilisation plans were adjusted in the faced off evidence that the Yes vote was gaining support amongst the electorate .
Here , the international social - Christian current handed over $ 3 million to the conspirators , amongst whom were the director of Globovision , Alberto Federico Ravell , and the leader of the party Primera Justicia , Julio Borges .
One by one , these steps aimed at unleashing violence in Venezuela before the elections were discovered and neutralised by the government , including the detection and dismantlement of at least two Colombian paramilitary units contracted by the warmongering wing of the opposition .
Amongst the defensive reactions of the government , what stands out was the capacity to detect and detain various armed forces officers involved in an incipient coup plotting conspiracy .
And no less resounding was the military response to an operation aimed at publicly involving General Jesus Gonzalez Gonzalez -- head of Plan Republica , which is entrusted with ensuring that the electoral event goes ahead -- in the coup - plotting conspiracy .
At the same time as intelligence organisations have laboured with an efficiency and speed not seen in previous occasions , the principal force aimed at neutralising this escalation been the mass mobilisations that have been carried out in the function of a precise plan of action designed by Hugo Chavez – and , in fact for the first time , scrupulously controlled in its execution by the president himself , as if it were a military operation – in order to accomplish the task of clarification for the public in the lead up to electoral contest .
That is why the youth identified with the revolution came out onto the streets to neutralise the attempt to make students appear as a compact mass force of opposition and paralyse potential adherents to these counterrevolutionary groups , who saw their actions and mobilisations reduced to a pathetic expression of isolation .
Parallel to this , hundreds of thousands of “ patrulleros ” came out to explain to the population the significance of the vote .
PSUV : a combat party
Never before had this happened on such a scale .
In the elections for governors and mayors last November , the United Socialist Party of Venezuela demonstrated its potential and was the [ vehicle ] of the large electoral advance that was registered at that opportunity .
But now its role has been qualitatively superior : it acted as a genuine instrument of masses mobilised by a leadership united behind a revolutionary and socialist objective .
The meaning of the positive result in favour of the constitutional amendment , added with the revelation of this new phenomenon of the PSUV as a combat party , has exacerbated the belligerence of the opposition .
With the possibility that Chavez could be a candidate in the next election in 2012 , any perspective of an opposition electoral victory in the presidential dispute would be closed off completely .
At the same time , the possibility that opposition groups could tempt certain wavering groupings within the PSUV to convert the struggle over candidates into a factor of division and debilitation would also be blocked off .
US strategists know the significance of what this will mean , not only for Venezuela but for all Latin America .
That is why they have manufactured this crescendo in counterrevolutionary activity and essentially campaigned not around the issue of the referendum , but instead limited themselves to denouncing a ridiculous and unsustainable claim of the danger of dictatorship based on the figure of Hugo Chavez .
That is why it is logical to think that the last step of this escalation will be the rejection of the Yes victory , which all the polls as showing as the likely result , including those paid for by opposition leaders .
Although the final result is in the hands of the men and women who will or will not turn up to cast their vote , everything seems to indicate that the never before seen effort of revolutionary propaganda carried out by the PSUV – and the effort of Chavez himself – will result in a massive turnout of the poor to participate in the electoral event .
If this is verified , the Yes triumph will be overwhelming , including in proportions superior to those seen in the historic 2006 elections , when Chavez was re-elected on a campaign which raised this socialist proposal as the key slogan .
Faced with such a perspective , it is not only the imperialist chiefs that are trembling .
Concern also blights the centrist governments who sense the dynamic that will be triggered off in the entire region by a fourteenth electoral victory of the Bolivarian Revolution .
So , we can expect a desperate intervention by imperialism ’s strategists , stunned by the potent combination of the world capitalist crisis and the programmatic , organisational and political affirmation of a revolutionary socialist response .
And the same goes in regards to expecting a pulling back by South American semi-allies , that in the midst of these tremors are wagering their survival on an agreement in response to the crisis that imperialism hopes to seal at the G - 20 meeting in London next April 2 .
Therefore , we must be on alert regarding events on February 15 .
If the United States succeeds in imposing a situation of violence in the face of a Yes victory , the conflict in Venezuela will extend itself like a trail of gun power across the region .
What is impossible to expect from fearful governments -- mass mobilisations at the continental scale in defence of the free expression of the Venezuelan majority -- is left in the hands of those millions who see in the revolutionary government of Venezuela a lighthouse to orientate Latin American and the Caribbean in a moment of extreme crisis on the world scale .

It 's easy to forget that the PS3 is a fully - equipped PC in your living room attached to your house 's best monitor .
Installing Ubuntu can help you remember , and play SNES games in the process .

It still kind of surprises me ( in a good way ) that Sony was , from the start , very OK with PS3 owners tinkering with Linux on their PS3s .
A modified release of Yellow Dog Linux was available from the very beginning , and some very handy hard drive partitioning and dual - boot utilities are baked right into the PS3's XMB ; Ubuntu gets installed on an entirely separate partition of your PS3's hard disk , so your default system does n't get touched and switching between Ubuntu and the XMB is a piece of cake .
There is a flipside to this coin , however .
Since the PS3's Cell Processor is PowerPC based , you wo n't be able to use any Linux software that 's compiled for x86 , which is , unfortunately , most of it .
However , Ubuntu has always had a PPC distro , and most of the basic stuff will work just fine .
You can even load up a PPC - compiled Super Nintendo Emulator , SNES9X , and play some classic games pretty easily on your Sixaxis controller paired via Bluetooth .
Also , doing web browsing and other basic computing is a lot more natural and elegant on Ubuntu running on your TV than in the PS3's somewhat gimped browser .
Advertisement
Another downside is performance - the PS3 obviously has a lot of hardware muscle , but there are no Linux drivers to take full advantage of the Cell processor 's multi-core architecture , or the PS3's hardware graphics acceleration .
Plus , Ubuntu can only see and use 221.7 MB of the PS3's 512MB of RAM for some reason .
So it wo n't be a speed demon ( and you wo n't be able to play HD videos or anything ) , but it 's definitely functional for the basics .
And , even over two years into the PS3's life , doing all of this still requires a fair amount of Linux geek forum sifting , which I have humbly take upon myself to do so you do n't have to .
And believe me , you do n't .
So let 's get started !
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
What You 'll Need :
• Ubuntu 8.10 PS3 Install Disc Image
• Blank CD
• USB hard drive formated to FAT32 to backup your PS3 data
• USB keyboard and mouse ( wireless if possible )
Install Ubuntu 8.10
1. Installing an alternate OS requires you to wipe the hard disk completely , so you 'll want to back up your PS3 data - this includes game saves , downloaded games and the hard drive installs many games require .
For this , you 'll need a FAT32 - formatted USB disc ( Mac HFS + volumes wo n't work ) .
This wo n't save your trophies , so if losing them will be a tragedy for you , go to Game -> Trophy Collection , press triangle and choose " Sync with Server . "
Advertisement
2. Plug in your disc and go to Settings -> System Settings -> Backup Utility in your XMB .
Choose Back Up and select your USB disk .
The data will be saved at / PS3 / EXPORT / BACKUP .
It took about 25 minutes for me .
When you 're done installing Ubuntu , the first time you switch back to the XMB you 'll want to use the Backup Utility to restore your backup .
3 . Now you 're ready to install Ubuntu .
This Ubuntu help page can assist , but like it says at the top , it was written for Ubuntu 7.10 , so some things may change .
Our guide here is using 8.10 .
I would use the alternate install disc , because some folks say the graphical Live CD install can give them some problems .
The alternate install disc is the exact same thing , only with old - school DOS -y graphics .
Grab that ( I recommend the torrent , which will blaze down as fast as your connection will let it ) and burn the ISO file to a CD .
Advertisement
4 . Drop that CD into your PS3 , and go to Settings -> System Settings -> Install Other OS .
This will install the dual - boot loader kboot in a matter of seconds , and ask you if you want to restart into the the Other OS 's install disc .
Make sure your PS3 is connected to the web via ethernet ( wi - fi could possibly work , but it might confuse the Ubuntu instllaer ) , plug in your USB keyboard , which you 'll need , and say yes .
Advertisement
5 . With the keyboard , follow the fugly text - only instructions for the Ubuntu 8.10 installer to install the system .
Everything is self explanatory , and at almost every turn , you should be able to select the default option .
The installer will look like it 's hung up at several points , but it 's not , so let it do its thing .
Install will take about 45 minutes , and when it 's done , remove the install disc , and you 'll boot into a good ol ' Ubuntu desktop .

Pair Your Sixaxis or Dual Shock via Bluetooth
One advantage of using Ubuntu over , say , the PS3 - specific Yellow Dog distro is that it 's easier to wirelessly pair your PS3 controller with a little downloadable utility .
For these steps , you should switch to your PS3 running Ubuntu .
Advertisement
A wireless USB keyboard and mouse here are essential , but stick with wireless USB over Bluetooth .
Logitech 's MX1100 mouse worked immediately with Ubuntu without any futzing , but the Logitech DiNovo Edge BT keyboard I had was a different story - Ubuntu 's Bluetooth utility found it and paired with it , but I could n't get it to actually type .
I 'm sure there 's a way , but that 's some forum sifting you 'll have to do on your own .
Instead I used an old Apple keyboard I had laying around with the USB extension cord .
1 . This thread spells out most of the process , and it's the source of the software you 'll need to download .
Grab Sixaxis Bluetooth Package.tar.gz and unzip it on your Ubuntu desktop .
Advertisement
2. Double click to install the packages inside , first the " bluez - sixaxis- bin_powerpc.deb " package and then the one named " bluez - sixaxis_rc1.1_all.deb . "
3 . Now , with your controller turned off , go to Applications -> Accessories -> Sixaxis - gui in Ubuntu and start the app .
Choose " Setup Menu " and then " Setup first connection " and follow the instructions .
Do n't press the PS button until it tells you to .
The lights will keep blinking even after it 's connected .
Advertisement
4 . After that 's done , you can connect this or any of your other controllers by simply going to " Connect Sixaxis to PC " under " Task menu . "
But to use it with the SNES emulator you 're about to install , you have to do one more thing :
5. Under " Task menu " choose " Enable Keyboard and Mouse " and then pick " Fake Joystick . "
This will pair your controller as a Linux joystick .
After that , you 'll have to disconnect ( with " Turn Off Sixaxis " ) and re-connect your controller .

Install SNES9X Emulator
SNES9X works fairly well on the PS3 , with a few minor caveats , which we 'll get to below .
Advertisement
1. Open up a terminal window in Ubuntu and type the following command :
sudo apt - get install snes9express snes9x-x
This will install the emulator .
2 . When it 's done , " snes9express " will appear under Games in Ubuntu 's application launcher .
Fire that up .
Advertisement
3 . To configure it properly , do the following : under the ROM tab , select the folder that houses all your SNES ROMs ( for games you already owned as a kid , of course ! ) ; under Sound , make sure " Thread Sound " is selected , or else everything will sound horribly garbled ; under Video , check " Scale , " " Hi - Res " and " Full Screen . "
4. Getting SNES9X to recognize your Sixaxis takes a little bit more juju , but even then , there is still some weirdness .
To config , go to the Controllers tab and press " Devices . "
Change the entries of " Pad 1 " ( and " Pad 2 " if you 're using two ) from " / dev/js0 " to " / dev/input /js0 " and hit close .
Do n't try to Configure Button Maps ... for the joysticks .
Advertisement
5 . Go back to ROM , choose your game , and hit Power , and it should start up .
Here , though , are the aforementioned caveats : the PPC version of SNES9X on the PS3 chokes hard when you try to use an alternate button configuration for your controller ( it will take the configuration , but just wo n't play any games ) .
But it 's default configuration , while wacky , is still playable .
You 'll just have to find where each SNES button is mapped for each game .
You 'll have trouble with something like Street Fighter 2 , but simpler games like F - Zero , Pilotwings and RPGs like Earthbound ( !!! ) are totally playable .
Advertisement
And , less damaging , total full - screen does not appear to work ( or at least I could n't get it to work ) on the PS3 .
But you can still drag the window as big as it will get and get the same effect , just with your Ubuntu desktop visible behind .
So , all in all , this wo n't be as elegant as dusting off your old SNES and plugging it in , but it 's fun to squeeze all of the potential out of your PS3 and see it play some vintage classics .

Tips
If Ubuntu locks up on you at any time , do n't trip the main power switch on the back : all you have to do is hold down the regular power button on the front for five seconds to force a shutdown .
Advertisement
And , theoretically , all you have to do to get back to the XMB is type " boot - game - os " at the kboot prompt .
This has yet to work for me .
Instead , power down the PS3 ( so the power light is red ) , and then hold down the power button for 5 - 10 seconds until it beeps a few times , then let go .
This will boot back into XMB by default ( you may have to re-select your TV resolution , but do n't worry , all the rest of your configurations should be saved ) .
If you 're done playing around with Linux for a while , you can simply set the PlayStation OS as the default in your XMB System settings .
Further Tinkering
A couple of things that are possible , but I have not fully tested :
Setting Ubuntu to Your Exact TV Resolution
This thread will help there - in my default installation on my Samsung 720 p LCD , Ubuntu was sufficiently high - res , but with a black border an inch or two thick around the edges .
If you 're experienced with Linux config files though , you can dive into the xorg.conf ( which is blank by default in Ubuntu 8.10 , much to my initial confusion ) and calibrate it to the exact resolution of your TV .

Using the Sixaxis as a Mouse
I do n't think this works by default , but if you want to ditch the USB mouse and use the PS3 controllers analog stick , see this thread for more guided xorg .
conf config file tweaking .
I tried it but the buttons were oddly mapped , so I gave up .
Many have gotten it to work though .
Oh , and I think you guys will enjoy this : while researching this article and diagnosing some problems with using the Sixaxis with SNES9X , I found perhaps the greatest moment in geek troubleshooting forum history .
But thanks to this guy , I was able to get it working , so mad props to him and his Olive - Garden - fueled troubleshooting .
As of JAN/06/2008 @ 11:43 AM EST -
For some reason , SNES9EXPRESS does not like it if i turn JOYSTICK on , i have to go to JOYSTICK tab and turn it off for the Emulator to run without an error code 1 .
I will look further into this and see if i can make sense of it .
*( UPDATE ) * Going to Olive Garden for lunch , going to let a few ideas rattle around in my brain before i take another stab at this .

And that 's about it .
Enjoy Ubuntu on your PS3 , and if you come up with any more fun uses for it , please let me know in the comments .
And if there are any other topics you 'd love to see covered by a weekend how - to , speak up !
Have a good Saturday tweaking everyone .
Early in the summer of 2007 Starmen .
Net received an unsolicited message :
" EB on VC in July . "
There was n't much else to the message .
We were skeptical at first -- EarthBound fans have endured more ill - fated rumors , delays , false starts , cancellations and disappointments than probably any other fanbase in gaming history , so we approach everything with a healthy skepticism .
Like , 0 % body fat skepticism .
After a little investigation , though , we were assured the source of the message was totally legit .
In addition to that , we had actually heard from other sources ( namely , a post from Lucas Thomas of IGN on our forum ) that EarthBound was slated for a summer '07 VC release .
We knew what was happening -- it was something we had been anticipating since Iwata mentioned EarthBound during the Virtual Console introduction .
This would be our last chance to prove to Nintendo that EarthBound could be a commercial success .
So began one of the most hectic , sleepless , tiring , awesome summers in the site 's history .
We hatched a plan :
In the capable hands of Jon Kay , steps 1 and 2 went from vague ideas to finished projects in about a month 's time .
In the two weeks leading up to E3 , Jon and I ( as well as many other Starmen .
Net staffers ) crammed in hundreds of hours of work , and it was paying off : EarthBound 's VC release was promising to be some of the biggest gaming news of the summer .
Not only would anyone be able to legally play the game for less than $ 85 ( the latest going rate on eBay ) , but we 'd finally get our chance to prove to Nintendo -- with cold , hard cash -- that EarthBound was a profitable franchise worth reviving .
True to form , though , we were a little over - optimistic .
Attack of the Copyright Lawyers
As a side note , one of the sources which was keeping us updated re : EB on VC helped us to predict all three of the major MOTHER - related Brawl announcements .
We did n't publicly predict the Franklin Badge announcement because we were a little dubious , but everyone on staff was like ' wtf no way ' when it came true , so we knew we had to go public with the other two predictions .
Sure enough , the weeks following E3 were barren .
By the end of July we heard from our contact -- all they could say was that there were delays , and while things were n't falling apart , it was n't looking good .
Maybe August ?
After an agonizing couple of weeks ( and the release of the hotly - anticipated DK Math Jr ) , we got something solid : December .
We adjusted our plans accordingly .
We did n't realize it at the time , but the appearance of NoA 's legal squad was the beginning of the end for EarthBound .
They were demanding changes to the game , and while we can't say specifics , it 's safe to assume they were uncomfortable with the game 's constant pop culture references .
EarthBound 's soundtrack , in particular , references / samples / mimics every band under the sun , and hearing that a game is constantly referencing bands like The Beatles is enough to make any IP lawyer wring his hands .
You might be thinking , " sampling / references are n't enough to bring a lawsuit " , and you 'd be right .
But it 's also true that not everything in EarthBound is simply sampled / referenced , and even if the game was technically legal , that does n't mean lawyers will be comfortable with it .
They get paid to avoid lawsuits entirely , not to get sued and then say " here 's why this lawsuit is stupid " .
This would n't normally be an issue ( lots of changes have been made to other VC releases ) , but there was one major problem : NCL was n't playing ball .
For reasons we can only guess , the head honchos back in Japan were refusing to let NoA modify the game prior to release .
Was it too expensive ?
Did they disagree with the NoA lawyers ' assessment ?
Were they just being stubborn ?
Was Itoi involved somehow ?
None of our sources were able to tell us what transpired .
Meanwhile , we were in the dark , still expecting a December release .
By January 2008 , we were getting worried .
December had come and gone , and Brawl 's release was drawing near .
If Nintendo hoped to release EarthBound , their window of opportunity was closing -- SSBB 's hype had been sending Starmen .
Net 's traffic off the charts , and it did n't take a marketing genius to realize that , a few weeks / months after the game was released , most people would stop caring about Ness .
Brawl and the ESRB rating
In March ' 08 , Brawl was released and our traffic peaked .
The game came with an unpleasant surprise : EarthBound 's demo had been removed from the Masterpieces section , even though it was present in the Japanese version of the game .
The following Mondays were agonizing , and when EB failed to materialize on the VC we contacted our source to find out what was going on .
This is when we found out that NoA 's lawyers were refusing to release the game without changes , and NCL was refusing to authorize those changes .
The stalemate , if it continued , guaranteed that the game would go unreleased .
That news is what compelled us to organize the PK Tube 'N in the spring of 2008 .
It was a last - ditch effort to salvage the game , and we made that much clear : in the video , we explained that " EarthBound is probably not coming out on Virtual Console " .
The fans responded in the same way they always have : with a huge flood of creativity and an outpouring of support .
The Tube 'N was a great success , with the submitted videos garnering about 400,000 views over the course of a month .
Part of the reason the Tube 'N felt like such a huge success is because , only a week after it started , EarthBound was rated by the ESRB , capping off a huge Shacknews article about the community .
This , of course , sent fans into a frenzy , and since then pretty much everyone has believed that it 's just a matter of time before EB is released on the VC .
Unfortunately that 's not true , as we found out a little later that summer .
We 've had to sit on the information until now , but the time and circumstances are finally right to let the cat out of the bag :
The VC rating was a mistake .
Not like " ugh we never should have done the ESRB rating early , all these annoying fans are all worked up " , but more along the lines of " Uhhh , why was EarthBound rated ?
I thought the guys over in legal told us to forget about it ? "
From what we 've learned , Nintendo never intended to send EarthBound up the flagpole ; it seems to have been some kind of internal mistake on behalf of the ESRB .
By the time both parties ( NoA and the ESRB ) realized what had happened , it was presumably not worth the effort to ' fix ' .
NoA did n't have to pay for it , and the ESRB did n't have to go to the trouble of backpedaling .
And besides , as far as the ESRB knew , the game would be released eventually anyway ... right ?
Well , then .
To preemptively squelch any unwarranted Nintendo bashing , do n't assume NoA is being totally irrational .
Their obsessions might often seem frivolous ( remember how " yo - yo " got changed to " star " in StarTropics ? ) but their lawyers get paid big bucks for a reason -- they know how to save Nintendo from expensive lawsuits .
The real problem here is NCL and their unwillingness to make changes to the game .
We ( more than anyone ! ) can appreciate a little bit of dedication to keeping things canon , but ... come on D :
EB was , and will continue to be , withheld due to legal issues .
It does n't matter what anyone 's opinions are on copyright law or fair use ; the fact is that Nintendo 's lawyers have a huge amount of leverage over the release of any game they 're uncomfortable with , and EarthBound made them pretty uncomfortable .
As long as NCL remains unwilling to approve changes to the game , EarthBound will stay buried .
This is a little depressing for us all as EarthBound fans , probably moreso for the new people we 've had flooding in over the past two years who are n't used to the constant disappointments ;)
If you 're among them , consider these unpleasant circumstances like your induction into our creepy masochistic society .
Now that you 've experienced the unflinching neglect of a multinational gaming company , you 're one of us !
No worries , though .
As EarthBound fans , we 'll continue to take matters into our own hands and ensure that this great game gets recognized .
We 're working on a new site , and we 've got a lot of big plans for the future .
If you 'd like to help out , add EarthBound Central to your daily surfing routine and consider buying some of the EB - inspired swag we 're selling at the Fangamer Store .
The store sales keep us alive while we 're working on the new site ( and the new Starmen .
Net Forum , which we launched last year ) !

Advertisement A new art installation going on display at the European Council building in Brussels has angered EU members with its lampoons of national stereotypes .
Entropa portrays Bulgaria as a toilet , Romania as a Dracula theme - park and France as a country on strike .
The Czech Republic , which holds the EU presidency , thought it had commissioned work from 27 European artists .
But it turned out to have been entirely completed by Czech artist David Cerny and two associates .
The eight - tonne mosaic is held together by snap - out plastic parts similar to those used in modelling kits .
The Netherlands is shown as series of minarets submerged by a flood - a possible reference to the nation 's simmering religious tensions .
Germany is shown as a network of motorways vaguely resembling a swastika , while the UK - criticised by some for being one of EU 's most eurosceptic members - is absent from Europe altogether .
Raised eyebrows
The 16 - square - metre ( 172 - square - foot ) work was installed at the weekend to mark the start of the six - month Czech presidency of the EU .
There has already been an angry reaction to the piece from Bulgaria , which has summoned the Czech ambassador to Sofia to explain .
The three artists responsible for Entropa were led by David Cerny who , says the BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague , is the enfant terrible of the Czech art world .
In pictures : Entropa installation Mardell blog :
But is it art ?
When his government commissioned him to create the installation , several eyebrows were raised , and they were not raised in vain , our correspondent adds .
Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra said he was only informed on Monday that the installation was not the work of 27 European artists , but David Cerny and two colleagues .
Mr Vondra condemned Mr Cerny and said the Czech EU presidency was considering what steps to take before Thursday 's official launch .
" An agreement of the office of the government with the artist clearly stated that this will be a common work of artists from 27 EU states , " he said .
" The full responsibility for violating this assignment and this promise lies with David Cerny . "
Mr Cerny , who presented Entropa to his government with a brochure describing each of the artwork 's 27 supposed contributors from each member state , has apologised for misleading ministers , but not for the installation itself .
" We knew the truth would come out , " said Mr Cerny .
" But before that we wanted to find out if Europe is able to laugh at itself . "
He added that Entropa " lampoons the socially activist art that balances on the verge between would - be controversial attacks on national character and undisturbing decoration of an official space " .
Mr Cerny first created a splash in the early 1990s when he painted a Soviet tank , a Second World War memorial in a Prague square , bright pink .

The trouble with OpenBTS
LWN .net needs you !
Without subscribers , LWN would simply not exist .
Please consider signing up for a subscription and helping to keep LWN publishing
Last September , LWN pointed out the OpenBTS project , which is working toward the creation of a free GSM base station using GNU Radio and Asterisk .
OpenBTS had just been demonstrated through the creation of a cellular network at Burning Man .
More recently your editor , who had been looking in other directions , was surprised to learn that the OpenBTS developers are not allowed to tell anybody where to get the source from , despite the fact that it is available as free software .
Intrigued , your editor decided to look into what is happening with OpenBTS .
OpenBTS is clearly an interesting project ; who would n't like the potential of rolling their own cellular phone service ?
There are a number of potential applications , including special events like Burning Man , the creation of personal " femtocells , " or the ability to explore how cellular handsets interact with base stations .
The biggest target application , though , would appear to be the provision of inexpensive cellular service in parts of the world where the cellular industry sees no money to be made .
In the rural parts of the developing world , potential customers simply cannot afford to pay normal cellular rates , and carriers fear that low - cost offerings , beyond being unprofitable , would endanger the higher rates charged in the cities .
Using systems like OpenBTS , cheap hardware , and some interesting business models , it may well be possible to bring phone service into these areas in a way which is simultaneously affordable and acceptable to the large carriers .
So what is the problem with OpenBTS ?
One might think that an obvious trouble spot would be regulatory : spectrum for cellular services tends to be scarce and expensive .
It is true that one cannot set up an OpenBTS station in the attic and expect to be left alone , but it also seems that the regulatory issues can often be dealt with , especially in places where cellular coverage does not exist .
The real issues come from a different , all - too - familiar direction : " intellectual property " law .
When LWN first wrote about OpenBTS , the source code was not yet available .
On October 24 , 2008 , the OpenBTS developers formally donated this code to the Free Software Foundation , putting it under the GPLv3 license in the process .
OpenBTS is now part of the GNU Radio project .
There has not yet been a GNU Radio release which includes OpenBTS , but interested parties can learn about it - and find out how to check out the current code repository - from the OpenBTS wiki on the GNU Radio site .
The transfer of the copyrights was the result of a direct intervention by John Gilmore , who , while certainly being motivated by the opportunity to improve GNU Radio , also likely saw the potential for trouble in the near future .
The problem is that David Burgess , the primary author of the OpenBTS code , previously did GSM - oriented work for a company called Martone Radio Technology , Inc. Massimiliano Martone , the owner of this company , filed suit against David , alleging that the OpenBTS code contains Martone 's proprietary information .
David denies these charges , stating that GSM is documented in a series of open standards and , thus , can not be proprietary .
See this filing [ PDF ] for a lot of details about the history of the OpenBTS code , this case , and David 's defense .
Whether this defense will hold remains to be seen ; this case is pending as of this writing .
The judge did , however , issue a preliminary injunction reading :
For these reasons , IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants and their agents , officers , directors , employees and anyone acting on their behalf are enjoined from making available on any internet website any algorithm , computer code , software , technical information or any other intellectual property or technical data relating to any base station transceiver , unless they gather and preserve the names , internet addresses and other identifiers of all persons or entities who upload , download or otherwise access any such information .
This is why nobody associated with Kestrel Signal Processing ( David 's company ) can say anything about where the code is located .
However , David does not own this code ; the FSF owns it , and the FSF is not a party to this particular dispute .
So the FSF is not subject to this injunction .
The FSF is also uninclined to collect information on people who download its code .
So the OpenBTS code remains available for anonymous download , this injunction notwithstanding .
If Martone is able , somehow , to convince a judge that it has some claim on that code then the situation could change , but , for now , obtaining OpenBTS is possible - though Kestrel is not able to contribute any further changes to the FSF version .
There is , however , another issue that potential OpenBTS users need to be aware of .
While the GSM standard is " open , " in that it is publicly available , it is not a free standard ; many parts of it are encumbered by patents .
So anybody who wants to set up a production GSM base station powered by OpenBTS ( or anything else , for that matter ) must have acquired patent licenses from the various owners .
Given that , one might wonder how the code can be distributed ; David has posted an explanation on his weblog .
It comes in two parts , the first of which is :
The current GPL distributions of OpenBTS are offered for only private experimental use , which is generally exempt from patent licensing .
Furthermore , OpenBTS is presently distributed as software , not an actual , usable end product .
Anyone using OpenBTS is expected to comply with all applicable laws , including patent laws .
In other words , the FSF is distributing code with known restrictions on its use ; this is a bit of a change for an organization which is not normally enamored of software which is only available for " private experimental use . "
But , evidently , this approach makes it possible to put the code out there under the GPL .
But , even if one accepts this reasoning , there is another problem to face : the GPLv3 text contains some strong language designed to protect users against patent problems .
Anybody who ( 1 ) has the patent licenses necessary to actually deploy OpenBTS , and ( 2 ) contributes to or distributes the OpenBTS code must arrange for recipients to obtain the same patent protection .
Needless to say , that is not really an option in this case ; the owners of these patents ( companies like AT&T , Ericsson , and Alcatel ) have not expressed any great willingness to license them to OpenBTS users .
So the only people who can distribute OpenBTS are , in general , those who can't actually make use of it .
In other words , it would appear to be impossible to use OpenBTS in a commercial product in a way which satisfies both the patent requirements and the GPL v3 requirements .
Quoting David again :
Thankfully , there 's a loophole of sorts .
Look closely at Section 6 .
It does not say you must distribute the source code .
It just says that you must make sure that people who have your product know where to get that source code .
The specific GPLv3 text being referred to would appear to be section 6d , which reads , in part :
If the place to copy the object code is a network server , the Corresponding Source may be on a different server ( operated by you or a third party ) that supports equivalent copying facilities , provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source .
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source , you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements .
So , as long as somebody is distributing OpenBTS without their own modifications , and they do not , themselves , hold licenses to the GSM patents , they need only point to the GNU Radio repository .
This assumes that the operator of that repository is committed to making the source available for the requisite period of time - probably a good assumption when that operator is the FSF .
That said , this is a fairly intricate dance designed to get around , in some sense , the patent licensing requirements of GPLv3 .
And that is where things stand at the moment .
In OpenBTS , we have a software platform which could be used to , among other things , bring affordable telephone service to large numbers of people who have no such service now .
This code has been written to conform to published standards which are in use worldwide , and it has been freely licensed under GPLv3 .
Thanks to the current legal climate , though , this code currently has an uncertain future , a future which must certainly weigh on the minds of anybody considering making use of it .
The administration says that its scheme does not reward people who recklessly borrowed too much .
This is untrue : the plan will certainly help some people who borrowed more than they should have .
No doubt , it would be fairer to help only borrowers whose standard repayments ( after teaser rates expired ) were no more than say 30 percent of gross income to begin with , and / or who borrowed less than 80 % of their property 's initial value -- in other words , to help only borrowers who behaved prudently , and who are now in trouble because their income has fallen .
But of course this would have meant many more defaults .
Because foreclosures also hurt innocent bystanders , there is a public interest in limiting them .
The second part of the plan , I think , is indeed unfair and does raise moral hazard concerns -- but I 'd say that is a price worth paying if it stems the tide of foreclosures .
Will it succeed in doing that ?
It certainly gives loan modification a much firmer push than seen up to now .
Lenders will not be forced to modify , but TARP beneficiaries will have to apply the guidelines , and show that they are making an effort .
The new prospect of bankruptcy - court cramdowns ( this requires legislation ) should also help to focus minds .
A standard Treasury - endorsed modification template ought to ease some of the worries servicers have about being sued by investors over unauthorized modifications of securitized mortgages .
An important question is how far cuts in repayments will be achieved by interest - rate reductions as opposed to cuts in principal .
Many observers reckon that principal reductions would curb foreclosures more effectively .
The plan sees principal reductions as a possibility , but the incentives appear to grant that method of reducing repayments no special favors .
Maybe this will have changed by the time we get full details of the plan next month .
The third part --$ 200 billion of new capital for the GSEs - - improves Fannie 's and Freddie 's ability to buy mortgage - backed securities , supports the market value of those securities , and keeps downward pressure on the interest rates lenders charge mortgage borrowers .
This too makes sense .
I 'm sure the plan will reduce the rate of foreclosures -- as compared with a no-plan baseline .
How much it will reduce them , and whether that will be enough to stabilize the housing market , is impossible to say just yet .
But after many months of almost total neglect , this is a big step forward .
WASHINGTON 
Of nearly 2.2 million immigrants deported in the decade ended 2007 , more than 100,000 were the parents of children who , having been born in the United States , were American citizens , according to a report issued Friday by the Department of Homeland Security .
But the department lacks data that might have addressed questions left unanswered by the report , like the number of American children who were left behind in the United States or , alternatively , exited the country with their deported parents .
Nor could the report say in how many instances both parents of such children were deported .
Similarly , said Representative José E. Serrano , Democrat of New York , since no one knows how many children a given deportee had , the number of affected children could be much higher than 108,434 , the exact number of deported parents of American citizens .
So “ the problem goes deeper than just the numbers you see , ” said Mr. Serrano , who requested the study .
He called the circumstance “ tragic . ”

( CNN ) --
Without his input , Bryan Rutberg 's Facebook status update -- the way friends track each other -- suddenly changed on January 21 to this frightening alert :
Fears of impostors are increasing as Facebook 's membership grows .
" Bryan NEEDS HELP URGENTLY !!! "
His online friends saw the message and came to his aid .
Some posted concerned messages on his public profile -- " What 's happening ?????
What do you need ? " one wrote .
Another friend , Beny Rubinstein , got a direct message saying Rutberg had been robbed at gunpoint in London and needed money to get back to the United States .
So , trying to be a good friend , Rubinstein wired $ 1,143 to London in two installments , according to police in Bellevue , Washington .
Meanwhile , Rutberg was safe at home in Seattle .
Rubinstein told CNN he misses the money , but it 's perhaps more upsetting to feel tricked by someone who impersonated his friend on Facebook , a social - networking site where millions of friends converse freely online .
" It 's an invasion of your whole privacy , who your friends are , " he said .
Watch Rutberg talk about his Facebook page being hacked »
While reports of extortion and false impersonation have been common in phony phone calls and fake e-mails , similar fraud has n't been reported on Facebook until recently .
Now a number of complaints are surfacing .
In response to the trend , the Better Business Bureau in late January issued a warning on its Web site , intended for Facebook 's 150 million users : know who your friends are and keep your sensitive information private .
In the Seattle case , a hacker appeared to steal Rutberg 's identity to get money from his friends by toying with their emotions .
In Wisconsin , police accuse an 18 - year - old man of posing as a woman on Facebook to get high school boys to send him naked photos of themselves .
Watch 18 - year - old accused in Facebook case »
Anthony Stancl , of New Berlin , Wisconsin , allegedly used the naked photos he had solicited to force the young men into sex acts with him , according to a criminal complaint .
Stancl was arrested on 12 felony complaints , including sexual assault of a child younger than 16 and possession of child pornography , the complaint says .
CNN left multiple messages for Stancl 's attorney but did not receive a response .
Stancl is being held in lieu of $ 250,000 bail and has no previous criminal record , according to CNN affiliate WISN .
There are primarily two ways to stay safe on Facebook , said Jim Lewis , director of the technology and policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
First , make sure your computer anti-virus programs are up to date ; and tell online companies you want better privacy protection , he said .
In a statement , Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told CNN that impersonation schemes affect fewer than 1 percent of Facebook 's 150 million users .
He would not comment on whether the rate of such incidents is increasing , but said any increase in the total number of impersonations could be due to the fact that the site is growing by 600,000 users per day .
" In many cases , the scammer has added a new contact e-mail to attempt to maintain control of the account , " Schnitt said in a prepared statement .
" To combat this , we 're instituting changes that will better notify users when their account is modified and empowering them to reverse these changes . "
Rutberg , the Seattle man who had his Facebook page hacked , said he worked with the site to shut down his profile within a day .
It was back up in a week , he said .
All Internet users should be aware their identities can be compromised , and " every user of the Web should be better educated , " Rutberg said .
Like other types of Internet fraud , Facebook impersonation cases are difficult to solve and costly to pursue , said Officer Greg Grannis , spokesman for the Bellevue Police Department in Washington .
" We are not investigating this case , " he said , noting that a report on the case had been filed with his office .
" It is pretty much at a dead end . "
Because the money went to London , it would be nearly impossible to send officers out to investigate the case , he said .
Facebook says it is taking measures to reduce impersonations .
The popular site also offers these preventative tips for those who want to take the security of their online profile into their own hands :
• Be suspicious of anyone -- even friends -- who ask for money over the Internet .
Verify their circumstances independently , either by calling them directly , or checking with mutual friends .
• Choose a strong password and use unique credentials for each of your Web accounts .
Facebook says hackers tap into one site and then try to reuse passwords on others .
• Use an up - to - date browser that features an anti-phishing blacklist .
• Use and run anti-virus software on your computer .
• Reset your Facebook password if you suspect your account has been compromised .
• Have more than one contact e-mail address .
This will help if one of them is hacked .

Here ’s something straight out of the land of philosophical thought experiments .
Â Scientists in Germany have now mapped 65 % of the Neanderthal genome , and could bring one of these hulking fellas to life .
Neanderthals are a humanoid species that split off from homo sapiens about 300 , 000 years ago .
Â
For some reason there was little interbreeding between the two species , despite very strong genetic similarity .
Â
One of the most interesting findings is that Neanderthals had some of the genes critical for language .
Dr. George Church , at Harvard , says Neanderthals could be brought back with existing technology , at a price of about $ 30 million .
The trouble , says Richard Klein , a paleoanthropologist at Stanford , is that you would n’t know whether to put Neanderthals in a zoo or at Harvard .
Klein ’s question flies in the face of a very sensible sounding view called “ moral individualism , ” put forth by the always clear and insightful ethicist James Rachels ( sadly now deceased ) .
Â
You ought to put Neanderthals wherever they belong , based on their own individual characteristics , he would say .
Â
If they were smart , you ’d have to let them into Harvard .
Â
What would it matter what species they belonged to ?
These scientists really seem to set great store by species .
The “ recipe ” for creating a Neanderthal using modern techniques allows you to start with a human cell , and tinker madly ( see article for what “ tinker madly ” means ) , or start with a chimpanzee cell .
Â
The article says –
To avoid ethical problems , this genome would be inserted not into a human cell but into a chimpanzee cell .
The chimp cell would be reprogrammed to embryonic state and used to generate , in a chimpanzeeâ€™s womb , a mutant chimp embryo that was a Neanderthal in many or most of its features .
How does this avoid ethical problems ?
Â
The idea seems to be that the resulting creature would be a mutant chimp , not a mutant human , so it would be much easier to justify poking , prodding , keeping it in a lab , etc .
If Rachels were alive to discuss the case , he ’d find this the height of nonsense .
Â
How could anything be relevant to the way an individual is treated but the character of the individual itself ?
Â
The special deference we feel toward anything that happens to be classified human is groundless , and not innocently so either .
Â
The flip side of the deference for humans is dismissal ( relative or absolute–to make Mary Midgley ’s helpful distinction ) of all that is not human .
If you tinkered with human cells to create Neanderthals , would you thereby be placed in a position of having stronger obligations to them than if you tinkered with chimpanzee cells ?
Â
Or put it this way : say one research team starts with human cells and creates Neanderthals , and another starts with chimpanzee cells .
Â
Do we owe anything more to the human - based Neanderthals ?
I think Rachels view is sensible–as I said –but this is n’t really a simple matter .
Â
Your thoughts ?

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Eating a box of Girl Scout Cookies in one sitting will be a little bit easier this year :
The Girl Scouts of the USA confirmed Wednesday that it has reduced the number of cookies per box to save money because of rising transportation and baking costs .
People buying Girl Scout cookies like these on their Web site this year can expect fewer cookies in the packages .
Michelle Tompkins , a national Girl Scout spokeswoman , said that " the cost of baking a cookie today is significantly higher than it was even a year ago , and our bakers cannot continue to absorb these rising costs . "
She also said transportation costs have increased 30 to 40 percent from a year ago .
The combined cost increase prompted the organization to " lower the net weight of our cookie boxes slightly rather than ask our customers to pay a higher per-package price during these difficult times , " Tompkins said in a written statement .
There will be two to four fewer cookies in boxes of Thin Mints , Peanut Butter Sandwiches , Shortbread Cookies , DoSiDos and Trefoils , she said .
The Girl Scouts also reduced the size of some cookies , but Thin Mint lovers should n't worry that their sweet snacks will get any slimmer :
Only the Lemon Chalet Cremes will change shape .
Tompkins said it is too early to tell how Girl Scout Cookie sales will fare for the year .
She said the cookie - selling season ranges from October to May , with the bulk occurring between January and March .
Each individual council determines when its scouts will sell , and many have just begun in the past few weeks .
Do n't Miss iReport.com : Thin Mints and office politics
Tompkins said she 's heard a range of comments on how sales are going :
One council in Texas is having its best year ever , which attributes to new marketing , and other groups are reporting low numbers .
Sales average $ 700 million a year , she said .
" We hope Girl Scout Cookie lovers will understand the situation and continue to support our girls , " she said .
" As the premier leadership organization for girls , we also intend to use these circumstances as a business learning experience for the girls . "

Amid signs that nuclear power is on the verge of a renaissance are the voices of opponents of the technology who say the industry remains secretive and irresponsible — particularly about highly radioactive waste .
The latest salvo against it is from the anti-nuclear environmental group Greenpeace .
Greenpeace issued warnings and links to scientific documents on Friday to The International Herald Tribune and on Saturday more widely that claimed that waste from one of the most prominently marketed next - generation reactors will be seven times as radioactive as waste from the current generation of reactors .
That , said Greenpeace , will make nuclear power even more costly and potentially dangerous than it is already .
Areva , the French manufacturer of the new reactor technology , called “ EPR , ” said that the reports were grossly inaccurate .
It said the waste from the reactor would be up to 15 percent more radioactive at most .
Hans Riotte at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris said that the current technologies for handling and storing waste could be adapted quite easily to deal with waste from the EPR .
Even so , the latest materials from Greenpeace do raise many interesting points .
One is the high cost of nuclear power plants .
Construction of the first new EPR in Finland already is running hugely over budget .
Another plant is under construction in Flamanville in France , where there also have been delays .
( Two more EPRs are scheduled for construction in China , and Areva is waiting for the reactor to be certified for use in the United States . )
Another point raised by Greenpeace is that nuclear power , despite its appeal as a low - carbon source of energy , will continue to face political hurdles unless adequate plans are put in place for the long - term disposal of nuclear waste .
That disposal , of course , includes even more radioactive forms of waste from the next generation of reactors like the EPR .
Currently , there are no long - term facilities for disposing of high - level nuclear waste anywhere in the world .
Construction is under way in Finland to store waste a quarter of a mile underground , but that project still is awaiting final approval .
American authorities have sought to put high - level waste inside Yucca Mountain , in Nevada , but that plan is foundering because of local opposition .
The government is in a muddle with its policy of “ quantitative easing ” – printing or creating money .
It wanted us to believe this was a policy of the “ independent ” Monetary Policy Committee .
Hence they enacted the charade of the MPC writing to the Chancellor and the government responding .
In a moment of inconsistency the Chancellor yesterday announced the policy on the media and sought to defend and explain it .
Clearly he is in full knowledge of it and has given it his blessing .
It therefore becomes his policy , whatever the truth about who first thought it should be adopted from within the MPC and the government .
He dropped the old pretence that these are matters under independent control which we leave to the Bank and do not comment on .
I am glad he did seek to explain it and defend it .
It is a big step to take and one which the senior elected official needs to be happy with and needs to defend .
Why then did my colleagues get a brush off in the Commons when they rightly asked for a government debate ?
Have we now got to such an undemocratic pass in this country that a government creating or printing the large sum of £ 75 billion does not have to announce it first to the Commons in a statement and then allow a debate ?
Should n’t a democratic government want to explain it to those paid by the taxpayer to approve or criticise these decisions ?
Once again I am driven to the world of the web to make my points .
Every Thursday the government holds a so called “ topical debate ” without a vote to require most MPs to be present .
If they chose genuinely topical matters that could be a good thing .
Instead they usually choose the government ’s spin topic of the week .
They do not let the Opposition ever choose their preferred topic .
Yesterday should have been a debate on the economy and money .
Of course it was n’t .
The Opposition asked me to speak in a full day Economy debate to be scheduled in Opposition time next Tuesday .
I willingly said I would .
Subsequently I was told the Chancellor was not available to take part , so the debate has had to be postponed .
So , like the rest of you , my opportunity to understand the government ’s approach to all this was confined to watching Miss Cooper ( alias Mrs Balls ) on Newsnight .
She may have gone home thinking she had triumphed .
She had put across the government ’s highly political spin line .
They say that the crisis is global , that they made no mistakes , that Gordon Brown is leading the world out of the crisis , that the Conservatives want to do nothing , and the Conservatives have opposed the very measures they are taking which will alleviate and then solve the problem .
One of their dwindling number of supporters has put this all eloquently in a recent posting on this site .
If she did think this I fear she is much mistaken .
Their points about the Conservatives are simply untrue .
The Conservatives have proposed various actions , and have not voted against government measures which they think might help .
What I think we wanted to hear from Miss Cooper was something different .
We wanted a serious tone , an admission that mistakes have been made by this government in the conduct of monetary policy , fiscal policy and banking regulation , and a better explanation of what quantitative easing means and how it might make things better .
I do not think most viewers will have warmed to Labour as a result of her partisan performance .
Some think quantitative easing will have little impact .
On the first day of its formal announcement bond markets did not respond greatly , and sterling remained mercifully unmoved .
The Japanese who tried this found in their circumstances it did not work .
Nor did it trigger inflation .
Some think quantitative easing marks our adoption of a Weimar or Zimbabwean approach to monetary management , fearing that addiction to it could eventually trigger a major inflationary problem .
Government should remember that on its chosen measure inflation is still at 3 % , and there are still price increases a plenty to come though from last year ’s big fall in the pound .
Some think this will prove to be the right sized stimulus that could help turn the corner .
Miss Cooper seems to belong to the try everything school .
She did not claim last night this policy is the magic missing ingredient .
She may be adopting a monetarist policy , designed by people she used to condemn regularly as part of her ideological mantra , but she has not been completely bowled over by their claims .
She said it was just another measure in a long laundry list of initiatives .
As the Opposition pointed out this week , several of last year ’s initiatives still have not got beyond the press release and planning stage .
So what do I think of all this ?
I think the government should realise that doing everything is not necessarily the right answer .
I think inflating the deficit massively , spending huge sums on subsidising very large banks , and undertaking monetary easing increases the risks substantially .
The government is overflexing the national credit card and national financial credibility .
The main problem that is different this time round is the state of the banks .
The government should concentrate on making the banks heal themselves , instead of shovelling obscene sums into them .
They should await the results of lower interest rates .
They should stop savaging savers at a time when savers are needed in a country which has collectively borrowed too much .
If you are going to print some money , you need to have a prudent course for future public finances .
The government has not merely divorced Prudence but is holding a drink and drugs party on her grave .
How do you get on someone ’s nerves quickly ?
Be sarcastic .
You ’re sure to catch the person ’s attention .
Just get ready ...
You might think that there would be few applicants for the post of Labour leader after Gordon Brown , but you would be wrong .
The race to succeed him after the election has already started , as the Prime Minister 's year has so far been entirely empty of good news .
This week , the bad news got worse when Sir James Crosby , Brown 's friend , was forced to stand down from the Financial Services Authority .
As one Brownite admits regretfully : " The link is being made .
Gordon liked the risk - takers , these bankers were his mates .
That 's what people will say . "
You have already voted for this video .

This is your war on drugs .
Mr. Micheal
Phelp 's picture on the net a couple days ago , allegedly smoking from a bong and prompting an " apology " yesterday , is now causing him some more trouble .
This is because a backwards South Carolina sheriff who is " tough on drugs " ( read : Backwards and probably Republican ) has decided to see how far he can push this .
That 's DESPITE the picture being published in another country .
The allegation is the picture as taken in South Carolina , somewhere in HIS county , so the reefer mad sheriff there is on the case .
Spending tax payer money to bring this criminal to justice .
Reefer madness lives in South Carolina , for sure :
A spokesman for Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott , who is known for his tough stance on drugs , said Tuesday the department was investigating .
" Our narcotics division is reviewing the information that we have , and they 're investigating what charges , if any , will be filed , " said Lt. Chris Cowan , a spokesman for agency .
This is exactly how marijuana stays illegal in America .
This is how stupid things about marijuana never go away - the unholy interaction of dumb cops and dumb journalists leave us with a dumb situation .
First - note how the cops switch " narcotics " for " marijuana " .
The sheriff never even says the word in the article - it's all " narcotics " .
Pot is not a narcotic .
This is stupid .
The police have adopted this " narcotic " classification to fit with their propaganda bullshit of equating pot smoking with heroin addiction .
Liars and deceivers working for your tax dollar , lying through their their teeth - here we get to dissect a little bit of it .
The Richland County sheriff can pursue charges as long as the party was in the county , the spokesman said .
" The bottom line is , if he broke the law , and he did it in Richland County , he 's going to be charged , " Cowan said .
" And there 's no difference between Michael Phelps and several other people that we arrest for the same type of a charge everyday . "
This is how cops manage to spend their time arresting 850000 people a year .
This is how cops arrest more people for POT than for all violent ( real ) crimes combined .
Note he adds " we arrest several people a day " for marijuana possession .
He is so PROUD of his actions .
This is just mean spirited , aside from being ultra-dumb .
Obviously this sheriff has nothing else pressing in his county .
It 's the vendetta of the reefer mad .
What a friggin ' idiot .
Phelps has not hurt anybody - he 's not even hurt himself .
People who suggest as much simply do n't know what they are talking about .
They do n't read about this , they do n't do their own thinking or research .
They just regurgitate the shit that people like Sheriff Dimwit here spews to the news .
I want to see them waste MORE tax - payer money - since it is a bottomless goddamned pit - trying to probe what is in a picture that cannot actually be seen .
Because marijuana is alleged to be involved and police ideologies , no expense will be spared because Phelps damages the propaganda stream :
He 's a successful person who smokes pot and therefore has to be destroyed .
People are NOT to be wildly successful and smoke pot .
A lot of people say " marijuana is not important " .
They clearly do n't do any research and their ideas are hilariously devoid of easily verifiable knowledge .
Clearly , it 's one of the most important things in the world to cops .
This is YOUR war on drugs .

Turkey is geographically , politically and officially part of both Europe and Asia
By Adil Ray
BBC , Explore
When I received a call from the Explore team at the BBC , asking me if I wanted to take part in a documentary focusing on Muslims in Turkey , I had to pause and think hard .
At the risk of sounding ungrateful , I get an awful lot of offers for Muslim - related television projects , which is n't always helpful if one is trying to carve out a broad and varied television career .
If I were to tell you that I 'd had an offer ( from one of the big channels who love catchy programme titles ) to front a show called " The Fat Muslim with Two Heads who is also a Jew " would you believe me ?
Well do n't .
It was n't offered , but I feel it coming .
If a modern majority Muslim country can't make Islam work in a democratic system what chance do we have here [ in the UK ] ?
Within seconds of talking to the series producer of Explore I had made my decision - I realised immediately how important this was .
The battle that prevails in Turkey between those who are in favour of more traditional Islamic thought and the secularists is relevant to us all .
After all , if a modern majority Muslim country can't make Islam work in a democratic system what chance do we have here ?
Without wishing to give the far right in Britain any campaign ideas , I am sure the thought of any number of the 70 million Muslims being able to travel freely to the UK would affect us all and probably scare one or two of us too .
Informed about Islam My mother thinks Turkey becoming part of the European Union is a great idea .
What struck me about the pork-eating and beer - drinking Turkish Muslims was how informed they were about their religion
Her theory is that the more Muslims there are in Britain the greater the chance of her son marrying a nice Muslim girl .
Pah !
Pigs might fly !
As we all know , pigs can't actually fly unless accompanied by an adult .
But if they were to hover over the Istanbul skyline many Muslim Turks would n't mind .
You see , what I discovered in Turkey was probably the single most shocking piece of information regarding practising Muslims I have ever encountered .
No , not that the longer the beard the more religious you are , although some TV journalists would have us think so .
It 's that in some parts of Turkey it is deemed perfectly acceptable for a Muslim to eat pork !
The guys I met take so much pleasure from it , in fact , that they actually go and hunt for it themselves - presumably to make sure it 's real pork and not some kind of " tofu " variation supplied by the Islamic authorities .
I never thought I would see this day .
While a student , I was under the impression that even if a speck of my housemate 's bacon fat was to get anywhere near my fish finger , I would be immediately struck down by lightning , but not before I had received 40 lashes in public from the local mullah and was disowned by the entire family .

What struck me about the pork-eating and beer - drinking Turkish Muslims was how informed they were about their religion .
The people I spoke to had read the Koran and had made their choices .
This was n't a case of someone feeling it had to be one choice or the other and that his or her life , beliefs and freedom were being compromised .
Until , that is , the authorities try to make it hard for them to hunt and sell pig meat or try to close down their local bars .
Hairpiece
Any good TV documentary needs a light moment and this was provided by Mercan , an Ankara university student .
Judges recently blocked a move to allow headscarves at universities
Her issue is very important , but the way it is being tackled by girls like her may make you laugh .
As Mercan herself says , it is absurd .
At the moment headscarves or the hijab are banned in all public and government buildings , including universities , thanks to a directive passed by a former government .
So what does Mercan do ?
Show off her locks ?
No , that would go against her strong belief .
Try a university elsewhere ?
She can't afford to .
Instead , on top of her hijab which covers her own natural hair , she wears a hairpiece .
Her wig may not fit perfectly , but her absurd response , on the other hand , appears to .
As with many places in the world , what ministers discuss is n't always reflective of the moods on the streets , and in cafes and living rooms
I am constantly thinking of new comedy material for my radio show and needless to say I was inspired .
Here we have an intelligent , ambitious young woman that Turkey will depend upon , who is denied her rights in a majority Muslim democratic country .
It 's hard to imagine her in any way representing extremists in the manner the authorities fear she does .
That is , after all , what they are saying .
Even though she is not a terrorist , they somehow think her piece of cloth is a weapon and is therefore dangerous .
All - important gateway Despite the confusion that exists in Turkey I believe there is a tremendous amount to learn .
The forces of modernisation and traditionalism meet head on in Turkey As with many places in the world , what ministers discuss is n't always reflective of the moods on the streets , and in cafes and living rooms .
Undoubtedly , as Turkey sits on the cusp of Europe and Asia it holds the key to providing that all - important gateway between East and West .
I hope they take on that responsibility .
I can think of no better scene from Turkey than sitting in a beautiful bar or restaurant overlooking the Bosphorus and hearing the call to prayer coming from one of the many nearby mosques .
Maybe we should all drink to that .

This weekend , I learned the hard way that trying to jailbreak an iPhone 3G using a MacBook running 10.5.6 can totally freeze up the machine later on .
Here are the specifics : UPDATED
Advertisement
Short version :
Be careful with that latest QuickTime update if you have run any " DFU fix " Automator scripts on your unibody ( Late 2008 ) MacBook or MacBook Pro .
Do not upgrade to QuickTime 7.6 until you 've repaired the alterations that the script made to your system .
UPDATE : I am learning from commenters that this is not just limited to unibody Late '08 MacBooks , but it applies to ALL MacBooks running 10.5.6 .
In this post , we outlined how to re-enable unlocking and jailbreaking functionality if you 've upgraded to Mac OS X 10.5.6 .
To do it , you have to run an Automator script that " fixes " the system so that you can enter something called DFU mode .
It 's some hardcore juju , but the script seemed easy enough to run and reboot .
Advertisement
The now - mysteriously - missing original Hackintosh article mentioned that there were some issues with the unibody MacBook and MacBook Pros , but it never said that you should undo it after you finish jailbreaking .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
I did n't even get the jailbreak itself to work on that machine in the end , even though Jason did on his unibody MacBook Pro , but the Automator DFU fix did n't cause any perceptible changes to my system 's behavior , so I promptly forgot about it .
Fast forward two weeks .
I get a notice of the latest QuickTime upgrade , so I OK it .
When my system restarts , I have no access to keyboard or trackpad .
Not only do I not have access , I can't even plug in a mouse or keyboard .
I could use those controls when booting off of a system install disc , but I could n't get the installer to repair my OS , since it was " newer . "
The computer was borked .

My solution was easy but nuclear : I turned an external 320 GB drive into a boot disk , ran the migration tool to move every bit of data from my unibody MBP , then simply swapped drives .
( Gotta hand it to Apple for that new swappable - drive design . )
My machine is as good as new , and now totally up to date .
What you should do , if you already ran the DFU script and have n't installed that QuickTime update yet , is try the method I have since discovered outlined in this Apple Support thread .
Apparently , I 'm not the only one with this problem .

Here are a few solutions besides the one in the support thread :
• If you still have access to your keyboard and mouse , you can copy the backup files ( it should be under Backup_IOUSBFamily_kext_10_5_6 on your desktop ) to where the Automator script was , Install_IOUSBFamily_kext_10_5_5 on your desktop .
Then , just run the Automator script again , and it will copy those " original " files to the right location , then change the permissions correctly and reboot your machine .

• If you already ran the QuickTime update and you 're unable to access any input ( USB or otherwise ) , you can SSH into your machine and run these commands one by one .
If you had trouble with the Automator script , you can open up the terminal and do this too , manually .
Note , some of these lines are too long , so they wrap to 2 lines .
Make sure you copy it in its entirety .
Commands are separated by empty lines in between .
sudo rm - R / System / Library / Extensions / IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBHub.kext
You 'll have to enter your administrator password here sudo rm - R / System / Library / Extensions / IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOUSBCompositeDriver.kext sudo cp -R $ HOME / Desktop/ Backup_IOUSBFamily_kext_10_5_6/AppleUSBHub.kext /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/ sudo cp -R $ HOME / Desktop / Backup_IOUSBFamily_kext_10_5_6/IOUSBCompositeDriver.kext /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/ sudo chown - R root : wheel / System / Library / Extensions / IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBHub.kext sudo chmod -R 755 /System/Library / Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBHub.kext sudo chown - R root : wheel / System / Library / Extensions / IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOUSBCompositeDriver.kext sudo chmod -R 755 /System/Library / Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOUSBCompositeDriver.kext sudo rm -r / System / Library / Extensions .mkext sudo touch / System / Library / Extensions sudo reboot
Your machine will reboot after prompting to update boot caches , and the files should be back to the standard 10.5.6 ones .
Good luck !
Lately I ’ve been helping a few people to get started on Github .
I use git at the command line and my survival guide is also based on that way of interacting with Git .
So I thought I ’d write the procedure up so that I can just point people to this page .
The first tip I can give you and most of what I ’ll be talking about is in the guides from github .
When you ’re used to Subversion or Team Foundation Server for example you ’ll need to make a mental leap .
That leap would be to realise that your local copy is the master copy for you .
The remote server like github.com is one is a little bit like an afterthought .
I think it goes a little bit like this : “ O cool I ’ve built this really cool thing here and I ’ve got it in this git repository on my machine .
It would be cool if other people also had access .
Wait a minute , I ’ll just add a remote and push my stuff onto that server . ”
Problem solved .
Most of this guide applies to both windows and * nix systems except for the next part because that will describe the install parameters for getting msysgit to behave nicely on your system .
==== Windows only ====
If you ’re on windows I suggest you use msysgit as your git client .
You can probably use everything I ’m about to explain from explorer too if you want to use tortoisegit or just prefer gui’s .
I , personally , like having options so I ’ll probably use a mix of those in the future .
Ok onto the install procedure .
Somewhere half - way through the install of msysgit it will ask you how far you want to integrate it .
The correct choice is the middle one : Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt .
For generating ssh keys etc you probably want to use OpenSSH .
==== Windows only end ====
When the install of msysgit is completed it is time to start configuring your git install for usage with github .
The first step you need to take is to tell git your username and email address .
You will also need your API token that you can find on your account page .
[ ~ ] $ git config -- global user.name < span class = " str " > " Ivan Porto Carrero " </ span > [ ~ ] $ git config -- global user.email ivan@nowhere.com [ ~ ] $ git config -- global github.user casualjim [ ~ ] $ git config -- global github.
token [ [ API TOKEN ] ]
This information can be found in the github guides : http://github.com/guides/tell-git-your-user-name-and-email-address.
The configuration above is global but you can still override that on a per project basis .
Now that git knows how to deal with github it is time to formally introduce your machine to the github server .
To do so you might have to create an ssh key private / public keypair .
A tip I can give you before you start the creation is that you probably do n’t want to type a password everytime you push to github .
So when you create your ssh key do n’t use a passphrase ( leave it blank when asked for one ) .
The procedure on how to create the ssh keys can againn be found in the github guides : http://github.com/guides/providing-your-ssh-key.
On windows I would suggest that you use the openssh one .
I use RSA keys but you can choose whichever flavor you want of course :)
After generating the ssh keys you need to provide them to github in your account page .
This should get you up and running with github .
I ’m assuming most people coming to github are familiar with subversion so I ’ll try to map some common operations to the command sequence you need in git .
First things first I have a couple of aliases defined for some common operations .
You can just copy paste the aiases section below in the .gitconfig file that you can find in the root of your personal folder .
C:\users\ivan.gitconfig on vista for me and ~/.gitconfig in bash .
[ alias ] ci = commit st = status co = checkout
If all you need is read - only access to a repository you can just clone a repository by its public clone url ie .
git clone git://github.com/casualjim/ironrubymvc.git
The first operation you ’ll need is how to get source code , make changes and send in a patch .
In git lingo this is called forking .
On github you fork the project you want to make changes too .
Then you clone that project on your local machine and make your changes .
You then push your changes back to your repository and send a pull request to the original project .
That is all you need to do to send in a patch , issue a pull request .
I forked ironrubymvc from Jimmy Schementi and send him pull requests regularly when I ’ve completed a chunk of work on it .
so here ’s the sequence of commands I use to do this .
git clone git@github.com :casualjim/ironrubymvc.git
… make some changes …
To start updating the repository with my changes I ’ll generally first ask for a status to see if I need to add some files to ignore and if there are new files that need te be included
git st
If there are files that need to be ignored I ’ll add them to the .gitignore file in my project root .
If there are still some new files that need to be added :
git add .
Then I ’m ready to commit the changes to my local repository :
git ci –a –m “ Made ironrubymvc do the dishes and ironing ”
Now it ’s time to push my changes to the github server .
git push
And now I need to go to the github website and send a pull request to Jimmy .
He can then decide if he wants to apply the patch or make some changes .
The next step is to keep your fork in sync with the forked repository , so that you can continue to pick up their changes and ensure that your changes still work .
git remote add upstream git://github.com/jschementi/ironrubymvc.git
to automatically fetch and then merge the changes from the upstream repository you can pull from it .
You have to tell pull the remote source it has to pull from and the target branch .
git pull upstream master
A more detailed explanation of this process can be found in the github guides .
http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications
The next thing we ’re going to map is svn:externals .
In git this is called submodules .
They have a great explanation off that in the github guides http://github.com/guides/developing-with-submodules
Suppose you made some changes and they are n’t really what you want and you want to restore the repository to the last commit .
git reset –hard
The last topic is branching and merging changes etc .
As an example I will take the IronRuby project for which Michael Letterle and myself maintain the linux branch .
This branch ensures that IronRuby gets the fixes it needs to compile on mono .
A typical workflow for me when I sync it with the source repository @ git://github.com/ironruby/ironruby.git from the ironruby project root on my local machine .
Previously I did :
git clone git@github.com :mletterle/ironruby.git
git remote add ironruby git://github.com/ironruby/ironruby.git
And to create and track the remote linux branch I issued the following commands :
git co –- track –b linux origin / linux
git pull
This has now got my local copy set up with a linux branch and has pulled in the contents of the remote branch to my local repository .
When there are changes in the source repository I issue the following commands :
git co master // Check out the master branch
git pull ironruby master // Pull in changes from remote
git co linux //
Check out the linux branch
git merge master // Merge in the changes from the master branch
mate . //
Open textmate to resolve conflicts
git add .
//
Add the files with the resolved conflicts back to the repository
git ci –a –m “ Synced with upstream ” // submit changes
git push // update the github server
The information above can be found in the github guides as well but in several places :
http://github.com/guides/git-cheat-sheet
http://github.com/guides/showing-and-tracking-remote-branches
http://github.com/guides/push-a-branch-to-github
http://github.com/guides/keeping-a-git-fork-in-sync-with-the-forked-repo
http://beans.seartipy.com/2008/12/09/setting-up-ruby-on-rails-projects-with-git-and-github/
Those are the commands I use about 95 % of the time when I ’m working with git .
I thought they might be useful to other people hence the share .
If you combine the above with my previous post on how to git-enable your command - line http://flanders.co.nz/2009/03/19/pimp-your-command-line-for-git/ .
I guess you ’ve got a pretty sweet setup .
There is one gotcha that I ’d like to repeat one more time .
When you ’re branching you have to close the solution in visual studio or all kinds of nastiness will ensue .
Visual studio will lock some files and if git wants to remove them it can’t .
This results in a branch that is probably messed up .

Two young men stood nose to nose on a south London street a few months ago , in a furious argument over a minor car accident so heated it had to be broken up by police .
The scene would have been utterly common place , banal even , had one of the young men involved not been the country 's greatest living war hero – Victoria Cross recipient Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry .
" I actually wanted to kill the person .
The police had to come , " explained the 29 - year - old , who is one of only 10 living VC holders .
" It was not about the car , it was not about the accident .
I have been told that because of what happened to me [ in Iraq ] all my body can remember is defence .
Any time something happens I go into a defence mode . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Cpl Beharry 's gentle face is now familiar across the country .
He is the quiet , solemn figure who stood behind 110 - year - old veteran Harry Patch on Armistice Day .
Since becoming the first living recipient of a VC for 40 years for " repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour " , the young Grenadian has been portrayed , somewhat patronisingly , as a humble , almost docile Caribbean soldier .
Cpl Beharry is a confident , self - possessed , yet modest , man , driven to make something of his life and help others .
But he is also a soldier tortured by mental and physical wounds , who has had to learn to live with constant pain , nightmares , mood swings and unexplained rages .
He has decided to speak out for the first time on behalf of the thousands of servicemen and women suffering in the UK , who are forced to turn to charities for help because the Government is failing them .
The soldier cannot remember the last time he had a good night 's sleep .
Almost five years after he saved the lives of 30 comrades in Iraq by driving through a series of ambushes – his head sticking out of the burning Warrior armoured vehicle " despite a harrowing weight of incoming fire " – he can get no rest .
" If I fall asleep , I relive all the contacts [ battles ] .
I start sweating .
Even thinking about it now I am beginning to sweat , " he explained .
" Kosovo , Northern Ireland , Iraq , training – it all blends into one .
One minute , I will be in Iraq on top of a building and the next thing I am in Grenada with my friends during the same contact .
I have been told I kick in my sleep and worse .
I used to get a couple of hours a night but recently , I can't sleep again .
I lie there at night , tossing and turning .
I put on the TV .
I try to read to get tired but I can't .
You think the next night you are so tired you will sleep but you do n't . "
The rocket - propelled grenade that tore open his skull put him in a coma for eight days but , Cpl Beharry explained in an unemotional tone , he survived because his head was so smashed up that it allowed room for his swelling brain .
Today , his hair has largely grown over the scar which extends from one ear to the other .
But the pain persists , jumping from his back to his shoulder and bouncing around in his head .
He likened it to an agonising toothache but he refuses to take painkillers for fear of becoming dependent .
" No one expected me to walk or talk or even be alive .
My mind is telling me everything is fine and my body is reminding me it is not .
I have been told it is memory pain , the body catching up .
My psychotherapist explained that the body could only deal with a certain amount of pain at a time so it comes out later .
When I get those moments , I get angry . "
Ironically , he chose to endure more pain when he decided to have the Victoria Cross tattooed across his entire back .
It is a reminder that he his not just a man who will go down in history for his bravery but an ordinary young soldier with the customary penchant for the artist 's needle .

On his uninjured shoulder is a tattoo of his late grandmother , to whom he would run as a child when his father was violently abusive , and who instilled in him values , aspirations , and a respect for religion .
The body art represents the most important things in his life alongside his fiancée , Tamara Vincent .
The boy who walked to school barefoot speaks with informal ease of meeting royalty and heads of state .
When he was presented to the then US President , George Bush , before the election , he boldly asked him who he thought would win .
Bush replied " Obama " .
When Cpl Beharry met the Queen on his investiture at the Palace , she said to him that it was the injuries people could not see that would take the longest to heal .
The combination of brain injuries and combat stress has made an angry young man of him at times , often completely irrational , he said .
During his time in Amarah with the 1st Battalion , The Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment , his battle group came under attack more than 800 times .
" People do n't realise how hard it is for soldiers .
You spend six months on the battlefield and you have to defend yourself every day and then you come back to normal life and go to Tesco 's and someone runs into your trolley .
You have to stop and think it is only a trolley , you are not on the battlefield .
We are trained to be angry .
We are trained to kill and then at five o'clock you have to go home , adjust , change completely to a different person .
You can't react the same way . "
He continued : " The only people who can relate to it is other soldiers or ex-soldiers who have been through the same .
I find it difficult to talk to normal civilians . "
The wail of a siren , the bang of a door , any loud noise , reminds him of the RPGs that blasted into the Warrior armoured vehicle he was driving , of the day he repeatedly leapt on to the burning vehicle to drag injured colleagues to safety , or the moment six weeks later when he was injured again , this time almost fatally .
" It brings me back into the killing zone , to the explosion .
When you hear a bang in Iraq , you know it is going to be followed by something and back home you still feel the same .
You go tense , waiting .
I go into that defence mode .
Everyone experiences combat stress differently .
But we are all linked .
" The guys are dealing with it in their own way , " he added .
" A lot of soldiers who were there in Telic 4 [ the Iraq campaign of summer 2004 ] have left the Army .
Those who are still serving get some form of help for combat stress , but not enough . "
War veterans are supposed to get priority treatment in the health system for conditions resulting from military service but many complain that the reality is very different .
" It is disgraceful that an ex-serviceman or woman has to go to the NHS .
The Government should have something in place , " he said .
" I do n't think the Government is doing enough for soldiers , personally .
That is why you have all these different organisations like Help for Heroes . "
The burden of the VC has placed incredible pressure to be a " superman " .
" I am no different to anyone else .
I did something out of the ordinary but I hope that someone else would have done the same thing in my position .
There is a lot of stress .
The hardest part of it is so much is expected of me .
I now have to carry myself in a certain manner and it is hard work . "
His brain injury has also left him with a terrible short - term memory .
" If people can see the problem , maybe they can sympathise , but when they can't it is very difficult .
People see me acting normally but inside I am dealing with the pain of the injury . "
But he added : " I worry something is going to happen to me , that one day my injury is going to creep up on me and I will be in bed all the time . "
While he is grateful for all the care he has received , he worries for others .
" Two years ago , I went to King 's College Hospital because I was in so much pain .
I sat in the waiting room for three hours before I could see a doctor .
It was ridiculous .
It is not because of who I am that I should be treated first .
I think all soldiers should be treated equally .
" Ex-servicemen and women should get the treatment but they do n't get it .
We need to raise awareness in the NHS .
These are people who have served this country .
Why can't they get treatment ? "
Sitting in a smart London hotel , he is all too aware that many of his regiment are in Iraq and Afghanistan and , like VC recipients before him , he will never return to the frontline .
He is deeply frustrated by the enforced inactivity , unable to join his regiment and desperate for the Army to find him a role .
" I do n't regret anything that happened to me but I feel like I am 60 years old because I do n't have a job .
I am employed but I do n't feel employed .
I want to achieve something in life . "
Four years after being awarded the VC , he lives in a small house on a quiet south London street , living off a Lance Corporal 's salary , boosted by a reported £ 1 m book deal .
He is sanguine about the press coverage which followed his split from his wife , Lynthia , days after the investiture .
" Everything about me is in the open .
I have nothing to hide , " he said .
He spends his time promoting his book , Barefoot Soldier , which describes his early days growing up in an impoverished Caribbean family , his move to the UK at 19 and decision to join the Army – and pursuing his passion to inspire children from difficult backgrounds .
" Because I was involved in drink and smoking weed , I can say I was there and look at how my life turned around , tell them they have a choice : a job or prison . "
He also helps out with countless charities , including Combat Stress , which offers a lifeline to thousands of servicemen dealing with mental health problems .
The charity has experienced a 53 per cent increase in the past three years in veterans presenting with post - traumatic stress or complications brought on by combat .
A £ 4 m grant from the Ministry of Defence covers less than half its costs , and it must rely on other donations .
A portrait of Cpl Beharry is among items being auctioned at Combat Stress 's 90th anniversary ball , organised by another decorated former soldier , Kevin Godlington , in London on 11 June .
But while Cpl Beharry is happy to put himself in the public eye to help such causes , he finds attention difficult and rarely takes public transport .
With a wistful grin he explained : " Eric Wilson [ the country 's oldest VC holder , who died last year aged 96 ] said to me ' Young man , your life will never be the same again . '
At the time , I thought it was just a saying but , trust me , it is not . "
The 90th Anniversary Ball for Combat Stress is being held on 11 June at the Berkeley Hotel in London .

Medal - winning heroism : ' Extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour '
An edited extract of the VC citation for L / Cpl Beharry , then a private
Private Beharry carried out two acts of great heroism which saved the lives of his comrades under intense enemy fire and at great personal risk to himself .
On 1 May 2004 , Beharry 's company was ordered to replenish an outpost in the city of al - Amarah .
He was the driver of the platoon commander 's Warrior armoured fighting vehicle .
As his platoon passed a roundabout , they saw the road in front was empty .
The platoon commander ordered the vehicle to halt .
It was hit by multiple rocket - propelled grenades ( RPG ) .
The platoon commander and the vehicle 's gunner were incapacitated and a number of the soldiers were also wounded .
Beharry closed his hatch and moved toward a barricade .
The vehicle was hit again by RPGs .
He drove his Warrior through the barricade .
By doing this , he led the remaining five Warriors behind him towards safety .
Another RPG destroyed his periscope , so he was forced to drive with his head exposed .
The vehicle was again hit by RPGs and small arms fire .
He was hit by a bullet , which lodged on his helmet 's inner surface .
He continued to push through the extended ambush until he broke clean .
On 11 June 2004 , Beharry 's Warrior was part of an attempt to cut off a mortar team in al - Amarah .
He was moving towards the suspected firing point when his vehicle was ambushed .
A RPG detonated six inches from his head .
Other rockets hit the vehicle , incapacitating his commander and injuring several of the crew .
Beharry reversed the Warrior out until it hit a wall .
Beharry then lost consciousness .
By moving the vehicle he enabled other Warrior crews to extract his crew .
Despite receiving a serious head injury , his level - headed actions almost certainly saved the lives of his crew .
Beharry displayed repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour in the face of relentless enemy action .

Futurism was an international art movement founded in Italy in 1909 .
It was ( and is ) a refreshing contrast to the weepy sentimentalism of Romanticism .
The Futurists loved speed , noise , machines , pollution , and cities ; they embraced the exciting new world that was then upon them rather than hypocritically enjoying the modern world ’s comforts while loudly denouncing the forces that made them possible .
Fearing and attacking technology has become almost second nature to many people today ; the Futurist manifestos show us an alternative philosophy .
Too bad they were all Fascists .

Democracy Now ’s Amy Goodman talked to Luce Guillen - Givins who is one of the first people ever to be charged under the 2002 Minnesota version of the federal PATRIOT Act .
Guillen - Givins and 7 other members of the group RNC Welcoming Committee — also known as the “ RNC 8 ” — were formally charged with conspiracy to riot in furtherance of terrorism .
However , criminal complaints filed reportedly do not allege that members of the RNC 8 personally engaged in any act of violence or damage to property .
“ Instead , authorities are seeking to hold the eight defendants responsible for acts committed by other individuals during the opening days of the Republican National Convention , ” reports Democracy Now .
“ I think the significance is that this is one more step in the process of criminalizing dissent , ” Guillen - Givins .
“ It ’s the fact that we do have a right to protest .
Any prosecution under a PATRIOT Act or any similar legislation infringes on those rights . ”
A full transcript of Amy Goodman ’s interview with Luce Guillen - Givins is available here .

The DHS is looking to mount the cameras in places where regular surveillance systems would not be practical .
According to the department , video footage would only be viewed after an incident occurred .
And , to prevent a breach of privacy , the cameras would be tamper - proof .
No one would be able to lift the video and post it on YouTube .
For Immediate Release
American ’s largest third party is calling plans by the incoming Obama administration a “ multibillion - dollar boondoggle . ”
“ We ’re not going to spend our way to economic recovery , ” says Andrew Davis , a spokesperson for the Libertarian Party .
“ You ca n’t even call Obama ’s economic plans a gamble because the results are written in stone .
We ’ve tried this Keynesian experiment many times in the past , with no proven success .
It ’s nothing but a multibillion - dollar boondoggle . ”
The Libertarian Party says that Obama ’s spending proposals , which include funding the largest public works program since the 1950s , will take too long to implement and do n’t pass a cost / benefit test .
“ The best plan for economic recovery would be giving more money back to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts , which can increase consumer spending and increase job creation , ” says Davis .
“ It will also avoid the corruption and wastefulness of government spending — something that must be addressed at once if we expect to remain a free and prosperous nation . ”
“ Public works projects , like those proposed by the Obama administration , will take too long to implement and many will cost far more than their economic benefit , ” Davis explains .
“ So , not only will the government be spending taxpayer money on wasteful projects , it will be spending money during a time when economic relief is not needed .
Conversely , tax cuts are always in season . ”
The Libertarian Party also warns that adding close to a trillion dollars in additional government spending to the budget will push the United States closer to financial ruin .
“ Elected officials do n’t like to talk about the reality of government spending because it ’s not an issue that gets them reelected , especially when they will be long - gone before it comes time to pay the piper . ” says Davis .
“ However , we ’ve reached an event horizon in spending that if government does n’t immediately begin to cut its programs , the only option will be massive tax increases unlike Americans have ever seen . ”
Davis says the government ’s focus should be on permanent and significant tax cuts .
“ However , any tax cuts absolutely have to be offset by a reduction in government spending , or else we ’re merely asking for higher taxes in the future , ” Davis explains .
“ We must not make the same mistakes of the Bush administration , which cut taxes , but also dramatically increased government spending . ”

“ This crisis is resizing and reshaping the industry , ” the group ’s chief executive , Giovanni Bisignani , said in a conference call from the group headquarters in Geneva .
He predicted revenue would fall 12 percent , or $ 62 billion , in 2009  double its contraction after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
That is chiefly because airlines are suffering from sharp declines in the two areas from which they derive most of their revenue : first - and business - class passenger traffic and freight .
Image  This crisis is resizing and reshaping the industry ,  says Giovanni Bisignani of the International Air Transport Association .

High - end passenger traffic fell 16.7 percent in January and cargo dropped 23.2 percent .
While the Asia - Pacific region will be the worst hit , forecast to lose $ 1.7 billion this year , airlines in North America were expected to turn a $ 100 million profit .
Those carriers have been quick to reduce capacity in line with an expected 7.5 percent drop in demand , and they avoided the pain of misjudged oil hedging contracts that left other carriers exposed when prices fell last year .
“ Over the past 15 months we suspended nearly 40 airlines .
The reason ?
They could n’t pay their bills , ” Mr. Bisignani said , referring to the 500 carriers in the association ’s fare settlement system , although most of the suspended airlines were small .
Airlines are experiencing difficulty in obtaining credit from banks to finance the purchase of new aircraft .
The group predicted that the world ’s airline fleets would absorb only 700 jets from Boeing and Airbus together by 2011 , compared with 1,400 scheduled for delivery this year alone .
Going once , going twice … virginity sold !
A 22 - year - old student from San Diego , California , has put her virginity up for sale .
Natalie Dylan is offering herself and her virginity to the highest bidder and she is reportedly getting a lot of million - dollar bids .
The young student first hoped she will sell her purity for at least a million dollars and is now thrilled with the price it has fetched .
She revealed : “ I am shocked by how far this has gone .
“ I did n’t expect so many people to bid for me or for the amounts to be so high .
It ’s shocking that men will pay so much for someone ’s virginity , which is n’t even prized so highly any more . ”
One bid for her virginity at the Bunny Ranch brothel in Carson City , Nevada , came from a man who offered $ 3.8 million with the condition that he be allowed to videotape the sex , the New York Post reported Tuesday .
“ I ’m still getting offers , but I ’m not necessarily taking the highest bidder , ” she said .
Miss Dylan said her offer of a one - night stand could help her gain a master ’s degree in family therapy and marriage counseling .
She was inspired by her sister Avia , 23 , who paid for her own degree course by making thousands of dollars as a prostitute in three weeks at the Bunny Ranch .
According to her , she ’s already taken a polygraph test to prove her virginal status , and is also willing to undergo a medical analysis .

Exclusive to STR
Like all good STR articles , the recent one by Marcel Votluka got me thinking .
It got me thinking about what laws are , and what an ethic is when it 's at home .
Both purport to be about behavior -- harmony between humans -- so we expect them to coincide well and are surprised when they do n't .
However , I take the opposite view , and express surprise when they do .
An examination of what they are will help show why .
A law is as we know a government rule , a decree handed down by people poised to punish those who disobey their will .
That 's its essence .
Group G imposes itself on Group P , by means of laws .
Since Group
P may be large and sometimes intelligent , Group G takes some trouble to placate members of P by stressing that chaos would result without laws , that laws are closely aligned with good ethics , and that G folk are in any case chosen by P folk in a fair manner , so there 's no question of a dictator just imposing his whim .
In addition , it 's a frequent trick to invent a deity , whose word is not to be questioned , and establish a close link to it or him so that the lawmakers are seen as pals of the Almighty ; hence the proximity of the National Cathedral to the White House , Parliament to Westminster Abbey , and all the multiplicity of appeals at the end of political speeches for God to Bless America , etc. , the Reverend Wright excepted .
Hence too those odious words from the other party , endorsing the first : " the powers that be are ordained of God " ( Romans 13:1 . )
Here , we 're reflecting on the second of those claims -- that laws and ethics go together ; but all four of them are dead wrong and , in fact , the imposition of laws actually creates chaos , rather than preventing it .
But that second claim is bolstered by the fact that rape is ethically terrible and look !-- there are laws against rape ; theft is morally wicked and see !-- there are laws against theft , etc .
Ethics ( why are they always plural ? ) on the other hand are a bit harder to define .
They have to do with an inherent sense of right and wrong , an inbuilt conscience that all humans possess , influenced by the very large background of tradition and culture that has evolved over at least 50,000 years following the great human move out of Africa to populate the Earth .
We have to get along with each other , so we take care how we treat other people .
Although seldom enunciated this way , ethics stem , it seems to me , from the simple principle " do unto others as you would have them do unto you , " and that involves no governor , natural or supernatural -- just rational self - interest .
All of us hate having things stolen , so it 's right and ethical not to steal ; likewise physical hurt , assault , defrauding etc .
In ethics , there is no retribution for violating one of those principles , except for one 's severe loss of self - respect and of a good reputation ; but those things are vastly more important than the suffocating r'gime of laws and penalties has made them seem .
In ethics , moreover , a bad act is a bad act even if nobody can become aware of it ; for example , if it were possible to steal something with a 100 % certainty of never being accused of breaking a law , it would still be a bad act .
( Come to think of it , I 've just described taxation . )
This caught the notice of Roman thinkers , who called it malum in se-- bad in itself -- in contrast to malum prohibitum , which is " wrong " only because some law prohibits it .
I 'd say that mala prohibita are n't wrong at all , because once they are prohibited , the element of moral culpability is removed .
That brings up the key attribute of ethics -- choice .
We can be praised or blamed for something we do only to the extent that we could choose whether or not to do it ; but if there is no choice , there can be neither blame nor praise and no moral content at all .
You see a cop car right behind you , so you observe the 30 mph limit ; is there any moral virtue in that action ?
I do n't think so .
There is no choice involved except to defy the cop and that is , in most cases , plain foolish .
To drive with extra caution when there is risk of hurting someone is , on the other hand , ethical .
Similarly with taxpaying ; the idiot in the street sees it as " good " to pay them and " cheating " to " dodge " them ; but if there is no choice about the matter , there can be no ethical merit either way ; except that if one can avoid contributing to the mayhem they fund , while remaining at large , I 'd say that achievement is as laudable as it is hard to do .
Okay , so those are the main differences between law and ethics .
Laws come from outside and seek to codify ever more details of conduct , while ethics come from within and spring from an inherent moral sense , a rational desire to maximize one 's own long - term self - respect .
Now here 's why law and ethics seldom coincide in practice .
1. Laws are made by people who are , for the most part , the very scum of the earth ; if something they impose on society is ethically beneficial , therefore , the coincidence involved is considerable .
They are drawn from those with an urge to dominate , who have quite often never done a day 's work in their lives for customers or employers who are free to accept or decline their offer .
They take their powers by force and deceit ( any who compete with the R&D Party , for example , are deliberately hindered by obstacles especially erected for them ) and draw their salaries and large expenses 100 % from funds which are not only stolen , but stolen without possibility of recourse by the victim -- and stolen sometimes ( the US " income tax " for example ) by absolute fraud since it 's done without laws even having been written .
They habitually and often make laws to enslave their subjects in a military force designed to kill their enemies , and habitually lie when questioned about the need for it ; and they try to avoid being subject to their own rules whenever they can get away with it , as in the recent cases of Geithner , Killefer and Daschle .
Instead of being benevolent , disinterested and morally upright , therefore , lawmakers are normally psychologically freakish , kleptocratic , mendacious , murderous , irrational and hypocritical .
2 . Laws are by their nature wholly rigid , while ethical behavior is not .
Life is full of uniquely puzzling situations -- well suited to honest resolution attempts made on the basis of our broad nonaggression principle , but wholly unsuited to mindless adherence to pre-formed rules that could not possibly anticipate every circumstance .
That 's why laws multiply ; a rule is made , then an exception arises and an exception rule is made , and then an exception to the exception , and so on until the shelf is full .
Currently , alas , it still has room ; even though those voting on new laws have no time to read them first .
3 . Every law written carries punishment for breaking it , executed by the lawmaker 's agents .
Punishment is utterly futile .
It has no corrective element ( except in name , itself a sick joke ) and no redeeming feature .
The perp rots , the victim is uncompensated , a third party is forced to fund the farce .
Therefore , as above , the mechanical operation of law and punishment excludes the possibility of moral choice ; the name of the game is no longer " what should I do to maximize my wellbeing ? " but " where 's the nearest loophole , " or " how can I get away with it ? " and meantime the concept of what " justice " actually means is concealed .
4 . Laws are , even at best , 100 % surplus to what is needed for a society to be ethical ; and a simple way to prove that is to take the case of murder .
The intentional , non-defensive act of taking a human life is everywhere recognized as ethically repugnant .
What purpose , therefore , is served by making it also a crime -- by having a law forbidding it ?
In the ( shockingly ) improbable case that the perp is brought to trial , the outcome brings the victim ( or rather his family and friends ) no comfort beyond the savage and unhealthy one of satisfied vengeance .
It also brings the aggressor an end to his life -- either literally or , in case of permanent incarceration , to that of normal , useful existence ; there is no possibility of reform .
And again , society at large is the further victim , in that we are required to pay $ 30,000 a year to keep him in a cage .
Such is law - based , government " justice " even in the best case , where law and ethics coincide most closely ; such is the absolute contrast with what ethics would require ( some compensation to the victims , at the perp 's expense ) .
Would lawyers exist , in the free society which I anticipate a couple of decades hence ?
I suppose they may still be called " lawyers " out of habit , but no , since there will be no government , there will be no laws and since there will be no laws , there can be no lawyers to administer and enforce them .
There will of course be disagreements in need of resolution , and today 's lawyers will probably , after extensive re-education , take a part in that process ; but I rather hope that they will get themselves another name .
The French word for the profession , even today , is avocat and I favor its adoption here , with just the addition of a " d " after it begins and an " e " at the end .
Someone to act as a skilled , articulate spokesman for each party in dispute before a free - market arbiter .
Now , that would be useful .
People would agree to pay money for it .
The ethical nonaggression principle springs from the axiom of self - ownership , which is an axiom because no alternative , rational possibility exists ( if you do n't own you , then who does , and how did he acquire title ? ) .
Being applicable to every human , the single limit on behavior is not to take decisions for someone that are , by that right of ownership , his alone to take .
It 's really simple to understand , and unless it 's been suppressed by government in 12 years of youth indoctrination , I dare say that everyone understands it very well from early childhood .
It is the true basis for ethical conduct and it suffices perfectly well for any interaction among human beings , even those that may at first seem morally ambiguous .
The difference , then , between law and ethics is so stark that we need not suppose they are related , or ever susceptible to divorce .
In reality , they were never married .

Jan. 28 , 2009  --
The CIA 's station chief at its sensitive post in Algeria is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly raping at least two Muslim women who claim he laced their drinks with a knock - out drug , U.S. law enforcement sources tell ABC News .
The suspect in the case is identified as Andrew Warren in an affidavit for a search warrant filed in federal court in Washington , D.C. by an investigator for the State Department 's Diplomatic Security Service .
Click here to read the affidavit .
Watch " World News with Charles Gibson " TONIGHT at 6:30 p.m. ET for the full report .
Officials say the 41 - year old Warren , a convert to Islam , was ordered home by the U.S. Ambassador , David Pearce , in October after the women came forward with their rape allegations in September .
According to the affidavit , the two women " reported the allegations in this affidavit independently of each other . "
The affidavit says the first victim says she was raped by Warren in Sept. 2007 after being invited to a party at Warren 's residence by U.S. embassy employees .
She told a State Department investigator that after Warren prepared a mixed drink of cola and whiskey , she felt a " violent onset of nausea " and Warren said she should spend the night at his home .
When she woke up the next morning , according to the affidavit , " she was lying on a bed , completely nude , with no memory of how she had been undressed . "
She said she realized " she recently had engaged in sexual intercourse , though she had no memory of having intercourse . "
According to the affidavit , a second alleged victim told a similar story , saying Warren met her at the U.S. embassy and invited her for a " tour of his home " where she said he prepared an apple martini for her " out of her sight . "
The second victim said she suddenly felt faint and went to the bathroom where " V2 [ victim 2 ] could see and hear , but she could not move , " the affidavit says .
She told investigators Warren " was attempting to remove V2's her pants . "
The affidavit states , " Warren continued to undress V2 , and told her she would feel better after a bath . "
Alleged Rape Victims Tell Their Stories to Investigators
The alleged victim said she remembers being in Warren 's bed and asking him to stop , but that " Warren made a statement to the effect of ' nobody stays in my expensive sheets with clothes on . ' "
She told investigators " as she slipped in and out of consciousness she had conscious images of Warren penetrating her vagina repeatedly with his penis . "
The second victim told investigators she sent Warren a text message accusing him of abusing her and he replied , " I am sorry , " the affidavit says .
According to the affidavit , when Warren was interviewed by Diplomatic Security investigators , he claimed he had " engaged in consensual sexual intercourse " and admitted there were photographs of the two women on his personal laptop .
He would not consent to a search or seizure of the computer , leading investigators to seek the warrant .
According to the affidavit , a search of Warren 's residence in Algiers turned up Valium and Xanax and a handbook on the investigation of sexual assaults .
The affidavit says toxicologists at the FBI laboratory say Xanax and Valium are among the drugs " commonly used to facilitate sexual assault . "
" Drugs commonly referred to as date rape drugs are difficult to detect because the body rapidly metabolizes them , " said former FBI agent Brad Garrett , an ABC News consultant .
" Many times women are not aware they were even assaulted until the next day , " he said .
The CIA refused to acknowledge the investigation or provide the name of the Algiers station chief , but the CIA Director of Public Affairs , Mark Mansfield , said , " I can assure you that the Agency would take seriously , and follow up on , any allegations of impropriety . "
State Department Acting Spokesman Robert Wood issued a statement saying , " The U.S. takes very seriously any accusations of misconduct involving any U.S. personnel abroad .
The individual is question has returned to Washington and the U.S. Government is looking into the matter . "
U.S. officials were bracing for public reaction in the Muslim world , following the report of the allegation .
" It has the potential to be quite explosive if it 's not handled well by the United States government , " said Isobel Coleman , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who specializes in women 's issues in the Middle East .
" This is n't the type of thing that 's going to be easily pushed under the carpet , " she said .
U.S. Officials Say They Found Video Tapes
Both women have reportedly since given sworn statements to federal prosecutors sent from Washington to prepare a possible criminal case against the CIA officer .
Following the initial complaints , U.S. officials say they did obtain a warrant from a federal judge in Washington , D.C. in October to search the station chief 's CIA - provided residence in Algiers and turned up the videos that appear to have been secretly recorded and show , they say , Warren engaged in sexual acts .
Officials say one of the alleged victims is seen on tape , in a " semi-conscious state . "
The time - stamped date on other tapes led prosecutors to broaden the investigation to Egypt because the date matched a time when Warren was in Cairo , officials said .
As the station chief in Algiers , Warren played an important role in working with the Algerian intelligence services to combat an active al Qaeda wing responsible for a wave of bombings in Algeria .
In the most serious incident , 48 people were killed in a bombing in Aug. 2008 in Algiers , blamed on the al Qaeda group .
The Algerian ambassador to the United Nations , Mourad Benmehid , said his government had not been notified by the U.S. of the rape allegations or the criminal investigation .
Repeated messages left for the Warren with his parents and his sister were not returned .
No charges have been filed , but officials said a grand jury was likely to consider an indictment on sexual assault charges as early as next month .
" This will be seen as the typical ugly American , " said former CIA officer Bob Baer , reacting to the ABC News report .
" My question is how the CIA would not have picked up on this in their own regular reviews of CIA officers overseas , " Baer said .
" From a national security standpoint , " said Baer , the alleged rapes would be " not only wrong but could open him up to potential blackmail and that 's something the CIA should have picked up on , " said Baer .
" This is indicative of personnel problems of all sorts that run through the agency , " he said .
" Rape is ugly in any context , " said Coleman , who praised the bravery of the alleged Algerian victims in going to authorities .
" Rape is viewed as very shameful to women , and I think this is an opportunity for the U.S. to show how seriously it takes the issue of rape , " she said .

A Sydney zoo has unveiled two of its baby meerkats , named Nairobi and Zanzibar .
The pups were born in January weighing around 40 grams each but have now grown to 150 grams .
Their keeper Bobby Jo Vial said , " We feed them worms , cockroaches , crickets , maggots ...
All the yummy things .
They also eat mice and small reptiles so they have a pretty varied diet but mostly insects . "
The story is about how the politically - arranged marriage between Victoria and Prince Albert none the less turned into a genuine love match .
Normally , filmmakers would have pared all the minor characters away to mere caricatures , yet this movie features the interaction between such esoteric figures as Baroness Lehzen , Sir John Conroy , Baron Stockmar , Lady Flora Hastings and any number of others whom one would otherwise have come across only in the pages of Elizabeth Longford 's biography of Queen Victoria or the second volume of Lord David Cecil 's life of Lord Melbourne .
The Texas Department of Transportation is n't laughing at the ghoulish warning that appeared Wednesday on an Austin traffic sign .
Someone altered electronic signs intended to warn motorists of construction near the intersection of Lamar and Martin Luther King boulevards to warn drivers to " run " from the " zombies ahead . "
" The end is near !!!!!!!!! " the signs exclaimed .
" Caution !
Zombies ahead !!! "
" Run for cold climates , " the signs instructed motorists .
The two signs are about a half mile west of the University of Texas campus .
Austin Public
Works spokeswoman Sara Hartley said the message was only displayed for a few hours .
While some people found it funny , TxDOT says the signs are there to display traffic information .
The department is now trying to figure out who hacked into its digital road sign system .
Hartley said the hackers cut a padlock to get into the signs ' computers .
She told KXAN - TV in Austin that the stunt is a Class C misdemeanor punishable by up to a $ 500 fine .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Looking forward to spring ?
The good news is that it is coming two days earlier on average , but so are summer , autumn and winter , researchers said on Wednesday .

They found that on average , the hottest day of the year in temperate regions has moved forward by just under two days , and so has the coldest day of the year .
While the consequences of this shift are not clear , it is worrying , Alexander Stine of the University of California , Berkeley and colleagues said .
“ All of the seasons are coming earlier .
They are both hotter and they are earlier , ” Stine said in a telephone interview .
The effect can be seen in both the northern and southern hemispheres , said Stine , whose team studied more than 100 years of temperature data to tease out the pattern .
Writing in the journal Nature , Stine and colleagues said the effect is related to global warming and is very likely to be caused by humans .
The shift in seasons is unsettling because none of the climate change computer models predict this , Stine said .
“ There are certain things that we expect from global warming and there are certain things that we do n’t , ” he said .
“ You expect that , say , the ice is going to melt a little earlier ... and you expect the ice is going to form a little bit later in the year .
But what you do n’t expect to see is for the hottest day of the year to be earlier . ”
Stine ’s team found that land temperatures between 1850 and 1950 showed a simple pattern of variability , with the hottest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere around July 21 .
Between 1954 and 2007 , temperatures peaked 1.7 days earlier .
Peak temperatures come about a month after the solstices -- when the sun ’s rays hit the Earth more or less indirectly , causing summer and winter .
Stine said it takes time for the rays to heat up the land in the summer , and for things to cool off during the period of indirect sunlight .
This pattern suggests the planet has lost something that helps draw out the process .
“ The land is putting up less resistance to what the sun is telling it to do , ” Stine said .
There may be a loss of moisture in the soil , or some other factor like pollution , he said .
“ If the way the Earth is responding to the sun is changing , we ’d like to know that , ” Stine said .
“ There is a concern that we may be missing some important processes . ”
The finding fits in with other research that shows spring begins earlier in certain areas of Britain , for instance , and that growing seasons have shifted forward .

Rogers Communications Inc. , which yesterday posted a $ 138 million fourth - quarter loss , is again raising rates for residential cable and high - speed Internet services as customers scale back spending .
The cable and telecommunications giant recently mailed customers a card detailing residential rates , effective March 1 .
Rates will rise between 3 and 9 per cent for Rogers ' high - speed Internet services , with the exception of its $ 99.95 per month " Extreme Plus " tier .
Several cable TV packages will also see prices increase , including a 5 per cent hike for basic cable services to $ 29.99 per month .
Prices for Rogers home phone , raised last year through a 30 per cent increase to a " system access " fee charged to subscribers , will remain unchanged .
The latest increases are necessary to " ensure continued investment in our network and programming " and to address " increased costs like those from programming providers , " Rogers spokesperson Nancy Cottenden said .
The changes come as Rogers feels the impact of a slowing Ontario economy on its Internet and home phone businesses .
Rogers added just 40,000 new home phone customers in the fourth quarter compared with 65,000 net additions in the same period last year .
Executives blamed a slowing economy and increased efforts by Bell Canada Inc. to win back customers with special promotions and competitive rates .
Nadir Mohamed , chief operating officer of Rogers ' communications division and a leading candidate to replace the late Ted Rogers as the company 's chief executive , said sales were also affected by a slowdown in Ontario 's housing sector .
" Consumers are generally much more cautious , " Mohamed told analysts during a conference call yesterday .
" People are moving residences less and those are important sales points for us . "
Rogers posted a fourth - quarter loss of $ 138 million , or 22 cents a share , on revenue of $ 2.9 billion .
That included a $ 294 million charge related to the company 's conventional television business , which has been hurt by steep declines in spending by advertisers .
By contrast , Rogers earned $ 254 million , or 40 cents a share , in the year - earlier period when sales totalled $ 2.7 billion .
Rogers nevertheless increased its annual dividend yesterday to $ 1.16 from $ 1 .
Rogers ' key wireless business , which accounts for more than half the company 's revenue , added 199,000 new subscribers in the fourth quarter .
The average cost of a postpaid user 's monthly bill grew just 2 per cent to $ 74.71 , driven mainly by a 36 per cent jump in network data revenue , Rogers said .
But operating costs were also higher in the wireless division as the company sold a greater proportion of high - end smartphones such as Apple Inc. 's iPhone and Research In Motion Ltd. 's various BlackBerry models .
The devices carry a higher upfront cost for Rogers , which subsidizes the purchase price and attempts to recoup its money through three - year subscriber contracts .
Greg MacDonald , an analyst at National Bank Financial , said in a note to clients he expects average bills to grow 5 per cent .
Investors also appear concerned that Rogers ' smartphone strategy – it sold about 400,000 iPhones and BlackBerrys in the quarter – may not be as profitable as the company has suggested .
Rogers shares fell nearly 8 per cent , or $ 2.65 , to close at $ 31.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
Taking place on the 4th - 11th day of the first Tibetan Lunar month , Monlam , the Great Prayer Festival , is one of the most important festivals in Tibetan Buddhism .
Pictures of this year 's festival display the spectacular processions and colourful outfits of Tibet 's Buddhist monks .
The Monlam festival was established in 1409 by Tsong Khapa , founder of the Geluk ( Yellow Hat ) tradition and is considered the greatest religious festival in Tibetan Buddhism , with performances of masked dancers , known as Cham , always attracting large crowds .
It is said to commemorate the Buddha 's spiritual victory over the forces of ignorance , anger and greed , and his attainment of enlightenment .
Pilgrims from all over Tibet take part in the festivities , which includes prayers and teachings , at monasteries throughout the region .
The festival was banned by China 's Communist authorities during the Cultural Revolution , though it has continued to be revived and celebrated .
Reports this year have suggested further threats from Chinese authorities warning Tibetan Buddhists against taking part in the annual prayer at the Labrang monastery .
$ 550 Billion Electronic Run On U.S. Banks Nearly Triggered Financial Collapse
At 2 minutes , 20 seconds into this C - Span video clip , Rep. Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania explains how the Federal Reserve told Congress members about a " tremendous draw - down of money market accounts in the United States , to the tune of $ 550 billion dollars . "
According to Kanjorski , this electronic transfer occurred over the period of an hour and threatened a further $ 5 trillion to be drawn out triggering a total collapse of the Financial System , which prompted Hank Paulson 's emergency $ 700 billion TARP bailout action .

A former interior minister , Aftab Ahmad Sherpao , told the parliamentary committee on national security this month that Shariah ordinances should be introduced to “ calm the situation . ”
Sherry Rehman , the government information minister , said the deal should not be seen as a concession .
“ It is in no way a sign of the state ’s weakness , ” she said .
“ The public will of the population of the Swat region is at the center of all efforts , and it should be taken into account while debating the merits of this agreement . ”
In legislative elections a year ago , the people of Swat , a region that is about the size of Delaware and has 1.3 million residents , voted overwhelmingly for the secular Awami National Party .
Since then , the Taliban have singled out elected politicians with suicide bomb attacks and chased virtually all of them from the valley .
Several hundred thousand residents have also fled the fighting .
Many of the poor who have stayed in Swat , which until the late 1960s was ruled by a prince , were calling for the Shariah courts as a way of achieving quick justice and dispensing with the long delays and corruption of the civil courts .
The authorities in the North - West Frontier Province , which includes Swat , argued that the Shariah courts were not the same as strict Islamic law .
The new laws , for instance , would not ban education of females or impose other strict tenets espoused by the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
The new accord , they said , would simply activate laws already agreed to by Benazir Bhutto in the early 1990s when she was prime minister .
Similarly , the principle of Shariah courts in Swat was also agreed to by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999 .
In both cases , the courts , though approved , were never put in place .
A Pakistani official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official did not have permission to speak publicly , said that the government ’s acceptance of the courts was an attempt to blunt efforts of the Taliban to woo Swat residents frustrated by the ineffective judiciary .
“ The Taliban was trying to take advantage of the local movement and desire for a judicial system , ” the official said .
The official insisted that the Obama administration , informed of the accord , “ showed understanding of our strategy . ”
It has become somewhat common to read stories or see surveys about the fact that the United States ' ranking in scientific and mathematical competency is lower than we would like it to be , or about how the nation 's research output is declining .
But what is less often discussed are the underlying causes of these trends , and what may be done to address them .
One simple solution is to throw more money at the problem , but whether this would result in any improvement proportional to the money spent has yet to be determined .
The underlying assumption behind the money - throwing approach is that if kids learn more science and math , things would trickle down through time .
When they grow up , they would become part of a more competent , scientifically literate populace that would have more scientists and engineers .
The more people doing innovative research , the better for the economy , our country , and the world at large .
A new survey suggests that there may be a much simpler alternative to simply throwing money at the problem .
Instead of — or in addition to — just upping funding , the survey discovered that encouraging working scientists and engineers to go out and meet with young people can result in a positive change .
The survey , conducted by the Lemelson - MIT Program , revealed that teens in America have an interest in science , engineering , and mathematics , but a lack of understanding about career paths in these fields is holding them back .
The survey also suggests that this lack of knowledge could be easily fixed if those of us who currently enjoy a career in such fields would step up and get out .
In fact , almost two - thirds of teen respondents to the survey said that the lack of a mentor would discourage them from entering a science or engineering career .
The interest is there
The 2009 Lemelson - MIT Innovation Index ( LMII ) found that " an overwhelming majority of teenagers surveyed expressed interest in science , technology , engineering and mathematics with ' curiosity about the way things work ' as the driving factor for their interest . "
Of course , " overwhelming " is a useless PR word and has little scientific value , so let 's put a number behind it : a full 85 percent of the teens surveyed showed interest in STEM fields .
In addition to merely showing interest , 80 percent of those surveyed felt that their schools had sufficiently prepared them — or was in the process of preparing them — for such a career choice .
What is it about these fields that capture the interest of the young ?
While these careers pay well , by and large , they wo n't make someone immeasurably rich .
( You will rarely , if ever , see scientists or engineers rollin ' in a Bently Continental GT Coupe or Aston Martin DB9 while sipping Cristal . )
More than half of the respondents reported altruistic reasons for their interest in STEM ; 30 percent wanted to help the environment , while another 26 percent wanted to improve society .
Less than one - fifth of the respondents cited money or fame as a motivating factor .
The LMII also tried to get a sense of how teens view people in these careers .
As an engineer , I could personally be described by the adjective that would first come to the mind of many when they think of the typical engineer : nerdy .
Indeed , when I was in graduate school , my wife taught pre-school ; she once told me about how she and her co-teacher asked the kids what a scientist looks like .
The response from the pre-schoolers was along the lines of " someone who wears glasses and is kind of dorky . "
But it seems that with a little more perspective on the world , teens have a different view of those in STEM fields .
Only five percent of respondents selected " nerdy " as the best - fitting description of scientists , engineers , and mathematicians .
The majority ( 55 percent ) described them as " intelligent , " with 25 percent of the other respondents choosing " successful " as the best descriptor .
So with all the positive attitudes , why are n't these young , interested parties flooding the engineering and science halls of academia across the country ?
The LMII found that nearly two - thirds ( 59 percent ) of the interested respondents — despite feeling prepared — felt discouraged from pursuing a STEM field career because they do n't know anyone who works in the field , or they do n't know what these people do .
Clearly , young people are interested in STEM careers , but they want to hear from some sort of mentor .
All it takes is you
Students deciding on a path of study can read all the college brochures and talk to professors all day long , but this wo n't really give them an idea of what truly happens in various fields .
It might give some insight into the academic side of STEM , but it wo n't give them access to the real - world , hands - on experience that those of us working in these fields go through every day .
The real solution is for people in STEM fields to make themselves available to talk with interested young people .
Meeting a person who works in a given field is not terribly difficult — any local community college has someone in any number of STEM fields on staff — but actually knowing what kind of work is done in a given area of study is a bit more of an overwhelming task .
Speaking as a chemical engineer , I can honestly say that most people have no clue what a chemical engineer does , and they can't give a concise description of what the field even is .
( The lack of knowledge of what goes on in STEM fields , engineering in particular , is something I have covered in the past . )
At last year 's AAAS meeting I attended a lecture series about marketing engineering where various people spoke about different initiatives and efforts that would allow engineering — specifically the four engineering societies ( Chemical , Civil , Mechanical , and Electrical ) — to educate the public about what engineers do .
To overcome this dearth of knowledge , the group produced the slogan " Engineers make a world of difference . "
Whether that slogan alone will incite people to flock to engineering careers is open to debate , but the entire premise behind the drive highlights the fact that , for the most part , what people in STEM fields do is not always clear to outsiders .
Many of us in STEM fields often do n't know what 's involved in bringing science to young people , so to help out in this regard I have been in contact with a variety of programs that do science outreach with a focus on various fields .
At the end of this article , I 'll list contact information for each of the groups discussed , so that if one of them seems up your alley , you can let them know you want to help out .
It should come as no surprise that we at Nobel Intent are big supporters of outreach programs , and many of us have participated in them personally throughout the years .
I first did this formally while an undergraduate at the University of Delaware .
Police have said a decision to use a Taser gun to control an 89 - year - old man was necessary as he was threatening to cut his throat with a piece of glass .
Officers from the North Wales force said the incident happened after the man had absconded from a care home .
It was decided the use of a 50,000 volt stun gun was the " most appropriate " option to protect him during the incident at Llandudno , Conwy .
The man was taken to hospital where he was treated for minor glass injuries .
A spokeswoman for the force said the incident happened at 0630 GMT on Saturday after police received a report " expressing concern for the safety of an elderly man who had absconded from a care home in Llandudno " .
Police later found the man , who has not been named , in Abbey Road , Llandudno , where he was threatening to cut his own throat with a piece of glass , she said .
" He was believed to be suicidal , " the spokeswoman said .
' Diabolical way '
" In all the circumstances the specially trained officers made the judgement , in order to protect the life of the man , that the use of Taser was the safest and most appropriate option .
" This was successfully done and the man was taken to Llandudno Hospital to be treated for minor glass injuries , " she added .
The man was later transferred to the care Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor .
His sister said she was lodging a complaint because she thought it was a " diabolical way to treat an old man " .
His nephew , an engineer , said he had gone into a care home about three weeks ago and had walked out within a few days and again on Saturday .
Excruciating pain
He said his uncle had been fit until about a year ago , but then had deteriorated and found it difficult to cope .
However , he was now recovering well in hospital .
He said his uncle , who is unmarried , could recall the excruciating pain of the Taser and had said he had been very frightened .
The family felt the police should have tried other methods and considered it a miracle he did not have a heart attack on the spot , he added .

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Israeli intelligence – Mossad – have infiltrated Muslim organizations like Hamas in Palestine , Hizbullah in Lebanon and the Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) in Indonesia , says an Indonesian intelligence expert .
“ It is clear that the CIA and the Mossad have infiltrated such organizations and have done much more than that , ” Sayed Abdullah , who operates an intelligence services firm in the Indonesian island of Maluku ’s , told IslamOnline .net .
He asserted that the spy agencies “ demonstrated their capacity to control these organizations with the murdering of two Hamas leaders in a month and that is enough to understand what they are up to . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Abdelaziz Rantissi , Hamas new leader in the Gaza Strip , was assassinated late Saturday , April 17 , in an Israeli air strike .
This came less than a month after an Israeli strike helicopter fired three missiles at 67 - year - old wheelchair - bound Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin after performing the dawn prayers in a mosque near his home , killing him and at least eight others .
“ It is obvious the CIA and the Mossad , assisted by the Australian Special Action Police ( SAP ) and the M15 of England , are all working towards undermining Muslim organizations in an attempt to weaken the Muslims globally , ” he charged .
Sayed said that the assassination of Rantissi was planned and done with the intent to hurt the Palestinian resistance movement and the Palestinians .
He asserted that the Israelis would not have carried out such an act if they were not certain of the aftermath of this attack .
“ They know , for a certain reason , that they have control of the Hamas now and they are now forcing the organization underground which will eventually make it difficult for the Hamas to press on with Intifada .
“ The Hamas leaders must come to accept the fact that however sophisticated the weaponry , the enemy needs moles , spies from within the organization to undermine it and they can also rest assured that the enemy knows who the Hamas leader in Gaza is at this moment , ” he said .
Several Hamas leaders have vehemently repudiated claims that the resistance movement has been successfully penetrated by the Israeli enemy .
They admitted , however , that Israeli moles remain a cancer eating away at the Palestinian body .
“ It is difficult to believe but this is how it works for the enemies of the Muslims in Palestine and elsewhere .
Their intelligence is working day and night to break down any resistance groups around the world , including those in Palestine and indeed in other Muslim countries too , ” opined the Indonesian expert .

Amy Winehouse Robbed
seemingly can't escape drama in her life .
The troubled songstress , who is currently vacationing in St. Lucia , was robbed early Thursday morning .
Burglars busted down the door of Winehouse 's north London apartment and made off with recording equipment and several valuable guitars before police were alerted by a neighbor around 4:00 a.m .
According to her rep , " Amy is upset , of course .
But everything can be replaced . "
" From her point of view , her favorite guitar is with her in St. Lucia .
It was a special present , given her by Universal for winning the Grammy awards last year , " he said .
No arrests have been made .
Winehouse , who has been on an extended vacation on the Caribbean island , reportedly saved a woman from drowning last week , and earlier this month declared that she will not allow incarcerated husband Blake Fielder - Civil to divorce her .
Many parents and legislators view the popular psychedelic Salvia divinorum as a public health menace .
But the drug has an unlikely set of supporters : scientists .
Many medical researchers view the plant as a potential medical marvel .
They believe that rigorous scientific study of salvia could lead to medical breakthroughs yielding new treatments for addiction , depression , cancer , and even HIV .
If lawmakers criminalize salvia at the state or federal level , the ban could cripple salvia research in this country before it has a chance to make any headway , says Dr. John Mendelson , a pharmacologist .
With federal financing , Mendelson is studying the impact of salvia on humans at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute .
At this writing , salvia is legal to buy , sell , and use in most parts of the United States .
However , 13 states have adopted legislation banning or otherwise regulating its use ; and legislators in a number of other states , as well as federal officials , are considering regulating the drug .
" Salvia is a totally unique compound , unlike opioids and other hallucinogens , " Mendelson says .
" We 've never seen anything like it before . "
Even ten years ago , scientists had paid little attention to salvia .
That changed when researchers isolated the active compound in salvia and discovered that it was an extremely powerful short - acting hallucinogen with no known side effects or addictive properties , Mendelson says .
In addition , salvia differs from other psychoactive substances in interacting with specific receptors in the brain that the other drugs do n't affect .
This unique physiological reaction makes salvia attractive to researchers .
Mendelson says that salvia research could lead to drugs that activate the specific brain receptors engaged by the substance , and block pain without risk of addiction .
( Little is currently known about these particular receptors . )
Salvia might even help unlock mysteries related to Alzheimer 's disease and schizophrenia .
" We have been watching with interest and concern the moving drumbeat toward regulations , " says Dr. Roland Griffiths , professor of behavioral biology in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .
Griffiths says that criminalizing salvia could hurt research by forcing research labs to follow burdensome regulations similar to those associated with handling cocaine , heroin , and other controlled substances .
" We would anticipate that if salvia were scheduled it would increase research costs and place undue red tape on the drug , and delay research , " says Griffiths , who is applying for a research grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the effects of salvia on humans .
Other proposals by medical researchers seeking NIH funding would study salvia in connection with drug dependency , HIV , hepatitis B and C , and depression .
Scientists concede that they face an uphill battle in attempting to change attitudes and reverse the trend among states toward creating laws against salvia .
At this writing , 13 states already have such laws on the books : Of those 13 , 10 ( Delaware , Florida , Illinois , Kansas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Missouri , North Dakota , Oklahoma , and Virgina ) classify salvia as a Schedule I drug ( putting it on the same legal footing as ecstasy and LSD ) .
In Tennessee , ingesting salvia is a Class A misdemeanor , but possessing the herb is legal .
In California and Maine , possession is legal but sale to a minor is prohibited .
Legislation to criminalize salvia is pending in at least 13 more states .
For example , an Iowa bill would make salvia possession a felony , while a bill introduced in Massachusetts would make such possession a misdemeanor .
Griffiths and other researchers are even more concerned about what federal officials may do .
“ A move by the DEA to put salvia on the controlled substances list could be a real possibility , ” Griffiths says .
Asked for comment , DEA officials would say only that they are in the process of evaluating salvia .

The n-bodies problem
There ’s been some activity in the #haskell IRC channel recently towards coming up with a better solution to the n-bodies problem .
In this problem , you ’re given a set of bodies , and are asked to simulate Newtonian gravity on them .
Most of the solutions I ’ve seen go past have involved some sort of crazy state monad based stuff , reading from and writing to STUArrays and other imperative ideas .
So , I thought I ’d try and solve the problem using a pure functional style instead .
Reactive
I ’ve recently been playing with Reactive a lot , initially for my work , but also just because it ’s so damned cool .
Reactive is a library for Haskell that lets you describe time varying values in a purely functional way .
That is , out goes the concept of state , and in comes the concept of describing exactly what is going on .
Back to n-bodies
In order to simulate newtonian physics , we need the bodies ’ mass , the positions of the bodies , and the velocities of the bodies :
data Body = Body { mass :: Double , position :: Point3 Double , velocity :: Vector3 Double }
That was pretty straight forward , lets get down to the core of the problem – simulating gravity :
accelBetween :: Body -> Body -> Vector3 Double accelBetween p1 p2 = ( mass p2 *^ vecBetween ) / ( ( mag vecBetween ) ^ 3 ) where vecBetween = position p2 ^-^ position p1 computeAccels :: Body -> [ Body ] ->
Vector3 Double computeAccels p = sum . map ( accelBetween p )
Well , that was surprisingly easy !
The accelBetween function describes the newtonian gravity equation just as the maths does , and summing up the acceleration due to all the other planets in the system is fairly straightforward .
What we ’ve not seen yet though , is any of that lovely functional reactive programming I was talking about .
We know now how to compute the acceleration affecting any one body at any one time , but what we want to know is the acceleration affecting a body at * any * time .
To do this , we ’re going to need to move from doing computations on Body s , to instead doing computation on Behavior s of Body s .
bodyAccels :: [ Behaviour Body ] -> [ Behaviour ( Vector3 Double ) ] bodyAccels ps = withOthers ( lift A2 computeAccels ) ps withOthers :: ( a -> [ a ] -> b ) -> [ a ] -> [ b ] withOthers f xs = withOthers ' f [ ] xs where withOthers ' _ _ [ ] = [ ] withOthers ' f os ( x : xs ) = f x ( os ++ xs ) : withOthers ' f ( x : os ) xs
The withOthers function here is just like map , but it passes in all the other values in the list in a second argument to the function .
So then , bodyAccels computes a continuous acceleration function for all the bodies in the system .
For each body , it runs the computeAccels function , giving it all other bodies in the system as its second argument .
Crucially , lift A2 allows us to do this in the Behavior Applicative , so we are no longer computing it on rigid , static bodies , but instead , on all the positions and velocities the bodies in the system will ever have ( is n’t lazyness great ! ) .
Finally , we can get from these accelerations down to the velocities , and then positions of the bodies using integration on the acceleration :
bodyVel :: Body ->
Behaviour ( Vector3 Double ) ->
Behaviour ( Vector3 Double ) bodyVel p acc = ( velocity p ^+^ ) < $> integral dt acc
I ’m sure you can imagine what the body Pos function looks like .
You may wonder what the dt in here is talking about .
This is an unfortunate effect of not being able to mathematically integrate arbitrary functions .
Instead , we must use euler integration , and that requires us to provide times at which to take samples .
The dt argument is an event which ticks reasonably fast , and progresses our simulation :
dt :: Event ( ) dt = atTimes [ 0 , 0.01 .. ]
So , now we are able to combine all our efforts together , and solve the whole n-bodies problem :
nbodies :: [ Body ] -> [ Behaviour Body ] nbodies ps = pbs where pbs = Body < $> ( mass < $> ps ) <*> pps <*> pvs pps = zipWith bodyPos ps pvs pvs = zipWith bodyVel ps pas pas = bodyAccels pbs
Conclusions
A lot of assumptions are made about how we must write programs .
Often , even beautiful mathematical problems end up described as horrible state - full masses of code that obscure what it is we ’re trying to compute .
I ’ve presented a solution to the n-bodies problem using the Reactive library to get a handle on time in a purely functional setting , it turned out that this was rather beautiful !
Full code for my solution can be found below .
module NBodies ( Body ( .. ) , nbodies ) where import Control .
Applicative import Data.VectorSpace import Data .
AffineSpace import FRP .
Reactive import Graphics .
FieldTrip data Body = Body { mass :: Double , position :: Point3 Double , velocity :: Vector3 Double } nbodies :: [ Body ] -> [ Behaviour Body ] nbodies ps = pbs where pbs = Body < $> ( mass < $> ps ) <*> pps <*> pvs pps = zipWith bodyPos ps pvs pvs = zipWith bodyVel ps pas pas = bodyAccels pbs accelBetween :: Body -> Body -> Vector3 Double accelBetween p1 p2 = ( mass p2 *^ vecBetween ) / ( ( mag vecBetween ) ^ 3 ) where vecBetween = position p2 ^-^ position p1 computeAccels :: Body -> [ Body ] ->
Vector3 Double computeAccels p = sum . map ( accelBetween p ) bodyAccels :: [ Behaviour Body ] -> [ Behaviour ( Vector3 Double ) ] bodyAccels ps = withOthers ( lift A2 computeAccels ) ps withOthers :: ( a -> [ a ] -> b ) -> [ a ] -> [ b ] withOthers f xs = withOthers ' f [ ] xs where withOthers ' _ _ [ ] = [ ] withOthers ' f os ( x : xs ) = f x ( os ++ xs ) : withOthers ' f ( x : os ) xs bodyVel :: Body ->
Behaviour ( Vector3 Double ) ->
Behaviour ( Vector3 Double ) bodyVel p acc = ( velocity p ^+^ ) < $> integral dt acc bodyPos :: Body ->
Behaviour ( Vector3 Double ) ->
Behaviour ( Point3 Double ) bodyPos p vel = ( position p .+^ ) < $> integral dt vel dt :: Event ( ) dt = atTimes [ 0 , 0.01 .. ]

With the return of Sen. Red Kennedy to the Hill today , we are reminded that healthcare reform will be not only a prominent issue , but also it could be the biggest challenge that President Obama will face .
Here are some of the pitfalls , and possibilities for healthcare reform .
“ I am very hopeful that this will be a prime item on the agenda .
Barack has indicated that this will be a prime issue , and I believe that it will be .
There are some major issues , obviously with the economy , and also environmental issues , but the president elect has indicated that this is going to be a priority and I certainly hope it will .
We ’ve got a good team .
They have been working over the period of the late summer into the fall , and they ’ve been doing a lot of good work , and I think we ’ve got a good start on it , ” Kennedy said .
The big news is that Sen .
Kennedy said that Obama has stated that he wants to sign a healthcare reform bill by early next year .
If this is the case , then Congress will need to have a bill ready by summer at the latest .
The minefield of healthcare reform derailed the Clinton presidency early in his first term , so the question Obama faces is how can deliver on his promise of healthcare reform , while breaking the congressional gridlock on this issue .
Advertisements
The biggest change working in Obama ’s favor is that the national attitude on healthcare since the Clinton administration .
Americans are still greatly divided on how to improve the system , but almost everyone agrees that the system does n’t work as well as it should .
On the campaign trail , Obama made an interesting choice .
Instead of advocating for a single payer universal system , he correctly , at least in my view , assessed the problem as being one of access not care .
The Obama plan does n’t want to touch the system of medical care in our country .
It wants to get more people into the system so that they can get care .
The fact that Obama is n’t pitching government run healthcare , should melt away some of the conservative opposition .
The issue of a mandate is going to be the stumbling block in any bill .
Republicans are opposed to a mandate , and Democrats are divided on the issue .
Obama opposes a mandate .
However , I do n’t see those who favor a mandate blocking a bill that does n’t contain one .
The problems will come if congressional Democrats try to ram through legislation that contains a mandate .
I still believe that we are going to see a series of smaller bills passed before we get to the big reform .
Prescription drug costs , SCHIP expansion , and a bill allow consumers to buy their medications in Canada will all likely pass .
I think that a healthcare reform bill could pass muster will Republicans and conservative Democrats if it sticks to the market model and offers some tax cuts .
President Clinton ’s healthcare reform failed because he overreached .
Obama is an astute observer of history , so I doubt that he will repeat the mistakes of the 1990s .
The Republican civil war continues .
Very weird quote from chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele .
Mr. Steele said he is in stage two of a two - stage process to reform and transform the Republican Party .
He wo n’t reveal details , because , “ The mice who are scurrying about the Hill are upset because they no longer have access to the cheese , so they do n’t know what ’s going on . ”
He says his process has been “ insular ” because he does n’t want people “ pontificating ” on his decisions or second - guessing them before they are made . ”
Sounds like stage two of a two - stage process to get himself fired .
While it ’s not 100 % clear who Steele is referring to , it ’s difficult to read this – in context – as anything other than a reference to his GOP critics on the Hill .
Not very smart .
A top adviser to Steele , in a Politico piece just two days ago , confirms the notion that Steele thinks a lot of Republicans are unfairly after him , which seems to be the notion behind the “ scurrying mice ” quote :
The chairman promised to clean house at the RNC if he won .
He did , and he did .
This has led to some serious griping inside the Beltway .
Many were lying in wait , hoping he would stumble , so they could pounce .
He did , and they did … .
Change is never easy , of course , and many feel threatened by it .
Steele ’s election as chairman of the Republican Party was a shock to the system for many of the Republican ruling class , the old guard in Washington .
Over the past week , countless anonymous sources have brought out the long knives .
Indeed , over the past week , the empire has struck back .
Did Michael
Steele just attack congressional Republicans one week after he narrowly survived a dust - up with Rush Limbaugh ?
The man seems to have a political death wish .
We ’ll see if he survives this one .

SPIEGEL ONLINE Interview with Alice Waters ' Most of What We Eat Is not Real Food '
Legendary California chef Alice Waters , who is a jury member at this year 's Berlin International Film Festival , talks to SPIEGEL ONLINE about why we need to change the way we eat , Obama 's support for the food movement and how to forage in Switzerland in the winter .
From the day President Bush took office , the long knives were out for him - in ways they will not ( and should not ) be out for President - elect Barack Obama .
The chattering class saw Dubya as a walking style crime in a cowboy suit .
They hit Bush for everything - for the way he mangled syntax , for the books he read , because he worked out too much .
Note now that the buff Obama is taking office , stories gushing about Obama 's daily workouts flood the channels .
Oh , yes , and the same people who belittled Bush for sending troops to war even though he only served in the National Guard somehow do not seem to notice Obama 's utter lack of military experience .
To trash Bush was to belong .
There was little upside in supporting Bush , even if you had supported his agenda .
Most of the Democratic candidates for president in 2004 and 2008 voted for the Patriot Act - and then campaigned against it .
They voted for the resolution authorizing U.S. military force in Iraq - then bolted from the war itself .
Likewise with No Child Left Behind .
Somehow Bush was the guy who looked bad as he withstood the heat , while his caving critics preened .
When the Dems were pushing for a humiliating retreat from Iraq and opinion polls supported troop withdrawal , Bush instead pushed for a troop surge that has made all the difference .
Vice President - elect Joe Biden - who voted for the war before he was against it - visited Iraq last week .
While there , he promised the Iraqis that America would not withdraw troops in a way that undermines Iraqi security .
Yet that was exactly what his party advocated a year ago .
Does Bush get any credit ?
No , just as he has received little credit for efforts that have prolonged millions of lives , thanks to the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief .
Forget considerable goodwill in India and Africa .
His good deeds , you see , do n't fit with the prescribed story line that , with Bush in charge , the rest of the world hates us .
Yes , the man also stumbled , and others paid for his mistakes more dearly than he has .
Under Bush 's watch , Osama bin Laden evaded capture .
Worse , Bush 's slowness in changing strategies in Iraq suggested a presidency in a fetal position when Bush should have been managing the store and demanding results .
Weapons of mass destruction ?
The CIA believed Saddam Hussein had them .
So did Hussein 's lieutenants .
I did , too .
The conventional wisdom was wrong , but Bush can take comfort in the knowledge that without his efforts , Hussein almost certainly would have outlasted U.N. sanctions , armed himself to the hilt and wreaked unknown havoc in and beyond Iraq .
There is no comfort - there is no upside - to be had in the $ 810 billion Bush bailout .
The Bush administration should have been on alert to contain the damage from the housing - price drop and mortgage foreclosures ; instead , it allowed the credit crunch to reach a tipping point and roll over the U.S. economy .
It was so avoidable .
It was like the Katrina trailers all over again - except this preventable and unnatural disaster left toxic trailers strewn across America .
There 's an out - to - lunch sloppiness to the whole mess .
It feels as if the barrage of criticism made the Bush engine seize up and stop running the business of the nation .
America 's first MBA president turned out to be a poor administrator , more interested in ideas than making the machinery work .
He was good at fighting - and winning - ideological battles in Congress , but he never demonstrated a commitment to making his own administration deliver as promised .
In putting loyalty at a premium , he overlooked incompetence .
How will history judge Bush ?
Osama bin Laden once told Time magazine that the U.S. withdrawal from Somalia after the murder of 18 U.S. troops on a humanitarian mission made him realize " more than before that the American soldier was a paper tiger and after a few blows ran in defeat . "
Members of al Qaeda have told intelligence officials that they never thought that Washington would respond to the 9/11 attacks as ferociously as Bush responded .
They expected a few bombs to be dropped , no boots on the ground , a swift withdrawal if casualties mounted - the usual short - attention span foreign policy that warped Lebanon , the Persian Gulf War , Somalia , the African embassy bombings and the attack on the destroyer Cole .
Bush showed America 's enemies a country that does not retreat in fear , does not bomb with impunity , and most important , does not desert civilians or foreign governments that trust us .
If you think that does n't matter , look at Libya , which disarmed its weapons program .
And see how much easier Obama 's presidency will be , because Bush kept the faith .
Osama bin Laden may live , most likely quivering in a cave .
But no one thinks America is a paper tiger anymore .
AUSTIN , Texas , March 24 ( UPI ) -- Social networking
Web site Twitter has shut down an account that falsely claimed to be affiliated with the police department of Austin , Texas .
The " AustinPD " page , which was created in 2008 , had featured the official City of Austin seal and published comments pretended to be from real Austin police officers , the Austin American - Statesman reported Tuesday .

" Although some may dismiss the site as a simple prank or minor irritant , the fact is that the information presented was false and misleading and could lead to unwarranted concern by the public , " Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said Monday .
The page , which had about 450 followers , now states that it " has been suspended due to strange activity . "
Anne Morgan , Austin 's chief of litigation , said officials learned about the page about a week and a half ago and immediately lobbied Twitter to have it taken down .
" What we really wanted was for Twitter to take the page down and educate people that it was n't a police department site , " Morgan said .
" We did n't want people thinking police officers were making those comments . "
A group of researchers using sonar to find shipwrecks on the bottom of Lake Michigan have found something far older than crashed cargo ships .
They believe they 've found a 10 - thousand - year - old stone structure like Stonehenge , including a rock carved with the image of a mastodon .
io9 pal Geoff Manaugh reports over at BLDG BLOG that the researchers ' report ( with cool sonar images ) was released last year to surprisingly little fanfare .

And yet the possibility of a Stonehenge - esque worship site would n't be out of place at the bottom of Lake Michigan .
The region already has its share of petroglyphs from ancient tribes and other standing stone sites .
These submerged stones could have been raised by local populations at a time when part of the lake bed was dry , in the late Ice Age .
More research is needed to determine whether these stones were arranged by humans , or merely look that way .

HIGH -TECH MARXISM COMES TO AMERICA
by Beverly Eakman
January 13 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
Deep down , most Americans once thought they were immune from blatant propaganda , government - sanctioned media-bias and psychiatric hospitals - cum - prisons — hallmarks of Adolf Hitler ’s Third Reich and Josef Stalin ’s Communism .
Such confidence is shifting as folks increasingly fear speaking their mind — on schools campuses , on the job , in houses of worship and public places .
Worse , a metastasizing mental health industry has convinced government leaders that “ nonprofessionals ” — especially parents — are unqualified to make decisions on behalf of children .
Average Americans find themselves intimidated by bureaucracies ranging from Child Protective Services to universities to the Environmental Protection Agency .
These are just three agencies steeped in a deep - rooted presumption of citizen incompetence — precisely opposite the view of American Founders like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison .
Today ’s national leaders , agency heads and mainstream reporters are mostly hostile to American idealism , Christian morality and Western culture , which have taken the hardest hits under the banner of political correctness .
TV sitcoms , women ’s magazines , and much of what passes for news daily prove that traditional notions of integrity and decency are in their death throes , while psychology ( despite its dismal track record ) is promoted as being firmly anchored in “ science , ” just as it was under Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin .
The difference today — thanks to exponential advances in computer cross-matching , identification and tracking — is that politically incorrect “ troublemakers ” can be identified and marginalized before they secure careers involving leadership , status or influence .
That , of course , is always the end - game of campaigns in political correctness .
The Forty - Five Year “ Leap Forward ” Just as in Mao Tse - tung ’s “ Great Leap Forward ” ( a.k.a. “ cultural revolution ” ) , during which millions were murdered , the current state of affairs in America did not emerge suddenly .
There were abundant warnings .
Many writers , myself included , penned well - read works signaling a multitude of subtle twists and turns which our government , together with special interests , had undertaken since World War II in pursuit of , first , a socialist America , and then a totalitarian Superstate .
For some reason , Americans resist ominous signs .
Perhaps it is because this nation was founded upon optimism , not created out of desperation .
The earliest immigrants to our shores left everything familiar to institutionalize a different sort of governing style , one in which individuals were important instead of being servants of the State .
This was a huge departure from prior ideas about the relationship of government to the governed .
Modern citizens have pretty much lost touch with the radical nature of that single step .
The “ Mouse ” That Morphed Today ’s schools , of course , barely touch on anything about the early values , philosophies or ideals that formed the “ America ” of the 17th , 18th and 19th centuries .
This is not surprising .
Every “ wannabe ” tyrant that ever existed has always tried to wipe out knowledge about a nation ’s past , or recast it to reflect “ new ” thinking .
Today ’s elites and special interests are no different — except for one thing : the computer .
Sophisticated mathematical models and data - collection techniques make it possible , with the click of a “ mouse , ” to know which people are “ buying in ” to the incessant flow of disinformation and which citizens are not .
Those who are not “ buying ” are “ resisters . ”
Those who do “ buy ” are accepted into the better colleges , obtain the influential jobs and enjoy “ status . ”
Within the space of 30 years , computer giants had perfected software and hardware packages that gave the public — and , more importantly , its overseers — “ what they wanted . ”
( For step - by - step details of data - collection and tracking , see Educating for the New World Order , 1991 and its sequel , Microchipped , 1994 , Halcyon House Publishers ) .
Meanwhile , a silent revolution was taking place in the media .
The so - called “ mainstream ” sources — and both major political parties — started engaging in turf battles , which meant , basically , ignoring any “ competitor ” who might be saying something a little different .
Nobody wanted to lose funding to somebody else .
This resulted in fewer forums for real whistleblowers , and less dissemination of ideas .
Despite the conveniences of the Internet , average people found it necessary to become proactive in obtaining their news .
They could n’t rely on any of the old standbys .
Even libraries and bookstores displayed “ preferred ” books and magazines prominently ( for money , of course ) and relegated everything else to the back wall or to “ special order . ”
Consequently , one had to know beforehand what to ask for .
Americans had to sleuth around in a way they never did previously .
Most people thought they had more pressing priorities .
Schools : The Primary Aggressor in the War Against America The National Education Association ( NEA ) became a primary aggressor in the war against parents , religion and national sovereignty during the post - war period , beginning with its landmark publication , Toward World Understanding and its co-founding of UNESCO ( the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , co-founded in 1947 with a grant from the NEA and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching ) .
Passing itself off as a “ professional teacher ’s organization , ” the NEA ’s leftist leadership lured educators by offering incentives like insurance and retirement benefits , then proceeded to create proxies to infiltrate teachers ’ colleges and dictate weird accreditation standards .
The orthodoxy of parental incompetence began pervading teacher - preparation programs .
Politicians were neutralized as they came to fear loss of NEA support more than loss of American principles .
Other institutions and corporations soon fell into step .
The new supercomputers introduced features most people had ever heard of in a pre-personal - computer world .
In 25 years , the era of psychological dossier - building was a done deed ( see Chapter 3 , “ Taking a Ride on the SPEEDE - ExPRESS , ” in my 1998 , award - winning book , Cloning of the American Mind , available from the NewsWithViews.com bookstore .
Note : Book out of print , supply is limited ) .
Analysts with concurrent degrees in psychology and statistics sealed the deal .
Advertisement Today , children are “ empowered ” — blatantly encouraged to circumvent their parents and defy traditional values .
Unfortunately , their “ empowerment ” had more to do with creating chaos and a vigorous data - collection effort than with self - determination .
Applying Marxist Terminologies to Psychological Profiling Programs
The 1995 Texas Medication Algorithm Project ( TMAP ) , inaugurated in Texas ( and funded by the leftist Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ) under then - Governor George W. Bush , morphed into a congressionally funded universal mental - health screening program and psychotropic drug - treatment plan encompassing some 25 federal agencies by 2004 .
This would enable a future administration ( incoming President Barack Obama ? ) to enforce psychological profiling ( and mandatory drugging , if “ necessary ” ) on every man , woman and toddler under an umbrella of “ security . ”
Today , TMAP goes by the Marxist - like moniker “ New Freedom Initiative ” and is linked directly to political correctness .
A quiet campaign of coercion , hidden amongst computerized records collected over two decades was launched .
Today , the Powers That Be can access and merge information about you , “ flag ” anything that might prove damaging to you down the road ( should you become a “ refusenik ” ) , while simultaneously editing out anything positive , and relegating it , in effect , to the cutting - room floor .
How would anyone know , after all ?
Among the first hints that such atrocities were under construction occurred in 1973 .
Parents in Pennsylvania got wind of intimate questions being included on a standardized achievement test .
The “ test ” supposedly required parental consent and voluntary participation , but complied with neither directive .
These parents called in the American Civil Liberties Union .
The case was settled out of court in favor of the complainants .
The Chief of Pennsylvania ’s Department of Testing was told that if he henceforth would agree to adhere to a policy of voluntary participation and provide notification , then charges would be dropped .
But a decade later , the old U.S. Office of Education took on cabinet - level status as the U.S. Department of Education .
Its state clones , called “ state education agencies , ” decided that such admonitions could be safely ignored .
An avalanche of what - would - you - do - if queries and word - association games passed off as legitimate test items were disseminated to 120,000 students in the 5th , 8th and 11th grades through Pennsylvania ’s Educational Quality Assessment ( EQA ) .
Irate parents were shuffled between the local , state and federal bureaucracies , each of which blamed the other .
When Pennsylvania ’s Division of Testing took the fall ( again ) — this time for linking curriculum directly to the tests , renamed “ assessments , ” as well as for failing to give notice — politicians dithered .
It turned out that the money trail for both the assessments and the “ remediating ” curriculums ( bearing the EQA logo right on the covers ) led back to the federal government , through salaries and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 .
The whistleblowers were already too late .
Self - Reports and Intimate Revelations Soon , copycat EQA ’s started turning up in other states , with such “ test ” questions as : I often wish I were someone else . [ or ]
I get upset easily at home . [ a ]
Very true of me , [ b ]
Mostly true of me , [ c ]
Mostly untrue of me , [ d ]
Very untrue of me .
You are asked to dinner at the home of a classmate having a religion [ or race ] different from yours .
In this situation I would feel : [ a ]
Very comfortable , [ b ]
Comfortable , [ c ]
Slightly uncomfortable , [ d ]
Very uncomfortable .
A group of people are standing on a street corner .
Some pick up rocks and start throwing them at windows .
I WOULD ALSO THROW ROCKS when I knew … [ a ] there was no chance of getting caught ; [ b ]
I agreed with what they were protesting about ; [ c ] my friends decided to throw rocks .
Individual classes were n’t immune from these computerized assessments , either .
A Nebraska Adolescent “ Health ” Survey asked high - schoolers whether they considered themselves “ religious ” and what they thought about when they thought of sex !
By May 2004 , 194 - question - long surveys like the one given to 11th - graders at the Tucson Unified School District were cropping up , featuring True - False queries like : • I consider myself outgoing and spontaneous .
• I consider myself basically quiet and shy .
• I consider myself able to persuade my peers that my opinion is correct .
• My parents feel they should make a significant contribution of time and energy to society .
• I feel individuals identified as gifted experience more problems than individuals not [ so ] identified .
Typically , there were just enough real academic questions to appear credible .
But the truth was usually found in the scoring literature — the kind of professional material that is still off - limits to laypersons .
On the EQA , it explained how points were given for a “ minimum positive attitude ” ( in the opinion of behavioral psychologists , not necessarily parents ) .
The rationale ?
Assessment creators stated they were testing not for academics , but for a student ’s “ locus of control ; ” his / her “ willingness to receive stimuli ; ” “ amenability to change ; ” and for inclination to “ conform to group goals . ”
Thus , kids were getting points for responses that showed a willingness to conform to the group — one of the New Ethics that precludes both individualism and a Christian worldview .
The implications were staggering .
Pupils were being tested on whether they would be “ team players ” instead of individual thinkers ( much less “ critical thinkers ” ) , and whether they would be acquiescent instead of principled .
Today , these kinds of “ tests ” pervade even job applications .
“ Like a Rolling Stone ” — or an Atom Bomb Eventually , test creators became so good at devising questions that the “ target subjects ” — children or adults — were generally unaware just how much they were divulging .
Surreptitious identification mechanisms improved , too : “ slugging , ” “ bar - coding , ” “ sticky - labeling , ” “ embedded identifiers . ” ( see Dec. 2008 Speech of the Month by Beverly Eakman , including PowerPoint presentation with evidence , in Vital Speeches of the Day , # 563 ) .
According to two of the premier behavioral test constructors , the late Ralph Tyler and Richard Wolf , the goal is “ to outwit the subject so that he cannot guess what information he is revealing . ”
Cecil Golden , Associate Commissioner of Education in Florida , put it to The Ledger this way in July 1972 : “ … like those assembling an atom bomb , very few of them [ software designers ] understand what they ’re building , and wo n’t until we put all the parts together . ”
Today , professional opinion molders understand it just fine , as do educational leaders and many Members of Congress .
And after the Obama Administration ?
Well , let ’s just say that America , by that time , will look a whole lot less “ like a rolling stone ” — the song that came to define the Baby Boomers ’ free - spirited rebelliousness of the 1960 ’s — and more like “ the atom bomb ” of Cecil Golden ’s prophetic nightmare .
That ’s “ change ” you can bank on !

ATHENS ( AP )  Rioters rampaged through Athens and the northern city of Thessaloniki Sunday , hurling Molotov cocktails , burning stores and blocking city streets with flaming barricades after protests against the fatal police shooting of a teenager erupted into chaos .
Youths wearing hoods smashed storefronts and cars in Athens .
Riot police responded with tear gas while the fire department rushed to extinguish blazes .
Several bank branches , stores and at least one building were on fire on a major street leading to the capital 's police headquarters .
Clashes also broke out near Parliament .
Streets quickly emptied as word of the violence spread .
Local media reported several people sought treatment for breathing problems .
Violence often breaks out during demonstrations in Greece between riot police and anarchists , who attack banks , high - end shops , diplomatic vehicles and foreign car dealerships in late - night fire - bombings that rarely cause injuries .
Some believe the anarchist movement has its roots in the resistance to the military dictatorship that ruled Greece from 1967 - 74 .
The anarchists often take refuge inside university buildings or campuses , where police are barred under Greek law .
The shooting of the 16 - year - old boy that set off the first riots took place Saturday night in Exarchia , a downtown Athens district of bars , music clubs and restaurants that is seen as the anarchists ' home base .
The circumstances surrounding the shooting were initially unclear .
Police said the two officers involved claimed they were attacked by a group of youths , and that three gunshots and a stun grenade were fired in response .
Youths burning shops , set up flaming barricades and torched cars in cities around the country overnight .
At dawn crews cleaned up streets littered with the burned debris of businesses and cars .
Tear gas hung in the air .
Sunday 's riots broke out during demonstrations moving toward the police headquarters in Thessaloniki and Athens .
Protesters in the northern city attacked City Hall , two police precincts , several shops and a bank , as well as vans and cars belonging to several Greek television channels .
In Athens , violence broke out as more than two thousand protesters marched to the police headquarters .
Youths fought with riot police for about two hours before groups split off into different parts of the city .
More violence was reported in Exarchia .
Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos promised there would be a thorough investigation into the teenager 's death and pledged to punish anyone found responsible .
" It is inconceivable for there not to be punishment when a person loses their life , particularly when it is a child , " Pavlopoulos said .
" The taking of life is something that is not excusable in a democracy . "
He and Deputy Minister Panagiotis Chinofotis submitted their resignations , which were not accepted by the prime minister .
The two officers involved in the shooting have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation , as has the police chief in the Exarchia precinct .
Police said the Saturday night riots left 24 policemen injured , with one remaining hospitalized Sunday morning .
Rioters damaged or burned 31 stores , nine bank branches and 25 cars , including six police cars , police said in a statement .
Six people were arrested , five of them for theft from damaged stores and one for carrying a weapon , it said .
Full details for damage from Sunday afternoon 's riots were not immediately available .

Lowered from a helicopter near Dong Hoi , North Vietnam , Air Force pararescueman Duane Hackney of Flint grabbed a downed pilot .
Just as the two reached the door , the helicopter caught fire from an enemy round .
Hackney removed his parachute , put it on the wounded pilot and pushed him out of the chopper .
The airman lunged for a spare parachute just as the aircraft exploded .
The chute barely had time to open before Hackney hit trees , then dropped another 80 feet and landed on a crevasse ledge .
It was Feb. 6 , 1967 .
Hackney was 19 years old .
By the time he retired as a chief master sergeant in 1991 , he had flown more than 200 combat missions and received more than 70 medals and awards , becoming the most decorated enlisted man in Air Force history .
Now the Beecher High School graduate , who died in 1993 at age 46 , is about to receive another honor : induction into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame .
Did you know ?
In addition to the late U.S. Air Force Pararescueman Duane Hackney , the Flint area has had its share of noteable aviation connections .
Here are a few :
• The Flint Aviation Co. built about a dozen aircraft here from 1917 - 19 .
Flint Aviation 's Sidney S. Stewart ( a driving force behind the creation of Bishop Airport ) and World War I aviator Lt. John L. Hunt later built a twin - engine plane here , first flown in 1930 , but could n't market it successfully as three - engine airplanes took over .
• In 1927 , young Flint schoolteacher Mildred Doran was one of 10 fliers to die during a California - to - Honolulu airplane race -- a trek that would have made her the first woman to cross the Pacific in a plane .
Doran was lost at sea along with pilot Augie Pedlar , who taught flying in Flint , and their navigator .
Doran Tower , an unusual , windmill - shaped building raised in her memory near a small airfield in Grand Blanc Township , was razed in 1973 .
• Trans-Atlantic solo flier Charles Lindbergh flew his " Spirit of St. Louis " over Flint in 1927 .
In an early celebrity product endorsement , Lindbergh also lent his fame to promote Flint - made AC spark plugs .
• Clarence " Kelly " Johnson , a 1928 Flint Central High School graduate who died in 1991 , helped design the top - secret U - 2 and SR - 71 Blackbird spy planes for the U.S. military .
When he retired in 1974 , Lockheed Corp. said Johnson had worked on more than 40 aircraft , more than half of which were his original designs .
• At least two U.S. astronauts have local roots : Mike Bloomfield , a Lake Fenton graduate ; and Donald R. McMonagle , a Hamady High School graduate .
Both Air Force veterans flew space shuttle missions .
Source : Flint Journal archives
He will join Charles Lindbergh , Iven Kincheloe and other aviators and astronauts with Michigan roots in the hall , at the Air Zoo museum in Portage near Kalamazoo .
" Duane Hackney was a go - getter , " said Dan Hamill , a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who participated in a search and rescue exercise under Hackney 's leadership .
" You could tell this was a guy who does n't sit around .
He 's deserving of any recognition . "
Past honors include the Air Force Cross , Silver Star , Purple Heart and four Distinguished Flying Crosses .
Two years ago , Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio named its training facility the Hackney Training Complex .
Hackney 's story is featured in Air Force training manuals .
He has a permanent display at the Military and Space Museum in Frankenmuth and his own lengthy Wikipedia entry .
What would he think about enshrinement in the Hall of Fame ?
" Duane was very humble , " said his widow , Carole Hackney Bergstrom of Williamsport , Pa .
" He never understood what all the fuss was about .
His attitude was , that was his job . "
Embraced as a hero upon his return from Vietnam in 1967 , Hollywood gave him the star treatment .
Hackney had a speaking part on an episode of " I Dream of Jeannie " and an interview on " The Ed Sullivan Show . "
He also did a round of talk shows , including " The Tonight Show " and " The Joey Bishop Show . "
Hackney even appeared as a bachelor on " The Dating Game . "
In 1967 , Gen. Howell M. Estes Jr. sent a private plane to Bishop International Airport and flew the entire Hackney family to Washington , D.C.
The occasion was a ceremony to give Hackney the Cheney Award , said a sister , Janice Hackney of Grand Blanc Township .
" I remember we had a private dinner at the Pentagon , " said Hackney , then a teenager .
" We were very proud of him , but we were also very fearful for his life . "
Duane Hackney accepted the accolades showered on him grudgingly , said his twin sister , Dianne Elford of Wesley Chapel , Fla .
" He told me , ' The real heroes are the ones who died for our country -- not me , ' " she said .
Growing up in Flint , Hackney was an outdoorsman who enjoyed fishing , hiking and canoeing , Elford said .
He was a fun-loving guy who liked to play and tease -- especially Elford , though he was also protective of both sisters .
Without a lot of money for college , Hackney and a buddy enlisted in the military after high school .
Hackney knew he was probably in line for the draft , but that was n't his only motivation .
" We grew up loving our country -- patriotism was a big thing in our family , " Elford said .
Their father , Glendon Dale Hackney , was a decorated soldier in the Korean War , once throwing himself on a hand grenade to save fellow soldiers , Elford said .
Like father , like son .
Three days after reporting for duty , Duane Hackney flew his first combat mission , during which he was injured by a .30 - caliber slug in his leg .
To avoid being grounded by the medics , he did n't report the incident .
Hackney was courageous in his rescue efforts , but he made it known that he was no cheerleader for war .
" I have always been a conscientious objector , " he told a reporter in 1991 .
" I did n't want to kill people , and I never killed anyone .
I wanted to save them .
I hate war .
It 's nothing but legalized murder . "

His pararescue career ended in 1980 while training for mountain rescues in Europe .
During the mission , Hackney fell 90 feet while working on sheer ice on a mountain .
The accident left him with many serious injuries , including a broken hip and clavicle and a fractured skull .
Two weeks later , Hackney suffered a heart attack .
In 1989 , he underwent a triple bypass .
In 1991 , he left the military to manage a security firm .
He died two years later after a heart attack following a workout at a gym .
His son , Jason Hackney -- now a teacher in Pennsylvania -- was 9 years old .
The procession at Duane Hackney 's funeral in Flint was five miles long and featured a flyover by Air Force craft .
Ceremonies honoring Hackney 's service took place over a full week .
" The pride I feel for my brother is immeasurable , " said Elford , born 20 minutes before her twin was .
" When he died , I felt like I had lost my left wing .
" I miss him so much . "
A pair of Argentinean researchers has demonstrated a BIOS - level exploit that allowed the duo to potentially run a great deal of invisible code — which could remain installed even if the hard drive was wiped .
Much has been made of this last bit , but malware attacks against the Basic Input Output System are anything but new .
The CIH ( Chernobyl ) virus that first appeared in 1998 was capable of bricking a system by rewriting critical boot information in the computer 's BIOS with garbage output .
Even if you dodged this bullet , CIH 's primary payload rewrote the first 1MB of the hard drive .
If Chernoybl successfully activated on D - day , the best outcome a user could hope for was an apparently wiped hard drive .
At worst , system repair involved physically pulling the BIOS chip and installing another .
The advent of write - protected BIOSes , partly in response to CIH , put a damper on firmware - munching malware , but the inherent attractiveness of the BIOS as an attack vector has never vanished .
The exploit demonstrated by Anibal L. Sacco and Alfredo A. Ortega , both of Core Security Technologies , is noteworthy and important , but it 's not the game - changer some have made it out to be .
The duo presented the details of their BIOS incursion at ConSecWest last week ; their presentation is available here ( PDF ) .
I have n't seen the full text of their presentation , but the attack as laid out within the document is quite straightforward and relies on the simple fact that a system BIOS can be flashed ( upgraded ) with a new version .
These new versions are installed through several methods — some motherboard companies have utilities that will flash a BIOS within Windows now — but one commonality is that the BIOS must be switched to write - allow mode before the attack can be executed .
The aforementioned attack consists of dumping the new BIOS into flashrom ( a BIOS read / write / modify utility ) , making the necessary changes , adjusting all of the checksums to ensure the hacked BIOS will verify as authentic ( the two credit Pinczakko here ) , and flashing .
Voila !
One evil BIOS .
Establishing one 's secret evil layer in BIOS , as previously mentioned , is a darned good idea .
From here , the attacker can theoretically install rootkits , infect any virtual machines running on the main rig , and perform any number of dastardly deeds — all below the OS kernel level .
As dangerous of a problem as an attack of this nature presents , however , there 's one overriding factor that makes it unlikely that we 'll ever see an attack of this sort in the wild .
The duo's BIOS hack is n't a bug you can catch by opening the wrong e-mail — it must be installed , either by someone with physical access to the system , or remotely by a person with root - level access .
This is not the sort of exploit that anyone bothers with on a grand scale .
Not only is it highly impractical , it 's also pointless — why go to so much trouble to infect a PC running at a Ma and Pa store if you can spend a hundredth of a cent and send them an infected e-mail they 'll open and run ?
If an organization is genuinely vulnerable to this type of attack , it means one of two things :
Either the business 's IT security is absolutely horrible and has failed on multiple levels , or it's an inside job .
Either way , a number of gates have been left open to leave a system vulnerable to a BIOS - level assault .
Gordon Brown is making reform of the international monetary fund , its governance , funding and powers of surveillance , the centrepiece of a 45 - day diplomatic drive in an attempt to make the G20 summit in London a turning point in remaking the international economic order .
Brown , in alliance with the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd , wants to increase the funding of the IMF , speed up a review to give China and India clearer voting rights , and also give the fund powers to direct nation states to respond to its surveillance reports .
He also wants to give the G20 a permanent secretariat , so making it a powerful body overseeing finance and largely eclipsing the G8 .
The prime minister is meeting the IMF managing director , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , on Wednesday , the pope on Thursday and the Italian prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , on Friday , before joining a mini-summit of European G20 members France , Italy and Germany in Berlin hosted by Angela Merkel , the German chancellor .
No 10 angrily denied suggestions that Merkel is lining Brown up to be a new IMF super - regulator .
Some officials believe a cabinet member leaked the suggestion .
Britain is chairing the G20 , with a summit in London on 2 April to be attended by Barack Obama , and Brown is using the event to advance his long - nurtured plans to reform the IMF .
It is a huge test of his diplomatic skills as he seeks to weld conflicting goals and ensure practical proposals emerge rather than rhetorical bombast that fails to assure the markets .
On the IMF , Britain wants to expand its existing lines of credit , so giving " emerging market economies " an opportunity to contribute .
Brown has also considered a loan or bond facility funded by Arab states , Japan and China .
He and Rudd also want allocate additional special drawing rights ( SDRs ) to the IMF 's newer members , as agreed in 1997 , so giving them access to foreign exchange .
SDRs are an official international reserve asset issued by the IMF to its members , who can exchange them for freely useable currency .
Strauss - Kahn has called for the IMF 's resources to be doubled $ 500bn .
Brown is also interested in the IMF supporting – through expertise and financing – the creation of a network of national " bad banks " to take on toxic assets .
Finally , he wants to give the IMF a strengthened mandate to provide early warning of weaknesses and advice on remedial policies , similar to those provided by a central bank .
At a seminar on the G20 summit last week Brown argued : " The world lacks a proper early warning system .
There is the Bank for International Settlement , there is the Financial Stability Forum , but we have never given anybody sufficient teeth so that their views are treated so seriously that people will immediately have to act when that early warning is given .
We still lack the means for financial supervision . "
The International Monetary Fund , he said , " cannot have a role that is simply commentating on the global economy , it must have a surveillance role that is effective " .
He added : " If people feel that the IMF is simply the representative of the richest countries with very little say for the poorer countries , if people think that the World Bank is similarly constructed , then people are going to either seek to have other institutions or going to reject the existing institutions , and of course the danger of that at this time is protectionism . "
The aim appears to be develop a " grand bargain " in which there is a greater role for emerging economies such as China in the IMF , and easier access to its financial assistance , in exchange for such countries playing by the global rules and not trying to build up surpluses and reserves as an insurance policy .
Other issues to be addressed include whether hedge funds and shadow banking are brought within the remit of regulation and Brown has also asked Pascal Lamy , the head of the World Trade Organisation , to compile a report for the G20 on the threat posed by protectionism .
Brown now reckons that unless new credit lines are opened , as many as 100 million people will be driven into poverty as a result of the global financial crisis .
He has been struck by figures from the International Institute of Finance which said two years ago net flows to the emerging markets were nearly $ 1 trillion , but that in 2009 this figure will be $ 160 - 170bn – a 700 % fall in two years .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ’s aggressive moves against the food industry show the socialist leader will respond to growing economic woes in the OPEC nation with takeovers and tighter controls on business .

Chavez has in the last week sent troops to temporarily occupy several rice mills and nationalized another one run by U.S. food giant Cargill after complaining they were not producing enough at government regulated prices .
The socialist stalwart appears set to continue increasing state control over the economy in response to tumbling oil revenues , galloping inflation and the possibility of a slump in productivity by a weakened private sector .
Emboldened by a February referendum win that lets him run for re-election in 2012 , Chavez is again looking for show - downs with private industry that may further cut GDP growth -- which slowed to 4.8 percent in 2008 compared to 8.4 percent in 2007 .
“ His name is confrontation , and there are not many tricks left in that bag , ” said Riordan Roett of the Latin America program at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington .
“ We will likely see more aggressive behavior as we head into mid-year with no bounce in oil prices . ”
Chavez said on Thursday night his government took over a timber farm run by Irish paper company Smurfit Kappa SKG .
I and earlier this week he also threatened to take over Venezuela 's top food producer , Empresas Polar .
Venezuela ’s heavy dependence on imported food means it could struggle this year to ensure supplies at subsidized prices as currency reserves shrink , possibly sparking shortages of staple foods .
Shortages two years ago hurt Chavez ’s popularity , forcing him to spend more on food imports and set up a state - run food distribution network .
WARY OF BUSINESS
Chavez ’s mistrust of business -- often justified because of political meddling and unscrupulous practices -- means he almost always blames merchants for product shortages or price increases even as inflation soared to 31 percent last year .
Chavez last year decreed laws vastly expanding government power to regulate the production and distribution of food , but still food prices overall rose a staggering 40 percent in the last 12 months .
“ The government has laid out a clear strategy to tighten the screws on the private sector in a failed bid to control inflation , ” said Patrick Esteruelas , an analyst with the Eurasia Group in New York .
The oil services sector is particularly vulnerable .
Dozens of small oil services firms are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy because state oil company PDVSA -- short on cash -- has run up at least $ 8 billion in outstanding bills .
Unpaid for months , angry workers have threatened to take over service companies that try to shut down , creating conditions similar to Chavez ’s nationalization last year of the country ’s largest steelmaker amid labor disputes .
Chavez had an easier row to hoe with his 2007 nationalizations because state coffers were full , giving him the option to pay compensation for some takeovers and reduce the risk of legal conflicts .
But in recent days , with Venezuela ’s cash flow already stretched thin , Chavez has mentioned paying out compensation in the form of government bonds .
“ I ca n’t say I ’m surprised by this move , he is politically bolstered and is not wasting any time tightening his grip on the country ’s economy , ” said Michael Shifter of the Inter - American Dialogue think tank in Washington .
“ For Chavez , the economic consequences of another wave of nationalizations are secondary . ”
Back in late September , when my bank stocks began to tank — slowly , then all at once , as Hemingway described going broke — another wall in my life began to crack , as rumors of break - ins rattled my peaceful neighborhood in Allentown , Pa .
The first indication that something was going on was the Crime Watch sign that suddenly appeared on the utility pole a block from my house .
To see what was happening , my husband and I attended a neighborhood - watch meeting in October at the nearby Christian and Missionary Alliance Church , where people suggested that crime was moving into our beautiful old neighborhood because the police were putting the squeeze on criminal activity downtown .
A former city councilwoman sobbed as she told us how her home was broken into while she slept .
An elderly man described how thieves ransacked his house in broad daylight .
Some people were roving around different areas , stripping cars , the police liaison there told us , but evidently our stretched department could spare only three squad cars for the whole West End .
We left feeling as if we ’d have to batten down the hatches while the police tried to make it so uncomfortable for the drug gangs downtown that they ’d move on .
We signed up to be informed of future meetings and took the card of a local locksmith .
We live in a big old house with an open back porch and a three - tiered yard with trees .
A year ago , I loved the fact that we were so open , that neighborhood kids and animals could play and hide here .
But after that meeting , I began to see access points , places where we were vulnerable .
“ We have five doors , ” I told my husband .
“ And the windows are a joke .
The cat knows how to open them . ”
Meanwhile , the financial news kept getting bleaker .
A lawyer friend ’s real estate and bankruptcy practice morphed into a plain bankruptcy practice .
I ’d always heard that crime increases when the economy goes down , and I found myself thinking of some of my grandparents ’ stories about the Great Depression : people breaking the law out of desperation .
Can the World 's Worst CD and DVD Manufacturer Do Better with Solar Energy ?
February 20th , 2009 by Matthew Phelan
Sun Well Solar — a subsidiary of the notoriously poor CD and DVD manufacturer , CMC Magnetics — has announced today that it is one month ahead of schedule in the ramp - up of its new photovoltaic production line .
Every 50 seconds , their Taipei Taiwan plant is currently producing one brand new , amorphous thin - film silicon solar cell — thanks to micromorph tandem - cell production equipment purchased from Oerlikon Solar .
As we ’ve previously noted , Oerlikon has a long track record with thin - film solar innovations , but its production equipment is only as good as the , erghm … “ electronics manufacturing services ( EMS ) ” who buy them .
Last July , Oerlikon sold 60 - MW and 120 - MW solar production lines to Sun Well and made a similar deal with Singapore - based Flextronics .
( Some of you may recall Flextronics as the company that introduced double the World Health Organization ’s maximum for acceptable Nickel content into Guadalajara ’s well water .
At the time , they were making Xboxes for Microsoft there . )
Sun Well ’s facility promises “ more than 1,250 panels or 110 kW produced per day , ” which according to their press release , “ is equivalent to about 10 % of the world ’s module production , making Sun Well one of the largest in Asia . ”
All well and good , provided that these solar cells do n’t totally blow chunks .

Daily newspapers will become a thing of the past for readers in four Michigan markets , with issues being printed only three days a week in Flint , Saginaw and Bay City , and twice weekly in Ann Arbor .
Advance Publications said it would close the 174 - year - old Ann Arbor News in late July , and replace it with two new corporate entities : a primarily Web - based news operation , AnnArbor.com ; and a printing company that will publish two days a week .
All 272 employees at The News , which has weekday circulation of 45,000 , will be laid off and invited to apply for jobs at the two new companies .
Their staff size has not been determined , but “ there will be by far fewer positions , ” said Laurel Champion , publisher of The Ann Arbor News .
AnnArbor.com will have some original reporting , and an emphasis on reader input and community forums .
“ This will be a new company built from the ground up , ” said Steven Newhouse , chairman of Advance.net , the Internet arm of the company .
The changes at The Flint Journal , The Saginaw News and The Bay City Times will be less sweeping , reducing daily publication to Thursdays , Fridays and Sundays only .
Executives said those days account for about 80 percent of advertising revenue .
The papers , which have combined circulation of 141,000 on weekdays and 176,000 on Sundays , plan to lay off 35 percent of their employees .
Soft - deletes are bad , m'kay ?
Thursday , February 19 , 2009
Have you ever ran into database tables with a field which is used to mark if a row has been ' deleted ' ?
Probably .
These fields are used to implement ' soft - deletes ' .
For the soft - delete impaired , a quick introduction .
Soft - deletes are row deletes which are not really happening : instead of removing the row from the database table , a field in the row is set to a value which signals that the row is officially ' deleted ' .
Every SELECT statement on that table is then filtering on that field 's value so only rows which are n't marked as ' deleted ' are returned ( as the deleted data is not there anymore , semantically ) .
If this sounds rather awkward , it is .
However , there are people who insist in having soft - deletes instead of real deletes , because it allows them to go back in time , to look back at the data that was deleted , as all data is , well ... , still there .
A small group of those people even believes that soft - deletes allows them to roll - back to deleted data , a kind of ' undo ' facility .
The truth is , soft - deletes using status fields in rows is a bad solution to the real problem .
Fortunately there are alternatives .
First let 's have to look at why people would want soft - deletes .
In general there are two reasons , which are already mentioned above : to be able to look at deleted data and to be able to roll - back to deleted data .
Let 's discuss the second reason first : rolling back to deleted data .
Roll - back to deleted data is hard .
Let 's use Northwind as our example database .
Let 's say we do n't delete rows from that database , but flag them as ' deleted ' using a new field , IsDeleted ( bit ) , added to every table .
If you want to roll - back a deleted Order row , it looks as simple as setting the ' IsDeleted ' field to 0 , right ?
Though , what if that Order row refers to a deleted Customer row using its CustomerID foreign key ?
For the RDBMS , it 's OK , as the ' deleted '
Customer row is still in the Customers table , it just has its IsDeleted field set to 1 .
However , executing a SELECT statement which fetches the just recovered Order row with its Customer row will run into a problem : the Customer is n't technically there : the mandatory IsDeleted filter prohibits that the Customer row is showing up .
The only solution to this is to also recover the deleted Customer row .
Order might have had OrderDetail rows as well , which requires the OrderDetail rows to be recovered as well .
In short , recovering a row is not what 's this is all about , it 's about recovering a graph .
Recovering graphs instead of table rows is much more complicated , due to the dependencies between the involved entity instances ( rows ) .
Writing roll - back code for this is therefore likely a complex affair , especially if you want to make sure the data - integrity of the working set is still 100 % correct ( so all rows involved in the recovered graph indeed have their IsDeleted flag set to 0 and are part of the working set ) .
In the end you 'll run into issues where rows have to be merged , similar to source - control systems ( e.g. in the situation where a row becomes deleted several times in different graphs ) .
So rolling back graphs is not likely going to be implemented in the average system , it 's therefore not the main reason for soft - deletes .
On to the first reason , looking back at old data .
Old data is old for a reason .
When a system deletes rows from a table , it 's hopefully done inside a transaction , so when something goes wrong , the delete is ' undone ' .
When the transaction completes , the delete is final , and the data is gone .
If you ever would want to look at the old data ( the data you just deleted ) again , you can't , it 's gone .
Let 's ignore that some people can't throw anything away ( " I might want to look at it in 2 years , then what !? < wild panic > " ) and focus on what ' delete ' actually means : it means that the data is considered ' no longer needed ' and therefore removed from the working set .
If the data was necessary after the delete , do n't execute the delete in the first place , it 's the same with your file system really .
However , when ' data is no longer needed ' does n't mean it is totally worthless in all situations : there 's a situation where old data could be useful : for reports on history of an entity , when happened what , etc . .
Though when will those reports be ran ?
Every 5 minutes ?
Will the average user of the system look at historic data all day long or work with the actual working set ?
The answer to these questions is likely the same : functionality consuming historic ( deleted ) data is rarely used compared to the functionality consuming working set ( not deleted ) data .
Let it be clear that it sometimes is required for legal reasons not to toss away data , however in other situations the same requirement actually lead to different solutions : old email is archived in archives and not kept in the in - box .
Is that solution useful for this situation as well ?
Implications of using soft - deletes
So the main reasons why some people want this is clear , however what are the implications when soft - deletes are used ?
Below I 've mentioned a couple , though I 'm sure there are more , though I think the list below is already convincing enough to look at another solution instead .
Queries become very complex .
Make no mistake , once you introduce a field to signal if a row has been deleted , you have to make sure every table reference is accompanied by a filter on that IsDeleted status field .
Every table reference .
If you forget one , it 's over : your data is then officially not correct .
Maintainability will become more cumbersome , and as most time on a software project is spend on maintenance , it 's something which will hurt the project , hard .

Maintainability will become more cumbersome , and as most time on a software project is spend on maintenance , it 's something which will hurt the project , hard .
Queries become slower over time .
Every ' deleted ' row is still there , and for the database system the row is just an ordinary row like any other .
This means that DML operations on the rows will become slower , but especially SELECT statements will become slower over time : the percentage of rows which are ' live ' of the total number of rows in the table is getting smaller , as more and more rows will become ' deleted ' .
This baggage could hurt in the long run , especially in tables with a lot of inserts / deletes : the working set might stay the same ( e.g. 10 K rows ) but the total set of rows grows every day so the total number of rows might be millions .
When you have millions of rows in the table while the actual set of rows which are ' not deleted ' is a small percentage of that , it will influence the performance of queries dramatically .
Compare that to a table with the actual set of rows you 've to work with .

Compare that to a table with the actual set of rows you 've to work with .
Using constraints ( UC , FK ) is impossible .
Using a unique constraint ( UC ) is not really possible , as the RDBMS will take into account the rows which are ' deleted ' as well .
So a value might be unique for the rows in the working set , but for the total set of rows in the table it does n't have to be unique and the update or insert fails .
In our example above with Customer and Order , we 've seen that foreign key constraints are not really working anymore either , as they do n't protect us from ' deleting ' a PK side while keeping the FK side : for the RDBMS , both rows are still there and everything is fine ( which is not the case )
A better solution to these requirements
There 's a better solution , and I 've already mentioned it briefly : archiving .
RDBMS 's ( I assume you 're using a proper , professional , solid ACID compliant database , not some toy RDBMS ) usually sport a system called triggers .
Triggers are neat things : they get called when something happens .
You can compare them to event handlers really : an event occurs ( e.g. a row gets deleted from a table ) and the trigger responsible for handling that event is called .
Additionally , the trigger is called in the same transaction as the code which triggered the trigger .
So all actions taken inside a trigger are rolled back when the transaction containing the code which triggered the trigger is rolled back .
If you look closely at the two main reasons for soft - deletes , you 'll recognize that both can be satisfied with simply keeping the data around which is deleted by DELETE statements : looking back at old , deleted data is possible wherever the old data is located and rolling back deleted data is not going to be less complex when the data is located elsewhere , as the complexity is in the graph rollback mechanism , not the location of the data to rollback to .
This leads to the solution of an archiving database .
An archiving database is a catalog ( or schema if you wish ) which contains the same table definitions as the real database , with perhaps no UC or FK constraints , as data integrity is implied by the data integrity of the source data ( after all , it 's just for archiving data consistent data ) .
Every table of which you want to keep deleted data around in the real database now gets a DELETE trigger which simply grabs the row (s ) deleted and inserts them in the same table in the archiving database .
If the transaction fails , the inserted rows in the archiving database roll back too , if the transaction succeeds , the data is successfully archived and still available .
Additionally , you could add date / time fields to the rows in the archiving database to store exact dates and times when the row was deleted , the trigger can insert these values when the deleted row is inserted .
This makes sure the data is still available , so the reasons why people want this are still met , though it does n't pollute the working set for the application anymore , and the implications of soft - deletes are gone .
The only thing you 've to be sure of is that the triggers and the archive database are maintained together with the real database ( so schema changes in the real database are applied to the archive database as well , or you could go overboard and add a new archive database ! ) .
However , that 's a small price to pay compared to the overly complicated queries one has to write ( even with O/R mappers ) and work with , queries which also have to be maintained and documented for the length the application is in use .
Using the triggers and the archive database , the application can be written normally , can be tested normally , and no data is thrown away .
Ever .
One could extend this system with an UPDATE trigger as well , so updates are also tracked , so value deletes on the field level could be tracked as well .
So do yourself a favor , next time someone tells you to use soft - deletes , discuss the implications and offer this alternative solution .
Everyone will be better off : you , the customer , and the group of people who will maintain the system for the next 20 years .
Common to the human experience is the desire to bask in the sure and certain knowledge those who adhere to different practices have it much worse than we do .
Part of belonging to any group is the need to believe it ’s the best of its kind , and that holds true even when the groups in question are different religions , or even sects within the same religion .
One needs to feel comforted one has made the right choice and is indeed upon the right path , after all .
Consequently , bits of wild misinformation about what goes on in the other camp often get circulated as truth because these tales serve to confirm the rightness of one ’s own choice .
Such is the case with the “ sex through a hole in the sheet ” rumor .
None of the three branches of Judaism ( Orthodox , Conservative , or Reform ) require this of their adherents , and indeed taking the joy out of marital sex in such a fashion runs directly counter to all things Jewish .
Whereas in some branches of religion sex within marriage is supposed to be primarily for the purposes of procreation , throughout Judaism it ’s viewed as a celebration of couplehood — man and wife are supposed to enjoy each other , whether kids are the goal of the encounter or not .
Indeed , not making love to your wife can call rabbinical sanction down upon the head of a Jewish man or even provide grounds for divorce .
The times for conjugal duty prescribed in the Torah are : for men of independence , every day ; for laborers , twice a week ; for ass - drivers , once a week ; for camel - drivers , once in thirty days ; for sailors , once in six months .
These are the rulings of Rabbi Eliezer .
In a world that made sense , this rumor about joyless sex would better adhere to just about anyone other than Jews .
Ah , but sometimes things just are n’t logical .
Interestingly enough , a 1995 article in the Jerusalem Post said about modesty practices in other cultures , “ [ I ] n Catholic Mexico of yore with the use of modesty bed sheets with carefully stitched and positioned holes in them . ”
Looks like its writer confused a scene from the 1992 film Like Water For Chocolate with reality .
( See the Sightings section at the end of this page for more about that film . )
One guess as to the origin of the slit sheet belief postulates it as a joking reference to ultra-Orthodox weddings , where men and women are said to attend separate receptions by way of dividing the hall with a curtain .
Through a hole in the curtain , the children can pass through , but no one else .
However , according to the soc.culture .
jewish FAQ :
We do n’t know what you ’ve heard , but what we ’ve heard is that when it comes time for three men to “ witness ” a woman ’s conversion [ involving nude immersion ] , what ’s commonly done is for the water ’s surface to be covered with a thick , opaque sheet with a hole in it , just big enough to let her head through while discreetly shielding the rest of her body .
According to a Jewish “ urban legend , ” the myth derives from seeing Jews in religious neighborhoods hanging their “ talitot katan ” out to dry .
This poncho - like garment is about two feet by four feet , has a fringe on each corner , and a hole in the center for the wearer ’s head , and it looks somewhat like a small sheet with a hole , and many people have vivid and warped imaginations .
This rumor spreads chiefly among non-Orthodox Jews and is not often heard from those of other faiths .
Whatever this snippet of misinformation ’s beginnings , the whisper about holes in sheets has become a part of Jewish lore that reflects attitudes towards the fabled strictness of Orthodox practices .
To even hint sexuality between man and wife — a vibrant part of Judaism — has been squelched to this degree within the Orthodox branch is to strike at the heart of all things Jewish .
Nothing could better capture the presumption about how joyless life must be within the Orthodox faith .
But that ’s not the way of it at all .
Shmuel Boteach , author of the acclaimed Kosher Sex : A Recipe for Passion and Intimacy labels the sheet rumor as utterly false .
“ Judaism , ” he says , “ is the one religion that not only allows sex for pleasure but sees sex as the holiest of all acts because it brings life into the world — and even when it does n’t , it sews two people together as one flesh , one soul . ”
This tenet of the religion holds true across all branches of Judaism , including the heavily - governed Orthodox .
Sightings :
This belief turns up as a scene in the 1992 film Como agua para chocolate ( Like Water For Chocolate ) , which is set in the late 1800s .
After the wedding of a young Mexican couple , a scene from the wedding night shows the new wife nervously arranging a sheet over herself .
Also , Simon Louvish ’s 1986 book The Death of Moishe - Ganef uses the sheet belief as a plot point .
Deputy pleads not guilty to jail cell assault of 15 - year - old girl David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday February 28 , 2009
Print This Email This A King County , Washington police officer has pleaded not guilty to fourth - degree assault after a judge agreed to the release of a video showing a 15 - year - old girl being thrown against a wall , beaten and picked up by her hair .
A county prosecutor told the Seattle Post - Intelligencer the violent behavior should be considered " criminal misconduct , " concluding " he should be prosecuted . "
Captured November 29 , 2008 in a SeaTac City
Hall holding cell , the clip was released over the objections of Deputy Paul Schene 's attorney , who insists it does not " tell the whole story . "
The girl and another 15 - year - old female were arrested on suspicion of auto theft .
The vehicle they were allegedly driving belonged to the victim 's parents .
According to an analysis of court documents by Seattle 's KIROTV , " Schene described the girl as ' overtly belligerent , ' and said she made personal attacks toward him . "
At the beginning of the video , the girl -- who has not been named because she is a minor -- walks into the cell without incident , then , with her arms folded , kicks the shoe off her left foot toward the officer .
Deputy Schene , 31 and an eight year veteran officer , responded by apparently kicking her in the stomach and slamming her face into the opposite wall .
Then , grasping the girl by her hair , he violently slams her to the ground , placing his knee in the center of her back as another deputy , who did not participate in the assault , helps cuff her .
As she 's pinned , Deputy Schene rears his right hand back and strikes her twice .
While it appears the deputy is punching the girl on the back of the head , the blows do not land directly in the camera 's line of sight .
Once properly restrained , the girl is lifted to her feet by her hair .
Schene is currently free on personal recognizance .
" We take this very seriously and we 're very concerned about this , " sheriff 's Sgt. Jim Laing told Seattle PI .
The Seattle Post - Intelligencer requested the video be released and a judge agreed late Friday .
" Prosecutors said Schene did not explain why he struck the girl after he had her in a holding position on the floor , " noted the Associated Press .
" Several years ago , Schene shot and killed an unarmed , mentally disturbed man following a traffic stop that degenerated into a ' knock - down , drag - out ' fight , " noted William Grigg at lewrockwell.com .
" The shooting was ruled ' justifiable . '
Shortly after that incident , he was stopped for driving under the influence ( apparently of prescription medication ) .
He was given a deferred sentence and placed on probation , so that he could continue to bless the people of King County with his singular professionalism . "
Schene faces a maximum penalty of one year in jail and reprimand or termination from the department pending the results of an internal investigation .

The United States will move 8,000 troops from Okinawa , southern Japan , to its territory of Guam by 2014 , under an agreement signed by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Tokyo on Tuesday .
Japan will contribute more than $ US6 billion ( $ A9.24 billion ) towards the planned relocation of the US Marines , first agreed between Washington and Tokyo in May 2006 .
Clinton and Japan's Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone signed the agreement , in which Japan pledges to pay up to $ US2.8 billion in cash and $ US3.29 billion in loans and other investments for the relocation cost .
Okinawans have long been reluctant hosts for more than half of the 40,000 US troops based in Japan .
The pullout aims to reduce the burden of the post - World War II American military presence in Okinawa , where residents have long complained of noise from military operations and occasional crimes by US servicemen .

The Decline and Fall of the Spectacle - Commodity Economy Guy Debord unsigned tract originally translated into English by Donald - Nicholson Smith , distributed in the USA in December 1965
reprinted by Internationale Situationniste # 10 ( March 1966 ) Translated by Ken Knabb AUGUST 13 - 16 , 1965 , the blacks of Los Angeles revolted .
An incident between traffic police and pedestrians developed into two days of spontaneous riots .
Despite increasing reinforcements , the forces of order were unable to regain control of the streets .
By the third day the blacks had armed themselves by looting accessible gun stores , enabling them to fire even on police helicopters .
It took thousands of police and soldiers , including an entire infantry division supported by tanks , to confine the riot to the Watts area , and several more days of street fighting to finally bring it under control .
Stores were massively plundered and many were burned .
Official sources listed 32 dead ( including 27 blacks ) , more than 800 wounded and 3000 arrests .
Reactions from all sides were most revealing : a revolutionary event , by bringing existing problems into the open , provokes its opponents into an unhabitual lucidity .
Police Chief William Parker , for example , rejected all the major black organizations  offers of mediation , correctly asserting :  These rioters dont have any leaders . 
Since the blacks no longer had any leaders , it was the moment of truth for both sides .
What did one of those unemployed leaders , NAACP general secretary Roy Wilkins , have to say ?
He declared that the riot  should be put down with all necessary force .
And Los Angeles Cardinal McIntyre , who protested loudly , did not protest against the violence of the repression , which one might have supposed the most tactful policy at a time when the Roman Church is modernizing its image ; he denounced  this premeditated revolt against the rights of ones neighbor and against respect for law and order ,  calling on Catholics to oppose the looting and this violence without any apparent justification . 
And all those who went so far as to recognize the apparent justifications  of the rage of the Los Angeles blacks ( but never their real ones ) , all the ideologists and spokesmen of the vacuous international Left , deplored the irresponsibility , the disorder , the looting ( especially the fact that arms and alcohol were the first targets ) and the 2000 fires with which the blacks lit up their battle and their ball .
But who has defended the Los Angeles rioters in the terms they deserve ?
We will .
Let the economists fret over the $ 27 million lost , and the city planners sigh over one of their most beautiful supermarkets gone up in smoke , and McIntyre blubber over his slain deputy sheriff .
Let the sociologists bemoan the absurdity and intoxication of this rebellion .
The role of a revolutionary publication is not only to justify the Los Angeles insurgents , but to help elucidate their perspectives , to explain theoretically the truth for which such practical action expresses the search .
In Algiers in July 1965 , following Boumédiennes coup détat , the situationists issued an Address to the Algerians and to revolutionaries all over the world which interpreted conditions in Algeria and the rest of the world as a whole .
Among other examples we mentioned the movement of the American blacks , stating that if it could assert itself incisively  it would unmask the contradictions of the most advanced capitalist system .
Five weeks later this incisiveness was in the streets .
Modern theoretical criticism of modern society and criticism in acts of the same society already coexist ; still separated but both advancing toward the same realities , both talking about the same thing .
These two critiques are mutually explanatory , and neither can be understood without the other .
Our theory of survival  and of  the spectacle is illuminated and verified by these actions which are so incomprehensible to American false consciousness .
One day these actions will in turn be illuminated by this theory .
Until the Watts explosion , black civil rights demonstrations had been kept by their leaders within the limits of a legal system that tolerates the most appalling violence on the part of the police and the racists  as in last Marchs march on Montgomery , Alabama .
Even after the latter scandal , a discreet agreement between the federal government , Governor Wallace and Martin Luther King led the Selma marchers on March 10 to stand back at the first police warning , in dignity and prayer .
The confrontation expected by the demonstrators was reduced to a mere spectacle of a potential confrontation .
In that moment nonviolence reached the pitiful limit of its courage : first you expose yourself to the enemys blows , then you push your moral nobility to the point of sparing him the trouble of using any more force .
But the main point is that the civil rights movement only addressed legal problems by legal means .
It is logical to make legal appeals regarding legal questions .
What is irrational is to appeal legally against a blatant illegality as if it was a mere oversight that would be corrected if pointed out .
It is obvious that the crude and glaring illegality from which blacks still suffer in many American states has its roots in a socioeconomic contradiction that is not within the scope of existing laws , and that no future judicial law will be able to get rid of this contradiction in the face of the more fundamental laws of this society .
What American blacks are really daring to demand is the right to really live , and in the final analysis this requires nothing less than the total subversion of this society .
This becomes increasingly evident as blacks in their everyday lives find themselves forced to use increasingly subversive methods .
The issue is no longer the condition of American blacks , but the condition of America , which merely happens to find its first expression among the blacks .
The Watts riot was not a racial conflict : the rioters left alone the whites that were in their path , attacking only the white policemen , while on the other hand black solidarity did not extend to black store - owners or even to black car - drivers .
Martin Luther King himself had to admit that the revolt went beyond the limits of his specialty .
Speaking in Paris last October , he said :  This was not a race riot .
It was a class riot .
The Los Angeles rebellion was a rebellion against the commodity , against the world of the commodity in which worker - consumers are hierarchically subordinated to commodity standards .
Like the young delinquents of all the advanced countries , but more radically because they are part of a class without a future , a sector of the proletariat unable to believe in any significant chance of integration or promotion , the Los Angeles blacks take modern capitalist propaganda , its publicity of abundance , literally .
They want to possess now all the objects shown and abstractly accessible , because they want to use them .
In this way they are challenging their exchange - value , the commodity reality which molds them and marshals them to its own ends , and which has preselected everything .
Through theft and gift they rediscover a use that immediately refutes the oppressive rationality of the commodity , revealing its relations and even its production to be arbitrary and unnecessary .
The looting of the Watts district was the most direct realization of the distorted principle :  To each according to their false needs   needs determined and produced by the economic system which the very act of looting rejects .
But once the vaunted abundance is taken at face value and directly seized , instead of being eternally pursued in the rat-race of alienated labor and increasing unmet social needs , real desires begin to be expressed in festive celebration , in playful self - assertion , in the potlatch of destruction .
People who destroy commodities show their human superiority over commodities .
They stop submitting to the arbitrary forms that distortedly reflect their real needs .
The flames of Watts consummated the system of consumption .
The theft of large refrigerators by people with no electricity , or with their electricity cut off , is the best image of the lie of affluence transformed into a truth in play .
Once it is no longer bought , the commodity lies open to criticism and alteration , whatever particular form it may take .
Only when it is paid for with money is it respected as an admirable fetish , as a symbol of status within the world of survival .
Looting is a natural response to the unnatural and inhuman society of commodity abundance .
It instantly undermines the commodity as such , and it also exposes what the commodity ultimately implies : the army , the police and the other specialized detachments of the states monopoly of armed violence .
What is a policeman ?
He is the active servant of the commodity , the man in complete submission to the commodity , whose job it is to ensure that a given product of human labor remains a commodity , with the magical property of having to be paid for , instead of becoming a mere refrigerator or rifle  a passive , inanimate object , subject to anyone who comes along to make use of it .
In rejecting the humiliation of being subject to police , the blacks are at the same time rejecting the humiliation of being subject to commodities .
The Watts youth , having no future in market terms , grasped another quality of the present , and that quality was so incontestable and irresistible that it drew in the whole population  women , children , and even sociologists who happened to be on the scene .
Bobbi Hollon , a young black sociologist of the neighborhood , had this to say to the Herald Tribune in October :  Before , people were ashamed to say they came from Watts .
Theyd mumble it .
Now they say it with pride .
Boys who used to go around with their shirts open to the waist , and whod have cut you to pieces in half a second , showed up here every morning at seven oclock to organize the distribution of food .
Of course , its no use pretending that food wasnt looted ....
All that Christian blah has been used too long against blacks .
These people could loot for ten years and they wouldnt get back half the money those stores have stolen from them over all these years ....
Me , I m only a little black girl . 
Bobbi Hollon , who has sworn never to wash off the blood that splashed on her sandals during the rioting , adds :  Now the whole world is watching Watts . 
How do people make history under conditions designed to dissuade them from intervening in it ?
Los Angeles blacks are better paid than any others in the United States , but they are also the most separated from the California superopulence that is flaunted all around them .
Hollywood , the pole of the global spectacle , is right next door .
They are promised that , with patience , they will join in Americas prosperity , but they come to see that this prosperity is not a fixed state but an endless ladder .
The higher they climb , the farther they get from the top , because they start off disadvantaged , because they are less qualified and thus more numerous among the unemployed , and finally because the hierarchy that crushes them is not based on economic buying power alone : they are also treated as inherently inferior in every area of daily life by the customs and prejudices of a society in which all human power is based on buying power .
Just as the human riches of the American blacks are despised and treated as criminal , monetary riches will never make them completely acceptable in Americas alienated society : individual wealth will only make a rich nigger because blacks as a whole must represent poverty in a society of hierarchized wealth .
Every witness noted the cry proclaiming the global significance of the uprising :  This is a black revolution and we want the world to know it !
Freedom
Now is the password of all the revolutions of history , but now for the first time the problem is not to overcome scarcity , but to master material abundance according to new principles .
Mastering abundance is not just changing the way it is shared out , but totally reorienting it .
This is the first step of a vast , all - embracing struggle .
The blacks are not alone in their struggle , because a new proletarian consciousness ( the consciousness that they are not at all the masters of their own activities , of their own lives ) is developing in America among strata which in their rejection of modern capitalism resemble the blacks .
It was , in fact , the first phase of the black struggle which happened to be the signal for the more general movement of contestation that is now spreading .
In December 1964 the students of Berkeley , harassed for their participation in the civil rights movement , initiated a strike [ the FSM ] challenging the functioning of Californias multiversity  and ultimately calling into question the entire American social system in which they are being programmed to play such a passive role .
The spectacle promptly responded with exposés of widespread student drinking , drug use and sexual immorality  the same activities for which blacks have long been reproached .
This generation of students has gone on to invent a new form of struggle against the dominant spectacle , the teach - in , a form taken up October 20 in Great Britain at the University of Edinburgh during the Rhodesian crisis .
This obviously primitive and imperfect form represents the stage at which people refuse to confine their discussion of problems within academic limits or fixed time periods ; the stage when they strive to pursue issues to their ultimate consequences and are thus led to practical activity .
The same month tens of thousands of antiVietnam war demonstrators appeared in the streets of Berkeley and New York , their cries echoing those of the Watts rioters :  Get out of our district and out of Vietnam ! 
Becoming more radical , many of the whites are finally going outside the law : courses  are given on how to hoodwink army recruiting boards ( Le Monde , 19 October 1965 ) and draft cards are burned in front of television cameras .
In the affluent society disgust is being expressed for this affluence and for its price .
The spectacle is being spat on by an advanced sector whose autonomous activity denies its values .
The classical proletariat , to the very extent to which it had been provisionally integrated into the capitalist system , had itself failed to integrate the blacks ( several Los Angeles unions refused blacks until 1959 ) ; now the blacks are the rallying point for all those who refuse the logic of this integration into capitalism , which is all that the promise of racial integration amounts to .
Comfort will never be comfortable enough for those who seek what is not on the market , what in fact the market specifically eliminates .
The level attained by the technology of the most privileged becomes an insult , and one more easily grasped and resented than is that most fundamental insult : reification .
The Los Angeles rebellion is the first in history to justify itself with the argument that there was no air conditioning during a heat wave .
The American blacks have their own particular spectacle , their own black newspapers , magazines and stars , and if they are rejecting it in disgust as a fraud and as an expression of their humiliation , it is because they see it as a minority spectacle , a mere appendage of a general spectacle .
Recognizing that their own spectacle of desirable consumption is a colony of the white one enables them to see more quickly through the falsehood of the whole economic - cultural spectacle .
By wanting to participate really and immediately in the affluence that is the official value of every American , they are really demanding the egalitarian actualization of the American spectacle of everyday life  they are demanding that the half - heavenly , half - earthly values of the spectacle be put to the test .
But it is in the nature of the spectacle that it cannot be actualized either immediately or equally , not even for the whites .
( The blacks in fact function as a perfect spectacular object - lesson : the threat of falling into such wretchedness spurs others on in the rat-race . )
In taking the capitalist spectacle at its face value , the blacks are already rejecting the spectacle itself .
The spectacle is a drug for slaves .
It is designed not to be taken literally , but to be followed from just out of reach ; when this separation is eliminated , the hoax is revealed .
In the United States today the whites are enslaved to the commodity while the blacks are negating it .
The blacks are asking for more than the whites  this is the core of a problem that has no solution except the dissolution of the white social system .
This is why those whites who want to escape their own slavery must first of all rally to the black revolt  not , obviously , in racial solidarity , but in a joint global rejection of the commodity and of the state .
The economic and psychological distance between blacks and whites enables blacks to see white consumers for what they are , and their justified contempt for whites develops into a contempt for passive consumers in general .
The whites who reject this role have no chance unless they link their struggle more and more to that of the blacks , uncovering its most fundamental implications and supporting them all the way .
If , with the radicalization of the struggle , such a convergence is not sustained , black nationalist tendencies will be reinforced , leading to the futile interethnic antagonism so characteristic of the old society .
Mutual slaughter is the other possible outcome of the present situation , once resignation is no longer tolerable .
The attempts to build a separatist or pro-African black nationalism are dreams giving no answer to the real oppression .
The American blacks have no fatherland .
They are in their own country and they are alienated .
So are the rest of the population , but the blacks are aware of it .
In this sense they are not the most backward sector of American society , but the most advanced .
They are the negation at work ,  the bad aspect that makes history by setting the struggle in motion 
( The Poverty of Philosophy ) .
Africa has no special monopoly on that .
The American blacks are a product of modern industry , just like electronics or advertising or the cyclotron .
And they embody its contradictions .
They are the people that the spectacle paradise must simultaneously integrate and reject , with the result that the antagonism between the spectacle and human activity is totally revealed through them .
The spectacle is universal , it pervades the globe just as the commodity does .
But since the world of the commodity is based on class conflict , the commodity itself is hierarchical .
The necessity for the commodity ( and hence for the spectacle , whose role is to inform the commodity world ) to be both universal and hierarchical leads to a universal hierarchization .
But because this hierarchization must remain unavowed , it is expressed in the form of unavowable , because irrational , hierarchical value judgments in a world of irrational rationalization .
It is this hierarchization that creates racisms everywhere .
The British Labour government has come to the point of restricting nonwhite immigration , while the industrially advanced countries of Europe are once again becoming racist as they import their subproletariat from the Mediterranean area , developing a colonial exploitation within their own borders .
And if Russia continues to be anti-Semitic it is because it continues to be a hierarchical society in which labor must be bought and sold as a commodity .
The commodity is constantly extending its domain and engendering new forms of hierarchy , whether between labor leader and worker or between two car - owners with artificially distinguished models .
This is the original flaw in commodity rationality , the sickness of bourgeois reason , a sickness which has been inherited by the bureaucratic class .
But the repulsive absurdity of certain hierarchies , and the fact that the entire commodity world is directed blindly and automatically to their protection , leads people to see  the moment they engage in a negating practice  that every hierarchy is absurd .
The rational world produced by the Industrial Revolution has rationally liberated individuals from their local and national limitations and linked them on a global scale ; but it irrationally separates them once again , in accordance with a hidden logic that finds its expression in insane ideas and grotesque values .
Estranged from their own world , people are everywhere surrounded by strangers .
The barbarians are no longer at the ends of the earth , they are among the general population , made into barbarians by their forced participation in the worldwide system of hierarchical consumption .
The veneer of humanism that camouflages all this is inhuman , it is the negation of human activities and desires ; it is the humanism of the commodity , the solicitous care of the parasitical commodity for its human host .
For those who reduce people to objects , objects seem to acquire human qualities and truly human manifestations appear as unconscious animal behavior .
Thus the chief humanist of Los Angeles , William Parker , could say :  They started acting like a bunch of monkeys in a zoo . 
When California authorities declared a state of insurrection ,  the insurance companies recalled that they do not cover risks at that level  they guarantee nothing beyond survival .
The American blacks can rest assured that as long as they keep quiet they will in most cases be allowed to survive .
Capitalism has become sufficiently concentrated and interlinked with the state to distribute welfare to the poorest .
But by the very fact that they lag behind in the advance of socially organized survival , the blacks pose the problems of life ; what they are really demanding is not to survive but to live .
The blacks have nothing of their own to insure ; their mission is to destroy all previous forms of private insurance and security .
They appear as what they really are : the irreconcilable enemies , not of the great majority of Americans , but of the alienated way of life of the entire modern society .
The most industrially advanced country only shows us the road that will be followed everywhere unless the system is overthrown .
Certain black nationalist extremists , to show why they can accept nothing less than a separate nation , have argued that even if American society someday concedes total civil and economic equality , it will never , on a personal level , come around to accepting interracial marriage .
This is why this American society itself must disappear  in America and everywhere else in the world .
The end of all racial prejudice , like the end of so many other prejudices related to sexual inhibitions , can only lie beyond marriage itself , that is , beyond the bourgeois family ( which has largely fallen apart among American blacks )  the bourgeois family which prevails as much in Russia as in the United States , both as a model of hierarchical relations and as a structure for a stable inheritance of power ( whether in the form of money or of social - bureaucratic status ) .
It is now often said that American youth , after thirty years of silence , are rising again as a force of contestation , and that the black revolt is their Spanish Civil War .
This time their  Lincoln Brigades  must understand the full significance of the struggle in which they are engaging and totally support its universal aspects .
The Watts excesses are no more a political error in the black revolt than the POUMs May 1937 armed resistance in Barcelona was a betrayal of the anti-Franco war .
A revolt against the spectacle  even if limited to a single district such as Watts  calls everything into question because it is a human protest against a dehumanized life , a protest of real individuals against their separation from a community that would fulfill their true human and social nature and transcend the spectacle .
Okay , try and stay with me if you can .
While campaigning for the US presidency , Barack Obama pledged not to “ use Justice Department resources to try and circumvent state ( medical marijuana ) laws . ”
Nearly three - quarters of the American public agrees with this position .
According to a new national poll of 1,053 likely voters by Zogby International and commissioned by the NORML Foundation , seventy - two percent of voters say that President Obama should “ stop federal raids against medical marijuana providers in the 13 states where medical marijuana has become legal . ”
But since President Obama took office two weeks ago , the US Drug Enforcement Administration has undertaken at least seven separate raids of state - authorized medical marijuana providers in California and Colorado .
Most recently , on Wednesday DEA officials — acting without the cooperation of state or local law enforcement agencies — served federal search warrants on at least four Los Angeles based medical marijuana collectives .
Agents seized medicine , cash , financial records , and computers , but did not make any arrests .
Still with me ?
Good , because things are about to get even more confusing .
Today , in a front page article in The Washington Times White House spokesperson Nick Shapiro said , “ The president believes that federal resources should not be used to circumvent state laws , and as he continues to appoint senior leadership to fill out the ranks of the federal government , he expects them to review their policies with that in mind . ”
Huh ?
Okay , maybe I missed something but last time I checked Barack Obama is , in fact , the 44th President of the United States — which means he has the authority to tell both the US Department of Justice and DEA Acting Administrator Michele Leonhart : “ No more raids .
Period ! ” ( NORML podcaster Russ Belville has already drafted Obama the requisite memo here . )
Or , if Obama does n’t want to be the one who personally rains on the DEA ’s eight - year parade , then he can demand his newly sworn in U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to tell Ms. Leonhart and the DEA : “ When President Obama says ‘ no more raids , ’ he means no more raids !
Any more ‘ smash and grabs ’ in California — or any other state that ’s legalized the medical use of cannabis — and you ’re all out of your jobs .
Got it ? ”
Of course , given the likelihood that President Obama wo n’t be making such demands of his new Attorney General any time soon , why do n’t you ?
Click here and tell US Attorney General Eric Holder to uphold the will of the President and the public .
It ’s time for the DEA to stop circumventing state medical marijuana laws .
It ’s time for the raids to come to an end .

President - elect Barack Obama has announced his selections for America ’s top national security posts .
Among them is the foreign policy adviser from his campaign , Susan Rice , who will become ambassador to the United Nations .
Susan Rice , perhaps the least known of the nominees , will be a full - fledged Cabinet member in her role — a shift from past administrations .
Rice , 44 , will be the second - youngest person to ever hold the U.N. adviser post .
Susan Rice entered government life in 1993 as a member of President Bill Clinton ’s National Security Council staff .
She eventually became assistant secretary of state for African affairs .
Rice created a small stir when she decided to join Obama ’s campaign rather than Hillary Clinton ’s because of this past association .
Now , she will be working closely with Ms. Clinton as part of the new administration .
Rice is known for her criticism of the Bush administration ’s response to the Darfur killings .
The Save Darfur Coalition has already expressed excitement about her appointment and how it could help reshape the region .
Susan Rice ’s bio also includes a stint as senior fellow in foreign policy at independent research firm the Brookings Institution — the job she currently holds — as well as a role as senior adviser for national security affairs on the John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign .
She previously worked as a management consultant for McKinsey and Company .
Susan Rice graduated from Stanford University with a B.A. in history .
She received a doctorate in international relations from Oxford .
As expected , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton will become secretary of state .
Current Bush administration defense secretary Robert Gates will remain in that role within Obama ’s team .
Other appointments include retired Marine General James Jones as White House national security adviser , former Justice Department official Eric Holder as attorney general , and Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano as secretary of homeland security .
You can read bios of all of the new team members here .
The president - elect promised he and his staff would work to develop a new military mission , “ responsibly ending the war in Iraq through a successful transition to Iraqi control . ”
Obama ’s inauguration takes place January 20 .
The nominees ’ remarks are below in video form , followed by the full text of Barack Obama ’s speech from Monday ’s national security appointments announcement .
Good morning .
Last week , we announced our economic team , which is working as we speak to craft an Economic Recovery Program to create jobs and grow our struggling economy .
Today , Vice President - elect Biden and I are pleased to announce our national security team .
The national security challenges we face are just as grave — and just as urgent — as our economic crisis .
We are fighting two wars .
Old conflicts remain unresolved , and newly assertive powers have put strains on the international system .
The spread of nuclear weapons raises the peril that the world ’s deadliest technology could fall into dangerous hands .
Our dependence on foreign oil empowers authoritarian governments and endangers our planet .
America must also be strong at home to be strong abroad .
We need to provide education and opportunity for our citizens , so every American can compete with anyone , anywhere .
And our economic power must sustain our military strength , our diplomatic leverage , and our global leadership .
The common thread linking these challenges is the fundamental reality that in the 21st century , our destiny is shared with the world ’s .
From our markets to our security ; from our public health to our climate — we must act with the understanding that , now more than ever , we have a stake in what happens across the globe .
And as we learned so painfully on 9/11 , terror cannot be contained by borders , nor safety provided by oceans alone .
Last week , we were reminded of this threat once again when terrorists took the lives of six American among nearly 200 victims in Mumbai .
In the world we seek , there is no place for those who kill innocent civilians to advance hateful extremism .
This weekend , I told Prime Minister Singh that Americans stand with the people of India in this dark time .
And I am confident that India ’s great democracy is more resilient than killers who would tear it down .
And so , in this uncertain world , the time has come for a new beginning — a new dawn of American leadership to overcome the challenges of the 21st century , and to seize the opportunities embedded in those challenges .
We will strengthen our capacity to defeat our enemies and support our friends .
We will renew old alliances and forge new and enduring partnerships .
We will show the world once more that America is relentless in defense of our people , steady in advancing our interests , and committed to the ideals that shine as a beacon to the world : democracy and justice ; opportunity and unyielding hope — because American values are America ’s greatest export to the world .
To succeed , we must pursue a new strategy that skillfully uses , balances , and integrates all elements of American power : our military and diplomacy ; our intelligence and law enforcement ; our economy and the power of our moral example .
The team that we have assembled here today is uniquely suited to do just that .
In their past service and plans for the future , these men and women represent all of those elements of American power , and the very best of the American example .
They have served in uniform and as diplomats ; they have worked as legislators , law enforcement officials , and executives .
They share my pragmatism about the use of power , and my sense of purpose about America ’s role as a leader in the world .
I have known Hillary Clinton as a friend , a colleague , a source of counsel , and as a campaign opponent .
She possesses an extraordinary intelligence and toughness , and a remarkable work ethic .
I am proud that she will be our next Secretary of State .
She is an American of tremendous stature who will have my complete confidence ; who knows many of the world ’s leaders ; who will command respect in every capitol ; and who will clearly have the ability to advance our interests around the world .
Hillary ’s appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew American diplomacy and restore our alliances .
There is much to do — from preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to Iran and North Korea , to seeking a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians , to strengthening international institutions .
I have no doubt that Hillary Clinton is the right person to lead our State Department , and to work with me in tackling this ambitious foreign policy agenda .
At a time when we face an unprecedented transition amidst two wars , I have asked Robert Gates to continue as Secretary of Defense , and I ’m pleased that he ’s accepted .
Two years ago , he took over the Pentagon at a difficult time .
He restored accountability .
He won the confidence of military commanders , and the trust of our brave men and women in uniform , and their families .
He earned the respect of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle for his pragmatism and competence .
He knows that we need a sustainable national security strategy — and that includes a bipartisan consensus at home .
As I said throughout the campaign , I will be giving Secretary Gates and our military a new mission as soon as I take office : responsibly ending the war in Iraq through a successful transition to Iraqi control .
We will also ensure that we have the strategy — and resources — to succeed against al Qaeda and the Taliban .
As Bob said not too long ago , Afghanistan is where the war on terror began , and it is where it must end .
And going forward , we will continue to make the investments necessary to strengthen our military and increase our ground forces to defeat the threats of the 21st century .
Eric Holder has the talent and commitment to succeed as Attorney General from his first day on the job , which is even more important in a transition that demands vigilance .
He has distinguished himself as a prosecutor , a Judge , and a senior official , and he is deeply familiar with the law enforcement challenges we face– from terrorism to counter - intelligence ; from white collar crime to public corruption .
Eric also has the combination of toughness and independence that we need at the Justice Department .
Let me be clear : the Attorney General serves the American people .
And I have every expectation that Eric will protect our people , uphold the public trust , and adhere to our Constitution .
Janet Napolitano offers the experience and executive skill that we need in the next Secretary of Homeland Security .
She has spent her career protecting people — as a US Attorney , an Attorney General , and as Governor of Arizona .
She understands the need for a Department of Homeland Security that has the capacity to help prevent terrorist attacks and respond to catastrophe — be it manmade or natural .
Janet assumes this critical role having learned the lessons — some of them painful — of the last several years , from 9/11 to Katrina .
She insists on competence and accountability .
She knows firsthand the need to have a partner in Washington that works well with state and local governments .
She understands as well as anyone the danger of an unsecure border .
And she will be a leader who can reform a sprawling Department while safeguarding our homeland .
Susan Rice will take on the crucial task of serving as Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations .
Susan has been a close and trusted advisor .
As in previous Administrations , the UN Ambassador will serve as a member of my cabinet and integral member of my team .
Her background as a scholar , on the National Security Council , and Assistant Secretary of State will serve our nation well at the United Nations .
Susan knows that the global challenges we face demand global institutions that work .
She shares my belief that the UN is an indispensable — and imperfect — forum .
She will carry the message that our commitment to multilateral action must be coupled with a commitment to reform .
We need the UN to be more effective as a venue for collective action — against terror and proliferation ; climate change and genocide ; poverty and disease .
Finally , I am convinced that General James Jones is uniquely suited to be a strong and skilled National Security Advisor .
Generations of Joneses have served heroically on the battlefield — from the beaches of Tarawa in World War II , to Foxtrot Ridge in Vietnam .
Jim ’s Silver Star is a proud part of that legacy .
He will bring to the job the dual experience of serving in uniform and as a diplomat .
He has commanded a platoon in battle , served as Supreme Allied Commander in a time of war , and worked on behalf of peace in the Middle East .
Jim is focused on the threats of today and the future .
He understands the connection between energy and national security , and has worked on the frontlines of global instability – from Kosovo to northern Iraq to Afghanistan .
He will advise me and work effectively to integrate our efforts across the government , so that we are effectively using all elements of American power to defeat unconventional threats and promote our values .
I am confident that this is the team that we need to make a new beginning for American national security .
This morning , we met to discuss the situation in Mumbai and some of the challenges that we face in the months and years ahead .
In the coming weeks , I will be in close contact with these advisors , who will be working with their counterparts in the Bush Administration to make sure that we are ready to hit the ground running on January 20 .
Given the range of threats that we face — and the vulnerability that can be a part of every presidential transition —
I hope that we can proceed swiftly for those national security officials who demand confirmation .
We move forward with the humility that comes with knowing that there are brave men and women protecting us on the front lines .
Troops serving their second , third , or fourth tours .
Diplomats and intelligence officers in dangerous corners of the world .
FBI agents in the field , cops on the beat , prosecutors in our courts , and cargo inspectors at our ports .
These selfless Americans whose names are unknown to most of us will form the backbone of our effort .
If we serve as well as they do , we will protect our country and promote our values .
And we move forward with respect for America ’s tradition of a bipartisan national security policy , and a commitment to national unity .
When it comes to keeping our nation and our people safe , we are not Republicans and we are not Democrats : we are Americans .
There is no monopoly of power or wisdom in either party .
Together , as one nation , as one people , we can shape our times instead of being shaped by them .
Together , we will meet the challenges of the 21st century not with fear , but with hope .
Now , before I take questions , I ’d like to invite my team to say a few words , starting with my friend Hillary Clinton .
Thank you .
( CNN ) --
The Fresno Police Department has launched an internal investigation after amateur video surfaced of two officers punching and beating a man during his arrest .
The officers involved in the incident were placed on limited duty pending the outcome of an internal probe .
The incident , captured on video by an amateur photographer and aired by CNN affiliate KSEE , occurred on Monday , said police spokesman Jeff Cardinale .
Authorities in Fresno , California , became aware of the recording Tuesday and launched the internal investigation after seeing the video , he said .
KSEE identified the man attacked in the video as 52 - year - old Glen Beaty and reported he is homeless .
Police Chief Jerry Dyer told KSEE that Beaty had previous violent confrontations with authorities , and that his record includes resisting arrest and injuring a sheriff 's deputy .
However , " I think the initial reaction of people that view this video will be one of disbelief , " the chief said , according to KSEE .
" It will be one that in some cases may shock individuals , one that causes concern in terms of the level of force being used . "
Watch the tape of the violent arrest »
The video shows officers punching Beaty several times as he lay on the ground .
Beaty was ultimately arrested on a felony warrant Monday , the chief said .
Cardinale said the officers involved in the arrest have been placed on limited duty pending the outcome of the internal investigation .
The officers were not identified .
KSEE said it received the video from an amateur photographer , whom it did not identify , but quoted as saying , " I do n't think anybody should be beat like that .
They do n't beat dogs and let you get away with it . "
Dyer told KSEE that Beaty was found with alcohol around him and it was apparent he had been drinking heavily .
He refused to answer officers ' questions and a physical altercation occurred , according to police reports .
" One of the officers was punched by the suspect in the arm , " Dyer said .
" The officer had his badge ripped off of his shirt .
There was also an attempt to jab the officer in the arm with a pen that the suspect had taken from the officer 's shirt . "
Officers did not use a Taser on Beaty , he said , because he was wearing a heavy jacket at the time .
An ambulance was called to take Beaty to the hospital after the incident , KSEE said , but police did not collect witness statements .
Dyer said that would be done as part of the internal investigation .
Authorities will allow time for all the evidence to be gathered before making an official opinion , he said .
Beaty was in police custody as of Wednesday , Cardinale said .
CNN 's attempts to contact him were unsuccessful .

CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) --
An Illinois legislative committee Thursday unanimously recommended impeaching embattled Gov. Rod Blagojevich amid corruption allegations .
Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich may face federal corruption charges .
Blagojevich was arrested last month after federal prosecutors alleged , among other things , that he tried to sell the Senate seat President - elect Barack Obama vacated .
The issue will now be taken up by the full Illinois state House of Representatives .
" Today is the day that we begin to give back democracy to the people of the state of Illinois , " Democratic Rep. Jack Franks said as he cast his " aye " vote .
Blagojevich " has been AWOL and derelict of his duties .
He has abused his powers , and he has brought shame to this great state , " Franks said .
" I believe that Rod Blagojevich is a liar , and I believe he is a thief , " Franks said .
" He has stolen the trust of the people . "
The committee heard testimony Thursday afternoon from Roland Burris , the man Blagojevich appointed to succeed President - elect Barack Obama in the U.S. Senate .
Burris denied any quid pro quo with Blagojevich for his appointment to the U.S. Senate .
Burris , former attorney general for Illinois , is not accused of engaging in " pay - to - play " politics with Blagojevich .
Blagojevich denies any wrongdoing and has rejected calls for his resignation .
" I would have appreciated it if he had stepped aside , and we would not have been made the laughing stock of the country , " said Rep. Mary Flowers , another Democrat .
She noted , however , that the governor is " innocent until proven guilty . "
The 21 - member committee looked into Blagojevich 's actions on a number of issues beyond the federal allegations , including an allegation he withheld state money from a children 's hospital until he received a $ 50,000 campaign donation .
Rep. Chapin Rose , a Republican , called the alleged behavior " repugnant . "
" The report speaks for itself and contains many , many , many acts that I find , and most of my colleagues find , to be impeachable , " Rose said .
" The evidence is overwhelmingly damning , and with that I vote aye , " he said .
U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald initiated a criminal complaint against Blagojevich after listening to wiretaps of the governor 's phone conversations .
Blagojevich was arrested December 9 , but has not been indicted .
A federal judge in Chicago told Fitzgerald he has until April 7 to decide whether to charge the Illinois governor .
The committee 's report says it found the government 's allegations against Blagojevich " shocking " and believes the information in the federal complaint " is sufficiently credible to demonstrate an abuse of office " that was " inconsistent with the governor 's constitutional oath . "
If the full House votes to impeach the governor , the action moves to the state Senate , which would try the case and decide whether to remove him from office .
The Illinois committee 's report points out that Blagojevich does not need to be found guilty of a crime for the House to impeach him .
" An impeachment inquiry is not a criminal proceeding and its purpose is not punitive .
Rather , impeachment is a remedial proceeding to protect the public from an officer who has abused his position of trust , " the report says .
The committee points out that the criminal complaint against Blagojevich alleges he was secretly taped saying he would not appoint anyone to Obama 's seat without some form of compensation .

" The governor repeatedly demonstrated that his decision to appoint a senator would not be based on merits of the candidate or on public policy , but rather on how that appointment could benefit him personally , " the report says .
" The governor directed various individuals to conduct inquiries on his behalf to negotiate deals for the Senate appointment , affirmatively setting into action a plot to trade the Senate appointment for something of value to the governor , " it said .
Blagojevich declined the committee 's offer to testify on his own behalf , the report says .

Today is the first time I ’ve heard of them , and I gotta say , they ’re pretty cool !
According to Miranda Trimmier over at Utne Reader , ” Scraper bikes began as low - budget analogs to the colorful , big - rimmed cars - also called scrapers - often seen cruising around east Oakland .
Tricked - out scavenged frames with foil , colored tape , and candy wrappers , the bikes are a resourceful homage .
Until recently they were a purely local phenomenon .
But after a cameo in a YouTube rap video , prominent placement in the first - ever solar - powered hip - hop festival , and support from Bay Area businesses and museums , the bikes are garnering worldwide attention .
Many people see potential in the maturing scraper bike movement ; they hope the enterprising youth behind it can be a positive force for change in Oakland . ”

New route links Afghanistan to sea , via Iran WAR IN AFGHANISTAN
Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close New route links Afghanistan to sea , via Iran 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
As President Obama 's foreign policy team tries to make lemonade out of the diplomatic lemons it has inherited around the world , one region could represent low - hanging fruit : the Khyber Pass linking Pakistan with Afghanistan .
The historic bottleneck , through which about 75 percent of U.S. supplies bound for Afghanistan travel , has become a hotbed of Taliban activity .
Recent violence - a critical bridge has been destroyed and truck convoys have been bombed - could hamper Obama 's plan to send more troops to Afghanistan , but it also might provide an opportunity .
A new land route has just opened linking Afghanistan to the southern seaports of its next - door neighbor , Iran - and that could be the opening the new administration needs to forge a diplomatic relationship with a regional power the United States has , with rare exception , viewed as the Middle East bogeyman .
" I certainly think it represents an opportunity , particularly because it kind of takes up this relationship where it was last at its most amicable : that is , over Afghanistan , " said Abbas Milani , director of the Iranian Studies Program at Stanford University .
The attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , and the toppling of the Taliban government in Kabul a month later represented a remarkable departure from decades of mutual antipathy between the United States and Iran that peaked with Iran 's revolution and the hostage crisis .
Brief cooperation
That period of cooperation included direct dialogue at a U.N. - sponsored conference in Bonn two weeks after Kabul fell and ultimately included discreet Iranian permission for U.S. flights over Iranian territory and assurances that any U.S. pilots forced to land or crash in Iran would be returned , Milani said .
Since then , relations between the two nations have sunk over U.S. allegations that Iran has sought nuclear weaponry and fomented violence across the Middle East .
Iran has accused the United States of seeking to destroy its government and acting as a regional bully on behalf of Israel .
But last week , Obama and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad each made overtures about their desire to begin talking again .
Ahmadinejad 's call last Tuesday for " talks based on mutual respect and in a fair atmosphere " came less than 24 hours after Obama 's similar call in a press conference .
If Obama is looking for openings , Milani and other analysts said , he should look to Iran to help solve the crisis in the Khyber Pass , the ancient mountain corridor trod in antiquity by Alexander the Great and the traders of the Silk Road .
In recent weeks , the Khyber region in northwest Pakistan has shaken with battles between Pakistani troops and Taliban fighters , who blew up an important bridge and attacked NATO convoys heading to Afghanistan , the end of a journey beginning hundreds of miles away at the Pakistani port city of Karachi .
As invaders throughout history have learned , closing the Khyber Pass can create a logistics nightmare for even the largest army .
Afghanistan is landlocked , with few good routes connecting it to the seas .
The recent violence around the pass has left NATO convoys idling for hours and days awaiting repairs or safe passage .
Alternatives to Khyber
One of the best alternatives is relatively new : a road India built between the Afghan towns of Delaram and Zaranj , which are linked by road with the Arabian Sea - through Iran .
It 's not the only alternative - Afghanistan can be accessed from the northwest , but that route is longer and would require traveling through Russia 's sphere of influence .
And Russia 's relationship with the United States and Europe of late has been less than cordial .
Some analysts hope Obama explores the much shorter path through Iran , with an eye toward renewing the two countries ' sense of shared interests .
Iran has a degree of self - interest in its next - door neighbor that distant Russia lacks .
Iran 's hostility toward the Taliban predates Sept. 11 : the Taliban 's interpretation of Islam holds that the Shiite Muslims who dominate Iran are heretics , and an Iranian diplomat is among those being held by militants .
Iranians are also concerned about the boom in opium poppy cultivation that has swept Afghanistan in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion .
" There 's a lot of common interests - at a broad level , both countries want to see Afghanistan stabilized , neither country wants to see a resurgence of the Taliban , both countries want to stop drug trafficking , " said Karim Sadjadpour , an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
" If the U.S. is contemplating when and how to go about engaging Iran , Afghanistan presents the best opportunity to build confidence . "
NATO might be reaching a similar conclusion .
" We need to stop looking at Afghanistan as if it were an island , " Secretary - General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said late last month .
" We need a discussion that brings in all the relevant players : Afghanistan , Pakistan , India , China , Russia - and yes , Iran . "
A few days later , Gen. John Craddock , an American who is NATO 's supreme allied commander , said that if other NATO members wished to talk to Iran about sending supplies through its borders instead of through the Khyber Pass - fine .
But would it be wise ?
Some analysts question the wisdom of giving Iran new leverage in the region .
" It 's absolutely true to say that every country surrounding Afghanistan wants stability and security , but what you can't forget is they want stability and security on their own terms , " said Michael Rubin , a resident scholar in foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute .
" Oftentimes Iranian terms and U.S. terms are two different things .
I 'm not sure the desire for talks is worth gambling our troops ' supplies . "
Richard Russell , professor of national security affairs at the National Defense University 's Near East - South Asia Center for Strategic Studies , said any talk of logistical agreements with Iran is grossly premature and should wait until new diplomatic contacts between the United States and Iran in neutral territory and other cultural exchanges bear fruit .
" The Iranians are just not business partners right now , " he said .
But other analysts argued that small , practical deals such as opening supply routes can lay the ground for more successful diplomacy later on .
" We need to do these small confidence - building measures that show we can live with each other , we can find ways to work with each other , " said Steven Clemons , who directs the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation .
" Without that , you 'll never have enough trust . "
State Department spokesman Robert Wood said Wednesday that Obama 's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke , visited the Khyber region after meeting with Pakistan 's political leaders .
" The Obama administration is already thinking about this .
I 'm sure Richard Holbrooke has this in mind , " said Carnegie associate Sadjadpour .

Fleeing danger for uncertainty
GAUNT , wide - eyed and layered with grime , hundreds of civilians have started stumbling out of the diminishing patch of northern Sri Lanka that Tamil Tiger rebels continue to defend .
Images released by the army show exhausted men , women and children clutching meagre belongings stuffed into schoolbags , sacks and weathered suitcases .
Few wear shoes or slippers .
Their feet are dusty and cracked from the trek into government - held areas .
Some have injuries but there is no saying which side inflicted them .
With fighting between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam reaching a fierce climax , civilians and the truth are both casualties of war .
Journalists have no access to the battlefront or to the displaced and must depend on information released by the government or the Tigers .
According to army records , more than 30,000 out of an estimated 250,000 civilians have streamed out of Tiger territory this year .
The exodus has been particularly heavy this week and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa , the defence secretary , said a sense of self - preservation will cause the others to surge out more rapidly .
If the fighting does n't force them out , shortages of food , drinking water and other essentials will .
The army maintains that frantic rebels have intensified efforts to retain non-combatants as “ human shields ” .
On February 9th a woman travelling with displaced people blew herself up when about to be searched by soldiers manning the entry point at Vishwamadu .
Ten civilians , including a four - year - old girl , and 19 soldiers were killed .
The government said it was a desperate attempt by the rebels — who did not comment on the bombing — to prevent civilians from deserting them .
On February 10th the Tigers reportedly sprayed bullets into a crowd of people heading towards government areas , killing 19 and injuring at least 75 .
Udaya Nanayakkara , the army 's spokesman , said 1,057 civilians had later made it out with the bodies of the dead .
On the pro-Tiger TamilNet website , C. Ilamparithy , a rebel leader , denied involvement in the incident .
He said commandos from the army had entered their territory and opened fire .
The Tigers have repeatedly accused the army of wilfully shelling civilian - populated places , of starving them of supplies and of bombing hospitals .
The claims are unverifiable .
Amnesty International , a human - rights group , said in a statement that hundreds of civilians have now lost their lives .
Its Sri Lanka expert , Yolanda Foster , gave warning that , “ in a war with no witnesses , it is the civilians who pay the price for both parties ' disregard for international humanitarian law . ”
The International Committee of the Red Cross , which still has a presence in the war zone , also called for restraint .
It said civilians had died in the bombing of hospitals and makeshift medical centres but did not apportion blame .
In government - controlled areas , civilians are registered , “ sorted ” and placed in camps .
Their movement is restricted and they are watched closely for suspicious activity .
They are also uncertain of their fates at the hands of an army that has to root out rebels lurking among them .
The authorities say they will eventually be resettled but that security concerns must be dealt with , “ for everyone 's sake ” .

It seems I usually have negative things to say here , so I wanted to note an example of something positive .
Jeremy ’s work is Computer Science that is imminently relevant to practicing programmers .
I think gradual types are an inevitable feature of future programming languages .
At 0330 hours :
The controllers received the information that there was a UFO 24 miles to the northwest .
A B - 52 jet bomber ( JAG 31 ) flying at 2000 feet was on a calibration check and requests a clearance from radar personnel .
At 0334 " MIB ( Minot ) approach control does JAG 31 have clearance to WT fix at Flight Level 2000 ? "
JAG 31 , Roger climb out on a heading of 290 climb and maintain 5000 .
Stand by for higher altitude .
We 're trying to get it from center now .
At 0335 , the controller asked , " And JAG 31 on your way out to the WT fix request you look out toward your one o'clock position for the next fifteen miles and see if you see any orange glows out there ?
" Roger , roger glows 31 , " Someone is seeing UFOs again ! "
" Roger I see a ........ ( Rest of transmission garbled )
At 0352 , The controller then radioed , " Three one , the UFO is being picked up by weather 's radar also .
Should be at our one o'clock position three miles now "
The pilot said , " We have nothing on our airborne radar and I 'm in some pretty thick haze now and unable to see out that way . "
At 0358 , the pilot then requested an instrument guided approach , and received instructions .
The pilot called , and then the transmitter went dead , but they could hear instructions from the ground .
The controller asked them to squawk ident , " which meant to use the aircraft 's transponder which would paint the controller 's radar with a large , glowing blip with the aircraft 's identification .
At 0400 , the controller then radioed , " JAG 31 if you hear me squawk ident ... JAG 31 ident observed .
Cleared for the approach attempt .
Contact on frequency 271 decimal three and you 're cleared for the low approach .
They continued to have radio problems for another couple of minutes .
At 0402 , they were able to communicate easily .
The pilot said , " Our UFO was off to our left side when we started penetration .
" Roger , understand you did see something on your left side . "
" We had a radar return at about a mile and a quarter , at nine o'clock position for about the time we left 200 to 14 ...
" They discussed the troubles with the transmission and then , the controller asked , " Affirmative .
I was wondering how far out did you see that UFO ? "
" He was about one and a half miles off our left wing at 35 miles when we started in and stayed with us ' til about 10 . "
" I wonder if that could have been your radio troubles ? "
" I do n't know ....
But that 's exactly when they started .
" At 0413 , Jag 31 are you observing any more UFOs ?
Negative on radar .
We can't see anything visually .
JAG 31 , request you have someone report to base ops after you land .
What we have , then , was a group of sightings made by men on the ground , at the missile sites scattered around the base .
There was radar sightings from ground and weather 's radar .
There were visual sightings from the crew of the B - 52 , and an airborne radar sighting where the target traveled at 3,000 miles per hour .
Scope photographs were taken .
There were sightings made by S.Sgt .
Bond the FSC at Nov. Flight , S.Sgt. Smith at Oscar - 1 , Julelt , and Mike Flight Team and a number of men in widely scattered locations .
The object landed at location AA - 43 and the entire observation lasted for 45 minutes .
Fourteen other people in separate locations also reported the UFO .
Security alarm were activated for both the outer and inner ring at the missile sites .
When the guards arrived at the outer door it was open and the combination lock on the inner door had been moved .
Editors Note :
The case in my estimation was never investigated properly .
Project Blue Book personnel never sent a representative and the case was essentially written off despite the interest of several Strategic Air Command generals including 15th Air Force 's Major General Nichols .
The sighting was officially explained by on November 13 , by Lt. Col .
Hector Quintanilla who wrote , " The following conclusions have been reached after a thorough study of the data submitted to Foreign Technology Division .
The ground visual sightings appear to be of the star Sirius and the B - 52 , which was flying in the area .
The B - 52 radar contact and the temporary loss of the UHF transmission could be attributed to a plasma similar to ball lightning .
The air visual from the B - 52 could be the star Vega , which was on the horizon at the time , or it could be a light on the ground , or possibly a plasma .
No further investigation by the Foreign Technology Division is contemplated .
This is a classic Blue Book case where dozens of Air Force personnel who see B - 52s and stars nightly have their testimony doubted .
They know when they 've seen a UFO .
In this case the scientists doing the Condon report agreed that this was a real UFO .
The apparent damage to the missile site and disruption of B - 52 radio transmissions was in my opinion a threat to primary nuclear offensive systems and should not have been trivialized .
The records speak for themselves .
This article was taken from Scientific Ufology written by Captain Kevin D. Randle USAFR .
I consider this his finest book and recommend its reading .
This case like thousands of others are explained away with any simple mundane explanation that can be found .
Yet many cases involve the tampering of key government weapon systems .
It appears Quintanilla either did not care or had instructions to write off most of the sightings with any available excuse .
I wonder why the reports were white washed , while the Air Force 's scientific advisor Alan Hynek was coming to the opposite conclusion that , UFOs were real ?

Captain Kevin Randle book " Scientific Ufology "
When the English biologist Charles Darwin published " The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection " in 1859 , the former theology student knew his theory of evolution would cause a scientific and religious uproar .
He confided to family and friends it was " like confessing a murder . "
But within two years , President Abraham Lincoln saw a military corollary of Darwin 's theory play out as the North 's superior firepower vanquished Southern soldiers : survival of the fittest on ruthless display .
While Darwin studied finches and fossils , the bones of dead Americans provided a grisly case study of what later became known as social Darwinism , says one historian .
" Once Darwin became known , ( people ) could look back at the Civil War and say , ' That 's the laboratory .
You can see it happen , ' " says James Bratt , professor of religious and intellectual history at Calvin College .
Meanwhile , Lincoln surveyed the bloody laboratory and , in his 1865 second inaugural address , invoked a mysterious yet merciful God by quoting Psalm 19 : " The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether . "
" He was not a Christian by most measures of the term , " Bratt says .
" And yet he gives a more Christ - like expression of forgiveness and humility than virtually all the pulpiteers around him . "
Rare courage
Lincoln and Darwin :
They seem to have little in common other than both were born on Feb. 12 , 1809 .
But they also are linked by bold ideas and rare courage that profoundly changed history -- and continue to influence American culture .
This week , the bicentennials of these historical giants brought forth tributes from churches as well as universities and civic groups .
Both men grappled with faith and doubt amid immense change , leaving rich legacies for religious thought and how it functions in society .
" Here you have in one day the celebration of two people who had different ideas and provided us with two different metaphors to understand community , " says the Rev. Brent Smith , pastor of All Souls Community Church in Grand Rapids .
Smith 's Unitarian Universalist congregation honored Lincoln Sunday with readings from the Gettysburg Address and his second inaugural address .
Lincoln and Darwin shared a commitment to reason and realism but had very different ideas about human community , Smith says .
Where Darwin saw humans as part of " an evolving living organism , " Lincoln saw a covenant community based on rights transcending human institutions .
" If African slaves are human beings , then they have rights , and they 're given by God and not the government , " Smith said .
He sees Lincoln 's legacy continuing today in President Barack Obama , who has utilized Lincoln 's example as he faces national crises .
" I think this is what Obama understands about Lincoln , " Smith said .
" The human condition is tragic , but there is a providence that shoots through human existence that is redemptive . "
Evolution Weekend
His church also will recognize Darwin Sunday as part of an " Evolution Weekend " being observed by close to 1,000 churches nationally .
Smith is one of more than 12,000 signers of the Clergy Letter Project asserting that biblical truth and modern science " may comfortably coexist . "
Darwin's birth also is being celebrated by Michigan 's Center for Inquiry and other nonbelievers marking his evolution revolution .
But there 's no celebrating among religious conservatives pushing for God-inclusive creation theories in classrooms .
Despite polls showing close to half of Americans reject evolution , some see fears fading that Darwin threatens Scriptural belief .
" God did it , Darwin described it , " sums up the Rev. Ian Lawton , pastor of Christ Community Church in Spring Lake , which Sunday culminates a three - week series on science and religion .
" God 's behind ( creation ) , Darwin neatly described the patterns of it , and those patterns are wondrous . "
Lawton sees wonder in Darwin 's elegant explanation of nature 's complexity as well as timely truth in his placing humans in a broader environmental context .
His theory of ever - evolving life resonates more powerfully than ever , Lawton argues .
" Particularly at a time like this when there 's a lot of crisis in the world , the thought that there are always second chances , there 's always more to be understood -- that 's a very hopeful , encouraging message , " Lawton says .
Darwin's message often is misunderstood by those who see his theories threatening religion , says Gregory Forbes , director of the national Evolution Education Institute .
Forbes notes Darwin graduated from Cambridge with a degree in theology and originally wanted to be a parson .
Darwin agonized over the religious import of his discoveries , taking 25 years to publish " Origin of Species . "
But even then he wrote the " grandeur " of creation was " originally breathed by the Creator . "
He died an agnostic , not denying God 's existence but concluding it could not be proved or disproved scientifically , Forbes said .
Door to modern thought
Darwin's theory destroyed scientific and religious dogma , opening the way for modern thought , adds Forbes , a biology professor at Grand Rapids Community College .
" Darwin stood up and said , ' It 's OK to think outside the box . '
That 's what we value in Western culture . "
Calling evolution " the most well - substantiated theory science has ever seen , " Forbes said it pervades society from medicine to marketing .
" As the marketing environment changes and you do not , you become extinct , " Forbes says .
" GM should know . "
But pervasive though it may be socially , evolution as a biological theory continues to meet stiff resistance .
The Louisiana legislature last year ruled public school teachers could teach alternative theories .
Debate about evolution is about more than religious defensiveness , says Nigel Crompton , a biology professor at Cornerstone University .
Crompton argues natural selection can explain evolutionary adaptations in simpler life forms , such as birds , but not in larger biological systems and humans .
" He got it right to a certain extent , " Crompton says of Darwin , but adds , " I personally think God created man . "
Crompton also worries evolutionary theory has encouraged " reductive " thought that sees living things as the sum of their parts .
That 's like " trying to understand Shakespeare based on the letters , " he says .
" If you do not feel there is some kind of God or designer behind the created order , then you stop seeing meaning behind that , " Crompton adds .
Darwin 's biological theory transformed over time into a social theory that he never intended , says Calvin College 's Bratt .
" How people interpreted what he taught about the natural world got applied to the social world in a way that warranted hard - knuckle , capitalist industrialization , " Bratt says .
That way of thinking was not too far from Lincoln's , who favored government backing big business to promote progress , Bratt says .
Like Darwin , he had a materialist view of life in his younger days and not much spirituality .
But America 's trials shaped his religious views .
Though he did not believe in the divinity of Jesus -- his wife , Mary , said he was religious but " not a technical Christian " -- Lincoln used political speech that was " deeply saturated with religious language , " Bratt says .
Religious imagery pours through his second inaugural address and its prophetic phrase , " With malice toward none ; with charity for all ; with firmness in the right , as God gives us to see the right , let us strive to finish the work we are in . "
" That call to humility and mercy in the second inaugural is the best American civil religion can do , " Bratt says .
Lincoln 's assassination on Good Friday is a powerful symbol of his role in our history , Bratt adds .
" He is the dying Messiah of the nation .
He redeemed the nation of its original sin , slavery .
In his death , he brings the separated parts of the nation together . "

New Haven Mayor John DeStefano ( in center ) about to cut the ribbon on a new bridge over a newly paved section of the Farmington Canal Trail .
( Photos by Elly Blue )
As I was biking into downtown New Haven this morning ( it ’s about a 4 mile ride from my parents ’ house in Hamden just to the north ) I happened across a small crowd of people standing on what had just yesterday been an impassable construction zone on Hillhouse Avenue .
Two men were holding a shining red ribbon across the roadway , a couple of reporters scribbled notes and took photos , and a local news station was there .
Then I recognized New Haven Mayor John DeStefano , reading from a piece of paper .
“ As a kid , this trail was a big part of my outdoor life …
It was useful for getting to the library , or the nearby college where my mom worked , or to go rollerblading . ”
It was the ribbon cutting ceremony for a rebuilt bridge over the old Farmington canal .
As I rode up , I could hear DeStefano speaking .
First there had been a river , he said , then a canal , then the railroad , and now the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail .
He cut the ribbon to polite applause , and I rode on .
The Farmington Canal Trail stretches 84 miles , from New Haven to Northampton , Massachusetts .
It ’s a neat trail , with a lot of connections to interesting historical destinations , including a number of old canal locks that have been preserved .
Unfortunately , it is n’t all paved .
A recently paved section
of the trail in downtown New Haven .
As a kid , this trail was a big part of my outdoor life .
Its first paved section was for the ten miles directly to the north of my house .
It was useful for getting to the library , or the nearby college where my mom worked , or to go rollerblading .
When I was on the cross country team in high school , we would go running on overgrown , unpaved sections .
But the part of the trail that figured most in my life was the section to the south , which could have taken me all the way to New Haven , but was never paved and never even usable as a hiking path .
This was a constant source of longing and frustration , especially when I was living in New Haven and biking north on non-bikeable streets to have dinner with my parents every week .
In recent years , though , there has been some progress .
Significant parts of the trail in New Haven are now paved , creating a bicycle highway from the edge of Hamden right into downtown .
Using this section of the trail instead navigating a maze of one - way city streets takes at least ten minutes off of my travel time from my parents ’ house to the Publick Cup , the coffeeshop where I ’ve been working .
The Farmington Canal trail is clearly part of the growing popularity of rail trails since Rails to Trails helped gain federal funding for the paved paths the 1990s .
It looks like this thing has momentum .
I ’m looking forward to the day when I can come back here and take a ride on a nice summer day all the way from New Haven to Northampton .
For now , it ’s really good to see better bike infrastructure coming to my old home town .
Update : After posting this story I got an email from Norm Thetford of the Farmington Canal Rail to Trail Association .
He wrote that the gaps in the trail between New Haven and Hamden are scheduled to be completely paved by summer of 2009 .
At that point the trail will be complete from Hillhouse Avenue in downtown New Haven all the way north to Cheshire .
The next step in the works , Thetford wrote , is to continue paving the trail south from Hillhouse Ave all the way south to Long Wharf ( where there is a theater , a hot dog factory , and an Ikea , among other destinations ) .
This section is fully funded , and is currently in the design phase .
A note on funding : Thetford said that the new and near - future sections of the trail have come from a combination of specially appropriated federal monies and the federal Transportation Enhancement portion of the Federal Highway Association budget .
Yale has been providing the required local matching funds through investments in bridges over the trail such as the one pictured above .
I ’ll have more reports coming up in the next few days from my stay in New Haven .

I 'm in the middle of reading ' Dreams from my father ' ( Obama 's first autobiography ) , and am starting to believe that Obama is far more progressive and left wing than he led everyone to believe during the election .
Obama 's rhetoric during the battles with Clinton and McCain was decidedly cautious - he carved out centrist positions on about every meaningful issue .
But in ' Dreams from my father ' , a far more complex and interesting picture emerges about Obama 's political roots - one far removed from the pro Israel / Free market image he sought to create .

Obama 's book is a highly personal , painful exploration of race and poverty in America , and his insights display a very nuanced understanding of the many socio / economic problems in the States .
Much of Obama 's life experiences came from working as a community organizer in the southside of Chicago , and Obama writes eloquently about the problems of black identity and the devastating effects of Reaganomics he found in the area .
Obama is well versed in thinkers like Edward DuBois , Marcus Garvey , and Malcom X , and describes an affinity for their critiques of western society and their ideals of black self determination .
His views are not particularly radical in educated circles , but are far too the left of centrist Washington doctrine .

The election of a black man to the highest office is in itself a sign of huge social progress , and the tides are turning in favor of keynesian economics after the collapse of the economy .
We have a leader who is at least receptive to the notion of real change , and has a political heritage far more sophisticated and interesting than any other leader in modern history .
Obama 's job now is to recast the center much further to the left , and make sure the dialogue stays there .
If he can controll the message like the Republicans did for the past 30 years , we may be in for an interesting ride .
His book bares much about his character , but until then , it was untested in the public arena .
Now he is in the spot light , we 'll see what he is truly made of .
Edit August 2009 : looks like the service has expanded to all the major cities now .
This service was released in January of this year and I do n't think it 's gotten the fanfare it deserves .
Daum is kind of comparable to Microsoft in that it was first on the scene when the internet first became well - known in the 90s , and for a while it was the site to go to .
It was eventually replaced by Naver as the number one search engine and portal .
This time though they 've beaten their competitors to the punch by investing a ton of money to drive around Seoul and Gyeonggi - do ( the province surrounding the capital city ) and create their version of Street View , which they call Road View ( 로드뷰 ) .
Here 's what it looks like :
This is an intersection by COEX ( an international convention centre ) and a temple known as Bongeun - sa , where all the friendly cats are .
The interface is all in Korean though so I 'll explain how to use it ( it 's almost the same ) .
First , the bar at the bottom :
The arrows on the left and the right are to turn ( you can turn by holding the mouse button down and moving the image as well ) , the plus and minus are to zoom in and out , and the button just to the right of that with the two arrows is to drive automatically in the direction you 're facing .
If you want to head in one direction fast then hit that and the images will blur and you 'll speed up until you reach an intersection and have to decide whether to turn or not .
Hit the same button while you 're driving to stop .
Then on the top you have this :
The button on the left is for a standard map , the one just to the right is " sky view " ( satellite image ) , the next one is road view ( street view ) , and the one on the right is traffic information ( you do n't need that ) .
And besides that it 's exactly the same .
When you hit the road view button then all the streets that have been mapped out turn blue and you can select one to start from .
Since it 's all in Korean though you might want some good starting points , otherwise it might take forever to find something interesting .
Here are a few :
And that 's only scratching the surface .
This covers an area of some 30 million people or so , so there 's a lot to find .
Anatomy of a hedge fund fraud ( not the one you ’re thinking of )
Does regulation prevent fraud ?
Who knows ?
But according to this colorful and detailed account of one famous case , the SEC should think again if it expects to stamp out fraud using new regulatory powers .
The case is Manhattan Capital and the chronicler is Chidem Kurdas , one of the world ’s most experienced and articulate hedge fund journalists .
Kurdas ’ account of the Manhattan case in the Winter 2009 edition of The Independent Review is well worth the read – particularly as we move into an era of greater hedge fund oversight .
Kurdas points out that “ regulatory frenzy occurs every time another fiasco occurs . ”
And when it does , it ’s often ineffective unless an interested party complains after the fact – that is , when the damage is done . ”
Kurdas says that “ at least one aspect of the Manhattan Fund vividly demonstrates regulations failure to deter fraud . ”
But it ’s clear that this case study ( written before the Madoff Affair ) may provide some important lessons .
In a nutshell , here ’s what happened …
Michael Berger , described by Kurdas in this blog post as a “ restless ” 22 year old Austrian immigrant , launched Manhattan in 1996 with a decidedly bearish view of equities .
According to Kurdas ’ account , he raised $ 600 million over 4 years from investors who , like him , wanted to take out a sort of “ insurance ” against a market downturn .
The problem , of course , was that this market downturn did n’t come soon enough for Berger and his investors .
Although Manhattan was later described as a Ponzi scheme , Kurda ’s explains that it was actually a “ real investment operation ” .
But as losses mounted , Berger began to cook the books by submitting fake holdings data to his administrator .
That administrator trusted Berger ’s data since it purportedly came directly from the fund ’s introducing broker – a small Ohio firm that in turn used Bear Stearns as its prime broker .
The problem was , Manhattan accounted for a significant portion of the introducing broker ’s revenue – leading some to believe that it was too quick to acquiesce to Berger ’s demands .
One of the those demands was that the firm send holdings information directly to him , not to the administrator .
Well , you can guess what happened .
Berger re-cast those numbers before passing them off to the administrator .
When people asked about any discrepancies , he told then that the fund actually used several prime brokers – meaning only he had the full picture .
Eventually , Bear Stearns saw the red flags and alerted the SEC about the discrepancies between their data and Berger ’s reports .
Berger eventually fled the country and was picked up several years later by US authorities .
Ironically , writes Kurdas , the only law suit that exists to this day involves Bear Stearns – the whistle blower , but also , unfortunatley , the firm with the deepest pockets .
The SEC initially blamed a lack of regulation for the fiasco .
But it ’s far from certain that the regulation eventually proposed for hedge funds would have helped in this case .
As Kurdas points out :
“ The long - established regulatory regime from brokerages did not deter the [ introducing broker ’s ] executives , but instead gave them the status to assist Berger ’s cover up …
The aura of being supervised by the U.S. government almost certainly helped [ the broker ] play that role . ”
“ The case of Manhattan Capital ’s Ohio broker is just one of many examples in which government supervision was already extensive and yet ineffective in preventing malfeasance .
Decade after decade , illegal schemes crop up in closely regulated regulated industries . ”
But what if Manhattan itself was registered with the SEC and had been examined by the commission ?
Kurdas questions whether it would have actually uncovered the scam .
After all , she says , “ If there had been a chance of an SEC examination , he [ Berger ] would have prepared for it . ”
Kurdas goes on to explore the psychological and behavioral aspects of the case , saying that Berger ’s “ … confidence and audacity helped convince people .
He would n’t dare tell barefaced lies [ about the fund ] , would he ?
His explanation had to be true . ” ( sound familiar ? )
As you read this story , you will quickly see the parallels to more recent fiascoes .
But what is truly ironic about this captivating tale is that Berger acted as both fraudster and whistle blower .
His investment strategy was based on a belief that companies like Enron and Worldcom were themselves cooking the books .
But his complaints to the SEC fell on deaf ears .
Writes Kurdas :
“ At the time , however , attempts to bring up the issue were futile .
Regulators showed no interest , even though Berger ’s repeated warnings suggested that anyone willing to look could see the sleight of hand . ”

Philip José Farmer was part of that first generation of authors who put science fiction on the map — above is a clipping of a 1954 newspaper that shows him , his wife and Isaac Asimov sporting a bow tie to give you a context of the man and his times .
Farmer was unusual in that unlike so many other writers of the genre he managed to weave many sexual themes into his science fiction stories .
The book that would put him on the map was the novel Flesh which was published in 1960 .
When it first came out the book received a rather lukewarm review , but a revised expanded edition eight years later won him more praise — and today the book is acclaimed as a landmark novel of the genre .
Later Farmer would go onto write the Riverworld series of books which would inspire a role - playing game , a television series and a PC computer game .

Security screeners at Los Angeles County ’s 48 court buildings last year confiscated 53,302 knives , 24,783 scissors , 21,014 razors , 8,208 pairs of handcuffs and 114 stun guns -- enough to equip a small army .
Those figures form one of the more interesting -- and unsettling -- statistical categories in the latest Los Angeles County Superior Court annual report .
The review found that the number of banned weapons seized jumped to 245,868 from 199,015 two years earlier .
A total of 21 million screenings were performed in the L.A. court system , the nation ’s largest , in the first 10 months of last year .
Other finds : assorted hand tools , brass knuckles and a sword disguised as a cane .

Screeners also seized seven unspecified lethal weapons , two daggers and two handguns .
In one instance at the Long Beach courthouse , security personnel found a gun hidden inside a woman ’s diaper bag .
The woman had come to see her husband , who was appearing in court to face charges of making terrorist threats , and was unaware she was carrying the gun .
“ The weapons screen capability is literally life and death for anyone who works or does business in courthouses , ” said court spokesman Allan Parachini .
“ As time - consuming as people may find it , it is absolutely critical . ”

Security screenings were instituted a decade ago in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at the downtown civil courthouse .
In September 1995 , a Woodland Hills physician carried a .38 - caliber revolver into the building and fatally shot his ex-wife during a hearing on their divorce petition .
Harry Zelig claimed he was in an uncontrollable haze of rage and fear that coincided with the anniversary of the day his parents were incarcerated in a World War II concentration camp .
Zelig was convicted of first - degree murder in 1997 and sentenced to 35 years to life in state prison .
Since security screenings became widespread , the majority of the guns seized at courthouses in recent years have been taken from lawyers who forgot they had one in their briefcase , Parachini said .
“ As far as we ’re concerned , a gun is a gun , ” he said .
“ Once a gun is inside a courthouse , you have no control over who may have it , who may use it , and who may take it away from someone else and use it .
There is no such thing as a minor gun seizure incident . ”

Anyone coming to a court building should treat the experience like a trip to the airport , Parachini said .
The seized contraband is gathered up at the various courthouses several times a year , loaded onto a truck and destroyed , Parachini said .

' THERE was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment . . .
It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time . "
That quote from George Orwell 's " 1984 " becomes increasingly prescient in light of developments in eavesdropping , pioneered by Google .
Recently the company launched a service called Latitude , which allows consenting users to monitor each other 's whereabouts .
It 's the company 's latest snooping tool , the most controversial being the Street Views photographic mapping service .
When I tried Street Views by entering my address , I was surprised to see that with a single click a truly Orwellian image popped onto the screen : my house , my car , the newspaper in the driveway .
I could zoom in for a clear view of the open window on the second floor and the handy drain pipe that potential burglars might use to reach that window when no one was home .
Google has been working on Street Views for nearly two years , an incredibly tedious process .
As remarkable as the computer results are , they still require hired motorists , known as GeoImmersive Data Producers , to drive up and down every street using 11 roof - mounted cameras to snap 360 - degree images .
Boston was among the first cities captured by Street Views , but much of Massachusetts remains unphotographed .
For example , a two - hour drive from a friend 's house in Lenox to my daughter 's college in Norton yields only two photos : the entrance to the Mass .
Pike and , 96 miles later , the exit to I -495 .
But when Street Views does come to a community , it tends to spark great curiosity and raging debate about the propriety of Google 's remarkable feat .
To some , it is an outrageous invasion of privacy - a true step toward the world Orwell envisioned .
To others , including Google management , it is simply the latest beneficial - and commercially valuable - use of modern technology .
After arguing that Street Views showed nothing more than could be seen by anyone traveling on public property , Google agreed to blur all identifiable faces and license plates .
But by conceding that much , Google opens the door to demands that , say , doors should be blurred , and for that matter upstairs windows and drain pipes .
Of course , it would be naive to think that Big Brother has n't been watching for some time .
From the all - too - obvious ceiling cameras in convenience stores to the government 's exotic keyhole satellites , we 're all photographed more often than we might care to believe .
When US Airways Flight 1549 went down unexpectedly in the Hudson River - not a likely spot for routine surveillance - hidden cameras on shore were able to capture it from several angles .
The federal government has already warned Google not to photograph military installations .
Then there 's North Oaks , Minn. , whose city council contacted Google on behalf of its 4,500 residents , demanding that all photos taken within its borders be deleted .
Existing law makes distinctions between public property and private property ; between public figures and private individuals .
Yet in the Google Universe , these boundaries become fuzzy .
What if I created a reality show for which I stationed a TV crew on the public street outside your house , and spent weeks photographing your every move ?
What if I edited the footage to make the funniest three minutes - including the time you backed the car over the tulips , and the time you chased the neighbor 's cat and slipped ?
And what if , unlike " Candid Camera , " the show my father Allen Funt invented in 1948 , I televised it without your permission ?
Or , what if I paid a team of Data Producers to go through thousands of Street Views , including the one with your home , looking for driveways in need of repair , then sold the list to a paving company ?
With each technological breakthrough , some laws will require reexamination .
So will our definition of privacy .
As someone who , like my father , devoted many years to photographing unsuspecting people , I can report that the latest developments give me pause .
It 's one thing to have a brief , once - in - a - lifetime encounter with a hidden camera .
It 's another thing to live , as Orwell put it , " in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard , and , except in darkness , every movement scrutinized . "

It 's been at least year since George Lucas finished Raping My Childhood� , so it 's about time someone dug up another cherished memory and manoeuvred it into the anal - entry position .
While the prospect of a live - action Transformers movie does indeed kick insane amounts of ass , the execution looks like leaving a lot to be desired at this point in production .
" It 's almost a year until its release ! " you say ?
Well , disembodied internet voice , you 're not wrong , but let 's not forget that this is a project under the supervision of one Michael Bay , a man who emits so much testosterone , oestrogen levels of passing women have been known to drop to dangerous levels when in his presence .
It should be an easy sell , right ?
Two armies of big fucking robots , kicking seven shades of metallic crap out of each other , complete with big guns , badass trucks , snarky villains and fast cars .
Sounds like the kind of thing Bay jerks off about , right ?
Just to make sure he does n't fuck it up , here are ten guidelines Mike needs to stick to if he wants to stay the right side of an group even more dangerous than the Decepticons : internet geeks .
( Warning : this article is dangerous nerdy .
If you are likely to be offended by a man freaking out over the minutiae of a childrens ' cartoon , then this is n't the article for you . )
1. FLAME OFF !
Dude , not a good start .
The tagline for Transformers is ' Robots In Disguise ' , not ' Pimp My Truck ' .
Optimus Prime is not a Hot Wheels car .
He is not a promotional vehicle for a Texas radio station or a Pop Idol tour bus .
The first leaked images released showed everyone 's favourite semi in both forms ; robot and truck .
Prime 's robot form looked to be fairly spot on - faceplate , spiky ear things and the classic red and blue colour scheme .
Except for one small detail ... flames .
Prime 's vehicular incarnation is covered in red and blue flames , the kind of decal only a seven year - old boy would consider cool .
The only person that would drive this truck without shame is Kevin Federline .
It was pretty obvious right from the get - go that us nerds would pick up on the smallest inconsistency and run it into the ground , but even the most nonchalant of movie - goers will be heard to exclaim " Man , that truck looks pretty gay " come July 2007 unless it 's changed pronto .
2. QUIT DRIP - FEEDING US , WE'RE NOT BABIES
Okay , so we are kinda geeking out over a film about giant robots , but please try and treat us fans with some respect .
This does not mean releasing insignificant news snippets every few weeks in an attempt to keep the hype machine from flagging .
First came the teaser poster : an admittedly cool shot of a giant War Of The Worlds - esque eye looming over Earth .
Then came the teaser trailer , which showed us precisely nothing ( and actually managed to be less than insignificant in referencing Mars , when Mars does n't even feature in the film ) .
Next , teaser posters of the Autobot and Decepticon logos , which have n't changed a jot .
Then an announcement of an announcement , followed a few days later by the announcement itself , which was in fact , just a list of the transformers included and did n't include any casting information .
Jesus , it 's a wonder they did n't reveal Optimus Prime bolt by bolt .
" Ironhide 's clutch revealed - click here ! "
3. INVITE BACK THE ORIGINAL CAST
The only member of the robot voice cast to be announced is Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime , the guy who voiced him in the TV series and the original movie .
This is definitely A Good Thing ; hearing George Clooney 's voice coming from a truck would be odd , to say the least .
In fact , Bay would do well to bring back most if not all of the original voice cast , including Frank Welker , a dude who has a r�sum� that would make even the Voiceover Man bow down in adoration - he was Uni from Dungeons & Dragons , people , we 're talking about a living legend here !
Hearing celebrity voices coming out of helicopters and tanks just wo n't do : no one wants to see Megatron voiced by Jude Law or Starscream voiced by Jack Black .
He 'd probably insist on an air guitar solo or something , and that 's not cool .
4. " HE'S GOT A TINY ROBOT COCK " The designs of the original transformers were , quite simply , awesome .
As a kid , I used to sit in awe and watch as the characters effortlessly switched from road - churning vehicles to butt - stomping robot overlords without even breaking a sweat , loving the simplicity of the concept and the sleek and different designs of each different character .
The designs leaked for the movie transformers just do n't have the same essence as the 80's ones did : they 're all gears , cogs , shafts and machinations .
Simply , they 're too busy , too real .
We do n't need to see the inner workings of the characters , or how part A transforms into part B : leave a bit of mystery intact .
Optimus Prime looks a little weedy round the mid-section as a result , Starscream looks like he'd fall over in a high wind and the less said about the hastily - removed Work In Progress images of Megatron the better ( to quote one of the less rabid Ain't It Cool talkbackers : " He looks like a fucking chandelier !
" ) .
5. LESS OF THE HUMANS
Hands up all of you who can remember the human characters from the cartoon series .
Anyone ?
Yeah , that 's right : there was that dude who may or may not have been in a wheelchair ( or was that in Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors ?
Man , there 's a concept ripe for an update ) and was probably called Spike or something .
Point in fact : no one gave a shit about the humans in the cartoon , and I 'm pretty sure the only people going to see next year 's movie because of Shia LaBeouf will be Shia LaBeouf , and possibly his close friends and family .
I expect metal - on - metal carnage , vehicular violence and the almighty din caused by jets , tanks , huge cannons and trucks all waging a bloody war - fest on each other .
I do not expect scenes of light relief featuring fleshy bipeds like Dane Cook , or fresh - faced MTV - raised teens teaching robots how to love and cry .
Bay could easily move up a notch in my book if he 's willing to have a scene in which Optimus Prime repeatedly runs over Tyrese Gibson while honking his horn in jubilation .
You would n't even have to do it in CGI .
6. THE SOUNDS OF SCIENCE
A pretty simple one , this : keep the classic transforming noise .
You know the one : koo - koo - ka - kaa .
Or maybe it 's khoo - khoo - kah - kah .
You know the one I mean : it sounds like a vomiting robot .
Judging from the teaser trailer , they 've dropped it and gone with a rather dull whirring and clunking , which has precisely zero charm .
If you want to impress us twentysomething nerds , you need to cater to our basic needs : we want to be leaving the cinema making the noise in the back of our throats while secretly wishing our Ford Focus would change into a giant shit - kicking robot .
Coo - cooh - ka - kaagh .
Damn it , a Welshman would know how to spell it .
7. LET STEVEN HAVE A PLAY I 'm throwing this one open to the forum here , because I simply can't be bothered to find out for myself : what the fuck does an executive producer actually do ?
Because in my mind , an executive producer is the guy who nods his head , watches his bank balance rise by several million dollars , then falls back asleep in his reclining leather chair .
One Steven Spielberg is the executive producer on this picture , yet I doubt he 'll have any physical input whatsoever , other than milking Megatron 's metallic nipples for dimes .
If director Michael Bay was a smart man ( which I think we can all assume he is not ) , then he'd step aside and let the Berg take control of a few scenes .
Remember that awesome reveal scene from War of the Worlds , where the Tripods rise up from under ground ?
Imagine the transformers making their entrance on Earth in a similar style , shot subtly , suspensefully and masterfully by Spielberg .
Unfortunately , with Bay behind the camera , it 'll be all flashy camera moves and a heavy rock soundtrack with at least four exploding helicopters per scene .
8. AIM IT AT THE RIGHT AUDIENCE I 'm fully aware of the studios need to make money and to pitch films at a wider audience in their pursuit of the almighty dollar , but do n't forget who Transformers ' target market is : sweaty males in their mid-twenties with no girlfriend and a hard - on for robot porn .
Us , in other words .
Forget about updating it for a modern audience ( Megatron should have a mullet , fashion be damned ) and do n't bother with any of that Armada or Beast Wars crap : as a child of the 80's , I want characters I know and love .
Reading through a bewildering array of information on the Transformers Wikipedia entry , I 've become aware of about a billion different storylines from a million different mediums , but I 'll wager dollars for donuts , most people want to see old - school trannies getting pissy about Energon Cubes than some shit about a Constructicons trade embargo .
9. SORT OUT THE CHARACTERS
Like the massive spazmos we all are , we waited with baited breath to see which transformers made the final cut and got drafted into the movie .
But when our eyes darted down the cast list , once , twice , three times , it was clear there were some serious omissions from the register .
Prime and Megatron are a given , Starscream , Ironhide and Ratchet are all quite welcome and Bumblebee can go fuck himself .
But where the hell is Soundwave ?
What 's with all the new generation baddies ?
I do not know who Blackout is .
Barricade does not get me hard .
I keep stopping people in the street and asking them who the hell Scorponok is and they look just as confused as me .
Is it that much to ask for a gigantic robot dinosaur or two ?
I mean ... fucking Scorponok .
He 's the Theo Walcott of the Transformers squad .
10 . AUTOBOTS ... ROLL OUT !
AGAIN !
Nobody can deny a long - running Transformers movie series is indeed a prospect that could pop even the laziest of semi-ons into boners .
What we do not want is it turning into a ' franchise ' .
Movies are n't planned these days on how exciting they 'll be or how much enjoyment the audience will gain from them ; they 're meticulously plotted so as to leave us wanting more , to force us to buy accompanying materials to fill in the gaps the movie does n't show and to cram our living rooms with Transformers toys come Christmas time .
This being the first movie of the proposed series , studio bigwigs will intentionally hold back on the good stuff and keep it back for the sequels , meaning we 'll quite probably get short changed on quite a few counts if we 're expecting the complete Transformers experience .
We 're quite used to getting shafted when it comes to big summer movies like this , but I for one can still remember a day when movies had a beginning , a middle and an end , and did n't require you to sit on your nuts for two years while the studios raised the effects budget for the sequel , " where the real story begins ... "
