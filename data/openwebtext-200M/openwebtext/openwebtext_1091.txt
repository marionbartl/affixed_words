MEXICO CITY ( AP )  Refineries in the United States bought millions of dollars worth of oil siphoned from Mexican government pipelines and smuggled across the border  in some cases by drug cartels expanding their reach , the United States Justice Department said on Monday .
At least one American oil executive has pleaded guilty to a conspiracy that involved what prosecutors said was about $ 2 million in stolen Mexican oil , Justice Department officials said .
On Tuesday , the United States Department of Homeland Security is scheduled to hand over $ 2.4 million to Mexico ’s tax administration , the first batch of money seized during a joint investigation into smuggled oil that the authorities expect to lead to more arrests and seizures .
“ The United States is working with the Mexican government on the theft of oil , ” said Nancy Herrera , spokeswoman for the United States attorney ’s office in Houston .
“ It ’s an ongoing investigation , with one indictment so far . ”
When Ewan McGregor , Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle shot to fame with Trainspotting – so did Lorenzo Agius , the photographer who took the film 's iconic black - and - white publicity shots .
A year later , in 1997 , his photograph of Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit defined Cool Britannia on a Vanity Fair front cover .
It is , says Agius proudly , the only time the magazine 's legendary cover has been shot by a photographer on their first shoot .
Since then , he has regularly photographed A - listers from Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt to Beyoncé , often capturing them in unexpected ways with his characteristic naturalness and quirky humour .
From 14 September to 14 October , a selection of his images will be on show at the Alon Zakaim Fine Art gallery in London 's Mayfair .
There is Jack Nicholson jumping , Jude Law and Ewan McGregor having breakfast in bed together , Madonna eyeballing a mouse and many others .
His intimate images capture the essence of his subjects .
" With Ewan as Renton [ in Trainspotting ] , you can see what he 's like and that he 's suffering .
He is going cold turkey and he 's lost , " Agius explains .

Similarly , when he shot Gallagher and Kensit , Agius contrasted their images to emphasise why they were Britain 's
It couple , capturing the zeitgeist at the height of Cool Britannia and Britpop .
" The whole thing for me was beauty and the beast – Liam was the ruffian who would wear a hat and smoke a fag in bed so I told him to be tough and stare me down .
Patsy was the babe so I told her to be all over her man , " he explains .
Interestingly , Agius describes Liam as being incredibly quiet on the shoot .
" At that point he was at his most rebellious and angry and was annoyed off with anyone fussing around him .
He could n't handle it , " says Agius .
Some images reveal real emotions , such as his portrait of Eddie Izzard who , Agius says , was actually crying .
" I wanted to show the flip side of comedians as many are paranoid , insecure and depressive .
Eddie started to cry as he was thinking about his mother who had died .
He was sad that everyone was thinking about Princess Diana , who died in the same week , and not about his mother .
It 's easy to get someone laughing and joking but rare that someone lets you into themselves and into such a private moment , " he says .
For Agius , the best shots are those which are spontaneous , because they happen so rarely .
For example , Jack Nicholson jumping in the air and clicking his heels as he and Agius were talking about Fred Astaire or Sienna Miller creating a moustache as she relaxed in a bath .
" We were drinking , smoking and fooling around .
I was shooting Sienna around the bath with one foot on the side – a real Blow Up moment .
And suddenly she made a moustache with her wet hair . "
Other unplanned elements can also work well as they allow the personality of the actor to emerge .
Agius recalls a shoot with Hugh Jackman on the roof of a hotel in downtown Los Angeles .
" Suddenly , Hugh started to climb from the roof onto the metal signage high above the street .
His publicists were freaking out but he's an action man so I let him do it , " he says .
Agius is n't afraid of provoking his subjects , either .
" Carlyle was so aggressive as Begby in the film [ Trainspotting ] that I wanted it to come through in the shots .
It was like a screaming match , a frenzy .
He was opening beer cans and spraying them everywhere until we were both covered in it .
I was screaming at him .
So he stuck his fingers up in the V - sign that made the shot . "
He also pushes the boundaries of his stars .
For example , the shots of McGregor and Law in bed together .
" Jude did n't want to do it at first because he was worried about how he would be portrayed , but he agreed after I said , ' Let 's channel Morecambe and Wise , ' " he recalls .
" For the shot in the bathroom , I could n't stop them laughing .
Jude pulled his trousers and pants down and sat on the toilet reading the newspaper , as Ewan stripped off naked and got into the bath .
It was as if they were an everyday couple , " he says .
Agius likes to bring out a different side to his stars , too .
Describing his shoot of Madonna around the time she published her first children 's book , The English Roses , he says , " I wanted to capture her softer side , as the writer of children 's books , rather than her usual strong , masculine images .
At first , it was difficult for her to be herself .
It looked like she did n't know what to do but when I gave her directions such as lean against the bookshelf with her legs in the shape of an M , she started to relax and let her personality come out . "
He also tries to reveal a private side of the celebrity .
" My shot of Tom Cruise , relaxing in his chair is just like a picture of you or I .
He 's in a private moment of reflection .
It is all about what 's behind the eyes and in the head .
Suddenly , he connected to something and opened up .
You can see the connection in the eyes , " he explains .
Gaining trust is crucial .
It allows him to capture natural moments even in sensitive times .
His shot , for example , of Kiefer Sutherland on location for 24 shows the actor with stitches in his head after one of his infamous bar brawls .
The TV cameras had to film around him until his face healed .
" He allowed me to shoot him because we have developed a relationship over the years .
No one likes being photographed .
It 's time consuming and they may not know the photographer and lots of photographers can be a nightmare .
So it 's good to work with someone you know " .
For Agius , the image portrays Sutherland as he is .
" He 's a regular , real guy .
What you see is what you get .
He 's not aggressive , but with a few drinks , he may want to punch someone 's lights out . "
In other shots , the relationships between stars and their fans are laid bare .
He remembers following Eric Cantona around Marseille for three days , taking pictures for his autobiography .
Every time Cantona got out of the car , dozens of kids would turn up and watch his football tricks , mesmerised .
" It was interesting to see other people 's reactions , " says Agius .
One of his most bizarre shoots was with Nicholson at the Beverley Hills Hotel when Victoria Beckham was co-styling .
" Jack wanted to meet her .
She was a fan of his .
We were in the master bedroom .
Victoria was sitting at the end of the bed in awe of Jack who is standing there in his boxer shorts and no trousers [ he was having a fitting ] , " he laughs .
Sean Penn and Philip Seymour Hoffman are the two stars whom Agius has yet to shoot and would most like to .
Penn because he's " deep and interesting " and Hoffman for his " intriguing , yet vulnerable " air .
For Agius , the most important thing is to make the shoot real .
If it 's been jokey and fun you can see it .
It translates into the final images .

Google is not liable for defamatory comments that appear in news articles , blogs and forums displayed in its search results , a high court judge in London has concluded in a landmark ruling for UK defamation law .
The case , against Google 's US and UK operations , had been brought by London - based Metropolitan International Schools .
MIS runs distance learning courses in games development under the name Train2 Game .
MIS launched legal action over comments on the forum of a website that it claimed were defamatory and that appeared in Google 's search results .
The company claimed that Google was liable as a publisher of defamatory comments .
Google responded that it has no responsibility for the words and comments .
Mr Justice Eady ruled in a judgment in the high court on Friday that Google was a " facilitator " and not a publisher of the content .
" When a snippet is thrown up on the user 's screen in response to his search , it points him in the direction of an entry somewhere on the web that corresponds , to a greater or lesser extent , to the search terms he has typed in , " Eady said .
" It is for him to access or not , as he chooses .
[ Google ] has merely , by the provision of its search service , played the role of a facilitator . "
An analysis of the decision by the lawyers Pinsent Masons also noted that the ruling said the Google was not liable as a publisher of defamatory comments even in cases where it had been told that its search results contained potentially libellous comments .
However , Eady did say that Google has a responsibility to block or take down content if it is notified with a legitimate complaint about libellous material .
Struan Robertson , a lawyer at Pinsent Masons , said that this was the first judicial analysis of search engine liability for defamation under UK law .
" It is undoubtedly a brilliant result for Google and other search engines , " Robertson concluded .
" We are pleased with this result , which reinforces the principle that search engines are n't responsible for content that is published on third - party websites , " said a spokeman for Google .
" Mr Justice Eady made clear if someone feels they have been defamed by material on a website then they should address their complaint to the person who actually wrote and published the material , and not a search engine , which simply provides a searchable index of content on the internet , " the spokesman added .

I know I said this about Lego Mindstorm back in the day and never followed through , but I have just discovered the NeuroSky Mindset device and …
I Must have this SDK !
Harness the power of your mind with the NeuroSky MindSet™ headset .
This Brain - Computer Interface ( BCI ) turns your thoughts into actions , unlocking new worlds of interactivity .
The MindSet measures brainwaves to identify specific mental states and communicates these states as commands , empowering users to control supported video games , research devices , and other tools for an enhanced user experience .
The MindSet also has Bluetooth Stereo Audio and Bluetooth Hands - free features .
Source : NeuroSky site
I do n’t know about you , but the # 1 feature request from the users of every application essentially boils down to “ Make it read my mind . ”
Finally , there is a peripheral and associated API to make that happen .
It ’s already available and cheap !
Better yet , they have n’t forgotten the hobbyists out there and are offering a free version of the sdk and the hardware - device is cheaper than an I - POD .
The entry level version is priced at about $ 200 .
I am still trying to distinguish what the difference between the basic and “ pro ” versions of the device are besides $ 8,800 aside from market segmentation and slower shipping .
But what do I know ?
The pro version is sold out and the cheap one is still available .
The comparison matrix is far from helpful on this point and presumes quite a bit of prior knowledge of concepts like the subtle distinction between a “ Headset details ” that are customizable versus fixed function .
Maybe they are charging the extra 8 grand for the attorneys since you get to negotiate the agreement at that level .
Who knows ?
Pondering the Ponderable
Two questions immediately come to mind :
How precisely can the user control the device ?
This thing ai n’t gonna fly if you have to concentrate so hard that it causes a brain hemorrhage after 30 minutes of use .
What is the information depth ?
I ’ll be supremely disappointed if the user only has only the ability to communicate On / Off to the device .
Giving a basic switch - control mind - reading capabilities would be the worst case of gold plating ever .

For many months rumors circulating on the web about a price drop of the Playstation 3 console gaming flagship of the Japanese manufacturer Sony .
In recent days , it seems to finally confirm that some wholesalers say that the price of the console Sony will soon drop .
They talk about $ 140 less than the current version of 80 GB .
However , we have been hearing of this fall due to a Arrival of a new version –
This is not all a new version of the console , probably thinned physically .
The official announcement of this new version of the PS3 would be made at the press conference that the Japanese giant held in Cologne on the occasion of the “ gamescom ” scheduled Tuesday August 18 Belgian time to 18h .
No matter on what basis World is predicting signs of PS3 Slim , I ’ve rock solid base to say , it ’s coming and too soon .
Evidence :
– Bad Quarter Results – Sony reported drops in profits as much as 20 % .
Which had made them realize that they need to reduce the price of their hottest gadget – PS3 .
• The 80GB PS3 is being discontinued in Japan by the manufacturer ’s request .
Meanwhile , price cuts on various bundles are happening all around the world .
HMM .
• Digitimes reports
Sony is seriously ramping up orders for “ key PS3 components , ” enough to build a million consoles over the next three months .
Even though , you know , they ’ve been selling fewer PS3s .
• Amazon lists a PS3 “ Konsole Slim . ”
Are n’t all these facts enough to confirm that new PS3 Slim is coming and original PS3 ’s price is reducing ?
Wait and watch .
I ’m sure on this .

People who commit filicide , the killing of their own child , are no more psychotically disordered than other homicide offenders .
Research published in the open access journal BMC Psychiatry has shown that prevention of filicide cannot remain the task of psychiatry alone , but health care and society at large must work to prevent the danger .
Hanna Putkonen from Vanha Vaasa Hospital , Finland , worked with a team of Finnish researchers to compare the psychosocial history , index offence , and psychiatric morbidity of filicide offenders with other homicide offenders .
She said , " The novel results of this nationwide study reinforce the general impression that filicide offenders are a distinct group of homicide offenders .
However , they did not emerge as mentally disordered as has previously been supposed " .
Filicide offenders were not as often intoxicated with alcohol during the crime and they had significantly less previous criminal offending than the homicidal controls .
They were more likely to be employed and were not psychopaths .
Half of the filicide offenders but none of the controls attempted suicide at the crime scene .
According to Putkonen , " It seems filicide as a phenomenon is closely associated with suicide ; perhaps at times it is even more about the suicide than the killing " .
The researchers conclude that , although psychopathy was not a risk factor for filicide , the filicide offenders did exhibit emotional problems which should be noted as risk factors and that their suicidal behavior signals distress .
Putkonen said , " The filicide offenders might be people who are incapable of handling everyday difficulties .
Parents who are severely fatigued or otherwise not able to cope must receive adequate support " .

Comedian Noel Fielding is to take part in an attempt to break the world record for the largest gathering of zombies , it was announced today .
The Mighty Boosh star is to play the role of the Zombie King in the upcoming Film4 and Warp Films ' production , I Spit On Your Rave .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Shooting for a key scene in the futuristic film will take place at this year 's Big Chill festival at Eastnor Castle Deer Park in Herefordshire .
Organisers have appealed to revellers to turn up " zombiefied " to the festival on 6 August to be film extras and , in the process , be part of an attempt to break the world record for the largest ' zombie walk ' .
" Zombification stations " will be at hand to provide an undead makeover for those without the necessary fake blood and pale complexion .
A spokesman for the Big Chill has previously said the biggest official gathering of this kind was set in Nottingham on Halloween last year when 1,227 people donned torn clothes and smeared flour over their faces in the Old Market Square .
The spokesman added that 3,370 are believed to have congregated for such an event in the American state of Michigan last year although he said there are doubts over whether it was officially recorded .
I Spit On Your Rave is set nine years in the future with mankind extinct after a virus is released at the 2012 Olympics .
A spokesman for the Big Chill festival said : " The apocalypse has happened .
Zombies rule the world .
Human beings are kept only for food ( and sometimes entertainment ) .
" But old habits die hard , so once a year the zombies still hold a music festival and this year at The Big Chill Festival Warp Films and Film4 will be recreating this ghastly event .
" With the Zombie King Noel Fielding presiding over proceedings , its time to come and join the fundead ! "
He added : " Make - up stations will be open all - day , starting as soon as festival goers start to arrive and set up camp .
" Once the entertainment area opens at 3 pm , revellers will only to be able to get into the Open Air Stage field if they are zombiefied .
" White face make - up and a bit of fake blood will do , but festival organisers would love it if participants could go the whole hog .
" There will be zombie - themed DJ sets and other entertainment to keep festival goers in the mood . "
The evening will be crowned by an all - nighter of classic zombie films .
Other attractions at the four - day festival include Basement Jaxx , former Talking Heads frontman David Byrne and Orbital .
Pictures of penguins !
From the sky , this picture might look like a polluted river , or a field of flowers .
But when zooming in , you can see that it is in fact tens of thousands of penguins gathered at the same place !

WINNIPEG – The Harper government is putting up $ 550,000 to gather research on marijuana use and mental illness .
The Schizophrenia Society of Canada will use the money to further research the links between cannabis and early psychosis as well as develop promotional materials warning youth about the dangers of smoking pot .
The money is part of Ottawa's $ 30 million national anti-drug strategy announced in 2007 .
Chris Summerville , CEO of the Schizophrenia Society , said the public does n't realize that cannabis users have a seven - fold increase in risk of developing schizophrenia .
He pointed to recent research out of Victoria , B.C. , linking pot smoking and mental illness .
As part of the society 's research , some 30 youths who have experienced psychosis will be trained to gather information about the reasons their peers use cannabis .
The results will be used to develop educational materials aimed at decreasing the use of illicit drugs among young people .
Winnipeg Conservative MP
Joy Smith said Tuesday that while the public regards marijuana as a soft drug , there may be very serious consequences for young pot smokers who have a predisposition to mental illness .
" Science has shown that cannabis may actually trigger the onset of psychosis and may also intensify the symptoms for those who already have a psychotic illness , " Smith said in announcing the grant .
" It has been suggested that up to 80 per cent of youth who have had a psychotic episode were using cannabis .
And that 's pretty shocking , " said Smith , who was filling in for Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq at news conference .
You 've seen " March of Progress , " the famous illustration depicting the parade of modern man 's evolutionary predecessors , from apes to Cro-Magnon .
If for no other reason , it 's famous as the setup for a thousand visual gags .
As a gamer , the one you 've probably seen most ends with modern man devolving back into a hunched - over Neanderthal typing furiously on some internet forum .
There 's also the one where the fully evolved guy bellies up , after uncounted millennia , to a coin - op arcade machine as though that 's what lured him out of the primordial goo in the first place .
Like chimps have become people , games have also evolved .
Not that the analogy - or the graphic - is perfect .
As you read about " March of Progress , " you learn it was n't meant to communicate the idea of inexorable , one - way development that slowly replaces the primitive with the more evolved until Homo sapiens is replaced by Homo futurificus with a head the size of a watermelon and godlike psionic powers .
Evolution is more accurately thought of as a branching tree with dead ends and parallel development of related species .
But whatever you think about Scopes , the Flying Spaghetti Monster and all the brouhaha between them , there 's no question that games have evolved from the decisions of intelligent designers .
Looking back on the march of games through the lens of evolution can highlight both the genius and the shortcomings of today 's games .
For these purposes , let 's split out two main evolutionary branches of gaming .
On one branch , we have games that primarily involve the manipulation of playing pieces in relation to each other .
Call them " competitive games . "
The monkey in this picture is the ancient game Senet , or maybe the Royal Game of Ur. Modern man probably looks something like Dawn of War II .
These are games that one player wins decisively by trapping stones ( Go ) , capturing kings ( chess ) or blowing up the enemy 's HQ ( take your pick , Commander RTS ) .
Victory conditions exist even for the versions of these games that are played solo .
On the other branch , there 's a strain of games that 's developed much more recently in evolutionary terms .
Roleplaying games are less about the manipulation of playing pieces on a physical or virtual board and more about the changes brought about and experienced by players as they negotiate a game world with verisimilitude .
This avatar - centric , non-competitive gaming subspecies is a bit harder to see in the uni-browed predecessors of the modern RPG than today 's bleeding - edge games .
The modern roleplaying game grew out of the older , more competitive style at some point between H.G. Wells ' Little Wars , which many consider to be the first modern tabletop war game , and Jeff Perren and Gary Gygax 's Chainmail , the precursor to Dungeons & Dragons .
While roleplaying became its own concrete genre with D&D , its players still carried out a lot of the action by moving painted lead figures around on dry - erase battlemats and felt like they had won when they killed the level boss .
A lot of people still play D&D that way today .
President Yar 'Adua promised to tackle corruption and electoral reforms
The head of Nigeria 's leading lawyers ' association has said the country is " gliding toward being a failed state " .
Oluwarotimi Akeredolu said democratic institutions had failed to adequately represent Nigerians and uphold the rule of law .
The Nigerian Bar Association chief also expressed doubts over the government 's commitment to tackling corruption .
When President Umaru Yar 'Adua was elected in 2007 , he pledged zero tolerance for corruption .
" The NBA has serious doubts concerning the commitment of government in combating the menace of corruption .
There are outstanding issues of corrupt practices in government circles , " Nigeria 's This Day newspaper quoted Mr Akeredolu as saying .
As an example , he said , Nigerians were still waiting to hear the outcome of an investigation into the Halliburton scandal .
The US construction firm has admitted paying bribes to top officials between 1994 and 2004 .
Suspects paraded
Anti-corruption agencies have rejected criticism about their shortcomings , saying they have recovered hundreds of millions of dollars and made dozens of prosecutions in the past year .
Mr Akeredolu , who was speaking at the Nigerian Bar Association annual conference , also questioned the police 's practice of parading suspects in front of the media before their trials .
The police have come under fire recently after the leader of an Islamist sect died following his arrest earlier this month .
Police said he was killed in a shoot - out when he tried to escape but human rights groups said it was a summary execution .
Correspondents say democracy activists have also been disheartened by the lack of electoral reforms ahead of elections in 2011 .
Observers say the last elections were characterised by vote rigging , voter intimidation and ballot - box stuffing .

If you believe the pundits , you 'd think that Microsoft was one step from the grave , a company teetering on the edge of financial ruin and no longer technologically relevant .
After all , Microsoft 's most recent financial results show that it has had the worst year in its history .
For the first time , revenue from Windows dropped from the previous year -- $ 3.1 billion for the quarter that ended on June 30 , compared to $ 4.36 billion for the same quarter a year earlier .
The sagging economy is only partly to blame .
Much of the problems are of Microsoft 's own making .
From a business point of view , for example , Vista was an unmitigated disaster .
Enterprises have avoided it like the plague .
A study by Forrester Research found that 86 % of corporate PCs still run XP .
Then , of course , there 's Google , which owns the Internet search market , even though Microsoft has spent untold amounts of money trying to catch up .
And Google has targeted the heart of the Microsoft empire by announcing that it is developing an operating system called Chrome and by pushing Google Apps as a lower - cost or free alternative to Microsoft Office .
Sounds grim , does n't it ?
The truth is , though , in the midst of all the bad news , it looks as if Microsoft has finally got its mojo back .
There 's evidence that the company may finally be recovering from its worst year ever .
For a start , there 's the impending release of Windows 7 .
The new operating system is fast and responsive and has fixed many of Vista 's problems .
It wo n't be publicly available until late October , yet for a while it topped Amazon 's software best - seller list .
It still hovers around 25th to 30th -- impressive for software that wo n't be available for months .
Microsoft also revamped its search engine , which it now calls Bing .
Bing is an impressive piece of work , and for the first time Microsoft has a search site that can rival Google 's in terms of technology .
And the company 's recently announced deal with Yahoo will help Microsoft gain more revenue from the Web .
Microsoft also released a very solid beta of Microsoft Office 2010 , and Office will finally be available as a Web - based application .
This will likely be enough to fend off Google Apps .
Finally , Microsoft put Apple on the defensive with a set of aggressive ads called Laptop Hunters that play up the price differential between Apple and Windows - based laptops .
So what happened to Microsoft ?
Why is the company hitting its stride again ?
The primary reason is cultural .
Microsoft was always at its best when it believed it was an underdog .
Bill Gates was excellent at creating that striver culture , but in his later years , one had the sense that his attention had wandered .
And once he left , the company culture was adrift .
Microsoft 's culture has changed because for the first time in a long time , the company is , in fact , an underdog .
Google has been on top of Internet search and services , Apple got all the buzz for its new products , and Vista was widely reviled .
Microsoft finally recognized that it could n't just sit on a pot of cash and giant market share .
If it did n't start releasing solid products and rethink its Internet strategy , Google could eventually own even the desktop .
In short , the company got hungry again .
That 's not to say that Microsoft is perfect .
It needs to more aggressively Web-enable its applications , and it should slim down Windows and possibly release the operating system as a series of constantly upgraded mix - and - match components .
It needs to develop breakthrough products in the way that Apple has done .
It 's hard to know whether that 's possible in the long run .
But for now , at least , Microsoft has its mojo back .
Preston Gralla is a contributing editor for Computerworld.com and the author of more than 35 books , including How the Internet Works ( Que , 2006 ) .

Greek defender to join subject to passing medical
Liverpool have confirmed a deal has been agreed to sign Greece international Sotirios Kyrgiakos , subject to the defender passing a medical .
Skysports.com revealed on Tuesday that Reds boss Rafa Benitez had lined up a move for the AEK Athens stopper to provide cover in his back - line .
Benitez revealed after his team 's 4 - 0 win over Stoke City on Wednesday evening that the former Rangers centre - half is heading to Anfield .
Kyrgiakos is expected to arrive on Merseyside before the weekend to undergo a medical and he could be involved in next Monday 's Premier League game against Aston Villa .
" We have nearly done the deal subject to a medical , " Benitez told the club's .
" He is a player with experience who can hopefully help us in defence .
" He has experience in British football and Rangers .
After that with Frankfurt and the national team .
" He 's a good player in the air , strong and aggressive .
We were looking for a player with experience .
" He will have the medical this week , it has to be before the weekend . "
Benitez is currently without both Daniel Agger and Martin Skrtel through injury , and started Spanish teenager Daniel Ayala alongside Jamie Carragher against Stoke .

Two fascinating , powerful articles I 've read recently ( available here and here ) have led me to revisit the issue of who is really to blame when a collapses under the unbearable weight of what is normally an otherwise inconsequential extra-marital affair .
Are we justified in blaming the normally middle - aged man , who should have controlled himself ?
Why would he risk so much for so little ?
Explanations are easy to come by , ranging from economics ( He finally has enough money and status to be attractive to sexy young women at the peak of their reproductive power ) to existential dread ( he 's coming to terms with his own mortality by lashing out symbolically against his own impending old age and death ) to the wife 's life cycle ( she 's nearing so he 's biologically driven toward the fertility of younger women ) .
Each of these may have some measure of truth , but none answers the most pressing question :
Why do men have such overwhelming hunger for variety in their sexual partners - not just at , but always ?
The Coolidge effect has been discussed elsewhere .
Essentially , it 's just a scientific way of saying men ( like many male mammals ) need variety in partners to maintain sexual interest .
If the ghost of Calvin Coolidge were n't haunting him , a man would simply buy a DVD or two of his favorite actress and watch it over and over the rest of his life .
Knowing how the movie ends is hardly going to ruin the experience for him
If you 've never been to a porn gateway web site , you 'll be astounded by the variety and specificity of the offerings there : everything from " unshaved Japanese lesbians " to " tattooed redheads " to " overweight older gals . "
When researchers decided to look at this issue to develop a Sexual Boredom Scale , they found that for men , sexual boredom was correlated with variety in partners ( or lack thereof ) , while for women , it was more related to variety in activity .
In other words , women were more likely to be satisfied by changes in the sexual what , while men ( gay or straight ) were more likely to respond to a changes in the sexual whom .
It 's a simple , unavoidable truth almost everyone knows to be true , but few dare to discuss : variety and change are the necessary spice of the life of the male of our species .
But even having an intellectual understanding of this aspect of many men's inner reality does n't make acceptance any easier for many women .
Writer and film director Nora Ephron has explored these issues in many of her films , including Heartburn , which was based on her own failed marriage .
In a 2009 interview she explained how raising two sons had informed her view of men : " Boys are so sweet , " she said .
" But the problem with men is not whether they 're nice or not .
It 's that it 's hard for them at a certain point in their lives to stay true .
It just is .
It 's almost not their fault . "
But then she added , " it feels like it 's their fault if you are involved with any of them . "
In a letter to his then - friend Sigmund , wrote , " The prerequisite for a good marriage , it seems to me , is the license to be unfaithful . "
( January 30 , 1910 . )
Is there any truth to this ?
If men evolved over millions of years to seek sexual novelty ( thus avoiding genetic stagnation in small groups of foragers in a sparsely populated planet ) , is it fair to condemn them now for responding to these ancient , evolved appetites ?
What do you think ?
In future installments , I 'll look at this all too common situation from the perspective of the betrayed wife and the home - wrecking other woman .

Also escorted away but not arrested : an armed man at a loud and rancorous town meeting hosted by Representative Steve Cohen of Memphis .
Both the armpit guy and the Memphis guy had the required permit to carry a concealed weapon .
Kostric did not even have to have a permit since his gun was not concealed , which in New Hampshire makes it completely O.K .
This is under the theory that as long as you know that the strange - looking guy waving the big protest sign is packing heat , you can take steps to protect yourself , perhaps such as purchasing a bulletproof vest from a nearby street vendor .

( Actually arrested : Richard Terry Young , 62 , in Portsmouth .
While Young ’s loaded gun was in his parked car , not on his person , the fact that he did not have a license and that police discovered him lurking inside the high school where the president was scheduled to appear later in the day apparently tipped the scales . )
We are getting yet another series of reminders of the vast gun gap in this country .
There is the part that thinks a room full of red - faced men and women screaming at one another is the worst place in the world to bring a firearm .
And then there is the part that holds it is exactly the place where you need it most .
“ A firearm is a defensive tool , ” said Kostric , in an interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC .
He was wearing a yellow T - shirt , and he told Matthews that if everybody in the crowd waiting for Obama to arrive had been armed , things would have been much safer .
Beyond an air of mild surprise , he seemed like your average hard - core Ron Paul voter  male , smug and obsessed with the money supply .

" Evolution is not politically correct , so of the very broad range of potential sexual behaviour , there is actually only one that is consistently associated with better physical and mental health and that is the one sexual behaviour that would be favoured by evolution .

" I'm now curious what your feelings on Twilight are , since you 're doing

- Raynald
I have never read more that two consecutive words of Twilight .

Consider Edwin a parody more of decades of wanky vampire goth romance than of its most recent iteration specifically .
That 's probably why Edwin looks more like a normal vampire with actual fangs , unlike the vampires in Twilight who do n't have AUGH WHY DO I EVEN KNOW THIS ?
" So a correction for the latest round of Q&A .
Kraze tried to point out an
inaccuracy with the swords that the Ninja Mafia use , stating that real
ninjas used katana .
This is only partly true .
Ninjas arose from peasants
and farmers with samurai being the preferred upper - crust warrior class .
This means that a ninja could not afford to have a katana made for him and
instead equipped himself with shorter , straight swords .
These swords were
cheaper , easier to conceal , and were used in more of a stabbing motion
rather than the hacking swing of a katana .
However , there were a few
instances where a ninja could acquire a katana .
If he killed a samurai he
could claim his sword , and I would n't be surprised if a ninja performing
services for a samurai was equipped with one , as katanas were sharper and stronger .
So , the blades used by your ninja mafia are actually fairly
accurate .
Not that you needed an excuse , but now you have one ! "
- Steven
I 'll take it !
And thanks to the tons of other folks who also wrote in to defend my completely unintentional accuracy .
Apparently there are a lot of sword experts in the audience .

Ok .
This is another post that 's two thirds philosophical positioning and one third " things you can do " .
If you 'd like to skip to the last third , then follow this link .
Now we 've got rid of the people who do n't want to listen to me waffle randomly , let 's start with the nice , pithy central point that they 're now all going to completely miss :
The simplest way to get something from somebody is to find a direct means of contact and ask them .
Apparently this is hard though .
People much seem to prefer complaining on blogs , assuming the status quo is n't going to change .
Well , if you assume that the other person 's opinions are both contradictory to yours and immutable , then sure , they 're never going to change their mind .
Because you 'll never try to change it .
Worse still , you 'll never get the chance to find out if they were actually on the same side as you all along and you just misunderstood each other .
Failure : there was an Iron Man post early on about exceptions where somebody commented complaing that DBIx :: Class did n't produce an exception object hierarchy for errors and that on every project he was on he had to waste time recreating one .
I followed up as soon as I saw this going " hey !
we 'd love one of those !
have a branch !
have as many branches as you need ! " or words to that effect but I 'm not sure he ever saw it ; certainly , no code has resulted that I know of .
Success : The DBIx : : Class team had been steadily subclassing SQL :: Abstract in nastier and nastier ways because we could n't get any response from the maintainer , but I refused to fork it because we had n't heard from him at all .
Then he popped up on the Catalyst mailing list working on some Cat +DBIC stuff and I went " hey , I 've not seen that From address before " and dropped him a quick mail and the reply was basically " oh my god I left an address that does n't work on the CPAN module sorry " and now the DBIx : : Class team plus assorted other wonderful people like Laurent Dami of DBIx :: DataModel fame have banded together and we 've released 1.50 and work progresses on the prototype for 2.0 .
Then , the other day on IRC , zby commented that " mst seem to maintain that for every critical public post you should consult the matter with the parties involved " .
Well , I 'm not necessarily going to go quite that far , but ... a lot of times I 've been brewing up a rant for a while .
And then I 've had a chance to talk to the person the rant was going to be directed at and hey presto it turns out they'd love that to happen , they just need some help .
I 've spent a couple hours triaging the easy bits on an RT queue so a maintainer could get a bugfixed release out and solve a DBIx :: Class problem .
I 've found somebody a shell on a system so they can reproduce a problem .
I 've asked somebody for a shell on their system so I can reproduce a problem .
Four times out of five , the end result is that I 've got nothing to be critical of - and better still , over half of those times the end result is me having an exciting " we can fix this and here 's how " story to tell , which is the story I 'd much rather be telling because that means we 're part of the solution , whereas extended complaining without concrete suggestions just makes you part of the precipitate .
So I think , yes , we should try .
Any time we can .
To quote from the notebooks of Lazarus Long - " Your enemy is never a villain in his own eyes .
Keep this in mind ; it may offer a way to make him your friend .
If not , you can kill him without hate -- and quickly . " .
Now in our world " kill him without hate " means something more like " move on , understanding why this person disagrees with me " - but the quickly part is extremely important as well , because it means we do n't expend time on anger or upset that could be more productively expended actually achieving something .
And that 's pretty much the worst case outcome of this approach .
Well .
Except there 's a darker side .
Getting good results relies on finding the specific person that knows what 's stopping your problem being solved and making a unique , personal approach to them .
If lots of people basically send the same email or letter or whatever then it's just going to seem like noise and generate hostility towards the idea .
If you are n't willing to compromise then you are n't going to get anywhere .
Worst of all , if people get indundated with suggestions , the vast majority of them poor , they can easily start to consider every idea they 're sent to be guilty until proven innocent .
This is also why you want to try and avoid repeat bug reports and check the rt.cpan.org queue for a module before reporting the same problem again .
It 's why you actually have to think about what you 're saying , and remember this person has never spoken to you before , has no idea who you are , and no reason at all to accord you automatic respect - so you have to make a start on earning it from that first interaction .
So next time you 're about to blow your top over a problem , next time a rant is about to pour forth out of your keyboard and onto the internets , see if you can find somebody who holds a position such that they could influence the outcome .
Then think about what you want , and why they might care that such a thing comes to pass or at least that you 're given an opportunity to do the work yourself to fix it , and what help you could potentially offer to them .
Then , ask .
The perl.org repository and patch aggregation plan
People have been complaining for a long time that the main perl.org website and subdomains like learn .
perl.org do n't get updated often enough .
So I made the mistake of assuming for a while that there was n't a lot that could be done or , clearly , somebody would have done it already .
WRONG .
After ::NA
I thought I 'd wave at the perl.org admins and ask if there was any way to get updates in .
The reply I got was basically " sure , it 's in svn .
Sign up here , log in here , check it out and send patches . "
My jaw nearly hit the floor .
So I grabbed somebody who'd been complaining and went HEY LOOK YOU CAN DO SOMETHING and got a " huh ?
I have to sign up ? that 's not public " in return .
Which is the point at which I realised that the biggest problem is nobody found the repository and / or nobody thought to ask - so I went back and begged them to set up unauthenticated read only svn for people to make patches against .
It 's up .
Check it out .
svn co https://svn.perl.org/perl.org/docs/live/
Fortunately , the other thing we needed was a way to make sure that people did n't tread on each others ' toes - a co-ordination point so that those of us who care can thrash out patches before they go upstream , and to make sure work does n't get duplicated - and the entirely unofficial perl.org patch marshalling and discussion list will serve that purpose .
So , if you 're interested in working on perl.org or learn .
perl.org , hop onto the list and we 'll tell you when the svn 's stable - and hopefully share knowledge of installing and running the Combust system that the sites run atop so that we can test patches more easily .
Because in free software a question in the form of a well thought out patch is one that almost always gets a constructive answer .
Let 's make those questions and ask them .

Occasionally I am asked what I think the future will look like , not just in the next few years or in 10 years , but several decades from now .
Frankly , it ’s hard not to cringe , because my honest appraisal is not likely to be met with much enthusiasm .
Some people harangue me via e-mail , asking why I do n’t write about over - population and other great disasters .
Well , I write for the association for the study of peak oil & natural gas , so I usually confine myself to energy supply & consumption , alternatives to fossil fuels , and economic or scientific issues that bear on these subjects .
I ’ve been accused of being ignorant of , or not caring about , the Big Planetary Issues .
Today I depart from my usual stuff , not just to answer a few critics , but more importantly to put our current energy & economic problems in proper perspective .
If the 20th century was a time of expansion and growth for human population and economies , the 21st century will surely usher in a peak and decline in both .
Today I talk about my “ favorite ” disaster , called The Sixth Extinction .
Even in the age of politically correct environmentalism , most people could care less about the Earth ’s plant & animal species unless their decline bears directly and immediately on their own welfare .
Accordingly , I will talk about some clear - cut examples where the health of the natural world adversely affects our future survival .
via Peak Watch : The Sixth Extinction .
Human alpha and beta defensins contribute substantially to innate immune defenses against microbial and viral infections .
Certain nonhuman primates also produce theta - defensins — 18 residue cyclic peptides that act as HIV - 1 entry inhibitors .
Multiple human theta - defensin genes exist , but they harbor a premature termination codon that blocks translation .
Consequently , the theta - defensins ( retrocyclins ) encoded within the human genome are not expressed as peptides .
In vivo production of theta - defensins in rhesus macaques involves the post - translational ligation of two nonapeptides , each derived from a 12 - residue “ demidefensin ” precursor .
Neither the mechanism of this unique process nor its existence in human cells is known .
To ascertain if human cells retained the ability to process demidefensins , we transfected human promyelocytic cells with plasmids containing repaired retrocyclin - like genes .
The expected peptides were isolated , their sequences were verified by mass spectrometric analyses , and their anti-HIV - 1 activity was confirmed in vitro .
Our study reveals for the first time , to our knowledge , that human cells have the ability to make cyclic theta - defensins .
Given this evidence that human cells could make theta - defensins , we attempted to restore endogenous expression of retrocyclin peptides .
Since human theta - defensin genes are transcribed , we used aminoglycosides to read - through the premature termination codon found in the mRNA transcripts .
This treatment induced the production of intact , bioactive retrocyclin - 1 peptide by human epithelial cells and cervicovaginal tissues .
The ability to reawaken retrocyclin genes from their 7 million years of slumber using aminoglycosides could provide a novel way to secure enhanced resistance to HIV - 1 infection .
Defensins are a large family of small antimicrobial peptides that contribute to host defense against a broad spectrum of pathogens .
In primates , defensins are divided into three subfamilies — alpha , beta , and theta — on the basis of their disulfide bonding pattern .
Theta - defensins were the most recently identified defensin subfamily , isolated initially from white blood cells and bone marrow of rhesus monkeys .
They are the only known cyclic peptides in mammals and act primarily by preventing viruses such as HIV - 1 from entering cells .
Whereas theta - defensin genes are intact in Old World monkeys , in humans they have a premature stop codon that prevents their expression ; they thus exist as pseudogenes .
In this work , we reveal that , upon correction of the premature termination codon in theta - defensin pseudogenes , human myeloid cells produce cyclic , antiviral peptides ( which we have termed “ retrocyclins ” ) , indicating that the cells retain the intact machinery to make cyclic peptides .
Furthermore , we exploited the ability of aminoglycoside antibiotics to read - through the premature termination codon within retrocyclin transcripts to produce functional peptides that are active against HIV - 1 .
Given that the endogenous production of retrocyclins could also be restored in human cervicovaginal tissues , we propose that aminoglycoside - based topical microbicides might be useful in preventing sexual transmission of HIV - 1 .

In the current study we restored the translation of this evolutionarily lost retrocyclin peptide by ablating the premature termination codon using site - directed mutagenesis , and analyzed whether human cells can synthesize biologically active retrocyclins .
We found that promyelocytic HL60 cells stably transfected with retrocyclin constructs in which the premature termination codon was corrected could express retrocyclins .
Application of the expressed retrocyclins to TZM - bl cells , PM1 cells , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) conferred protection against HIV - 1 infection .
Moreover , mass spectrometric techniques confirmed the presence of correctly folded mature retrocyclin peptides .
We also explored methods to read - through the premature termination codon within the retrocyclin pseudogene .
Previous reports revealed that aminoglycoside antibiotics could suppress the termination codon of pseudogenes and disease - associated nonsense mutations [ 19 – 25 ] .
In bacteria , aminoglycosides bind strongly to the decoding site on the 16S rRNA , thereby hindering protein synthesis [ 26 ] .
However , in eukaryotes , aminoglycosides bind to the eukaryotic decoding site with low affinity and induce a low level of translational misreading , which suppresses the termination codon through the incorporation of an amino acid in its place [ 27 ] .
Herein , we utilized aminoglycosides to induce translational read - through of the θ - defensin pseudogene , which restored the expression of functional anti-HIV - 1 retrocyclin peptides in human cervicovaginal tissue models .
Topical application of aminoglycosides to produce endogenous retrocyclins in the vaginal mucosa might soon be an effective preventative to combat sexual transmission of HIV - 1 .
Retrocyclins inhibit the fusion of HIV - 1 Env by selectively binding to the C- terminal heptad repeat region on gp41 blocking 6 - helix bundle formation [ 15 , 16 ] .
RC - 101 is a congener of retrocyclin with a single arginine to lysine substitution that retains structural and functional similarity to retrocyclin [ 4 ] .
RC - 101 exhibited enhanced anti-HIV - 1 activity against over two dozen primary isolates from several clades [ 7 , 8 ] , and did not induce inflammation or toxicity in organotypic models of human cervicovaginal tissue [ 17 ] .
Continuous passaging of HIV - 1 BaL in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of RC - 101 for 100 days induced only minimal viral resistance [ 18 ] .
Given these beneficial attributes , we envisioned that restoring the endogenous expression of retrocyclins in humans would provide an effective and natural way of combating HIV - 1 infection .
θ- Defensins such as retrocyclin have a cyclic peptide backbone , derived from the head - to - tail - ligation of two peptides that each contributes nine amino acids to form the 18 - residue mature peptide [ 11 ] .
θ- Defensins are the only known cyclic peptides in mammals and were originally isolated from rhesus macaque leukocytes and bone marrow [ 11 – 13 ] .
While θ- defensin peptides are produced in old world monkeys and orangutans , in humans they exist only as expressed pseudogenes [ 14 ] .
A premature termination codon in the signal peptide portion of human retrocyclin mRNA prevents its translation .
The retrocyclin gene is otherwise remarkably intact , showing 89.4 % identity with rhesus θ-defensins .
Its genetic information was utilized to recreate retrocyclins synthetically and confirm their activity against both X4 and R5 strains of HIV - 1 [ 4 – 7 ] .
Nearly 33 million people are infected with HIV worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] , and despite extensive efforts there are no effective vaccines or other countermeasures to protect against HIV transmission [ 3 ] .
In our attempts to find effective anti-HIV agents , our group determined that certain synthetic θ-defensins called “ retrocyclins ” are potent inhibitors of HIV - 1 infection [ 4 – 8 ] .
Retrocyclins belong to a large family of antimicrobial peptides known as defensins , all of which are cationic , tri-disulfide bonded peptides that have important roles in innate host defense .
On the basis of the position of the cysteines and the disulfide bonding pattern , defensins are grouped into three subfamilies : α- defensins , β- defensins , and θ- defensins [ 9 , 10 ] .
Results and Discussion
Creation of Promyelocytic Cells Stably Transfected with Retrocyclin Constructs θ- Defensins are formed by post - translational modification of two 12 - residue gene products , each of which is processed to give a nonapeptide that contains three cysteines .
The N - terminus of one nonapeptide forms a peptide bond with the C- terminus of another nonapeptide , resulting in a cyclic 18 residue peptide with three intramolecular disulfide bonds [ 11,14 ] .
To determine if human cells have retained the ability to process θ- defensins , we transfected promyelocytic HL60 cells with retrocyclin constructs each encoding a nonapeptide in which the premature termination codon was replaced with a glutamine ( ⊗17Q ) .
Four types of constructs were produced : R1 , R3 , A1 , and A3 ( Figure 1 ) .
Aside from the corrected premature termination codon ( ⊗17Q ) , all constructs were engineered to contain two termination codons at the end of the gene to ensure read - fidelity .
Constructs with an “ R ” designation terminate after the retrocyclin portion of the gene , while constructs with an “ A ” designation contain the retrocyclin portion with additional downstream residues that might be critical for translation and / or processing [ 14,28 ] .
Constructs with a “ 1 ” designation do not have any additional residues mutated , while constructs with a “ 3 ” designation have the additional Arg → Lys mutation ( R70K ) encoding the RC - 101 nonapeptide .
HL60 cells were cotransfected by electroporation with either R1 and R3 , or A1 and A3 , and propagated in the presence of G418 ( 300 μg / ml ) to create stably transfected cell lines .
Stable transfection was verified by analyzing genomic DNA and mRNA ( Figure S1 ) .
Since two different constructs were cotransfected for each condition , combinatorially it would be possible to generate three different retrocyclin peptides as illustrated in Figure 1B .
For example , if cells were cotransfected with the R1 and R3 constructs , they could theoretically generate a heterodimer ( HL60 cells containing retrocyclin constructs R1 and R3 [ R1R3 ] ) or homodimers ( R1R1 or R3R3 ) .

Extracts of Promyelocytic Cells Stably Transfected with Retrocyclin Constructs Are Active against HIV -1
We next analyzed if correcting the termination codon in the retrocyclin constructs could restore the translation of biologically active retrocyclin peptides .
The infection of TZM - bl cells with HIV - 1 BaL was significantly reduced when cells were treated with cellular acid extracts of R1R3 cells ( p < 0.004 ) and HL60 cells containing retrocyclin constructs A1 and A3 ( A1A3 ) ( p < 0.002 ) ( Figure 2A ) .
A standard tetrazolium MTT assay revealed that the extracts did not affect cellular metabolism at the concentrations used in the experiment ( Figure 2E ) .
Addition of A1A3 cell extracts to HIV - 1 infected PM1 cells ( Figure 2B ) and PBMCs ( Figure 2C ) showed significant ( p < 0.002 and p < 0.004 , respectively ) decrease in the viral titer as compared to cells treated with control HL60 cell extract .
A trypan blue exclusion assay was performed in PBMCs to monitor cell viability ( Figure 2 F ) .
We next affinity purified R1R3 and A1A3 cell extracts using anti-RC - 101 antibody and confirmed the antiviral activity in a luciferase - based assay system ( Figure 2D ) .
Interestingly , A1A3 cell extracts were found to be consistently more active than equivalent amounts of R1R3 cell extract , which suggests a role for the downstream residues in retrocyclin processing .
These results indicate that biologically active recombinant retrocyclin peptides can be synthesized in human promyelocytic cells .
As a next step we tested the presence of retrocyclin in promyelocytic cells using immunostaining .

Immunofluorescence Staining of Stably Transfected HL60 Cells Reveals Retrocyclin Peptides Immuno - dotblot analyses revealed that our anti-RC - 101 antibody specifically recognized lysine - containing human retrocyclin analogs ( synthetic RC - 101 and RC - 101_2K ) and RC - 100 ( i.e. , wild - type form ) to a lesser extent ( Figure 3A ) but not human neutrophil peptides 1 –3 , or peptides with very similar tertiary structure including rhesus theta defensin - 1 ( RTD - 1 ) and protegrin - 1 ( PG - 1 ) ( Figure 3B ) .
This antibody was used to visualize the expressed retrocyclin peptides in the stably transfected HL60 cells by immunofluorescence staining , which revealed that R1R3 cells and A1A3 cells were brightly stained as compared to vector control ( VC ) cells ( Figure 3C ) .
Slides treated with preimmune serum showed no staining ( unpublished data ) .
Note that the staining of A1A3 was brighter than R1R3 and the morphology of A1A3 cells was smaller than VC cells .
Experiments were next designed to purify and confirm the identity of the expressed retrocyclin peptides from the cell extracts .

Stably Transfected Promyelocytic Cells Produce Retrocyclin Peptides Reverse - phase high - performance liquid chromatography ( RP - HPLC ) was utilized to purify the recombinant retrocyclin peptides from stably transfected HL60 cell extracts .
Figure 4A shows the RP - HPLC trace of A1A3 and synthetic RC - 101 .
Synthetic RC - 101 was recovered in fractions collected at 26 – 28 min.
A1A3 HPLC Fractions collected from 23 –30 min were analyzed on a 16 % Tricine - SDS - gel .
Control samples did not contain any protein bands at the expected size , whereas fractions from R1R3 cell extracts revealed protein bands of about 6 - k Da size ( unpublished data ) .
Interestingly , A1A3 HPLC fractions revealed multiple protein bands , which we further analyzed by western blot ( Figure 4B ) .
The western blot analysis revealed bands at sizes corresponding to a monomer , dimer , and trimer of retrocyclin .
Interestingly , the presence of multimeric forms of retrocyclin has been independently observed by Daly and colleagues [ 29 ] .
Furthermore , the RP - HPLC purified A1A3 fractions inhibited entry of HIV - 1 BaL in TZM - bl cells ( Figure 4C ) .
The IC 50 of retrocyclin peptides expressed by A1A3 cells ( 2 μg/ml ) was similar to that of synthetic RC - 101 ( 1.25 μg/ml ) [ 8 ] .

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000095.g004
To determine the identity of the retrocyclin peptide expressed by A1A3 cells , HPLC fraction 26 was analyzed by mass spectrometric analysis ( MALDI - TOF -MS ) at the Microchemical and Proteomics Facility , Emory University ( Atlanta , Georgia , US ) .
Analysis of A1A3 Fraction 26 revealed peaks with masses 1,889.775 Da ( oxidized ) and 1895.890 Da ( reduced ) , which is nearly identical to the expected mass of synthetic cyclic RC - 101 ( 1,889.85 Da and 1,895.96
Da , respectively ; unpublished data ) and is in agreement with reduction of the three disulfide bridges in the molecule .
Furthermore , treatment with iodoacetamide yielded mass species of 2,238.081
Da for the A1A3 fraction 26 and 2,238.071
Da for RC - 101 corresponding to the predicted 6 - fold–alkylated form of RC - 101 ( expected mass = 2,238.097 Da ) .
Comparison of spectrum of the Lys - C digest of reduced / alkylated synthetic RC - 101_2 K ( peak at 1,123.577
Da ; peptide cleaved at two Lys - Gly bonds ; Figure 4D ) , synthetic RC - 101 ( peak at 2,256.097
Da ; peptide cleaved at a single Lys - Gly bond ; N - terminal sequence determined as : Gly - Ile - Cys - Arg - ; Figure 4E ) , and A1A3 fraction 26 ( peak at 2,256.010 Da ) suggests that the A1A3 cells are expressing RC - 101 ( Figure 4 F ) .
These data confirmed that correctly folded mature retrocyclin peptides can be expressed by human cells .
In the following experiments we explored alternative methods to express the peptide endogenously .
Of particular interest was the effect of aminoglycosides in mediating varying degrees of termination codon read - through as previously described [ 19 – 25 ] .
Aminoglycosides Mediate Read - Through of Termination Codon of Retrocyclin Gene and Restore Anti-HIV - 1 Activity
We tested the ability of three commonly used aminoglycosides ( gentamicin , amikacin , and tobramycin ) to induce termination codon read - through of retrocyclin cDNA .
The native retrocyclin gene was fused with a luciferase reporter at the C terminus to create two constructs : unrescued RC - 101 and rescued RC - 101 ( positive control ) as shown in Figure 5A .
These constructs were transfected into HOS - CD4 - CCR5 cells , grown in the presence of varying concentrations of aminoglycosides , and the degree of read - through quantified by measuring luciferase .
Application of tobramycin ( 10 μg/ml ) was the most effective , producing a 26 - fold increase in read - through ( p < 0.0007 ; Figure 5B ) .

( B ) HOS - CD4 - CCR5 cells cultured in antibiotic free medium ( D10− ) were transfected with unrescued RC - 101 ( negative control ) or rescued RC - 101 ( positive control ) plasmids along with phRL - CMV vector ( transfection control ) .
The next day transfected cells were treated with PBS for control cells or aminoglycosides at the indicated concentrations and allowed to grow for 24 h .
Read - through was determined by measuring luciferase levels .
Data are expressed as fold increase in luciferase expression normalized to renilla levels .
( C ) TZM - bl cells grown in D10 − were treated for 30 min with PBS , RC - 101 ( 2.5 μg/ml ) , RC - 100 ( 2.5 μg/ml ) , or aminoglycosides as shown in the figure and infected with HIV - 1 BaL ( 2 ng / ml p24 ) for 24 h followed by luciferase measurement .

( D ) TZM - bl cells cultured on cover slips were treated with PBS ( Con ) or 10 μg/ml tobramycin ( Tob ) and then immunostained with rabbit preimmune or antiretrocyclin serum using a biotinylated secondary antibody FITC - avidin system .
( E ) Cellular cytotoxicity was assessed by performing an MTT assay on TZM - bl cells treated with indicated amount of peptide or aminoglycosides ( n = 3 ) .
Bars represent percent metabolic inhibition as compared to control ( vehicle + virus ) .
( F ) TZM - bl cells , treated with either PBS , tobramycin ( 10 μg/ml ) , or RC - 100 ( 2.5 μg/ml ) , were incubated with preimmune serum or antiretrocyclin serum as indicated and infected with HIV - 1 ( p24 of 5 ng /ml ) .
Data are represented as percent infection .

n = 3 ; + , p < 0.018 Statistical significance was determined by two - tailed Student 's t- test .

Having thus established the optimal aminoglycoside concentration required to achieve read - through of retrocylin cDNA , we next determined if aminoglycosides could restore the translation and anti-HIV - 1 activity of native retrocyclin peptides .
HeLa - derived cells lines such as TZM - bl cells can natively express retrocyclin mRNA ( unpublished data ) .
We applied aminoglycosides to TZM - bl cells and challenged them with HIV - 1 BaL .
We found that cells treated with gentamicin and tobramycin significantly ( p < 0.0005 and p < 0.0001 , respectively ) inhibited HIV - 1 infection as compared to untreated cells ( Figure 5C ) .
The effect was modest when compared to inhibition by synthetic peptides .
Cell viability , determined by a tetrazolium - based MTT assay , was not affected by the application of aminoglycosides at the mentioned concentrations ( Figure 5E ) .
In order to visualize the retrocyclins expressed by application of aminoglycosides , we performed immunostaining .
TZM - bl cells were treated with PBS control or 10 μg/ml tobramycin and stained with anti-retrocyclin antibody or preimmune serum .
Control cells showed no staining while cells treated with tobramycin revealed brightly stained cells suggesting that aminoglycosides can induce the expression of retrocyclin peptides ( Figure 5D ) .
We next incubated TZM - bl cells with tobramycin ( 10 μg/ml ) for 24 h , and then treated the cells with preimmune or anti-retrocyclin serum followed by infection with HIV - 1 .
Figure 5 F reveals that cells treated with preimmune serum showed a modest yet significant reduction in infection as compared to cells treated with anti-retrocyclin antibodies ( p < 0.018 ) , suggesting that the antibody inhibited the endogenous retrocyclins .
These data confirm that the anti-HIV - 1 activity observed is due to the endogenous retrocyclin peptides expressed when tobramycin was applied to cells .
Aminoglycosides Induce Production of Retrocyclin Peptides in Cervicovaginal Tissues
We next analyzed the ability of aminoglycosides to induce the expression of retrocyclin peptides in an organotypic model cervicovaginal tissue .
Tissues were treated apically with tobramycin or control ( PBS ) for 24 h and anti-retrocyclin immunohistochemical analysis was performed .
Interestingly , tissues treated with tobramycin alone and stained with anti-retrocyclin antibody revealed brightly stained cells ( Figure 6A ) suggesting that production of retrocyclin peptides is induced upon application of aminoglycosides .
Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) activity in the medium underlying the tissues was performed to determine tissue cytotoxicity .
The LDH assay revealed that application of 10 μg/ ml tobramycin was not cytotoxic to the tissues ( Figure 6B ) .
In addition , treatment of tobramycin did not affect the metabolic activity adversely , which was determined by an MTT assay performed on one tissue ( unpublished data ) .

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000095.g006
In order to purify endogenous retrocyclins expressed in the tissues , we utilized RP - HPLC .
Figure 6C shows an HPLC trace of control , tobramycin - treated tissue extracts as compared to synthetic RC - 100 peptide .
Synthetic RC - 100 peptide was recovered in fractions collected at 27 – 29 min .
Corresponding fractions from control and tobramycin - treated tissues were analyzed by immuno - dotblot analysis using the anti-RC - 101 antibody .
Figure 6D shows that retrocyclin peptides were recovered in fractions 27 – 29 min in tobramycin - treated tissue samples but not in control tissue samples .
The amount of retrocyclin ( RC - 100 ) expressed in tobramycin - treated cervicovaginal tissues was estimated by densitometry to be approximately 1.6 μg/ tissue .
Together these studies show that aminoglycosides are promising molecules to suppress the premature termination codon of retrocyclin transcripts and restore the ability of cervicovaginal tissues to protect cells from HIV - 1 .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed his government ’s five foundations for peacemaking with the Palestinians in a speech to parliament on Wednesday .
Following are Israel ’s demands , first voiced by Netanyahu last month , and the Palestinian position on each issue .
1. Palestinians must recognize Israel as a Jewish state .
Palestinians say such recognition could be perceived as abjuring a “ right of return ” for Palestinian refugees to land now in Israel .
They say they are also mindful of the rights of Arab citizens of Israel .
2. Palestinian refugees must be resettled outside Israel .
Palestinians have long demanded that refugees who fled or were forced to leave in the war of Israel ’s creation in 1948 should be allowed to return , along with millions of their descendants .
Yet Palestinian negotiators have signaled they would accept “ a just and agreed - upon ” solution for refugees as laid out in a U.N. resolution that mentions compensation for those who settle elsewhere .
3 . The final peace agreement will end the conflict , and Palestinians can make no further demands on issues such as borders and refugees .
The Palestinians seek a final , lasting agreement that would meet all their national aspirations .
4 . The Palestinian state must be demilitarized so as not to threaten Israel .
The Palestinians do not object to this demand , but say it should be discussed in negotiations with Israel .
5. Foreign backing , in the form of explicit international guarantees , for these security arrangements .
Again , the Palestinians say the issue can be sorted out in peace talks , as it was agreed upon in previous internationally backed agreements like the 2003 “ road map . ”

Janine Sugawara of California was shocked to learn that the " crunchberries " in Captain Crunch Crunchberries cereal are not real berries .
She had been eating them for better health for four years .
Whilst most people would be too embarrassed to tell anyone they had believed such a stupid thing , Sugawara went and filed a class action lawsuit against Quaker Oats , claiming that they purposely deceived " reasonable " people into believing that crunchberries were a real fruit .
Can you have a " class " of one ?
While we are all fed up by the number of stupid lawsuits which are allowed to progress , and which often end with ridiculous awards , our hero , US District Judge , Morrison C. England , Jr. , immediately dismissed the suit writing ,
" Under normal circumstances , when this Court grants a Motion to Dismiss , the Plaintiff is given a reasonable period of time , usually twenty ( 20 ) days , in which to file an amended complaint .
In this case , however , it is simply impossible for Plaintiff to file an amended complaint stating a claim based upon these facts .
The survival of the instant claim would require this Court to ignore all concepts of personal responsibility and common sense .
The Court has no intention of allowing that to happen . "
The specific reasons for the dismissal include :
" Defendant chose the moniker ` Crunchberries ' for its brightly colored cereal balls .
As far as this Court has been made aware , there is no such fruit growing in the wild or occurring naturally in any part of the world .
Sugawara 's attorney had previously failed in an attempt to sue Kellogg under a similar Fruit Loops action .
This makes him a cereal frivolous lawsuit filer .

Marcy ’s Concerned : I ’ve been dying my hair at home for years , and have never done an allergy patch test .
I ’m starting to wonder now if one of these days it ’ll catch up to me .
Unfortunately , I ’m usually pretty impatient with my hair dye and do n’t budget in time for a 48 - hour - long test before wanting to color my hair .
How common are such allergies , anyway ?
Also , the instructions say not to cover the test patch on your arm for 48 hours .
What if I need to wear a long - sleeved shirt or sweater ?
Will that alter the allergy test results somehow ?
Ok , last question , I promise …
I ’ve noticed a new warning that those with tattoos may be more suceptible to experiencing an allergy from using hair dye .
Is that true for a tattoo anywhere on the body , even though you ’re only using the hair dye on your head ?

Continuing the discussion on the Civilian National Security Force Obama wants to build , guests David Bellavia , author of " House to House " and an Iraq war vet , and Matt Spalding of the Heritage foundation , were on to discuss and ponder the need of a civilian security force and just who they would be " fighting . "
Bellavia has an interesting comparison ( not equivalence ) between a group loyal to the State and not the country or the people , that Saddam 's Fedayeen were for his rule in Iraq .
The parallels are striking , and only a military person could understand it .
Why would Obama want a civilian force just as powerful and as well - funded as the U.S. Military to protect our " national security ? "
From enemies foreign or domestic ?
And who decides for this group ( presumably AmeriCorps as the umbrella organization ) who they 're going to fight to defend our national security ?
More questions than answers , and we need more answers .
STAND UP !
Ask questions , and do n't give up until you get an answer .
As a final point of clarity , Glenn does get it wrong with AmeriCorps government funding of a $ 500B , but he does point out that he needs to check that and get the correct amount , as he does later in the show ( not in this clip ) .
It 's actually $ 5B , but before you say " wow , that 's a huge difference for Beck to screw up , " let me say two things :
1 ) Beck corrected himself , not because he was called on it , but because he wanted to be exact ; and2 )
Since when in hell did $ 5B become an inconsequential amount ?
Oh , yeah ... ever since $ 1 trillion became so trivialized to the point we 're all numb to it .
$ 5B is a lot to a " community organizer " group , and I 'd like to see justification for that expenditure of OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS !!!!

A legally blind Massachusetts phone hacker was sentenced Friday to over 11 years in federal prison , following his guilty plea on computer intrusion and witness intimidation charges earlier this year .
Matthew Weigman , 19 , was sentenced in Dallas by U.S. District Judge Barbara M.G. Lynn , according to the U.S. Attorney ’s Office there .
There is no parole in the federal system , and little time off for good behavior , so the 135 month term will likely keep Weigman behind bars until 2018 .
Known in the telephone party - line scene as “ Li’l Hacker , ” Weigman is widely considered one of the best phone hackers alive .
Relying on an ironclad memory and detailed knowledge of the phone system , the teenager is known for using social engineering to manipulate phone company workers and others into divulging confidential information , and into entering commands into computers and telephone switching equipment on his behalf .
The FBI had been chasing Weigman since he was 15 years old , at times courting him as an informant .
He was finally arrested in May of last year , less than two months after celebrating his 18th birthday .
“ I ’ve been interested in phones since I ’ve been about 8 , ” Weigman said in a 2007 interview with Wired.com .
“ I talked to technicians when they came down here to do things on my phone . ”
“ I will shoot . ” Listen to the Colorado Springs hostage hoax .
Disconnecting a phone .
Audio of Matthew Weigman at work .
In his plea deal with prosecutors , Weigman , who was born blind , admitted to a long criminal resume ( .pdf ) .
Among other things , he confessed to conspiring with other telephone hooligans who made hundreds of false calls to police that sent armed SWAT teams bursting into the homes of their party - line enemies .
Weigman also admitted eavesdropping on customer service calls to Sprint , by dialing into a phone line used by Sprint supervisors to monitor their employees .
Weigman parked on the spy line to overhear customers giving out their credit card numbers , which he memorized and passed to accomplices .
Weigman and his friends used the numbers to purchase computers and other electronics .
The FBI began investigating Weigman after he staged a 2005 hostage hoax that sent police to the Colorado home of Richard Gasper , a TSA screener whose daughter refused phone sex with Weigman .
When the FBI caught up with him more than a year later , cybercrime agent Allyn Lynd offered to make him a confidential informant , but called off the deal when AT&T discovered that Weigman was still manipulating the phone company .
Lynd later told a police detective that Weigman could n’t stop hacking for more than 72 hours .
Weigman ’s current case began in April , the month he reached adulthood .
William Smith , a Verizon security investigator who ’d been monitoring Weigman ’s hacking and phoning in updates to the FBI , noticed that Weigman had used the name and identifying information of a Texas woman to turn on phone service at the East Boston apartment he shared with his mother and siblings .
When Smith disconnected the fraudulent account , Weigman turned it back on again .
Then Weigman began making harassing phone calls to Smith at his house .
To trick the security worker into picking up the phone , the hacker socially engineered phone company employees into sharing Smith ’s billing records in near - real time , then used Caller ID spoofing to make Smith think someone was returning his own calls , according to court records .
“ For example , Smith would call a travel agency to arrange for a flight , ” the FBI ’s Lynd wrote in an affidavit .
“ A few minutes later , he would receive a phone call which appeared to be coming from the travel agency that he had just booked a flight through .
When Smith answered the phone , Weigman would begin harassing him again . ”
Then on May 18 , Weigman showed up at Smith ’s New Hampshire home with his burly older brother , and a party line friend named Sean Paul Benton .
Smith felt intimidated and called the police , who arrested the hacker .
Benton , who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice , was sentenced Friday to 18 months .

No exceptions to immunization of 12 million , says health minister
Paul Joseph Watson

Monday , August 3 , 2009
Greece has become the latest country to announce it will enforce a mandatory swine flu vaccination program , despite fears about the jabs containing mercury and squalene .
Despite the fact that there have been no deaths whatsoever from swine flu in the Mediterranean country , the Greek government has resolved to immunize its entire population of 12 million , all but guaranteeing that several thousand at least will be injured or be killed by the vaccine which is set to be fast tracked in Europe with no human testing at all .
“ We decided that the entire population , all citizens and residents , without any exception , will be vaccinated against the flu , ” Health Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos said after a ministerial meeting .
“ We are only waiting for the European Union ’s approval to start vaccinating everyone , ” a Health Ministry official told Reuters .
As we highlighted last week , many batches of the H1N1 vaccine will will contain mercury , a toxin linked with autism and neurological disorders .
Cases of autism in the U.S. have increased by 1,500 per cent since 1991 , which is when vaccines for children doubled .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The swine flu jab will also contain the dangerous ingredient squalene , which has been directly linked with cases of Gulf War Syndrome and a host of other debilitating diseases .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Squalene “ contributed to the cascade of reactions called “ Gulf War syndrome .
( GIs developed ) arthritis , fibromyalgia , lymphadenopathy , rashes , photosensitive rashes , malar rashes , chronic fatigue , chronic headaches , abnormal body hair loss , non-healing skin lesions , aphthous ulcers , dizziness , weakness , memory loss , seizures , mood changes , neuropsychiatric problems , anti-thyroid effects , anaemia , elevated ESR ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , multiple sclerosis , ALS , Raynaud ’s phenomenon , Sjorgren ’s syndrome , chronic diarrhea , night sweats and low - grade fever , ” according to Micropaleontologist Dr. Viera Scheibner .
Health authorities in both the UK and the U.S. have implied that the upcoming mass vaccination program against H1N1 will be mandatory , but no formal decision has been communicated to the public .
However , both countries are in the process of purchasing enough doses to cover the entire population .
A member of the public who was concerned about a mandatory mass vaccination program in light of the swine flu pandemic called the Arkansas State Health Department for advice only to be told that mandatory vaccines were constitutional and could be enforced at gunpoint by the government if necessary .
Pharmaceutical companies can be assured that they wo n’t face reprisals for the many thousands of injuries and deaths that will inevitably occur as a result of exposing millions to mercury and squalene during a mass vaccination program , because the government has already acted to provide them with blanket immunity from lawsuits .
“ Vaccine makers and federal officials will be immune from lawsuits that result from any new swine flu vaccine , under a document signed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , ” reported the Associated Press last month .

Yelling at Reform
As orchestrated efforts continue to disrupt civil discourse on the future of health insurance coverage in America , Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke with MSNBC's Keith Olbermann Monday night about these tactics .
Sanders talked about the staged , anti-health insurance reform protests taking place at town meetings across the country .
“ The fact of the matter is that these people talk about freedom , and what they are doing is trying to disrupt town meetings , which is the absolute opposite of what freedom of discussion is about .
The reason for that is that they are afraid to debate the real issues , the fact that we have a disintegrating health care system … ”
Sen .
Sanders frequently holds town meetings across the State of Vermont .
He allows Vermonters of all political persuasions and opinions to ask questions and make statements .

Nonetheless , I 've come across my share of possessed " gays " and " lesbians " and all I can recommend is that Tough Love solves it .
No way should you coddle them or plead for the demons to leave !
You need to be strong !
One recommendation of mine that has shown practical results is Associative Therapy .
Tie this lesbian to a chair and place eye clamps over her eyes .
Put on a movie / TV show where there is a lot of lesbian scenes .
Everytime a lesbian scene comes up , a good high voltage , low amp shock should be inducted into her .
Put on a program which emphasizes True Christian™ values like heterosexual love or women being mothers and everytime one of these positive images appear on screen , release the eye clamps enabling her to refresh her eyes and put on soothing music .
After a while , between the electric shocks and the eye refreshment , she will unconsciously associate homosexuality with pain .
This gives you an open door to then exorcise the demon .
Use mild forms of " torture " , actually what should properly be termed " love actions " to entice the demon to leave the body .
Demons cannot stay in a body experiencing pain .
Electric shocks , cigarette burns , harsh whippings across the bare skin , pouring salt in the eyes .... be creative in your methods , but make sure you get that demon out !
Remember :
You are not trying to harm her for her own sake , but doing a necessary evil to release her from the demons !
Keep your eye on the bigger picture :
She may experience temporary physical pain , but do not let her soul be aeternally damned to Hell !
After an extended period of time and multiple sessions , the demon will be out of her .
She may exhibit signs of what Jew psychologists call " Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder " but what she is actually experiencing is the relief of having an evil demon free from her body .
She may behave more submissive , fearful , anxious , and never look you in the eye , but those are good things !
I 've done these methods on a multitude on women over the years and I claim 100 % success .
Just make sure you keep your exorcism clandestine and sternly warn the woman never to speak about it , since law enforcement sometimes works for the atheist and homosexual agenda and may injustly prosecute you for a so - called " crime " when you are just doing the work of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on this Earth .
Best of luck to you .
Oh and I have some of my homosexual exorcism sessions available on VHS which I can send to you .
Let me know if you need some visual aids on the How - To !
Brother Lazarus , while most homosexuals choose their sin out of personal choice , every now and then an innocent heterosexual True Christian™ person becomes unwaringly possessed by a demon and acts out according to the demon 's wishes instead of their own personal free will .
These are delicate matters since the person is a victim of an external force and not willingly engaging in homosexuality .
Nonetheless , I 've come across my share of possessed " gays " and " lesbians " and all I can recommend is that Tough Love solves it .
No way should you coddle them or plead for the demons to leave !
You need to be strong !

Everytime a lesbian scene comes up , a good high voltage , low amp shock should be inducted into her .
Put on a program which emphasizes True Christian™ values like heterosexual love or women being mothers and everytime one of these positive images appear on screen , release the eye clamps enabling her to refresh her eyes and put on soothing music .
After a while , between the electric shocks and the eye refreshment , This gives you an open door to then exorcise the demon .
Use mild forms of " torture " , actually what should properly be termed " love actions " to entice the demon to leave the body .
Demons cannot stay in a body experiencing pain .
Electric shocks , cigarette burns , harsh whippings across the bare skin , pouring salt in the eyes .... be creative in your methods , Remember :
You are not trying to harm her for her own sake , but doing a necessary evil to release her from the demons !
Keep your eye on the bigger picture :
She may experience temporary physical pain , but do not let her soul be aeternally damned to Hell !
After an extended period of time and multiple sessions , the demon will be out of her .
She may exhibit signs of what Jew psychologists call " Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder " but what she is actually experiencing is the relief of having an evil demon free from her body .
She may behave more submissive , fearful , anxious , and never look you in the eye , but those areI 've done these methods on a multitude on women over the years and I claim 100 % success .
Just make sure you keep your exorcism clandestine and sternly warn the woman never to speak about it , since law enforcement sometimes works for the atheist and homosexual agenda and may injustly prosecute you for a so - called " crime " when you are just doing the work of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on this Earth .
Best of luck to you .
Oh and I have some of my homosexual exorcism sessions available on VHS which I can send to you .

My Personal Story
Development tool provider Digini said that it will stop support for its subscription - based development engine Blade3D in six months -- and competing engine developer Unity is swooping in with a discount offer for Blade3D customers who were " left out in the cold .
" Blade Games CEO
Tom Sperry said in a forum post in late July , " We have decided to wind down Blade3D in its current form as a 3D game engine and leverage the technology in a new direction .
" Sperry did not reveal the specifics of that new direction .
Current subscribers will get the next six months ' use of Blade3D free of charge .
The engine was available at a monthly rate from between $ 14.95 ( for hobbyists ) to $ 99.95 ( for game companies , per seat ) .
Blade3D customers posting in the Digini forums were discouraged by the news .
" I do n't know what to think , someone has just pulled the development platform I chose from under my feet , " said one user .
" So ... I 've got months of tools as - is to use for free .
...
But really now I 've got to find something else if I want to develop a game .
" Another poster wrote , " A shame really .
It was a good engine , but without the source and a subscription based license , I see my fears have come to fruition , much sooner than I had expected .
" Competing engine developer Unity saw the Blade3D shutdown as an opportunity to gain more customers for its own tools .
In a Friday post on Unity 's official blog , CEO David Helgason said Unity would " [ credit ] subscription fees a Blade3D customer has paid towards any Unity license , up to 50 percent off its full price .
" He added , " Since Blade3D used C# for scripting just like Unity can , anyone well versed in Blade3D will be right at home in Unity .
" Helgason said the Unity user community stands at around 10,000 developers .
The company 's engine supports PC , Mac , iPhone and Wii .
Mod_rewrite is an Apache - based rewrite engine for dynamically rewriting URLs .
It ’s built into Apache servers natively , though not enabled by default .
It ’s capable of functions beyond simple rewrites , though , some of which are included below .
Turn Mod_Rewrite On
Mod_rewrite is used through your .htaccess file .
Place the following code at the beginning of your .htaccess file to turn mod_rewrite on :
RewriteEngine on
( Do n’t forget that .htaccess commands are case - sensitive . )
This code needs to be entered at the beginning of any .htaccess file using mod_rewrite .
The Basic Mod_Rewrite Layout
The basic format for a mod_rewrite command is :
RewriteRule Pattern Substitution [ Flag(s ) ]
URLs are Always Relative
The URL you redirect to is always relative to the directory in which your .htaccess file is placed .
So if it ’s in the root directory , URLs are all in relation to the root directory ; if it ’s in a sudirectory , URLs are in relation to that particular subdirectory .
A Basic Redirect
If you just want to create a simple 301 redirect from one URL to another , then use the following code :
RewriteRule ^fileone.html$ filetwo.html
This is a very basic rule that means any requests for fileone .
html will be sent to filetwo.html .
Require no “ www ”
This bit of code will make it so visitors to your site do n’t need to type in the “ www ” bit of your website address .
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^domain\.com $ [ NC ] RewriteRule ^(.* ) $
http://domain.com/$1 [ R=301, L ]
Block a Specific IP Address
If you want to block someone coming from a specific IP address from accessing your website , you can use the following code :
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} ^( A\.B\.C\.D ) $ RewriteRule ^/* http://www.domain.com/sorry.html [ L ]
Replace the A\.B\.C\.D with the IP address you want to block ( do n’t forget to leave the “ \ ” before each dot , which escapes the character ) .
Block Specific User Agents
If you want to block a group of IP addresses using the same User Agent ( bot ) , the following code with do it :
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} UserAgent RewriteRule .* - [ F, L ]
Just replace the “ UserAgent ” bit with whatever user agent you want to block .
You can also block more than one at a time by replacing the top line in that code with something like this :
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} UserAgentA [ OR ] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}
UserAgentB
You can put as many user agents in as you want , just make sure you end each line with [ OR ] ( with the exception of the last line , of course ) .
Strip Query Strings
Let ’s say all the pages on your site other than your home page are formatted as follows , with query strings instead of page names :
http://www.domain.com/home.html?example=12345abcd
Those are n’t very pretty , and on top of that , search engines will show a bunch of duplicated “ home ” pages .
If you want to get rid of the query string in your page URLs , use the following code :
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} example= RewriteRule (.*)
http://www.domain.com/$1? [ R=301 ]
This not only gets rid of the query string , but also the preceding question mark .
Set up a Default Image
Using a default , backup image in case of broken images can make your site look more professional .
Use the following code to redirect to a default image for any image whose file cannot be found .
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^images /.*\. jpg$ /images/default.jpg [ L ]
Of course , you can change the “ .jpg ” bit to whatever file type you ’re using .
Make sure you have an image called “ default.jpg ” or change that to whatever your default image filename is .
Prevent Hotlinking
The last thing most website owners want is other sites stealing their content or worse — hotlinking to their images and stealing their bandwidth .
Here ’s a simple bit of code that prevents it :
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$ RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ! ^
http://(www\.)?domain.com/ .*$ [ NC ] RewriteRule \.( gif|jpg|swf|flv|png ) $ / feed / [ R=302,L ]
Make sure you change the “ domain.com ” bit to your own domain name .
Redirect to a Maintenance Page
If you need to take your entire site offline for a bit and redirect to a maintenance page ( or some other page ) , use the following code :
RedirectMatch 302 ^/ /maintenancepage.html
Change the “ maintenancepage.html ” bit to wherever your maintenance page file is located .
Redirect Multiple Domains to a Single Domain
If you have multiple domains pointing to your site , it ’s possible you could take a hit in the search engines for having duplicate content .
Use the following code to redirect visitors from two domains to just one :
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.domain.net$ [ NC, OR ] RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain.net $ [ NC, OR ] RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.domain.net$ [ NC ] RewriteRule ^(.* ) $
http://domain.net/$1 [ R=301,L ]
Remember the Filesystem Always Takes Precedence
The filesystem on your server will always take precedence over the rewritten URL .
For example , if you have a directory named “ services ” and within that directory is a file called “ design.html ” , you ca n’t have the URL redirect to “ http://domain.com/services”.
What happens is that Apache goes into the “ services ” directory and does n’t see the rewrite instructions .
To fix this , simply rename your directory ( adding an underscore to the beginning or end is a simple way to do that ) .
Remember :
Because mod_rewrite works within the .htaccess file , commands are case sensitive .
Always back up your .htaccess file before making any changes to it .
This way , if there ’s a problem , you can easily restore your site .

Anti-British protests have been held outside the UK embassy in Tehran Some UK embassy staff detained in Tehran and accused of inciting protests after disputed elections will face trial , a top Iranian cleric says .
Guardians Council chief Ahmad Jannati said : " Naturally they will be put on trial , they have made confessions . "
Nine embassy staff were held last weekend .
Britain says all but two have now been freed .
European Union governments summoned Iranian ambassadors to protest against the detentions .
An EU official told the BBC that , in addition , visas for Iranians holding Iranian diplomatic passports would be suspended .
The official said other measures , including the withdrawal of EU ambassadors from Iran , would be considered if the two staff members were not released .
After the election , the enemy could not stand people 's joy and made an effort to poison the people
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati
Britain and Iran 's fraught history Protests gripped Tehran and other Iranian cities after June 's presidential election , amid claims the vote had been rigged in favour of the incumbent , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The Guardians Council - Iran 's supreme legislative body , which Ayatollah Jannati heads - on Monday ratified his re-election , following a partial recount .
' Velvet revolution ' plan Ayatollah Jannati did not say how many employees would be tried or on what charges .
" In these incidents , their embassy had a presence , some people were arrested , " he told the thousands of worshippers at Friday prayers , according to news agencies .

Ayatollah Jannati said on Friday : " After the election , the enemy could not stand people 's joy .
The enemy made an effort to poison the people .
They had planned a velvet revolution before the election . "
He said the UK Foreign Office had warned of possible " street riots " around the 12 June election and had advised its nationals to avoid public places .
BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says Ayatollah Jannati's speech marks a significant deterioration in the already bad relationship between London and Tehran .
' Deeply concerned '
Tehran has repeatedly accused foreign powers - especially Britain and the US - of stoking unrest after the election .
Britain has protested strongly against the arrests and rejected the Iranian allegations as baseless .
IRAN UNREST 12 June presidential election saw incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 63 % of vote Main challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi called for result to be annulled for electoral fraud Street protests saw at least 17 people killed and foreign media restricted

In the fallout from the crisis , Tehran expelled two British diplomats and the UK responded with a similar measure .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Britain was urgently seeking clarification from Iran about a possible trial and remained " deeply concerned " about the two staff members in detention .
" We are confident that our staff have not engaged in any improper or illegal behaviour , " he said .
The Foreign Office later confirmed that Iranian envoy Rasoul Movahedian had been summoned and the same message reiterated .
Five of the nine employees were reportedly released on Monday and Iranian state media said on Wednesday it had freed three more , but British and EU officials say two remain in custody .
Iran 's semi-official
Fars news agency reported this week that one of the detainees had played a " remarkable role during the recent unrest in managing it behind the scenes " .
Iran 's Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , last month described Britain , as the " most evil " of its enemies .
Library ballot boxes
The issue of how to deal with Iran is set to dominate the summit of the Group of Eight ( G8 ) industrialised nations in Italy next week .
Some EU countries have urged caution , arguing that Europe should engage with Iran , not isolate it .
But if the embassy staff are put on trial , the EU may have few other options than to tighten the diplomatic screw , correspondents say .
Meanwhile , the governor of one of Iran 's biggest cities , Shiraz , has denied reports that a number of sealed ballot boxes in its main library contained votes from last month 's election .
Ebrahim Azizi said the boxes were from previous polls and that the interior ministry had ordered they be archived there .
Earlier this week , an Iranian journalist posted pictures on the internet of several ballot boxes sitting on the floor of the library .

Lanny Davis wants to “ name names , publish photographs ” of the conservative mob
It ’s a sad fact the right just does n’t know how to fight like the left does .
We ’re simply too nice , and too civil .
But now , the fear that we could lose this once great nation to socialism has brought conservatives to attention .
The right is now successfully utilizing some of the same tactics the left has employed for years – demonstration and protest .
Barack Obama and his followers are none too happy about this development and , frankly , they are utterly confused as to how to fight back .
First , they called the peaceful Tea Party protesters racist and domestic terrorists .
Now with fired up conservatives standing up to the men and women of congress in their home districts , they find they must resort to calling the concerned citizens simply asking question of their elected officials , fascist “ mobs . ”
Democratic Strategist Lanny
Davis took his turn at bat yesterday at Politico , accusing conservatives of thuggery , using fascist tactics to cause disruption .
Worse of all , he wants to “ have the media name names , publish photographs , and do interviews of those responsible … ”
This comes on the heels of Linda Douglass , Communications Director for the White House ’s Health Reform Office , who just this week asked all citizens to report any “ fishy ” talk , emails or websites to the White House so they can investigate any “ disinformation ” about healthcare .
Here are Orwellian words of Lanny Davis from yesterday , August 5 :
The “ shout downs ” organized by the Republican right meet one of the classic definition of “ fascist ” tactics –defined as using shouting and disruption to deprive the civil and respectful debate of ideas .
There is literally no defense to these tactics .
I do n’t criticize those who feel genuine anger or fear and show up to meetings to express those emotions .
But I do call out the tactic of screaming and disrupting a meeting and the fact that this is a systematic tactic by thugs who want to prevent civil discourse , not promote it .
Let ’s have the media name names , publish photographs , and do interviews of those responsible for approving , even organizing these techniques .
And let ’s find an investigative journalist – are there many left – to prove these so - called grassroots shouters are , or are not , being paid .
It took a year or more to prove that the so - called grassroots protesters shouting and pounding on the windows of the vote counters in Dade County – successfully stopping the vote – were really paid Republican congressional staffers , many then on the public payroll , and from the Republican National Committee and the Bush 2000 presidential campaign staff .
Will that story of paid people to disrupt and block discussion organized by the Republican Party or tacitly encouraged while Republican rightwing organizations organize them at least be investigated ?
We know we ’ve been saying this a lot lately , but is it 1984 yet ?

A motorist fleeing police ran a stop sign and crashed into a pickup truck in Tulare County southeast of Fresno , killing himself and two passengers , as well as four children who were ejected from the truck , authorities said today .
The California Highway Patrol said no one in either vehicle appeared to have been wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision Saturday afternoon .
The children in the truck , including an 8 - year - old who was injured , were not properly restrained .
All of the children were believed to be from the same family .
The crash occurred at the intersection of Avenue 424 and Road 120 , about four miles from where a Dinuba , Calif. , police officer tried to pull over a Dodge Neon .
The motorist allegedly ran a stop sign on East Nebraska Avenue and then sped through a second stop sign , crashing into a GMC Sierra pickup truck , said CHP Officer Felipe Martinez .
All three men in the Neon died at the scene ; one was thrown from the car , Martinez said .
Two other adults in the car were injured and taken to a local hospital , the CHP said .
They were identified as Carlos Salazar Jr. , 29 , and Jennifer Salazar , 26 , apparently from nearby Orange Cove .
Martinez said the Neon was reportedly a stolen vehicle but that investigators were unsure whether the three men were responsible for the theft .
The four children in the pickup truck – a 3 - year - old boy and three girls , ages 1 , 4 and 7 – died at the scene , said CHP Officer Kirk Arnold .
The victims ’ identities were not immediately available .
Arnold said it appeared that all those in the pickup were members of the same family .

Music legend Bob Dylan is " talking to a couple of car companies " about becoming the voice of their GPS system .
The singer - songwriter discussed the possibility on his BBC Radio 6 Music Sunday show which was on the theme of street maps .
Renowned for his raspy , nasally tones , the 68 - year - old American gave his listeners a taster of what his directions might sound like .
" Left at the next street .
No , right .
You know what ?
Just go straight . "
He continued : " I probably should n't do it because whichever way I go , I always end up at one place - on Lonely Avenue .
Luckily I 'm not totally alone .
Ray Charles beat me there . "
The normally reclusive Dylan , whose hits include Blowin ' in the Wind and Like a Rolling Stone , admitted he does not normally like telling people what he is doing .
His Theme Time Radio Hour is on Mondays at midnight .
The singer is currently on hiatus , and this week 's show was a repeat .
His comments had not previously been reported .
Comedian John
Cleese is one of several celebrities who have already lent their voices to sat -nav devices .
Other sat -nav voices include Susan Skipper , who appeared as Nigel Havers ' posh girlfriend in the 1980s sitcom Do n't Wait Up ; and Eve Karpf , who voice - dubbed the famous line : " Monsieur , with these Rocher you are really spoiling us " in a chocolate commercial .
But a feeling of ownership does n't hold up in court .
And at this point , the law is n't clear on whether you have the right to own and control your tissues .
When they 're part of your body , they 're clearly yours .
Once they 're excised , things get murky .
The scale of tissue research is only getting bigger .
" It used to be , some researcher in Florida had 60 samples in his freezer , then another guy in Utah had some in his , " says Kathy Hudson , a molecular biologist who directs the Genetics and Public Policy Center at Johns Hopkins University .
" Now we 're talking about a massive , massive scale . "
Within the last year , the National Cancer Institute started gathering what it expects will be millions of tissue samples for mapping cancer genes ; the Genographic Project began doing the same to map human migration patterns , as did the N.I.H. to track disease genes .
Many scientists depend on access to tissues without the burden of restrictions that donors might make .
( Restrictions like ,
You can use my tissues for this research , not that research ; do n't commercialize them , or do , and give me a cut . )
At this point , scientists largely have the access they want .
And they hope to keep it that way for fear that restrictions might slow research .
But a growing number of activists -- ethicists , lawyers , doctors and patients -- are arguing cases and pushing for federal regulations that would change the status quo by granting people rights to control their tissues .
These days , their attention is focused on a potentially landmark court case : Washington University is claiming ownership of tissues from 6,000 patients who want their samples removed from the university 's prostate - cancer bank .
Hudson , who has conducted focus groups about the public 's feelings on the tissue issue , says she believes that tissue rights have the potential to become a bona fide movement .
" I could see a broader mobilization where people start saying , ' No , you ca n't take my tissues , " ' she told me .
" All I can say is , we better deal with the problems now instead of waiting until that happens . "
Anna O'Connell agrees .
The day I visited her lab , she rolled a vial of Ted Slavin 's serum in her hand .
We sat as she told me she wanted to see this issue settled , but she wanted to make one thing clear : scientists are n't out to deceive people about their tissues .
" We genuinely want to gather as much information as we can to advance research , " she said .
" The problem is , in all that excitement , sometimes scientists do n't think about consequences . "
The $ 3 Billion Man
The tissue rights debate began in 1976 , with a man named John Moore .
He worked 12 - hour days , 7 days a week , as a surveyor on the Alaska pipeline .
He thought it was killing him .
His gums bled ; his belly swelled ; bruises covered his body .
It turned out that he had hairy - cell leukemia , a rare cancer that filled his spleen with malignant blood cells until it bulged like an overfilled inner tube .
Moore found David Golde , a prominent cancer researcher at U.C.L.A. , who said that removing his spleen was the only way to go .
As Moore told it to the courts and the media , he signed a consent form saying that the hospital could " dispose of any severed tissue or member by cremation . "
A normal spleen weighs less than a pound ; Moore 's weighed 22 .
After the surgery , at the age of 31 , Moore moved to Seattle , became an oyster salesman , went on with his life .
But every few months , he flew to Los Angeles for follow - up exams with Golde .
At first , Moore did n't think much of the trips .
But after a few years of flying from Seattle to L.A. so that Golde could take bone marrow , blood and semen , Moore started thinking , Ca n't a doctor in Seattle do this ?
When Moore asked Golde about doing his follow - ups in Seattle , Golde offered to pay for the plane tickets and put him up in style at the ritzy Beverly Wilshire .
Moore did n't start getting suspicious until one day in 1983 -- seven years after his surgery -- when a nurse handed him a consent form that said , " I ( do , do not ) voluntarily grant to the University of California all rights I , or my heirs , may have in any cell line or any other potential product which might be developed from the blood and / or bone marrow obtained from me . "
At first , Moore circled " do . "
" It 's , like , you do n't want to rock the boat , " Moore told Discover magazine years later .
" You think maybe this guy will cut you off , and you 're going to die or something . "
But when the nurse gave him an identical form during his next visit , Moore asked whether Golde was doing something commercial with his tissues .
According to Moore , Golde said that U.C.L.A. would never do such a thing .
But Moore circled " do not , " just in case .
That 's when Golde started calling , saying :
You must have accidentally mis-signed the consent form .
Come back and sign again .
" I did n't feel comfortable confronting him , " Moore said later , " so I said , ' Gee , Doctor , I do n't know how I could have made that mistake . " '
But he did n't go back and sign .
Nerve fibers that link perception and motor regions of the brain are disconnected in tone - deaf people , according to new research in The Journal of Neuroscience .
Experts estimate that at least 10 percent of the population may be tone deaf – unable to sing in tune .
The new finding identifies a particular brain circuit that appears to be absent in these individuals .
" The anomaly suggests that tone - deafness may be a previously undetected neurological syndrome similar to other speech and language disorders , in which connections between perceptual and motor regions are impaired , " said Psyche Loui , PhD , of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School , one of the study 's authors .
The authors used an MRI - based technique called diffusion tensor imaging to examine connections between the right temporal and frontal lobes .
This region , a neural " highway " called the arcuate fasciculus , is known to be involved in linking music and language perception with vocal production .
Brain images of 20 people were taken , half of whom had been identified as tone - deaf through listening tests .
The arcuate fasciculus was smaller in volume and had a lower fiber count in the tone - deaf individuals .
More notably , the superior branch of the arcuate fasciculus in the right hemisphere could not be detected in the tone - deaf individuals .
The researchers speculated that this could mean the branch is missing entirely , or is so abnormally deformed that it appears invisible to even the most advanced neuroimaging methods .
" The findings are clear , " said Nina Kraus , PhD , at Northwestern University , who was unaffiliated with the study .
" They show that the arcuate fasciculus , a structure long - known to join perceptual and motor areas , has reduced connectivity in individuals with tone deafness .
Beyond improving our understanding of the anatomical underpinnings of tone - deafness , this study provides new insight into a person 's ability to detect pitch , " Kraus said .
These findings add to previous work by the same researchers demonstrating that tone - deaf people could not consciously hear their own singing , and work by other researchers indicating abnormalities in brain regions that affect sound perception and production .

Twitter went offline today due to a Distributed Denial of Service attack .
There were reports that other sites were impacted too , but service was only mildly affected .
Here is a snapshot of the dropoff in traffic to Twitter according to Arbor Networks :
The below graph shows Observatory data from 55 providers around the world to Twitter ’s two NTT hosted addresses blocks : 168.143.0.0/16 , 128.121.0.0/16 .
From the data , Twitter traffic declined abruptly around 9 am EDT this morning .
We generally do n’t see a lot of data ( i.e. it takes thousands of tweets to match the bandwidth of a single video ) , but 55 ISPs in the Internet Observatory were exchanging roughly 200 Mbps with Twitter before the DDoS .
Then traffic dropped to a low of 60 Mbps around 10:40 am and began climbing after that .
As of 1 pm EDT , Twitter traffic was still down by 50 % at 150 Mbps ( normally we see close to 300 Mbps for this time of day ) .
According to Facebook ’s Chief Security Officer Max Kelly , the denial of service attacks that took Twitter offline and impacted the performance of Facebook , LiveJournal and Google ’s Blogger sites were because someone had set out to silence the voice of a single person– A Georgian blogger by the name of Cyxymu , who had an account on each of the affected web services .
If this is true , it represents an amazing operation by some organization to squelch his speech .
From CNET here :
A Russian activist blogger with accounts on Twitter , Facebook , LiveJournal and Google ’s Blogger and YouTube was targeted in a denial of service attack that led to the site - wide outage at Twitter and problems at the other sites on Thursday , according to a Facebook executive .
The pro-Georgian blogger , who uses the account name “ Cyxymu , ” had accounts on all of the different sites that were attacked at the same time , Max Kelly , chief security officer at Facebook , told CNET News .
“ It was a simultaneous attack across a number of properties targeting him to keep his voice from being heard , ” Kelly said .
“ We ’re actively investigating the source of the attacks and we hope to be able to find out the individuals involved in the back end and to take action against them if we can . ”
Kelly declined to speculate on whether Russian nationalists were behind the attack , but said : “ You have to ask who would benefit the most from doing this and think about what those people are doing and the disregard for the rest of the users and the Internet . ”
Twitter was down for several hours beginning early Thursday morning , and suffered periodic slowness and time - outs throughout the day .
I do n’t want to speculate on who was behind the attack , whether it was a criminal organization , a nation - state or a combination of the two .
But it should be noted that criminal malware authors also picked today to launch an updated version of the Koobface Virus , which propagates by using facebook and twitter posts to trick people into downloading trojanized software .
Any outage of Twitter during this attack would certainly be at odds with this criminal organization since it would impact their ability to distribute malware and thus make money .

Make a Mega Drop - Down Menu with jQuery
So how would we go about implementing Mega drop down menus ?
While it ’d be great to do all of this in pure HTML and CSS , it ’s impossible at the moment to get those nice half - second delays — and of course there ’s a pesky problem with Internet Explorer 6 , which only supports : hover on anchor elements .
Instead , I ’ve whipped up a solution using jQuery and a very nifty plugin called hoverIntent .
Creating a Filterable Portfolio with jQuery
If you have worked in your field for a while , there is a pretty good chance that you have a rather extensive portfolio .
To make it a little easier to navigate , you will probably be tempted to break them into different categories .
In this tutorial , I will show you how to make “ filtering by category ” a little more interesting with just a little bit of jQuery .

Better form submission feedback with jQuery Browsers fail to give users effective feedback when the user submits a form .
Users respond by clicking the submit button over and over .
The problem compounds when users find out they ’ve been charged 5 times or when you receive 5 contact submissions .
The solution is to replace the submit button with a friendly message letting the user know the form is working .
How to Make a Threadless Style T - Shirt Gallery
Here ’s the gist :
There ’s a thumbnail which is a full sized image in a container div , which is smaller than the full sized image .
The image is centered within it , but does n’t show entirely because overflow : hidden is turned on .
When the mouse hovers over the thumbnail , overflow : hidden gets turned off , and the entire image is displayed .

Using Form Labels as Input Values with jQuery and CSS I nice little additive to web forms is to put the input labels inside of the inputs box as the starting value .
By using jQuery to bring the label in as the value we can archive the desired effect without impacting accessibility , since the label elements are still there .
Then we can take it a step further by dynamically adding a class to the input and use CSS to style the form only if JavaScript is enabled .
The search box at the top of this page is an example of this technique .

jQuery and Ajax Best Demos Part - 2
A small list of jQuery and Ajax demos .
A jQuery inline form validation , because validation is a mess Të Position Absolute
When it comes to form validation , it ’s hard to have a versatile solution that works with every form .
Figuring out how to display errors is not a simple task .
This is something I tried to remedy with this script .
When an error needs to be displayed , the script creates a div and positions it in the top right corner of the input .
This way you do n’t have to worry about your HTML form structure .
The rounded corner and shadow are done with CSS3 and degrade well in non compliant browsers .
There is no images needed .
How to create a sliding image / reveal content with jquery Someone asked me about this effect a while ago and i thought i should make a tutorial about this .
The youlove .us scrolling background effect explained
The technique is actually a lot simpler than it looks , it ’s based around scrolling a very tall gradient image behind some transparent PNG images .
The header image ( with our logo , strapline and the laptop ) has a transparent background and solid text , while the main page is actually an image with the heading text as transparent cut outs .
Creating a Keyboard with CSS and jQuery Sometimes it ’s just fun to play around with the programming languages we know and see what we can create .
I thought it might be nice to create a little online keyboard with CSS , and then make it work with jQuery .

Building a jQuery Image Scroller
In this tutorial , we ’re going to be building an image scroller , making use of jQuery ’s excellent animation features and generally having some fun with code .
Image scrollers are of course nothing new ; versions of them come out all the time .
Many of them however are user - initiated ; meaning that in order for the currently displayed content to change , the visitor must click a button or perform some other action .
This scroller will be different in that it will be completely autonomous and will begin scrolling once the page loads .
Horizontal Scroll Menu with jQuery Tutorial
In this tutorial you will learn how to create a scroll menu .
In the final result you will be able to scroll up and down according to mouse -y axis and we ’ll use jQuery .
color to animate the background - color changes .
SpriteMenu
This is a method of putting together a nice - looking menu in a very quick and easy way .
It uses a technique known as CSS Sprites .
Instead of trying to manage huge amounts of images , everything is packed into just one file , which means the browser will only have to download one file instead of making multiple requests , and its just a lot easier to manage .
The menu is displayed by manipulating the background - position property to display individual sprites in the image .
There are no drop - downs attached to the menu , but it should n’t be hard to add them in which I may do in the future .
Slicker Show and Hide
jMar
We ’re going to tell the script to loop through all of the comments on the page .
If the member link on the current comment matches the member link in the profile , then it must be an author comment .
The script will then apply an additional class to the comment , allowing you to style it separately .

“ Outside the Box ” Navigation with jQuery Just about every website uses the regular navigation concepts we ’re all used to .
After awhile this can get pretty boring , especially for designers who thrive on creativity .
While mimicking the OS X dock and stacks is n’t new , it ’s certainly not common
Animate Image Filling Up Using jQuery
Studies show that top navigations tend to get the most visual attention when a user first visits a site .
Having organized and intuitive navigation is key × and while most drop down menus may look aesthetically pleasing , developing them to degrade gracefully is also essential .
In this tutorial I would like to go over how to create a sexy drop down menu that can also degrade gracefully .

Smoking during a brain scan is not easy .
Why would you want to ?
Because functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) allows researchers to observe activity in the brain , and doing so while smoking tobacco or pot could enhance our understanding of addiction and how to treat it .
But during an MRI , the head must remain completely still .
In the narrow bore of a superconducting magnet , there is n't much room to maneuver a cigarette or eat a pot brownie either .
Smoke raises a second set of concerns .
At the very least , it will stink up the lab .
Perhaps , it could even damage the expensive machine .
So Blaise Frederick at Harvard Medical School built a device that delivers smoke into the narrow confines of a scanner .
His colleagues , Kim Lindsey and Liz Ryan , tested it out on nine volunteers at McLean Hospital .
They described their work in the May issue of Pharmacology , Biochemistry , and Behavior .
Since that project was completed , Lindsey has used the same equipment to study the neurological effects of tobacco .
Last Friday , Scott Lukas , the ringmaster for these studies and director of the Behavioral
Psychopharmacology Research Laboratory was informed that he and Frederick will receive a grant to conduct further studies with marijuana .
Displaying skills that would put MacGyver to shame , Frederick constructed a makeshift water pipe inside of a picnic cooler , then ran
2.4 meters of tubing to a plastic facemask that rests inside of the scanner .
Since the mask is made from materials that are not magnetic , it will not interfere with the imaging .
To be sure that the contraption can get people high , Lindsey and her associates asked nine volunteers to inhale smoke from a marijuana cigarette with exactly 3.51 percent THC , then checked to see how much of the drug made it into their blood .
Using the mask , the subjects got almost as high as if they had puffed on a joint directly .
The researchers suggested using stronger weed to achieve more realistic effects .
Most important , the plastic facemask did not interfere with the scanner .
While the volunteers were smoking , they were given a visual stimulus .
Several sharp images of activity in their visual cortices showed that the Harvard scientists can credibly say , " This is your brain on drugs . "
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore , Calif. , are creating what is in effect a vast digital petri dish able to hold one million operating systems at once in an effort to study the behavior of rogue programs known as botnets .
Botnets are used extensively by malicious computer hackers to steal computing power from Internet - connected computers .
The hackers harness the stolen resources into a scattered but powerful computer that can be used to send spam , execute phishing scams or steal digital information .
These remote - controlled “ distributed computers ” are difficult to observe and track .
Botnets may take over parts of tens of thousands or in some cases even millions of computers , making them among the world ’s most powerful computers for some applications .
“ When a forest is on fire you can fly over it , but with a cyberattack you have no clear idea of what it looks like , ” said Ron Minnich , a Sandia scientist who specializes in computer security .
“ It ’s an extremely difficult task to get a global picture . ”

It was the “ o ” what did it , three swirling red crests with the vertiginous rabbit - hole center fading into white that hypnotized my attention and coaxed my bike tire left so that I nearly grazed the back wheel of a BMW .
It was an encounter I would have lost , surely , and it surely would have been my fault , though I ’m confident the owner was selfish and had no interest in looking out for my interests .
The bumper sticker was affixed with tape or static cling to the back windshield , hovering just below eye level .
“ Socialism Did n’t Work Last Time Either , ” only instead of the “ o ” in “ Socialism , ” some wag had substituted the Obama “ o ” .
One immutable law of rhetoric is that digs do n’t need to be accurate to make their point .
But as the BMW shifted gears and drag - raced past me , a second bumper sticker appeared , balancing the first like a convex diptych , secured in the other far corner of the back windshield , written in a cleaner sparer font than the fat white letters of “ Socialism . ”
“ Who is John Galt ? ” Who , indeed .
The allusion , of course , was Ayn Rand ’s Atlas Shrugged , a manifesto ( or apologia ) for capitalism unbound .
Galt is the Prometheus of productivity , a dynamo whose fiery ideas would ignite the economy if not for the vulture bureaucrats .
When Galt ( among others ) withdraws from society in the book and refuses to offer his liver to the body politic , the vultures panic , and society teeters on collapse .
The lesson — practically spelled out in italics — is that a few brilliants like Galt drive mankind forward , and any constraints on their activities impoverishes all .
Sporting a Galt bumper sticker ensures that you can take a moralistic stand without having to actually do anything .
I ’m going to leave aside here the dubious taste of anyone who ’d admit they read and liked Rand .
If you plotted Literary Merit on the x-axis versus Book Sales on the y - axis , the slope of the line for Rand ’s oeuvre would be undefined , a perfect vertical up and down .
She ’s atrocious with dialogue , unconvincing with sex , clumsy with pacing , heavy - handed with foreshadowing , lousy with clichés .
( I ’d add character development if she included any human beings in her stories . )
I ’m embarrassed for her , and she died in 1982 .
What Rand does have is conviction , utter conviction , conviction saturating every comma and period .
To her credit , she does summon up a unique world — only we happen to live , now , in an era antithetical to her vision , and have a president who disagrees on one or two or a thousand particulars .
( Though who , ironically , wrenched himself from obscurity through sheer will in a way that you rarely read about outside of Rand or Horatio Alger . )
According to The Economist , sales of Rand books spiked recently in the teeth of Obama ’s various reforms , economic gooses , and stimuli , making her decades - old books bestsellers all over again .
No one feels moved to scrawl “ Frodo lives ! ” on walls anymore .
It ’s “ Who is John Galt ? ”
Rand defines herself against all forms of collectivism , but she and her acolytes do n’t , can’t , acknowledge that her philosophy , sneakily named Objectivism ( talk about seizing the rhetorical high ground ! ) , has one important chromosome in common with socialism .
Socialism failed — and by “ socialism ” here I mean hard - core socialism , the kind tried and found wanting in the USSR and GDR , not the European democratic socialism that Obama does seem intent on introducing here — but hard - core socialism failed because it ’s a fantasy .
It ’s nonsense to think that human beings will learn to share their possessions for the common good , and it ’s nonsense to think that wars and greed and stomach aches will all cease once the government levels and razes all sign of status .
We ’ve always had the poor and we ’re always going to have them .
Charity can help ; but however nice it sounds to outlaw poverty , it ai n’t going to work .
That said , at least Karl Marx had the analytical talent to write a non-fictional and occasionally penetrating analysis of the capitalistic worldview .
Socialism is largely fantasy , but Galt and his ilk in the gulch are pure , unadulterated fantasy :
They appear in a novel .
How , how , how can someone condemn socialism as the paragon of a nice - sounding but dangerous policy and yet simultaneously cite what ’s more or less an economic Passion Play as the embodiment of a rational , level - headed , natural order ?
For Christ ’s sake , even Alan Greenspan has disabused himself , and no one drank more Rand - flavored Kool - Aid .
Okay .
At this point , I have to confuse things by making a small admission .
As long as I ’m not forced to read her actual writing , I ’m kinda sorta sympathetic with Rand .
Instinctively , I ’m a squishy libertarian — Nudge was written exactly for me — and I do find Rand ’s portrayals ( again , as long as I ’m just reading about them on Wikipedia ) of the jealous empty parasites who do seem to get on and get ahead in this stupid world hilarious in a bitterly hard - won way .
The Salieris who “ could n’t be , and know it . ”
But I recognize when I ’m fantasizing about a new world order .
I fully admit I would do a really , really bad job heading up any enterprise of any size larger than about two - point - five people ; if it was a business , we ’d declare insolvency within hours .
I ’m under no delusions that I ’m who John Galt is .
Rarely for her time , Rand rightly judged that Fascism and Socialism were more or less equivalent , with the far right and far left wrapping around the political continuum and swallowing each other .
But what Rand and her acolytes seem unable to grasp is that the cronyism , successful gamesmanship , and lack of scruples that she deplores in those systems are n’t products of collectivism .
They ’re products of human beings .
The mental Lilliputians often win out in Rand ’s horrorlands , but they ’d win out in her fantasylands just the same .
In fact without the restraining hand of at least a tiny bit of government , the forces Rand despised would gain even more naked power .
They would n’t suddenly let Galt and his gulch - mates be .
They ’d invade , they ’d rape , they ’d raze .
Some governments are superior to others and some do induce better behavior ; let ’s not kind ourselves on that .
But let ’s not kid ourselves here , either :
When people suck , it ’s usually because that ’s what people are like .
To answer the question in the BMW window , since I could n’t pedal fast enough .
Who is John Galt ?
No one who ever has , or ever can , exist .
Where to even begin with this segment from MSNBC's Morning Meeting .
I 've really got to wonder if a single one of these people has ever done a hard day of physical labor in their entire lives to be able to carry on trashing unions the way they did .
First , Dylan Ratigan asks if unions are against health - care reform because everyone having health - care benefits would mean union members ' benefits are no longer better than other non-union members ' benefits , and of course the only thing unions care about is getting bigger .
Ratigan does n't seem to understand that those benefits are bargained for and part of an overall compensation package , and that if we were n't having to bargain for the health - care benefits , that would likely play out in being able to negotiate for higher take - home pay or some other benefit instead .
He also ignores the fact that this would be good for unionized companies if the burden of paying health - care expenses were taken off of their backs , which would make them more competitive , thus also benefiting the workers at those companies .
Bernard follows with this :
Absolutely , the labor unions right now simply exist for one reason .
To self perpetuate receiving union dues and having political influence .
I think it 's absolutely amazing to watch that clip from The Rachel Maddow Show last night .
This guy is , he 's saying to President Obama , I 'm strong - arming you buddy .
And my answer to this would be they are showing themselves to be as ridiculous as many members of the American public think they are .
What happened to pragmatism ?
What happened to competition , and what actually happened to winning ?
Maybe it would be great for the Democratic Party to lose the support of labor unions because quite honestly a lot of labor unions are what holds America back and keeps us from being as good as we can be .
I 'd like to see these clowns try to have this conversation with someone like Leo Gerard at the table .
He 'd have eaten them for lunch .
Heaven forbid someone who represents labor might have a seat at this table .
I hate to break it to them , but unions care about a whole lot more than just building up membership and accumulating political power .
They have their problems like every other organization does , but to trash the only entity out there that is standing up for the interests of working Americans is just reprehensible .
They bargain for better pay and benefits , look out for the safety of workers on the job and they give the workers a chance to earn a living wage instead of a race to the bottom that there would be if corporations ran the whole show .
They also drive up the wages of of non-union workers in industries similar to the unionized ones and for the non-union workers within the same company .
Who 's going to volunteer to be someone 's non-union boss if your workers are making more money than you are ?
The Michelle Bernards and Dylan Ratigans and Mike Allens of the world will never have to worry about working double shifts at two lousy jobs just to take care of their families because their first job does n't pay enough to make the bills .
They 'll never have to worry about whether they might lose a hand at work because their company decided to skimp and not replace a guard on a piece of rotating equipment and they were afraid to complain about it because it might make their boss mad and find an excuse to fire them .
They wo n't have to worry about having a repetitive stress injury from doing the same task over and over all day , and because they have no union to ask that the jobs are rotated between workers , they can barely use their hands at a young age .
They 'll never have to be concerned that their backs are going out because they worked some job where they were stooped over day in and day out .
Instead , they sit on their pedestals and tell the public how awful the institutions that brought this country the end of child labor , the forty hour work week , overtime pay and a way for workers to be allowed to speak up for themselves in the work place without fear of losing their jobs are , and that all they care about is a " power grab " .
Oh carbon nanotubes , is there anything you can't do ?
Nanotubes can be envisioned as one - atom thick sheets of carbon that have been rolled into tubes .
Researchers know that when things get that small , they act a little weird , and labs around the world are now racing to capitalize on nanotubes ' strange properties .
With their extraordinary strength and fascinating knack for conducting electricity and heat , nanotubes are finding applications in everything from cancer treatments to hydrogen cars .
These structures of carbon may be tiny — a nanotube 's diameter is about 10,000 times smaller than a human hair — but their impact on science and technology has been enormous .
Here , we count down nine of the most enticing possibilities for these giants on the Lilliputian stage .
They probably wo n't all pan out , but if nanotubes fulfill just a few of these predictions , they 'll be worth the buzz .
9. X - traordinary X-rays
A new nanotube - based imaging system could take sharper , faster pictures that trump today 's X - rays and CT scans .
Researchers from the University of North Carolina say their device will be especially useful for imaging organs that are perpetually in motion , like the heart and lungs .
In a traditional X - ray machine , a filament emits electrons when it is heated above a certain threshold , and those electrons fly through the body and hit a metal electrode on the other side , creating images ; CT scans produce three - dimensional images by rotating the electron source .
But the new system uses an array of carbon nanotubes that emit hundreds of electrons simultaneously as soon as voltage is applied to them .
The system is faster than a regular X - ray machine because there are no filaments to warm up , and the multiple nanotube emitters can also take pictures from many different angles without moving .
8 . Helping the Hydrogen Car Cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells have been a clean energy dream for years , but they 've been held back largely by the expense of making fuel cells .
The Department of Energy estimates that half of a fuel cell 's price tag comes from the platinum catalyst used to speed up the reaction that produces energy .
But in February a team of researchers found that bundles of carbon nanotubes doped with nitrogen form a more efficient and more compact catalyst .
While carbon nanotubes are currently fairly expensive to produce , researchers note that the price has been plummeting .
Researchers from the University of Dayton , Ohio note that nanotube production costs have fallen 100 - fold since 1990 , while no such price reductions are likely with platinum , a limited natural resource .
7. Diagnosis Via Nanotube Spanish researchers say nanotubes can even help with an embarrassing medical problem , and have created a biosensor that can diagnose yeast infections ( the irritating fungal infections that can take hold on the genitals ) .
The scientists say their gadget provides a quicker diagnosis that today 's typical method , in which a cell sample is taken and cultured in the lab to look for the presence of the Candida albicans fungus .
The researchers built a transistor that contains carbon nanotubes and antibodies programmed to attack the Candida yeast cells .
When a cell sample is put on the biosensor , the interaction between the yeast and the antibodies changes the electric current of the device .
The extremely conductive nanotubes record the change and allow researchers to measure how much yeast is present .
6 . The Smallest Chips in the Land Nanotubes could even spell the end of a building block of our modern world : the silicon - based computer chip .
Several research groups have found ways to " unzip " carbon nanotubes to produce atom - thick ribbons of graphene .
Like silicon , graphene is a semiconductor , but the nano - sized ribbons could be used to pack much more processing power on every computer chip .
Researchers have made graphene ribbons before , but never as easily — previously the ribbons were cut from larger graphene sheets , which offered little control over their size and shape .
In contrast , unzipping nanotubes is a precise process .
One research group first stuck the nanotubes to a polymer film , then used argon gas to etch away a strip from each tube to produce the nanoribbons .
5. Turn It Up !
The next application could make for a noisier world : Chinese researchers have found a way to make flexible , paper - thin loudspeakers out of nanotube sheets .
The scientists say the technology could be used to add an auditory dimension to anything from clothing to magazines — and to prove their point , they put one on a waving flag .
The nanospeakers do n't generate sound like conventional speakers , which make noise by vibrating the surrounding air molecules .
Instead , they harness a phenomenon called the thermoacoustic effect , which is how lightning produces thunder .
When an electric current runs through the nanotube sheets , they heat and expand the air near them , creating sound waves .
4. Taking Lessons from the Gecko Real - world Spidermen could one day scamper up walls thanks to an adhesive made of carbon nanotubes .
The substance mimics the design of gecko feet , which are covered in millions of tiny hairs that each end in a profusion of spatula - shaped tips .
The lizards can defy gravity and walk up sheer surfaces because when those tiny tips are close to a surface , they induce a strong attractive force that operates on the atomic scale , known as the van der Waals force .
The nanotech version of this system is a glue that is ten times stickier than the gecko's feet .
Researchers made arrays of vertically aligned nanotubes that were topped with shorter nanotube bits , like branching treetops .
The adhesive worked on a variety of surfaces , including slick glass and rough sandpaper , but its hold could easily be broken by those who knew the trick .
Just like a gecko lifting its foot away from the wall , researchers pulled the glue pad away at a 90 - degree angle so that only the tips of the branching nanotube bits were touching the surface , and it easily came away .
3. Flexible , Bendable Electronics
Imagine a computer screen that could be bent , folded in half , and even crumpled like a sheet of newspaper , without affecting its function in the slightest .
Researchers at the University of Tokyo took a step in that direction in May when they constructed a display made of organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) paired with a rubbery , nanotube - based conductor .
The organic compounds in an OLED system emit light when an electric current is passed through them , and they need no backlight , making them thinner than traditional displays .
As nanotubes are natural semiconductors , they channel the electricity to the organic compounds .
Researchers can envision enough technological applications to fill a World 's Fair , including everything from food packages with interactive displays to artificial skin for robots and coatings for airplanes that would check the craft for wear and tear .
Low - cost , large - scale fabrication could be around the corner :
The researchers used a cheap industrial printing process to deposit the nanotubes on a rubbery surface .
2. Space Elevator , Going Up Carbon nanotubes are renowned for their superior strength , and in March researchers from the University of Texas manipulated that property to create a material that is simultaneously strong , stretchy , and nearly as light as air .
The researchers made an aerogel ( a low - density solid ) out of nanotubes , and found that in was as strong as steel .
Meanwhile , applying voltage to the material made it stretchier than rubber .
What possible uses could the world find for such a material ?
One idea is to fashion nanotube ropes to act as cables for a space elevator , which could lift astronauts , cargo , or even tourists into orbit .
The 62,000 - mile - long cables would have to be strong and flexible so they would n't break when buffeted by atmospheric storms and space debris , but light enough so they would n't collapse under their own weight .
1. Tumor Blitz
The tiny tubes could even end up as must - haves in cancer hospitals one day .
In a recent study , researchers injected carbon nanotubes into kidney tumors in mice , and then directed a near - infrared laser at the tumors .
The tubes responded to the laser blast by vibrating , which created enough heat to kill surrounding tumor cells .
In the group that received the highest dose of nanotubes followed by a 30 - second laser treatment , the tumors shrank and completely disappeared in 80 percent of the mice .
The procedure did n't appear to damage the animals ’ internal organs , and left only a slight burn on the skin .
But researchers have n't yet proven that nanotubes are safe and non-toxic , and say that much more research must be done before such procedures are ready to be tested in humans .
Fascism was explicitly antidemocratic , antiliberal , and corporatist , and it endorsed violence as a chief means to its ends .
It was " revolutionary " in its fervor , yet sought to defend status quo institutions , particularly business interests .
It was also , obviously , authoritarian .
58 year old Dennis Mahon is a former resident of the Kansas City area , where he was imperial dragon of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan .
He ran for alderman in Northmoor , Mo. , on a platform that included keeping the town white .
He and his twin brother , Daniel , were arrested and charged with mailing a parcel bomb to a Scottsdale diversity office in 2004 .
His attorney , Robert Fagan , says his client is a " ( military ) veteran and a contributing member of society . "
A third man , Robert Joos , was also arrested in connection with the case and the Indiana home of Tom Metzgar , founder of the White Aryan Resistance ( WAR ) , whose website describes him as " converted from minister to Free Thinker , reborn from right - winger to racist .
" All 4 of these misfits could easily have been a chapter in Dave Neiwert 's stunning new book , The Eliminationists -- How Hate Talk Radio Radicalized The American Right .
The book is n't so much about Hate Talk Radio per se as it is about the gradual transformation of mainstream conservatives to full blown fascists and all the steps that lead in that direction .
Recently , over the course of a few days I made a very different kind of journey ; I flew from L.A. to Hong Kong to Bangkok and on to Bali . was my traveling companion .
I looked to Neiwert 's careful definitions , historical examination and brilliant analysis to shine a light on something that has been bothering me all week .
On the surface the casual tweet from Florida Republican , an unabashedly right - wing politician campaigning for the open U.S. Senate seat from that state against heavily favored mainstream conservative Charlie Crist , was just a harmless paen to the right - wing stalwarts at the NRA , part of the coalition he hopes will help him overtake Crist .
I 've been following Rubio in Twitter since he signed up and he'd never used the NRA hash tag before .
And on this tweet he did :
But there was something more to it that has been bothering me .
Many Republicans refer to Rubio as " our Obama , " presumably because he 's young , wrote a book and is from a minority group ; he 's Cuban - American .
The former Speaker of the Florida House brags about his affiliation with the Bush wing of the GOP but his current campaign is reaching out to appeal to Republicans even more extreme and further to the right than that .
He 's gone from someone championing a reduction in property taxes and shrinking the state government to someone apparently advocating violence in Iran .
As I read deeper and deeper intoI kept seeing the specter of Marco Rubio in a conservative movement that has become , in Neiwert 's words , " a precursor to fascism . "
And Neiwert iscareful to warn off his readers from mixing up mainstream conservatives and fascists .
He points out that " right - wing rhetoric -- particularly the eliminationist kind -- is so innately violent , and moreover permissive about the use of violence , that it has the effect of promoting a general environment in which violence is accepted and even glorified . "
Earlier he defined classical fascism in a way that made me wonder if young Mr. Rubio , growing up , at least politically , around so many full - fledged Cuban fascists , might be headed down a path that is anathema to everything most of us value as Americans .
I 'm not saying Rubio is far along the road as , say , Ann Coulter , a full fledged fascist transmitter -- way beyond the pretense of conservatism -- who wrote in the National Review , as a Contributing Editor , that " [ w ] e should invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity .
"
In fact Rubio might not even be as far along as defeated Texas Republican Congressman Steve Stockman , a far right fanatic -- currently a vicious Hate Talk Radio host in Houston -- and militia movement stalwart , who appears to have been involved with the catastrophic bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , although he was never charged as a participant .
Earlier today I talked a little about my visits to Afghanistan in terms of tourism and Obama 's miscalculations there .
Now I want to recall how I marveled at the deeply ingrained Afghan gun culture when I was there in 1969 and again in 1971 .
I had never seen anything like it before -- not even in Texas .
I used to write letters home explaining that you would no sooner expect to see an Afghan man walking along without a gun than you would expect to see an American walking along without his trousers .
I remember often seeing pairs of grizzled old Afghan men walking along holding hands , each clutching an ancient long gun in the other hand .
And 1969 was a relatively peaceful time in Afghanistan 's turbulent history .
Before driving to Afghanistan , I spent a couple months in Iran , primarily in Tabriz , Tehran and Meshed .
Iran is a nation that prides itself -- and rightly so -- as one with a rich cultural heritage and a firm claim to being one of the word 's longest surviving civilizing forces .
The Iranians are as proud of their civilization and the Afghans are proud of their xenophobia and barbarism .
In Iran you never see someone with a gun other than a policeman or a soldier .
Rubio bemoans this and seems to think that if the Iranian demonstrators only had some guns they could have swept the tyrants of Tehran away .
When Bush and Cheney held sway in Washington I used to wonder if maybe the Second Amendment fanatics had a point .
Of course that would lead me to remember that no matter what armaments civilians have -- even in Texas -- the government has more deadly ones .
Certainly if the Iranian demonstrators would have carried guns and shot up the police , the Supreme Leader would have responded with tanks .
Or does Rubio thinks civilians ought to have the right to own tanks as well ?

Forensic Experiments , CGI Technology and Expert Analysis Meticulously Reconstruct Events and Address Persistent Questions Raised by “ 9/11 Truth Movement ”
9/11 : Science and Conspiracy Premieres Monday , August 31 , 2009 , at 9 p.m. ET /PT
WASHINGTON , Aug. 19 / PRNewswire -USNewswire / — America watched in horror as September 11 , 2001 , unfolded before our eyes .
Eight years have passed and no stone has been left unturned in the painstaking process of piecing together what happened that fateful day .
Yet according to a 2006 poll , 33 percent of us still do not accept the U.S. government ’s account .
Were the attacks really the work of al - Qaida terrorists , or is it possible something even more sinister was at work ?
On Monday , August 31 , 2009 , National Geographic Channel ’s 9/11 : Science and Conspiracy conducts a forensic investigation to test tenets of some of the most common conspiracy theories .
Did the Twin Towers really collapse from fires , or did explosives inside cause the buildings to implode ?
Was the Pentagon hit by a missile , and not a commercial airliner ?
And why do so many people believe theories like these ?
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The government ’s official version of events has been consistent : Hijackers commandeered commercial jetliners in a coordinated attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon that killed some 3,000 Americans .
Now we hear from a group of theorists , dubbed the “ 9/11 Truth Movement , ” who believe the official version is inconsistent with reality , and impossible .
Some even go so far as to suggest that the U.S. military plotted a colossal scheme to replace hijacked planes with remotely piloted rogue planes .
And their seeds of doubt have spread widely around the world and across the Internet .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Using high - tech forensic experiments , CGI re-creations , eyewitness footage and in - depth analysis by experts and theorists on all sides of the story , 9/11 : Science and Conspiracy examines the alleged conspiracies and available evidence .
Then we take a fascinating fly - on - the - wall position as the theorists observe the scientific results and debate the conclusions .
Featured interviewees include “ Truthers ” Dr. David Ray Griffin , Dylan Avery , and Richard Gage ; David Aaronovitch , journalist / author ; Matt Taibbi , Rolling Stone journalist ; Patrick Smith , pilot and Salon columnist ; David Baldacci , conspiracy novelist ; and Brent Blanchard , demolition expert ; among others .
9/11 : Science and Conspiracy is produced by Creative Differences Productions for NGC .

“ We ’ve already lost 81 this year , ” Kanas told CNBC .
“ The numbers are climbing every day .
Many of these institutions nobody ’s ever heard of .
They 're smaller companies . ”
( See the accompanying video for the complete interview . )
Failed banks tend to be smaller and private , which exacerbates the problem for small business borrowers , said Kanas , who became CEO of BankUnited when his firm bought the bank and is the former chairman and CEO of North Forkbank .
“ Government money has propped up the very large institutions as a result of the stimulus package , ” he said .
“ There ’s really very little lifeline available for the small institutions that are suffering . ”

This comes at a time when the FDIC has established new rules on bank sales .
Private equity , for instance , would have to hold double the capital of their competitors in order to buy such an institution , said Kanas .
“ This will have somewhat of a chilling effect on our participation , ” he said .
“ As a result of having to keep higher capital levels , we ’ll see lower prices coming from that sector . ”
Of the 81 failed banks this year , two have been successfully acquired by private equity , he said .
Kanas ’ private equity firm bought UnitedBank , the failed Florida - based bank , from the FDIC in May .
Regulators also allowed the sale of IndyMac Bankof California earlier this year .
“ We are seeing more people step up and lobby bids in this situation , ” he said .
“ We ’re seeing more players mostly as a result of being attracted to the sector .
I ’m not so sure that will continue now that the rules have been ratchet it up . ”
Meanwhile , much of the commercial realty problem resides in the regional and small community banks , said Kanas , because larger banks have n’t fueled that sector in the past .
“ The market is expecting about the way we were expecting , ” he said .
“ Unfortunately , we ’re not seeing any evidence of a recovery in the real estate market in the southern Florida market , ” he said .

Yes , the caption contest is stillllll rolling .
Anyone have any suggestions on some stuff I could do to get YOU to join the forum community ?
I 'd like to have some more folks there to chit chat with .
I knew I ’d forget something .
Sure , A Woman Should n’t Be Raped For Wearing a Short Skirt , But If I Leave My Door Unlocked , It ’s Only Reasonable To Expect I Will Be Robbed
I hate hate hate really bad and smug analogies when it comes to rape .
This kind of shit is the equivalent of , “ I ’m not a racist , but … ”
It ’s “ Women should n’t be raped , but … ”
You would n’t have to preface your shit with a disclaimer if what you were about to say did n’t indicate that you do , in fact , believe these very things .
I was ranting about this to the bear the other night , and he said , “ I ’m not a racist , but I really like Coke . ”
Exactly , EXACTLY .
You would never use the “ I ’m not an X , but … ” format of speaking if you were n’t about to actually endorse X . “ I do n’t think women should n’t get raped for wearing short skirts , but goddamn did you see that SpongeBob movie ?
My kids loved it . ”
That entire disclaimer exists to absolve you of any responsibility for actually in fact believing this thing .
“ I ’m not the kind of person that believes X , but I really think that X is true . ”
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING GODDAMMIT
Okay , but it ’s the analogy that bothers me the most .
Women should n’t be raped because they A ) drink B ) go out in public C ) walk down dark alleys D ) have sex E ) wear clothing F ) are pretty G ) whatever , but if they do these things , they should n’t be surprised if they get raped .
The comparison for this is n’t , “ I should n’t be surprised if I get robbed if I leave my door unlocked . ”
The comparison is , “ I should n’t be surprised if I get robbed if I carry a purse or a wallet , or spend money in public , or leave the house wearing anything but a burlap sack ( thus indicating I have money to purchase clothing ) , or have a job , or talk about my job , or reveal my salary to friends , or have a bank account and go to the bank in public .
I mean , let ’s be reasonable , anybody could see me doing any of those things and intuit that I have money , and so naturally they ’re going to try and take my money . ”
That would n’t be unreasonable , would it ?
I mean , that ’s what a robber would look for in a target .
But we do n’t consider people who leave the house with their purses and purchase goods in public stores to be really reckless and stupid and deserving of their eventual robbery , because jesus christ , that ’s just normal stuff that every person in the world does .
But we do think it ’s unreasonable for women to leave the house looking like women , and acting like women in public , and they are really reckless and stupid and deserving of their eventual rape , because jesus christ , they made the choice to do these obviously dangerous things .
It ’s not unreasonable to believe that criminals with criminal goals will target individuals as victims that will yield them the highest rate of success and the lowest possibility of punishment .
And criminals with criminal goals will make those determinations of success based on cultural indicators within the victim ’s appearance and physical location .
But here ’s the crucial difference .
A robber can look at a person who is leaving their job , driving a car , going to the bank , wearing a purse or carrying a wallet , and going to businesses and purchasing goods and reasonably assume that they have money , and if attacked in a successful way , the criminal can acquire that money .
A rapist who is looking to rape a woman can acquire what he wants from any woman .
They all have what he needs to complete his crime .
Having a short skirt or slutty personality does n’t make her vagina any more or less existent on the physical plane .
This is not at all comparable to somebody who may be robbed , whose appearance and behavior actually have something to do with the crime .
Somebody driving a flashy car with expensive clothes and a wad of cash is more likely to be a worthwhile target for a robber than somebody bringing their groceries home on the bus .
A criminal has more to gain by targeting somebody who exhibits more of the quality the criminal wants .
People with money can make their possession of money more apparent .
But outside of attempting to look like men , women can not be more or less female in public .
All a rapist is looking for is a woman .
Any woman can fit this bill .
Maybe they have a particular type of woman they ’d like to rape ; this narrows the field to all women who match the type .
But there is no corollary to the robber and his victim ; all women have what a rapist wants .
No woman has more or less vagina for a rapist to violate .
What some women do have is cultural approval to be raped .
A criminal wants to A ) commit a crime and B ) get away with it .
When we ’re talking about rape , any woman fits the bill for A .
But only women that bystanders believe deserve to be raped fit the bill for B .
When somebody says , “ I do n’t think women should be raped for wearing short skirts , but what do they expect when they do go out like that ? ” what you are actually saying is that if a woman in a short skirt is raped , you will be less likely to hold her rapist culpable .
Which makes a woman in a short skirt really appealing to a rapist .
That ’s something that you did .
That ’s not something the woman in the short skirt did , or something the rapist did .
You made that woman a more comfortable target by making it clear that if she got raped , you would be less upset about it , less willing to see the rapist go to jail , less willing to support the woman .
A woman is not increasing her risk of being raped by wearing a short skirt .
You are increasing her risk of being raped by saying that women who get raped in short skirts should have expected that .
Rapists hear you say that .
By only raping the women that bystanders agree should be raped , a rapist reduces his chance of being caught and , if caught , punished .
And that is why he will pick those women , over and over again , not because there is something more appealingly rapeable about them — they have what any woman has , as far as rape goes — but because he will be less likely to be held culpable for his actions .
“ Women should n’t be raped for doing X , but really what do they expect if they do X , ” really says , “ Rape a woman for doing X and I am not going to be the one who calls the police . ”
And then a woman who does X gets raped and suddenly it ’s , “ She was raped for doing X ! ” instead of “ She was raped because I made it clear I would not punish a rapist who only raped women who did X ! ”
Cause and effect people .
Women do n’t get raped because of things they do or do not do .
They get raped because a rapist wanted to rape a woman , and made a very rational decision to rape a woman you do n’t give a shit about so he would n’t go to jail .
Women get raped because rapists decide to rape them , but rapists choose which women to rape because there are some women you believe deserve to get raped , and a rapist was listening carefully when you said that .
There was a time when Cindy Sheehan could n’t go anywhere without having a microphone and a TV camera stuck in front of her .
As she camped out in front of George W. Bush ’s Crawford ranch , mourning the death of her son Casey in Iraq and calling attention to an unjust , unnecessary , and unwinnable war , the media created in her a symbolic figure whose public agony epitomized a growing backlash against the militarism and unmitigated arrogance of the Bush administration .
It was a powerful image : a lone woman standing up to the most powerful man on earth in memory of her fallen son .
Touting " an exclusive interview with Cindy Sheehan " on Good Morning America , four years ago ABC anchorman Charles Gibson intoned : " Standing her ground .
She lost her son in Iraq , she opposes the war , now she ’s camped out at President Bush ’s ranch and says she wo n’t leave until he meets with her . "
The level of coverage only increased in the coming days and weeks .
As Cindy continued her vigil , Gibson enthused :
" All across the country protests against the war in Iraq , inspired by the mother standing her ground at President Bush ’s ranch . "
Flashing across their television screens , viewers saw the headline “ MOM ON A MISSION : IS ANTIWAR MOVEMENT GROWING ? ” as Gibson averred :
“ This morning a war of words .
All across the country protests against the war in Iraq , inspired by the mother standing her ground at President Bush ’s ranch .
But is anyone in the White House feeling the heat ? ”
That was then .
This is now : in an interview [ .mp3 ] with Chicago ’s WLS radio on Aug. 18 , Gibson was asked whether his network planned to cover Sheehan ’s plans to travel to Martha ’s Vineyard , where she is protesting the escalation of the war in Afghanistan while President Obama is vacationing there .
Gibson ’s answer :
" Enough already . "
It is one thing to decide war protests are n’t newsworthy , that they ’re just the irrelevant emanations of a fringe element radically out of step with the 99 percent of the country that ’s marching happily off to war .
That , however , is very far from being the case .
Back in 2005 , Cindy represented a minority that was on its way to becoming a majority .
Today , she starts off her renewed vigil with over half of the American people agreeing with her that the Afghan war is n’t worth it .
Yet Gibson ’s announced news blackout is being observed well nigh universally : aside from Rush Limbaugh , only the generally conservative Boston Herald , the Martha ’s Vineyard Gazette , a daytime MSNBC news show , and a few blogs bothered noticing Sheehan ’s determination to be " an equal opportunity vacation disruption , " as the Herald writer put it .
The bitterness of conservatives over the obvious double standard is expressed by Limbaugh in terms of the usual partisan rhetoric :
" When she ’s out there revving up people against George W. Bush , it ’s , let ’s cover her 24/7 , let ’s make sure we have our cameras out there outside Bush ’s ranch when she ’s there , whatever she ’s saying , whatever she ’s doing , if she goes down and meets with Hugo Chavez , our cameras will be there .
They could not get enough of her .
Now that she ’s headed to Martha ’s Vineyard , the State - Controlled Media , Charlie Gibson , State - Controlled Anchor , ABC : ‘ Enough already . ’
Cindy , leave it alone , get out , we ’re not interested , we ’re not going to cover you going to Martha ’s Vineyard because our guy is president now and you ’re just a hassle .
You ’re just a problem .
To these people , they never had any true , genuine emotional interest in her .
She was just a pawn .
She was just a woman to be used and then thrown overboard once they ’re through with her and they ’re through with her .
They do n’t want any part of Cindy Sheehan protesting against any war when Obama happens to be president . "
While Cindy is nobody ’s pawn – as she is proving by her actions – the general point Limbaugh is making seems all too true .
So why is n’t he cheering ?
After all , what did this pro-war blowhard have to say about Cindy back when Gibson was breathlessly broadcasting her every utterance ?
Well , he basically said she was a traitor and a fraud , comparing her to Bill Burkett , who provided CBS with phony " evidence " purporting to show Bush ’s failure to show up for National Guard training .
" Her story , " he said , " is nothing more than forged documents . "
Sheehan ’s crusade , he claimed , was all part of a " coordinated " plan by the " far Left , " which he seemed to equate with the Democratic Party .
In the beginning of this year , when a caller asked " where are all the … Cindy Sheehans , the Code Pink Tuscaderos [ sic ] of the Democratic Party " now that Obama is in the White House , Limbaugh replied :
" Well , frankly , that does n’t bother me .
I had enough of Cindy Sheehan to last me a lifetime .
She was always a nonfactor anyway .
I mean , Cindy Sheehan , this is a poor woman who ’s lost her mind , and then that fact was used by the Drive - By Media to further drive her crazy into making everybody and her think that she was relevant , only because she was willing to accept enough money from a California PR film to build and occupy a little shack across the road from Bush ’s house down in Crawford , Texas . "
Aside from the fact that he has no idea whether or not she has the same media handlers – the True Majority group , founded by Ben Cohen of Ben and Jerry ’s Ice Cream , hired Fenton Communications to handle Cindy ’s media relations and thanked her when she ( prematurely ) announced her " retirement " from peace activism – one has to wonder what Rush is complaining about .
Gibson is doing just what the bombastic radio commentator always wanted him to do : ignoring Cindy ’s antiwar protest .
Ca n’t we all just get along ?
On the higher levels of the commentariat , the " Left " and the " Right " are slow - dancing in perfect harmony whenever Obama plays a martial tune .
Now that the Obamaite think - tanks , such as the Center for a New American Security and the Center for American Progress , are holding joint conferences with Rush ’s neocon buddies – Bill Kristol and his Foreign Policy Initiative – hailing Obama ’s Afghan " surge " and proffering advice on how best to go about it , Rush ought to relax .
He and Keith Olbermann can now march together , arm in arm , into the glorious war - torn future , united in steadfastly ignoring the Cindy Sheehans of this world .
We , of course , are not ignoring her passionate protest , including in our news section – but , then again , we do n’t fit into the Left / Right dichotomy that the " mainstream " media is stuck in and has a financial interest in promoting .
With Keith Olbermann capturing the self - described " left - wing " pro-Obama demographic , and Limbaugh / Hannity / O’Reilly going after the anti-Obama crowd , they ’re divvying up the demographic pie , with Fox News settling for the older crowd , and MSNBC going for the younger and more " hip " set .
Here at Antiwar.com it is n’t about demographics or Obama , and it certainly is n’t about the two major parties , both of which now accept the central premise of America ’s wars : that the U.S. has both the right and means to police the world .
In rejecting that onerous principle , we stand outside the bipartisan " consensus " and the whole ersatz Left / Right division of American opinion – whose proponents exhibit a curious unity when it comes to the vital question of foreign policy .
As much as Limbaugh and his right - wing brothers and sisters railed against the " liberal " media for undermining the war effort , they never really questioned the factual basis of the administration ’s case for invading Iraq : that Saddam Hussein possessed " weapons of mass destruction , " that he was on the verge of attacking his neighbors , and that he had proven links to the perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Instead , they reported these claims uncritically – even as they were being debunked right here on this Web site .
The lesson of all this is simple : the " mainstream " media simply can’t be trusted .
That ’s why newspapers are losing circulation at a rapid clip , and television news is fading in importance .
It ’s not the Internet that ’s killing off the sainted mandarins of the " mainstream " – it ’s their role as transmission belts for official propaganda , whether it be from the government or the partisan opposition .
They ’re shills , and everybody knows it .
That ’s why Antiwar.com is more important than ever – and is n’t it ironic that we ’re clinging to life by a very thin thread , just at the moment when we ’re needed the most ?
Oh , well , life is like that , you know .
I never expected it to be easy .
Yet even I have to admit that this fundraising campaign is beginning to scare me : we ’re way behind where we were at this point last time around , to say nothing of last year .
The number of contributors is equivalent , and even shows signs of increasing , but the amounts are smaller by as much as half .
We all are facing some hard economic times .
It just means we ’ll have to extend our fundraising campaign by as much as a week – hopefully not more .
But we ’ll do what we have to do to stay afloat .
If you have n’t given , or even if you have , I want to extend this appeal to all my readers , even the ones who do n’t agree with some ( or much ) of what I have to say in this space .
You may love Obama or you may bitterly oppose him : whatever .
You need to realize , however , that this is n’t about him .
It ’s about maintaining a skeptical approach to the foreign policy currently being conducted by those geniuses in Washington , who think they know all there is to know to bring order to a disorderly world .
It ’s about maintaining a wonderfully complete source of hard news , as well as an outlet for dissenting opinions – often colorfully expressed – in an age of ideological conformity and bland " pragmatism . "
It ’s about maintaining the tradition of independent journalism in a world where " journalists " are bought and sold like the ladies of Amsterdam ’s red - light district and events are viewed through a partisan prism .
Antiwar.com has stood like a rock against the War Party , resisting and opposing the pressure that is brought to bear on any popular media outlet these days , and we ’ve been doing it since 1995 .
Do n’t let this be our final year – which , I ’m sad to say , is a very real possibility .
Please make your tax - deductible contribution today .
Mr Fitzmorris , who saw the accident happen , said : “ He had a malfunction on his main parachute , which he cut away normally , but had some kind of control problem on his reserve which continued to spiral until he hit the hangar roof .
CAIRO | Egyptians are horrified by the brutal slaying of a pregnant Muslim woman stabbed repeatedly inside a German courtroom , calling what they see as a lack of outrage in Germany evidence of racism and anti-Islamic sentiment .
On Monday , thousands of mourners marched behind the coffin of Marwa al - Sherbini , 32 , in her Mediterranean hometown , Alexandria , where her body was buried after being flown back from Germany .
“ There is no god but God , and the Germans are the enemies of God , ” chanted the mourners , while others carried banners condemning racism .
“ We will avenge her killing , ” her brother Tarek el - Sherbini told the Associated Press by telephone from the mosque where prayers were being recited in front of his sister ’s coffin .
“ In the West , they do n’t recognize us .
There is racism . ”
Mrs. al - Sherbini , who was about four months pregnant and wore the Islamic head scarf , was involved in a court case against her neighbor , who was accused of calling her a terrorist , and was set to testify against him when he stabbed her 18 times inside the courtroom in front of her 3 - year - old son .
Her husband , Elwi Ali Okaz , who was in Germany on a research fellowship , came to her aid and was also stabbed by the neighbor and shot in the leg by a security guard who initially mistook him for the attacker , German prosecutors said .
He is now in critical condition in a German hospital , said Mrs. al - Sherbini ’s brother .
“ The guards thought that as long as he was n’t blond , he must be the attacker , so they shot him , ” Mr. al - Sherbini told an Egyptian television station .
The neighbor , who has only been identified as 28 - year - old Alex W. , remains in detention , and prosecutors have opened an investigation on suspicion of murder .
Christian Avenarius , the prosecutor in Dresden , where the incident took place , described the killer as driven by a deep hatred of Muslims .
“ It was very clearly a xenophobic attack of a fanatical lone wolf , ” he said .
He added that the attacker was a Russian of German descent who had immigrated to Germany in 2003 and had expressed his contempt for Muslims at the start of the trial .
At its regular news conference on Monday , German government spokesman Thomas Steg said that if the attack was racist , the government “ naturally condemns this in the strongest terms . ”
The killing has dominated Egyptian media for days but has received comparatively little coverage in German and Western media .

( CNN ) --
If Washington wants health care reform with bipartisan support , experts say consider what former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney accomplished as governor in Democratic Massachusetts .
Mitt Romney says the president must have bipartisanship in order to get quality health care reform .
" You do n't have to have a public option , " Romney said .
" You do n't have to have the government getting into the insurance business to make it work . "
Three years after enacting its own version of reform , Massachusetts now has near - universal coverage .
Taxpayer watchdogs say it 's affordable .
" There is this widespread assumption , that is treated as fact , that it 's breaking the bank in Massachusetts ... it's not breaking the bank at all . " said Michael Widmer of Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation .
And health care experts say it 's popular .
" Seven in 10 people in the state support the program , and no more than one in 10 would repeal it . " said Robert Blendon with the Harvard University School of Public Health .
Unlike Democratic proposals that would give Americans the choice of joining a government - run health care plan , Massachusetts has no public option .
Instead , people in the state are required to buy private insurance , and the poor get subsidies .
The reform created the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority , which is similar to a health insurance exchange .
Nicknamed " Connector , " its purpose , according to the state , is to connect individuals and small businesses statewide to affordable insurance plans .
The program reviews " existing health insurance coverage plans in the marketplace " and gives " certain plans the Connector ' seal of approval . '
Plans offered through the Connector will not be subject to minimum contribution and participation rules , " according to the state government 's Web site .
And under the 2006 legislation , there are several requirements for insurance companies .
According to Brian Rosman of Health Care for All , a nonprofit based in Massachusetts , the requirements include :
Minimum benefits , such as preventive care , mental health care and hospitalization
A ban on gender discrimination
Limits on total out - of - pocket costs
A prohibition on pre-existing conditions as a qualifier for health coverage
No medical underwriting , so insurers can't ask an individual about his or her health status in order to determine coverage
Limits on age restrictions , which means what is charged for an older individual cannot be more than double what is charged the youngest .
Analysts say " Romney care " is basically " Obama care " minus the public option .
Watch more on Romney 's program »
When asked if he 'd support Obama 's health care reform plan if it does n't include a public option , Romney said that it " depends on what 's in the rest of the bill . "
The Massachusetts model , however , does have its problems .
Experts say it does n't control rising health care costs -- something Romney insisted must be tackled on a national level .
Michael Tanner , the director of health and welfare studies at the libertarian Cato Institute , said that the Romney care program plan costs taxpayers a " great deal of money . "
" Originally , the plan was projected to cost $ 1.8 billion this year .
Now it is expected to exceed those estimates by $ 150 million , " he said in 2008 .
" Over the next 10 years , projections suggest that Romney Care will cost about $ 2 billion more than was budgeted . "
He added : " And the cost to Massachusetts taxpayers could be even higher because new federal rules could deprive the state of $ 100 million per year in Medicaid money that the state planned to use to help finance the program . "
At a GOP presidential debate at Reagan Library in June 2008 , Romney defended his program .
" I'm the only one that got the job done .
I got health insurance for all our citizens .
We had 460,000 people without insurance .
We got 300 of them -- 300,000 of them -- signed up for insurance now .
I 'm proud of what we accomplished , " he said at the time .
Meanwhile , Romney says Democrats have only themselves to blame for those rowdy town hall meetings that have sometimes been reduced to shouting matches and even violence .
" I think any time you 're dealing with people 's health care and their ability to choose their doctor , you 're going to find people responding very emotionally , " he said .
As for former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's now debunked claim that reform would lead to so - called " death panels , " Romney said " I 'm not going to tell people what they can and can not talk about . "
Still , Romney does warn the president that bipartisanship is the only road to health care reform .
" I think the right process for the president to pursue on a subject that is so emotional , so important to all Americans , is to go through the lengthy process of working on a bipartisan basis , " he said .
" He promised that . "
Democratic sources said Tuesday that the White House might resort to passing a Democratic - only bill without bipartisan support .
The White House later said Wednesday that the president was hopeful bipartisan talks would continue if Republicans continue to help Democrats devise a comprehensive plan .
Democrats , however , may run into problems .
A Quinnipiac University poll shows the American public is wary of a Democratic - only bill .
When asked if that 's the right approach , 59 percent said they were opposed , while 36 percent said yes .
The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points .
But it 's not all good news for Republicans .
A new NBC News poll shows only 21 percent approve of the Republican Party 's handling of health care , while 62 percent disapprove .
In contrast , 41 percent approve of Obama 's handling of the issue , while 47 percent disapprove .
The NBC News poll was conducted August 15 - 17 , with 805 adults questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
All About Mitt Romney • Health Care Costs
This is the story of one of the great unspoken scandals of our times .
Today , the people across the world who most need life - saving medicine are being prevented from producing it .
Here 's the latest example : factories across the poor world are desperate to start producing their own cheaper Tamiflu to protect their populations – but they are being sternly told not to .
Why ?
So rich drug companies can protect their patents – and profits .
There is an alternative to this sick system , but we are choosing to ignore it .
To understand this tale , we have to start with an apparent mystery .
The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has been correctly warning for months that if swine flu spreads to the poorest parts of the world , it could cull hundreds of thousands of people – or more .
Yet they have also been telling the governments of the poor world not to go ahead and produce as much Tamiflu – the only drug we have to reduce the symptoms , and potentially save lives – as they possibly can .
In the answer to this whodunnit , there lies a much bigger story about how our world works today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Our governments have chosen , over decades , to allow a strange system for developing medicines to build up .
Most of the work carried out by scientists to bring a drug to your local pharmacist – and into your lungs , or stomach , or bowels – is done in government - funded university labs , paid for by your taxes .
Drug companies usually come in late in the process of development , and pay for part of the expensive , but largely uncreative final stages , like buying some of the chemicals and trials that are needed .
In return , then they own the exclusive rights to manufacture and profit from the resulting medicine for years .
Nobody else can make it .
Although it's not the goal of the individuals working within the system , the outcome is often deadly .
The drug companies who owned the patent for Aids drugs went to court to stop the post - Apartheid government of South Africa producing generic copies of it – which are just as effective – for $ 100 a year to save their dying citizens .
They wanted them to pay the full $ 10,000 a year to buy the branded version – or nothing .
In the poor world , the patenting system every day puts medicines beyond the reach of sick people .
This is where the solution to the swine flu mystery comes in .
Ordinary democratic citizens were so disgusted by the attempt to deprive South Africa of life - saving medicine that public pressure won a small concession in the global trading rules .
It was agreed that , in an overwhelming public health emergency , poor countries would be allowed to produce generic drugs .
They are the exact same product , but without the brand name – or the fat patent payments to drug companies in Switzerland or the Cayman Islands .
So under the new rules , the countries of the poor world should be entitled to start making as much generic Tamiflu as they want .
There are companies across India and China who say they are raring to go .
But Roche – the drug company that owns the patent – does n't want the poor world making cheaper copies for themselves .
They want people to buy the branded version , from which they receive profits .
Although not obliged to , they have licensed a handful of companies in the developing world to make the treatment – but they have to pay for license , and they can't possibly meet the demand .
And the WHO seems to be backing Roche – against the rest of us .
They are the ones best qualified to judge what constitutes an overwhelming emergency , justifying a breaching of the patent rules .
And their message is : Do n't use the loophole .
Professor Brook Baker , an expert on drug patenting , says : " Why do they behave like this ?
Because of direct or indirect pressure from the pharmaceutical companies .
It 's shocking . "
What will be the end - result ?
James Love , director of Knowledge Economy International , which campaigns against the current patenting system , says : " Poor countries are not as prepared as they could have been .
If there 's a pandemic , the number of people who die will be much greater than it had to be .
Much greater .
It 's horrible . "
The argument in defence of this system offered by Big Pharma is simple , and sounds reasonable at first : we need to charge large sums for " our " drugs so we can develop more life - saving medicines .
We want to develop as many treatments as we can , and we can only do that if we have revenue .
A lot of the research we back does n't result in a marketable drug , so it 's an expensive process .
But a detailed study by Dr Marcia Angell , the former editor of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine , says that only 14 per cent of their budgets go on developing drugs – usually at the uncreative final part of the drug - trail .
The rest goes on marketing and profits .
And even with that puny 14 per cent , drug companies squander a fortune developing " me-too " drugs – medicines that do exactly the same job as a drug that already exists , but has one molecule different , so they can take out a new patent , and receive another avalanche of profits .
As a result , the US Government Accountability Office says that far from being a font of innovation , the drug market has become " stagnant " .
They spend virtually nothing on the diseases that kill the most human beings , like malaria , because the victims are poor , so there 's hardly any profit to be sucked out .
We all suffer as a result of this patent dysfunction .
The European Union 's competition commissioner , Neelie Kroes , recently concluded that Europeans pay 40 per cent more for their medicines than they should because of this " rotten " system – money that could be saving many lives if it was redirected towards real health care .
Why would we keep this system , if it is so bad ?
The drug companies have spent more than $ 3bn on lobbyists and political " contributions " over the past decade in the US alone .
They have paid politicians to make the system work in their interests .
If you doubt how deeply this influence goes , listen to a Republican congressman , Walter Burton , who admitted of the last big health care legislation passed in the US in 2003 : " The pharmaceutical lobbyists wrote the bill . "
There is a far better way to develop medicines , if only we will take it .
It was first proposed by Joseph Stiglitz , the recent Nobel Prize winner for economics .
He says : " Research needs money , but the current system results in limited funds being spent in the wrong way . "
Stiglitz 's plan is simple .
The governments of the Western world should establish a multi-billion dollar prize fund that will give payments to scientists who develop cures or vaccines for diseases .
The highest prizes would go to cures for diseases that kill millions of people , like malaria .
Once the pay - out is made , the rights to use the treatment will be in the public domain .
Anybody , anywhere in the world , could manufacture the drug and use it to save lives .
The financial incentive in this system for scientists remains exactly the same – but all humanity reaps the benefits , not a tiny private monopoly and those lucky few who can afford to pay their bloated prices .
The irrationalities of the current system – spending a fortune on me - too drugs , and preventing sick people from making the medicines that would save them – would end .
It is n't cheap – it would cost 0.6 per cent of GDP – but in the medium - term it would save us all a fortune because our health care systems would no longer have to pay huge premiums to drug companies .
Meanwhile , the cost of medicine would come crashing down for the poor – and tens of millions would be able to afford it for the first time .
Yet moves to change the current system are blocked by the drug companies and their armies of lobbyists .
That 's why the way we regulate the production of medicines across the world is still designed to serve the interests of the shareholders of the drug companies – not the health of humanity .
The idea of ring - fencing life - saving medical knowledge so a few people can profit from it is one of the great grotesqueries of our age .
We have to tear down this sick system – so the sick can live .
Only then we can globalise the spirit of Jonas Salk , the great scientist who invented the polio vaccine , but refused to patent it , saying simply : " It would be like patenting the sun . "

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
As makers from Tesla to Nissan Motor Co jockey to dominate the next generation electric - powered cars , a fight on which companies will control the lucrative market to fuel them is just getting started .

U.S. President Barack Obama aims to put a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 as part of the new U.S. effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming .
Cars are sexier than gas pumps or charging stations , but as the history of the oil industry shows , fuel is big business .
A million electric cars will need a lot of power and a complex system to make sure the grid is not overwhelmed .
“ Your head starts spinning when you think of what the possibilities and opportunities are but also the complexity , ” said Bill Nicholson , who leads the electric vehicle initiative at Portland General Electric in Oregon .
He does not expect utilities to be big players in setting up charging stations although they will provide the power .
“ There will be some pretty large players in the charging station infrastructure business who will then partner with some pretty large players in the information side of this , the IBMs of the world and others that do nationwide deployment of standardized charging stations , ” he predicted .
Politics are sure to shape the economics of the industry .
The Climate Change bill that has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and is being considered by the Senate requires utilities to draw up plans for charging electric vehicles .
It also sets financial incentives to set up charging stations and subsidies for people buying electric cars .
Many wonder if electric vehicle sales will take off .
Automakers sold only about 160,000 hybrids , or 2.8 percent of total sales , in the U.S. this year through July , according to Autodata .
Plug - in hybrids , which are part of Obama ’s goal of having one million electric cars on the roads by 2015 , may account for 25 percent of auto sales by 2020 , according to separate studies by the Department of Energy and environmental groups .
CHEAP TO RUN
Electric cars can be smooth , quiet and environmentally friendly .
But they must deliver clear operating savings , since their price tag may initially be higher than conventional vehicles .
Nissan roughly sees their operating cost equivalent to $ 1.10 per gallon of gasoline .

Skeptics say charging stations wo n’t be a viable business because drivers will top off batteries at home , except on long trips , and wo n’t want to pay a premium for electricity .
“ We ’ve found that about 90 percent of our customers ’ charging happens at home , ” said JB Straubel , Chief Technology Officer of Tesla Motors , maker of a $ 100,000 - plus electric sports car whose 300 - mile range is triple that of mass market vehicles from other makers due to enter the market late next year .
Proponents counter that charge stations will proliferate once there are a million or more electric cars on the roads .
Most charging will be done at home , but some cars do n’t even have a garage .
“ If you live in San Francisco , 51 percent of all cars are parked curbside at night , ” said Richard Lowenthal , founder and CEO of Coulomb Technologies , which aims to sell about a thousand charging stations this year at $ 2,000 - plus each .
“ I ship a station , I keep $ 1,000 , ” said Lowenthal .
He expects five times as many sales next year .
But he says electric charge stations will offer a lot more than a plug .
Company founders included former executives of Internet equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc , and Coulomb sees services such as finding a free charge spot by cell phone as key to its potential success .
A University of California , Berkeley study says as much as $ 320 billion will be spent on charging infrastructure over the next couple of decades .
The U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded $ 2.4 billion in electric - vehicle related grants .
QUICKER CHARGES
Technology being developed by the industry will cut the time it takes to charge a car battery from hours to between 10 and 45 minutes .
That wo n’t be possible in most homes , but it should make long trips much easier .
“ That ’s kind of a game changer because then you can do fast charging and it ’s competitive with gasoline , ” said Jeff Kim , president of privately held Shorepower Technologies , which already has charging stations at truck stops to run air conditioners on big rigs while drivers sleep .
A big roll - out of charging stations could come in about six months said , Kristen Helsel , director of electric vehicles at AeroVironment Inc .
“ What ’s really important is we go in before the cars , but not a whole lot before the cars , ” she said .
Views about who could own the stations are all over the map .
Equipment makers could deploy stations themselves , parking garage and restaurant owners could buy them for their properties , and larger networks might be set up by independent operators or companies who see charging as part of a bigger business of providing services to electric car owners .
Lowenthal has sold chargers to a McDonald ’s restaurant and his own landlord .
Both hope to attract ‘ green ’ clients , he said .
He ’s also had interest from financiers .
Entrepreneur Ron Percival , of PowerUp Systems Inc. , is buying Shorepower stations and plans a network of ‘ e - Stations ’ in Vancouver , Seattle and Toronto in time for the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics .
If successful he will expand in the Pacific Northwest and Canada .
A big question is whether municipalities and utilities will take on charging .
Better Place , a California company with $ 300 million in funding and plans to build networks from Australia to the San Francisco Bay Area , says cities and power companies wo n’t do more than set up ‘ seed ’ stations .
“ For real adoption you need to have real numbers .
You ca n’t have people driving around looking for a charge spot because it wo n’t work , ” said Sidney Goodman , vice - president of Automotive Alliances at Better Place .
Better Place plans to lease batteries to drivers along with charging facilities .
Motorists will be able to swap spent batteries at its stations and the company will develop a computer network to make the process easier .
The company has not yet raised the money it will need to begin operations in the United States , but it has started investing an expected $ 150 million to $ 200 million into deploying 100,000 charging spots and stations to swap out depleted batteries in its first deployment , Israel .

It ’s been more than three months since I realized one of my most important dreams by coming to the United States .
Still , I never thought that I would come here as a refugee , maybe because my Iraqi dignity and pride simply would n’t accept such an idea .
Under Saddam ’s rule , before the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 , we knew nothing about the other side of the world .
Internet , satellite television , and many other things were banned .
We knew nothing about America beyond that it was the country that kept fighting Iraq and killing its people .
But I suspected there was something wrong with this equation , and I did n’t like what was said everywhere by Saddam ’s officials .
The false news and Saddam ’s propaganda only fed my curiosity about America , but I had few sources to find out more .
One source was my father , who told me that America was the best country on earth–a statement that could have cost him his life had any of Saddam ’s followers heard it .
I still remember how badly he felt when he saw the news on that inauspicious day of September 11 .
During the first days of the American invasion , while I was still living the ecstasy of a new era of “ freedom , ” I thought of America as a liberator .
Everything my dad had told me seemed to be true .
But I still had a lot to learn about this country , especially when I worked as an Army interpreter and as a journalist with The New York Times .
Mudhafar al - Husseini
I first realized that life in America was not as easy and smooth as it appeared in Hollywood movies .
I was thinking that if life were so great in America , then those young soldiers with whom I worked would n’t have had to leave it and risk their lives on the front lines .
I was still confused about real life in America .
I kept asking the soldiers and officers , who came from different states and cities , what they thought ; some liked it and some did n’t .
When I stepped off the airplane in Chicago in my first moments in the U.S. , I quickly discovered more about the reality of this country .
O’Hare airport was so big , but it was clean and there were no signs of disorder despite the hundreds and maybe thousands of passengers .
Flashing back to the Baghdad airport , I recalled about six hours of waiting and searching in order to get to my waiting area for my flight .
The airport is one of the biggest bases for American forces in Iraq .
I now live in Tucson , Arizona , a quiet city and a good place to start over and get a wider view of America .
I am one of many Iraqis who have come to Tucson .
When I talk to fellow Iraqi immigrants , they are also surprised to find such a quiet city in America , but most say that this city is a good fit for them .
There are others who are not satisfied with it , and I think that is because they ’re jobless , which is the same problem in many parts of the U.S. now .
I was astonished by several things I never imagined about life in America .
Life is very serious and practical here , and people do n’t have much time to talk on the street , in markets , or even in public places .
It seems everyone is busy with his or her own business and daily concerns .
Sometimes I feel that it ’s good this way , and other times I hate it because in Baghdad you would never feel alone or neglected .
People in Baghdad would stay up late and forget about their long workday by hanging out with friends or going out .
The day would go until midnight , or even beyond .
Many things have changed since the invasion , and the deterioration of the security situation has kept most Iraqis indoors .
I was also surprised that most Americans know nothing about the reality of the war in Iraq .
I sometimes find it hard to explain , because Iraq is a complicated place .
I think it ’s the history , the civilization , and the old sand of that country that makes it harder than others to be understood .
These aspects were not considered at all before the war .
You have to study Iraqi history well and get to know the culture more before dealing with the people on a long - term basis .
As Iraqis here in Tucson , we talk about Iraqi issues and the war but we do n’t come to a consensus most of the time .
Everyone sees things from his point of view–some are against the invasion and some support of it , some were against Saddam and some were for him .
I prefer not to talk about it , but on many occasions , I find myself the only person who talks and convince the others that Saddam was wrong and the war was also a mistake in some ways for both Iraqis and Americans .
The war is now an irretrievable part of history , but we all have the chance to do something for our present and future .
I always try to conclude my speeches and discussions with this idea .
Talking to my family or friends in Iraq is another burden now , as I am on the other part of the war–the safest part .
It ’s strange sometimes when I hear them describe the situation there .
I get a mixed feeling : Sometimes I feel hopeless or torn apart .
I was there , in the middle of it , but now I ’m just one of the bystanders .
I ’m now in a better place , more secure and safe .
I live an ordinary life that I never had lived before coming to the States .
Every time I talk to my mother on the phone I hear her complain about the same simple things .
Such things are not considered huge issues in many countries because they are simply the basics of life nowadays .
“ We have n’t had water for three days , and there ’s no electricity on our side of the neighborhood because the transformers are old and they change them with older or worse ones every time , ” my mother says .
Thinking about infrastructure in Iraq is really exhausting .
People always say , “ How come America ca n’t fix such simple things ? ”
The situation has made some people think it ’s intentional .
They think the Americans are doing it on purpose now !
I thought that by coming to America I could relax and have fewer worries than in Baghdad .
It turned out that I have the same amount of concerns , but they are different in nature .
I now think about having a stable life by finding a job .
I think about my family and friends living in Iraq , while I live in exile as a refugee .
I have become part of the American mixture that is beaten by the daily blender of life .

By Clare Swinney , Member of Scholars For 9/11 Truth & Justice
I was wrongly diagnosed as delusional by the psychiatric staff of Ward 7 at Northland Base Hospital in Whangarei and held against my will for 11 days in mid-2006 , because I maintained the attacks of 9/11 were orchestrated by criminal elements inside the US Administration .
A definition of delusional : relating to , based on , or affected by delusions .
A delusion : a false belief strongly held in spite of invalidating evidence , especially as a symptom of mental illness .
In light of the definition , one of the most astounding aspects to the ordeal was that when I met with the chief psychiatrist , Dr Carlos Zubaran for two formal mental health assessments , I held Issue 3 of Uncensored , which is shown in the picture above , and asked him to look at information related to the 9/11 attacks .
This magazine contained an article I ’d written entitled : Why Does TVNZ Lie To Us About 9/11 ? , which cited evidence that proved the official fable was a lie – yet reminiscent of the fabled vampires afraid of the light of day , he refused to even cast his eyes over it , during both of the so - called “ assessments . ”
Another astounding aspect to what occurred was that Section 4 of the New Zealand Mental Health
Act makes it clear that no one can be judged to be mentally ill solely on the basis of their political beliefs .
The District Inspector for Mental Health – Northland , barrister Julie Young ; Bridget Westenra , the lawyer she appointed to assist me and the staff of Ward 7 , including the chief psychiatrist , did not appear to know this .
As can be seen , it is written in layman ’s language on page 33 of Chapter 2 of Mental Health ( Compulsory Assessment and Treatment )
Act 1992 , which is on the Ministry of Health ’s own website : ‘ You can not be considered to have a mental disorder just because of your : political , religious or cultural beliefs …’.
As this Judgement shows , because of his reluctance to scrutinize the evidence related to 9/11 and apparent lack of awareness of Section 4 of the Act , nine days into my incarceration , Dr Zubaran still held the belief I suffered from a “ delusional disorder ” because of my political beliefs .
The evidence that shows the official story of 9/11 was indeed a lie is now overwhelming .
We now have what has been referred to as the “ loaded gun ” – this is the unignited nanothermite , a highly - advanced explosive substance , which was far too sophisticated a composite to have originated from a cave in Afghanistan .
Think military .
Think US government .
The following article , which relates to what occurred in Ward 7 , was published in Issue 8 of Uncensored .
Thankfully , since writing about what happened and making numerous phone calls , plus sending many letters , as well as supplying numerous DVDs to the staff of Ward 7 to show them the truth about 9/11 – and then finally threatening to protest outside the hospital , the Clinical Director of Mental Health & Addiction Services in Northland sent an apology in August 2008 , which can be viewed here .
Dr Zubaran did not apologise .
POLITICAL PRISONER
Clare Swinney brought a complaint to the Broadcasting Standards Authority pointing out that TVNZ ’s claim that Osama bin Laden carried out the attacks of 9/11 was an outright lie .
Shortly afterwards , she was threatened and then incarcerated in a psychiatric ward .
Following a week of compulsory treatment , the head psychiatrist told a judge that she should remain in hospital , as her belief that 9/11 was an inside job was evidence she was “ delusional . ”
The judge agreed .
This is her extraordinary story :
On the morning of June the 6th 2006 , two social workers came to the door and advised that they ’d come to take me to the public hospital ’s psychiatric facility , as they ’d heard I might be suicidal .
Although I ventured to enlighten them I was n’t , they did n’t listen as their unit had received a phone call from an ill - informed family member who ’d said I might be on the verge of killing myself .
As it was apparent from their demeanour that my psychological state was a foregone conclusion , I asked if my flatmate , Brian Kennedy could come with us and attest that I was fine and most certainly not suicidal .
I picked up my bag and appropriate evidence for the meeting and walked anxiously to their car , where one of them warned that the two police officers who had driven into the driveway , were there to stop me from running away .
In retrospect , I probably would have done if I ’d known the emotional cost of what lay ahead .
At Whangarei Hospital , Brian and I were transferred into Ward 7 , which is a secure , locked up area , and then herded into a meeting room , where we waited for several nail - biting minutes before the middle - aged psychiatric registrar , Dr Mothafar Abass entered and introduced himself .
In a rather detached fashion , he advised that he would be conducting my suicide risk assessment , and then hurried through it , as if he was pressed for time .
Mindful that this was to determine whether I was to be committed under the Mental Health Act , I found his manner disturbing to say the very least .
He did n’t appear to fully understand me , nor did he give me sufficient time to explain myself to a level appropriate for this kind of evaluation , and in one instance , he even spoke over me in a rush to get to the next question .
For instance , when he inquired if I ’d been treated for depression , I replied I had , but was n’t given an opportunity to explain that it was n’t relevant to this assessment , as it was substance - induced , caused by sniffing a general anaesthetic intermittently when a teenager .
Likewise , when he asked if I had a sense of hopelessness about the future , I replied I did , but had no chance to clarify that it was based in reality , experienced by some of my friends also and related to the political and environmental state of the earth .
It was n’t a core symptom of suicidality in this case , as I could see he assumed it was .
Then came the big issue of my supposedly being suicidal .
As I told Dr Abass , but not in this detail , the story began in May 2006 , following my complaints to TVNZ and the Broadcasting Standards Authority ( BSA ) about a TV1 news item which placed the blame for 9/11 fallaciously on Osama bin Laden , [ 1 ] .
Paradoxically , while the BSA chose to “ decline to determine ” my complaint , they became propagandists themselves by alleging that Osama bin Laden ’s “ involvement [ in 9/11 ] is a widely accepted fact supported by the weight of credible evidence , ” [ 2 ] .
Bin Laden's FBI Page - No Mention of 9/11
As many Uncensored readers now know , there is not a shred of hard evidence to show bin Laden had anything to do with 9/11 , and even Dick Cheney had acknowledged this , [ 3 ] .
Consequently , on May the 6th , two days after the BSA decision was released , I e-mailed their office and asked why the BSA panel had failed to take Cheney ’s pivotal admission regarding bin Laden into account , that “ evidence has never been forthcoming . ”
I further stated , “ Their failure to do so is utterly disgraceful in my opinion , as it is indicative that they are failing in their duty to do proper research prior to arriving at important decisions and therefore making a farce out of their obligation to serve the public . ”
As well as poking a spanner in the works there , I had been distributing 9/11 - truth DVDs to people in the New Zealand media and posting 9/11 - related information on Internet newsgroups .
While I knew I was courting danger , I continued to do so because I believed that doing nothing was ultimately more dangerous .
I received a number of veiled death threats via e-mail between late - May and early - June 2006 , which included , “ You are right about the assassination part , ” and “ I like to pull my guns out and shoot at moving targets , ” while a number of benign messages received during the same period , were accompanied by a photo of a man holding a shot gun .
I believed they were from the Security Intelligence Service , ( SIS ) , who ’d targeted me for a psychological operation – a psyops – because I was a political activist challenging the validity of the government ’s portrayal of 9/11 .
Although I did n’t have the opportunity to tell Dr Abass this , I speculated that as a whole these e-mails were designed to prime me with fear for a subsequent encounter with a man , who looked the part of a cold - war assassin , which took place on June the 1st .
This pallid - skinned , clean - shaven man with dark blond hair , who was dressed in expensive - looking black clothing and was sporting an army - style hair cut , looked completely out of place in mid-town Whangarei .
He made a point of coming uncomfortably close up behind me while I waited at a major intersection in town on June the 1st .
There was no reason for him to have come as close as he did , unless he had wanted to intimidate me , so I stepped several meters to the left , to put a safe distance between us .
When the buzzer signalled that it was time to cross , I walked purposefully slowly and got directly behind him .
When we reached the pavement on the other side of the road , he glanced backwards briefly , his cold grey - blue eyes scanning my face to see if I was watching him , and then he clenched and unclenched his right hand four times .
I carried on walking and saw he ’d stopped on a corner and was watching me , and then when I looked back again a few seconds later , he had gone .
I was absolutely terrified by this , particularly so as I was horribly conscious of the content of the threatening e-mails I had received in the days preceding this .
( A Englishman who has been researching the New World Order , stated he has heard of these kind of tactics being used “ often ” to harass people in “ the anti-war and 9 - 11 Truth Movement . ”
His letter to the hospital can be viewed at the end of this post ) .
Consequently , with my heart thumping wildly , I strode to Police Superintendent Viv Rickard , who happened to be in the town Mall at the time , and told him I believed the SIS was threatening my life because of my work in exposing the truth about 9/11 .
Rickard said he believed me , but said he thought that others on the police force might not , so advised me to deal with him directly about the matter .
Subsequent to the encounter with the man dressed in black , I had a discussion with a family member about hypothetical scenarios and my very real fears , to the point at which I said that if it were between a man with a gun and tablets , I would prefer the latter .
Fortunately however , I received an e-mail on June the 2nd , - I believed it was from the SIS , which intimated that the threats would cease as it appeared I had gotten the message .
Although I tried to get Dr Abass to listen to me about the context my statement was made in , my hopes sunk like a submarine when his body language indicated he ’d stopped listening to me and his resolve to commit me was rapidly gathering momentum .
Brian , recognizing my situation was looking bleak , told Dr Abass that as I was so knowledgeable and active in this area of politics , it was n’t at all surprising I had been threatened .
He also advised that he ’d seen the e-mails containing threats , and he perceived them as intimidating , and said in spite of these , I was n’t suicidal – I was fine .
Nonetheless , to my horror , at my assessment ’s completion , Dr Abass told me I would be held in the secure unit under the Mental Health Act for 5 days for further assessment .
And as if this news was n’t bad enough , he told me I had n’t been threatened , I had misinterpreted the messages and that was because I was suffering from a delusional disorder .
He said he was prescribing antipsychotic medication to combat this problem and as I was depressed , he told me I should go on a course of antidepressants also .
I sat stunned , the reality of my predicament closing over me like a grave .
I was in a prison for the mentally ill , wrongly diagnosed as depressed , delusional and suicidal because of a case of what I believed to be medical incompetence .
I choked down the bile from my anger , approached the door and said : “ OK .
Take me to my room ! ”
It came as no surprise , when I demanded to peruse my file with one of my nurses a few days later , to find it littered with misleading comments – and it was mentioned that Brian was deemed delusional too !
I had been perceived , interpreted , construed and categorized incorrectly .
Dr Abass had given me a score of 14 on a suicide scale for which anything over 12 is regarded as “ risky . ”
As my mother had committed suicide , my score was raised from what would have been 11 to 14 , and as he ’d made inferences based on incomplete information , the full score belied my condition warranted hospitalization .
Contents Of Magazine Article I 'd Written Proved I Was Not " Delusional "
A young nurse escorted me down a foreboding corridor , to a small dowdy room with two single beds , two cupboards and a hand basin in it .
I felt so disempowered ; I lay face down on my bed for over four hours , agonizing that I was vulnerable to misdiagnosis by other staff members because of what I knew as a journalist .
As Aldous Huxley had put it , “ Ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you mad . ”
I found my first day in Ward 7 very troubling to say the least , for a number of reasons .
Nurses came in to check on me and although I had n’t had anything to eat for around 20 hours , ( as I did n’t have the chance to eat my breakfast before being picked up from home ) , I was offered Valium before I was offered food or a cup of tea .
It did n’t seem to concern the staff either that I only had the clothes I was wearing with me .
Consequently , I phoned Brian and got him to bring in some personal effects , fruit , chocolate bars and enough clothing to last for 5 days .
As a polite way of telling the staff to “ piss off and leave me alone , ” shortly after arriving I stuck a notice above my bed : ‘ WHILE MY HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BEING COMPROMISED LIKE THIS , PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT ME TO PARTAKE IN ANY SO - CALLED “ TREATMENT ” .’
Of course , it did n’t work .
At night - time , I was forced to take Risperidone , a mind - altering medication administered to treat schizophrenia .
I ’d read about its dangerous side effects from a website I subscribe to called Mercola.com , so utterly resented being forced to swallow this poison by a zealous nurse who stood over me like a guard in a Soviet camp for political dissidents .
Although I consoled myself with the thought that it would n’t be long before a well - informed psychiatrist who could talk English fluently would realize that I ’d been misdiagnosed , it was n’t to be .
The following day I felt lethargic because of the medication .
It looked as if most of the patients in the ward were up to their eyeballs on it , as they moped around , gazing woodenly , the majority seeming unable to engage in articulate coherent conversation .
As it seemed there was no one to have a conversation with , I had a look around for things to do – there was no garden , only a small grimy area outside for the smokers that was fenced off from the hospital grounds with prison bars .
There was however Ping - Pong , reading Woman ’s Day and New Idea , watching TV and talking to nursing staff , many of whom were empathetic and well - intentioned .
The consultant psychiatrist , Dr Carlos Zubaran , approached me cheerfully that day and said he wished to talk to me .
As I presumed there ’d be no difficulty in correcting my misdiagnoses and as Dr Zubaran had the position of authority , I retrieved my evidence and strutted hopefully into the meeting room , thinking , ‘ At last , he ’ll realize I ’m not mad and I ’ll be released ! ’
However , no sooner had I sat down than it became apparent that the self - assured Brazilian had accepted Dr Abass ’s diagnoses without question and was eager to commence treating my purported cases of delusional disorder and depression .
It was so awful for me at that moment , realizing I was imprisoned , and the head warden was going to play a part in this surreal ordeal .
In a beleaguered manner , as the Risperidone was making me drowsy , I tried to describe my frightening ordeal and show him my e-mails and my article , Why Does TVNZ Lie to Us About 9/11 ?
but he would n’t even spare 10 seconds to lean over and look at them .
He said he did n’t want to hear about them and told me I was “ delusional ” because I believed 9/11 was an inside job .
I could tell it was a waste of time pointing out that I was far from alone in this belief and that a CNN poll conducted in March 2006 had shown that over 82 % supported Charlie Sheen , when he went public with his opinion that the official story of 9/11 was highly questionable to say the very least .
If I had raised these types of matters , Dr Zubaran would have probably said it was further evidence of a delusional disorder .
As if he believed he was in possession of extra-sensory perception , he said , “ I know what ’s wrong with you ” with a glimmering smile , and then to my alarm he began questioning me in the manner one would expect from a card - carrying member of a Freudian Institute for Clinical Practice .
Although I was full of anguish and immense frustration , I think rage is not an exaggeration to describe my mood , I was forced to answer this totally irrelevant track of questioning for several minutes .
“ Did you use a condom with your last partner ? ” “ When was your last sexual encounter ? ” “ Who was your last partner ? ” “ Who initiated the sex ? ” “ How often do you have sex ? ” and “ Have you been questioned before like this about your sex life ? ” he inquired .
When I could no longer stomach wasting time on this nonsense , I briefly tried to draw his attention to the issue of my misdiagnoses and present my evidence , but like Dr Abass , he was n’t interested in engaging me in a reasonable interview .
There was obviously no easy way out of my buttonholing , and I could see imploring for help was n’t going to get me anywhere either , so I ended the session after only five or so minutes by storming out of the comfortless room , miserable and livid with indignation .
In the ensuing days , I made a concerted effort to make the staff realize I was n’t delusional .
I wrote in a note that I had a M.Sc. ( Hons ) and was highly regarded for my research as a journalist .
‘ One can not do this , if one is “ delusional ” ’ , it concluded .
I also recommended that they look on the Internet to verify some of what I was saying , and I provided them with search terms for Google .
Although Dr Abass said he ’d looked at these web pages and claimed to have understood the relevance of the information , to my amazement and mystification , he said he was increasing my dose of Risperidone to find a “ therapeutic dosage . ”
When I protested , saying that I was n’t delusional and I did n’t like the way the medication made me feel , he told me I had to take it and reiterated that he also wanted me to go on antidepressants .
On one occasion I ’d cried at the communal dining table , but this was a normal response to my current circumstances , not evidence of a major depressive illness .
Nonetheless , he was convinced I was depressed , owing to his initial faulty assessment of me and so recommended that I take Aropax .
I refused , telling him I ’d written an article for Investigate about it in 2004 and was aware that numerous studies had found that placebos were often just as effective as antidepressants , and there was significant evidence to demonstrate that Aropax was addictive also .
Following this gut - wrenching meeting , I forlornly walked into the lounge and spoke with a nurse about not wishing to take the Risperidone .
Unsympathetically , she advised that if I refused to take it , I would be injected with it .
An old schizophrenic woman who ’d refused hers because she thought she was pregnant , told me she was given a shot , so with tears in my eyes , I swallowed the larger dose , which did nothing other than make me feel like a zombie and so sluggish , I even struggled to maintain conversations .
I was particularly worried about this latter side effect because I knew I had to be able to communicate fluently to be able to dig myself out of this nightmarish hole and make people realise I was grounded in reality .
Nurses asked me questions to establish my state of mind each day .
Apart from a young one who childishly told me I was “ stupid ” to work in this dangerous area , most listened respectfully and attentively , and to my immense relief , a number told me they did n’t think I was delusional .
I had a lengthy conversation with a nurse on my fourth day , during which she said it was easy to tell who did n’t belong in the Ward and clearly I did n’t .
The psychiatrists got so used to seeing “ daises , ” – when they saw something else , they sometimes could n’t recognize it , she said .
In spite of the growing awareness amongst the nursing staff that I was n’t mentally ill , the doctors opted to extend my stay beyond 5 days .
I ca n’t remember being given a reason why , but I assumed it was because they wished to continue my assessment .
In my second session with Dr Zubaran , which was a week after the first abortive one , he began by telling me he had a Ph.D. in psychopharmacology and that I should consider going on an antidepressant such as Aropax .
He said proudly that he ’d run a double - blind study that had shown how effective antidepressants could be and I should at least give them a go .
I again refused and tried to explain that if he was so concerned about my mental health , he should discharge me immediately as I loathed being in hospital – I found it almost unbearable .
I again beckoned him to look at the threats I ’d received , but instead he sniped curtly , “ They ’re a defence mechanism . ”
I choked with emotion and got up and walked out – again after only a few minutes , absolutely livid with anger , as I could see no end to this trial , which judging by the look on his face , appeared to be nothing more than a minor part of a day ’s work .
When I spoke to one of my nurses about my misdiagnoses and my mounting sense of helplessness , he advised me to apply for a Section 16 hearing and put my case before a judge .
He said it would be an informal meeting , where Dr Zubaran would state his case and I , mine .
He gave me an application form to complete , which I did and he then faxed it to the District Inspector for Mental Health , Julie A . Young , a barrister , who contacted me promptly to advise that she would appoint a lawyer for the hearing , which would be on the following Wednesday , on the 14th of June .
As the days went by I persisted in complaining about the Risperidone , which one night had made me feel so breathless and headachy I ’d felt compelled to ask for a nurse ’s help .
Subsequently , I told the head nurse that I felt better without it and thankfully , she accepted my word and advised that I did n’t have to take it if I did n’t want to , implying that they would turn a blind eye .
From then on , when nurses brought it to me at medication time , and when I refused it , they did n’t threaten to inject me with it .
That was encouraging , so too that the nurse who ’d said I clearly did n’t belong in there , took me on a home visit to collect more proof that I was n’t delusional .
I got items for Dr Zubaran and the hearing , which included more of the e-mails that contained threats and documentaries on DVD which proved 9/11 was an inside job , such as 9/11 : In Plane Site and 9/11 : The Road to Tyranny .
On the day of the hearing I felt reasonably confident good sense would prevail and end Dr Zubaran ’s reign of error .
My father , who is an anaesthetist and knew 9/11 was an inside job , came to give his support , as did one of the nurses and the lawyer , Bridget Westenra , who ’d been appointed by the District Inspector for Mental Health , to help .
There were two psychiatrists present ; Dr Zubaran , and a psychiatric registrar called Dr Vernon Reynolds , who had listened to me and informed my father and I before the meeting had started that he believed I should be discharged immediately .
The hearing was in a small unpretentious room in which the seven of us sat , watched over by an old bearded guard .
The judge , Tim Druce , who was an elderly man who wore a brown suit , began by asking Dr Zubaran what he thought my problems were and if they were serious enough to warrant depriving me of my rights by keeping me in hospital under a compulsory treatment order .
Dr Zubaran set the stage by saying he found my case “ challenging ” and believed my problems justified my being held for 14 days for further assessment .
He told Mr Druce that I had a problem because I ’d had a hysterectomy that caused me to be depressed , I had unsafe sex and I drank too much – and concluded by saying that as I believed the US Administration had perpetrated 9/11 , it was evident I was suffering from a “ delusional disorder . ”
Mr Druce , visibly deferent to Dr Zubaran , nodded his head in apparent agreement .
The fact that I was a journalist and therefore might know something that they did n’t had n’t seemed to have occurred to either of them .
Lamentably , Dr Reynolds , rather than advising the judge he thought I should released , displayed the backbone of a soufflé , presumably unwilling to challenge Dr Zubaran ’s authority .
Instead he wheedled in a flat , pessimistic voice that he was “ ambivalent ” about me being released .
The nurse , however , said she had spoken to me and found me to be rational and in her opinion , I should be discharged .
Then the judge asked for my father ’s opinion , noting he was a doctor and looking duly impressed .
My father , Dr John Swinney said he thought I should be released and went on to boldly divulge that he agreed with my political beliefs .
He said 9/11 was an inside job and he ’d seen the evidence to prove it .
His words rang out like a shot and everyone in the room tensed up .
Mr Druce , looking awkward , grimaced and theatrically exclaimed : “ Oh dear ! , ” and tellingly , did n’t question my father any further .
It was as if his mind was coated with a varnish that waterproofed it from information that might get in the way of the hearing ’s foregone result .
( My father , who decades earlier had aided his brother out of an institution , as he had been wrongly diagnosed as schizophrenic , told me after the hearing that he felt as if he was putting himself “ in danger ” by exposing his political beliefs before the so - called mental health “ experts . ” )
Mr Druce then turned to me and asked me what I thought , although it was apparent from the manner he was eyeing me mistrustfully that he regarded me as too unbalanced to make any rational statements .
As I was anxious to be released , I battled on though and told him I ’d worked as a journalist for over 5 years and had a Master of Science , then pointed out that instead of talking about my political beliefs , what we should be discussing is whether or not I ’m suicidal – which I was n’t .
Doctors Zubaran and Reynolds both acknowledged that they did n’t think I was , and without hesitation .
However , in spite of this and the provision in the Mental Health
Act which states one can not be deemed to have a mental disorder because of one ’s political beliefs , [ 4 ] , Mr Druce , concurring with Dr Zubaran , concluded by saying he thought it best I remain hospitalized , as there was evidence I had a delusional disorder .
I waited for my lawyer to challenge their decision , but she said nothing and instead penned “ delusional ” in her file notes .
( View page 1 of Tim Druce ’s judgement , where he stated Dr Zubaran believed I had a delusional disorder related to my political beliefs , here : http://i480.photobucket.com/albums/rr163/KiwiClare/SCAN0012.jpg).
Following the hearing , a social worker friend , who works in Auckland , phoned me to find out how I was .
I described what had happened and she was aghast , advising that my being held under a compulsory treatment order because of my political beliefs was in contravention of the Mental Health Act .
She also mentioned that she knew of a patient with a number of mental health issues who had also voiced her opinion that 9/11 was an inside job , and she too had been judged negatively as a result .
So I was n’t alone .
To try and crack through this insanity and halt the spectacle of ignorance , I contacted Jon Eisen , the editor of Uncensored and asked him to write a letter to the staff of Ward 7 .
Mr Eisen , whose support and sympathy really helped to cheer me up that night , kindly wrote the following , which I printed several copies of during a brief home visit with a nurse , the next morning - which was day ten of the needless incarceration :
To whom it may concern
I am the editor of UNCENSORED magazine , a quarterly journal published in New Zealand and Australia .
I have known Clare Swinney for about two years , during which time I have had the pleasure of working with her on several important projects .
I can say without hesitation that Clare is one of the best journalists in this country .
Her work is very well known throughout New Zealand , and indeed internationally , as it has appeared in other journals beside UNCENSORED , including INVESTIGATE magazine , where she has broken many important stories .
She is the kind of writer who any editor would be honoured to work with , as she is more than competent : she is thorough and her writing is , to put it mildly , simply brilliant .
There is no doubt that some of her work has come to the attention of people who do not wish her to cover some of the stories she has been writing about .
Specifically I am referring to her most recent work in UNCENSORED which is both controversial and potentially dangerous for her .
I have no doubt that when she says she has been threatened , she has indeed been .
Clare is not by nature paranoid , nor is she delusional .
She was , however , badly frightened , and given the dangerous nature of her work , there is no doubt in my mind that she probably had every right to be frightened .
Journalists all over the world are being murdered for what they know .
To be a journalist is to have one of the most dangerous jobs in the world right now .
In fact , prior to her being hospitalised , I was concerned for her safety myself , as she had copied me with some threatening e-mails that she had received .
I have suggested to Clare that she immediately desist from writing about those subjects that are likely to provoke further threats , and she has agreed to this .
I have spoken with her at length tonight and she seems to be coping very well considering the circumstances .
I would be pleased to travel to Whangarei to meet with her doctors , should that be required .
I urge anyone who is currently in a position of responsibility for Clare ’s safety and wellbeing , to treat her with the respect and dignity she deserves .
Sincerely yours ,
Jonathan Eisen .
As soon as I returned from home , I handed a copy of this to Dr Zubaran and had one placed on my file for my nurses to read .
To my enormous relief , as the day progressed , I could see from the nurses ’ reactions towards me , that this letter was having the desired affect and I felt certain it would n’t be long before I was discharged .
Also that morning , I had a fruitful discussion with Heather Blackburn , the occupational therapist about my Catch - 22 situation with Dr Zubaran .
She said she ’d seen the angry look on my face when I walked out of the meeting room after talking to him , so I explained that he would n’t listen to me and that being stuck in hospital and not being listened to was torturous .
Consequently , she offered to organize a meeting with the Consumer Rights Advocate , Brian Vickers , which I gratefully accepted .
In the morning of the following day , Friday the 16th , Dr Zubaran said he wanted to talk to me .
I advised him about the meeting planned with the Consumer Rights Advocate – he said he knew about it .
He suggested that we talk outside , so we stood on the pavement of Hospital Road , and exchanged words a few meters from the hospital .
Evidently , he still had n’t done any research related to 9/11 and reiterated that I was “ delusional ” because I believed it was an inside job .
“ This is evidence I ’m not delusional , ” I said as I handed him an article I had in my pocket for him about what was then the biggest smoking gun of them all – Building 7 ’s collapse .
Not to be outdone , he ignored the clipping ’s contents and said I should go on antidepressants .
When I yet again replied I would n’t , he said he ’d inject them intramuscularly .
Suspecting he was hoping I would take the opportunity to do a runner before the meeting with the Advocate , and as I was offended by his condescension , I replied , “ You do n’t treat me like a human being , ” and headed back to the hospital cloisters .
We met at the door and it was then , for the first time , that he asked to see the evidence of death threats I had , on this , my eleventh day of compulsory treatment .
At last !
I eagerly gathered my bits of evidence together , and sat down at a table in the dining room with him .
Building 7 of the WTC Collapsing on 9/11
Ironically , he said he was in Manhattan on the day of 9/11 and saw the World Trade Center ( WTC ) buildings fall with his own eyes .
Referring to photos in Uncensored of Building 7 plunging , I advised that engineers and physicists had established that the only way the buildings of the WTC could have fallen at a velocity close to the speed of gravity , as they did , would be if explosives had been used , which showed that the official story was a lie .
I could see clearly he did n’t want to face this , but could n’t elucidate if he was reluctant to do so because his need to cling to the official story was greater than his need for truth , or because he was so certain of his intellectual prowess , his mind had closed up like a steel trap .
A nurse who looked annoyed with Dr Zubaran came to the table and said that there was a consensus amongst my nurses that I should be released , and in their opinion , he was holding me back wrongly .
He acknowledged that he was indeed holding me back , but tried to justify doing so by stating that during the hearing , the judge had agreed with him .
The nurse pointed out that the only reason the judge had agreed with him was because he regarded Dr Zubaran as the person with authority during the hearing .
This nurse then got up and left the table and the Consumer Rights Advocate sat with us .
We talked about the e-mails I ’d received and I pointed out some of the threatening statements , which included , “ I like to pull my guns out and shoot at moving targets , ” “ Decide in your heart of hearts that you are prepared to die to fight for justice if that ’s what it takes – then you do n’t have to be paranoid anymore , ” and “ You are right about the assassination part . ”
I told Dr Zubaran that I surmised that these e-mails had come from the SIS and thankfully , the Advocate advised Dr Zubaran that the SIS did in fact exist .
Their head office is in Wellington and they have branches in Auckland and Christchurch , and as I discovered subsequently from a young woman who answered the phone at the Auckland office , there is someone who attends to “ media issues . ”
Although , Dr Zubaran acknowledged I was n’t suicidal , he persisted in returning to his view that I should remain in hospital because my belief that 9/11 was an inside job was clear evidence of “ a delusional disorder . ”
Fortunately , however , after approximately 15 minutes of a discussion with the Advocate mediating , to my jubilation and relief , he agreed that I could go home that day , in spite of my political beliefs , on the condition that I saw a psychologist , as well as a community nurse at regular intervals .
We shook hands and I gave him DVD copies of Confronting the Evidence , The Oil Factor and 9/11 : The Road to Tyranny , and said I hoped once he ’d watched them , he would apologize to me .
He shook his head and said he did n’t think that that would happen .
For the sake of future patients , I made a complaint to the Clinical Director of Mental Health at Whangarei Hospital and supplied psychiatric staff with new documentaries regarding the rise of fascism and government - sponsored terror , including America : Freedom to Fascism and Terrorstorm .
Not surprisingly , Dr Zubaran failed to issue an apology , although he did succeed in writing in a letter he dated September 11 , 2006 , “ Thanks for offering an alternative look to such a puzzling issue . ”
My case has highlighted quite a number of issues , but perhaps most significantly , how dangerous it is to give psychiatrists the power to detain people on the basis of minimal and / or questionable evidence , without making their duty to abide by the provisions in the Mental Health Act clear to them .
In particular , that people can not be regarded as mentally ill on the grounds of their political beliefs .
Psychiatry was abused by the state in Soviet Russia to incarcerate dissenters – this has shown how easily it can happen in New Zealand , whether it is the result of ignorance or an inordinate unwillingness to face the truth .

• sexual preference ( for example , being gay or straight ) ;
• criminal behaviour ;
• substance abuse ( this includes drug or alcohol abuse ) ;
• intellectual disability . ”

As well as DVDs showing the evidence of 9/11 , in 2008 I provided Northland Base Hospital with letters from 5 friends , including one from respected scientist , Dr Robert Anderson of Tauranga , who wrote that I had never shown any sign of being delusional and that 9/11 was indeed an inside job .
The following was a letter written by an English friend , who has been researching the New World Order for some time :
TO WHOMEVER THIS MAY CONCERN
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I have read the testament of Clare Swinney as to her appalling treatment by a Dr Carlos Zubaran during a period of unlawful detention at a mental health facility .
The scare which began this episode , being followed by a man dressed like a member of the security services and email based death threats , is a story I have heard often from people within the anti-war and 9 - 11 Truth Movement .
Sadly whether you choose to believe it or not , the security services in many nations ( not just the USA ) have a habit of targeting individuals with threats and intimidation and harassment in order to get them to cease their political activities .
Seemingly however , Dr Zubaran thought nothing of this and chose to presume that Clare Swinney was having some form of mental breakdown .
He even cited her quite reasonable beliefs regarding the tragic events of 9-11-2001 as evidence that she was suffering from a “ mental delusion ” .
As you do not reside in a Nazi controlled nation , it is not a proper action by a Doctor , or indeed a judge ( Judge Tim Druce in this case ) to detain a person under the mental health act for their political belief .
You may or may not be aware that there is a very significant global movement which has seen enough evidence to conclude that 9 - 11 was not perpetrated solely ( or even at all ) by 19 Arab hijackers , and that the whole event was staged by persons within the US government and security services , perhaps with aid from Mossad , MI6 and others .
This attack was conducted for the purpose of starting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ( we have proof they were both planned prior to 2001 ) and indeed to enable greater implementation of security laws to allow stricter controls on persons in society .
Yes we do have proof , and the most famous 9 - 11 film – Loose Change – has been watched at least 100 MILLION times online , with dozens of other such documentaries having been watched many millions more times on Youtube and Google .
There are politicians , scientists , structural engineers and many other relavent persons who state quite clearly that the towers of the WTC were demolished by controlled demolition and did not collapse due to plane impacts or fire ( again we have proof ) .
You may or may not choose to believe such , which is irrelevant , what however should be clear to you is that this is not some wild fantastical fringe movement – a survey taken over a year ago found that over 80 % of New Yorkers feel the government is covering up what occurred on 9 - 11 .
I have been lucky to meet Clare online as part of my own research , it is my aim to be an author , and can attest that she is clearly fully competent mentally .
Further , she is a person who bases her viewpoints and online discussion contributions on facts that she can prove .
Clare Swinney is most certainly a fact driven lady and not one who is prone to wild assertions or accusations .
I find her treatment by the Dr and Judge mentioned above to be a disgrace and am dismayed for your nation if this kind of behaviour by trusted members of society is the norm .
She should in my view receive significant compensation as for a doctor to betray his Hippocratic oath in such a way is unforgivable .
Further for a judge to make a mockery of his role as legal trustee is sickening and he should be reprimanded in the strongest possible terms .
Yours sincerely ,
Biggs

Chávez toma control de servicios petroleros
Pie de foto , La expropiación ocurrió poco después de promulgada la ley que le dio potestad al Estado para hacerla .
Venezuela expropió este viernes 60 empresas prestadoras de servicios a la industria petrolera , después de que fuera promulgada una ley que otorga al Estado la potestad de hacerse total o parcialmente de los bienes y servicios conexos a las actividades primarias de hidrocarburos .
En un acto en el muelle " Transportes de Maracaibo " , en el occidental estado Zulia - una de las principales zonas de producción petrolera -- , el presidente de Venezuela , Hugo Chávez , oficializó el traspaso de las compañías .
" No nos hacen falta ( esas 60 empresas ) , ¿para qué ?
El pueblo y los trabajadores podemos y vamos a demostrar cómo ahora vamos a ser más eficientes en el manejo de nuestra industria y de todos los servicios conexos " , señaló .
En la lista de bienes expropiados se cuentan 300 embarcaciones y 39 terminales .
Un total de 8.000 trabajadores pasaron a engrosar la nómina gubernamental .
El mandatario agregó que el Estado se ahorrará unos US $ 700 millones al año al administrar directamente estos servicios , que incluyen transporte de trabajadores , inyección de agua , vapor o gas , entre otros .
" Aquí en esta zona producir un barril de petróleo cuesta casi ocho dólares .
Casi la mitad , el 40 % se iba hacia las contratistas " , indicó , para luego proponer que el dinero ahorrado sea entregado directamente a los consejos comunales , organismos de participación popular promovidos por su gobierno .
" Liberados "
En un discurso caracterizado por condenas al capitalismo y exaltación del socialismo , Chávez aseguró que con la transferencia de las empresas al Estado , éstas pasaban a ser " propiedad del pueblo " .
" Eso se llama socialismo .
Eso nos va a permitir liberarlos a ustedes de la explotación capitalista " , le dijo a un grupo de trabajadores , mientras visitaba algunas de las embarcaciones tomadas .
Por su parte , el ministro de Petróleo , Rafael Ramírez , dijo que el 85 % de las instalaciones y actividades primarias de explotación petroleras están sujetas a expropiación , en el nuevo marco legal .
El alto funcionario indicó que algunas empresas intentaron " evadir la ley llevándose remolcadores y lanchas , pero actuamos efectivamente ( para evitarlo ) con nuestra guarnición militar " .
Por otro lado reiteró que " las contratistas simplemente no cumplían con sus obreros y por eso había tanta conflictividad aquí en la zona del Lago de Maracaibo " .
Ésa es una de las razones que esta semana esgrimió el ministro para explicar el impulso inesperado a la Ley , que fue aprobada el jueves en la Asamblea Nacional .
¿ Socialismo o deuda ?
La toma de los servicios petroleros forma parte de los planes del gobierno nacional de controlar todos los sectores que considera de carácter estratégico para el desarrollo del país , tal como está enunciado en el Proyecto Nacional Simón Bolívar , o " primer plan socialista " de la nación , aprobado en 2007 .
Sin embargo , algunos comentaristas apuntan a que también se trataría de una estrategia para no hacer frente a la deuda del gobierno con los contratistas petroleros , que superaría los US $ 10.000 millones .
" Yo creo que hay de las dos cosas " , le dijo a BBC Mundo el experto petrolero José Guerra .
En cuanto a si los dueños recuperarán su inversión total o parcialmente , el especialista opinó que depende de la nacionalidad de la compañía en cuestión .
" Se dice que les van a pagar con bonos .
Hay que ver qué bonos .
Si es una empresa extranjera , yo creo que le van a pagar .
Si es nacional , a llorar para el valle " , indicó .
Guerra también piensa que hay que esperar para evaluar el efecto de estas expropiaciones en la industria petrolera nacional .
" Creo que va a haber problemas , pero no se van a ver en el corto plazo .
No creo que vayan a despedir a los técnicos , porque no son fáciles de sustituir en el corto plazo " , indicó .
The amounts involved are not nickel - and - dime stuff .
Hurricane Katrina produced something like $ 82 billion in damages in New Orleans , and as the destruction there is remedied , G.D.P. goes up .
Some of the remedial spending on the Gulf Coast does represent a positive change to economic well - being , as old appliances and carpets and cars are replaced by new , presumably improved , ones .
But much of the expense leaves the community no better off ( indeed , sometimes worse off ) than before .

Consider the 50 miles of sponge - like wetlands between New Orleans and the Gulf Coast that once protected the city from storm surges .
When those bayous were lost to development  sliced to death by channels to move oil rigs , mostly  gross domestic product went up , even as these “ improvements ” destroyed the city ’s natural defenses and wiped out crucial spawning ground for the Gulf Coast shrimp fishery .
The bayous were a form of natural capital , and their loss was a cost that never entered into any account  not G.D.P. or anything else .
Wise decisions depend on accurate assessments of the costs and benefits of different courses of action .
If we do n’t count ecosystem services as a benefit in our basic measure of well - being , their loss ca n’t be counted as a cost  and then economic decision - making ca n’t help but lead us to undesirable and perversely un-economic outcomes .
The basic problem is that gross domestic product measures activity , not benefit .
If you kept your checkbook the way G.D.P. measures the national accounts , you ’d record all the money deposited into your account , make entries for every check you write , and then add all the numbers together .
The resulting bottom line might tell you something useful about the total cash flow of your household , but it ’s not going to tell you whether you ’re better off this month than last or , indeed , whether you ’re solvent or going broke .
BECAUSE we use such a flawed measure of economic well - being , it ’s foolish to pursue policies whose primary purpose is to raise it .
Doing so is an instance of the fallacy of misplaced concreteness  mistaking the map for the terrain , or treating an instrument reading as though it were the reality rather than a representation .
When you ’re feeling a little chilly in your living room , you do n’t hold a match to a thermometer and then claim that the room has gotten warmer .
But that ’s what we do when we seek to improve economic well - being by prodding G.D.P .
Several alternatives to gross domestic product have been proposed , and each tackles the central problem of placing a value on goods and services that never had a dollar price .
The alternatives are controversial , because that kind of valuation creates room for subjectivity  for the expression of personal values , of ideology and political belief .
How , after all , do we judge what exactly was the value of the services provided by those bayous in Louisiana ?
Was it $ 82 billion ?
But what about the value of the shrimp fishery that was already lost before the hurricane ?
What about the insurance value of the protection the bayous offered against another $ 82 billion loss ?
What about the security and sense of continuity of life enjoyed by the thousands of people who lived and made their livelihoods in relation to those bayous before they disappeared ?
It ’s admittedly difficult to set a dollar price on such things  but this is no reason to set that price at zero , as gross domestic product currently does .

Quotations
In Indiana , and in many other parts of the NBA - watching world , it 's the giant white elephant in the middle of the room .
Is Pacers president Larry Bird specifically trying to build a team dominated by white players ?
It 's an uncomfortable question to ask in these politically correct days , but how do you ignore a roster that includes Mike Dunleavy , Troy Murphy , Josh McRoberts , Travis Diener , Jeff Foster and now , first - round pick Tyler Hansbrough ?
In a league where little more than 10 % of the players are white Americans , the Pacers ' roster is racially split down the middle , making them one of the whitest teams in the league .
" I do n't see race at all , " Bird said recently .
" I know a lot of it comes out of The Brawl — people think Indiana has to get all white guys — but I do n't buy any of that .
I played in Boston where it did n't matter who came in or who left , it was who helped us win .
( Late Celtics coach and architect ) Red ( Auerbach ) never saw color .
And I do n't either .
I just pick them .
It we had n't taken Tyler Hansbrough , it would have been Ty Lawson .
And if I could have gotten another pick ( later in the first round ) , I would have taken Sam Young or Wayne Ellington . "
There is the perception , fueled in part by local and national sports talk shows , that because the Pacers imploded after The Brawl and had several other off - court embarrassments that involved African - American players , now they 're overcompensating by stocking the roster with white players who may be perceived to be choir boys .
This overlooks the fact that since Bird got involved in the draft process , eight of the 10 Pacers draftees have been African - American .
Feel free to question Bird 's judgment as a basketball executive , and there 's plenty to question ( see the empty 2006 draft of Shawne Williams and James White ) .
But do n't question the motivation behind his choices .
If anybody understands that race does n't matter , it 's Bird .
In some ways , the Pacers ' president is still held hostage by comments he made to Jim Gray in a 2004 ESPN roundtable discussion .
Asked if the NBA would benefit from having more white stars ( specifically white American stars ) , Bird answered : " Well , I think so .
I think so .
You know when I played you had me and Kevin ( McHale ) and some others throughout the league .
I think it 's good for a fan base because as we all know the majority of the fans are white America .
And if you just had a couple of white guys in there , you might get them a little excited … "
How is that different than saying Major League Baseball needs more African - American stars ?
Or that the NBA needed a Chinese - born star to open up that huge market ?
Bird also caught heat for saying that as a player , he was insulted whenever a white player tried to guard him .
He still feels that way .
Whatever you think of the statement , does that sound like a guy who thinks so highly of white players , he would go out of his way to trade for , sign and draft them ?
Think about it .
" I say what I say and however people take it , they take it , " he said .
Then he paused .
" People are still trying to figure out how a kid from French Lick , Ind. , made it to the NBA and played his ( butt ) off and won , and took no ( bleep ) off anybody .
There are always people out there . "
At one point in our conversation , I tossed out the supposition that Hansbrough , whose selection was partially jeered on draft night in Indianapolis , is the victim of racial profiling .
Bird did n't bite , but here 's my theory :
When a white player is drafted ( particularly a white American ) , we immediately think of the many famous white busts throughout history .
I 'll admit it :
When I heard Hansbrough 's name , I had a Rick Robey flashback .
It could have been Scott Haskin .
Or Adam Morrison or J.J. Redick .
The truth is , if we had looked at Hansbrough 's résumé without seeing his picture , we'd have slotted him as a sure - fire top 10 pick .
When Bird looks at his No. 13 selection , he sees a player in the mold of former Boston great Dave Cowens .
" All these idiots out there , just wait until ( Hansbrough ) starts playing , " Bird said .
" Then they 'll say , ' Oh , I see that now . '
Just wait . "
In the end it 's not about black and white , but the bottom line is printed in black and white .
Wins and losses .
And nothing else matters .

One of my colleagues , a higher - up at the station , told me : " The weekends will be better for you , anyway , Charles .
You and Keith [ my partner ] want to have kids .
It 's a lot less high - profile there . "
It was a suggestion that never would have been made to one of my straight colleagues , male or female .
The only thing I could take from it was that my profile as a gay man , especially if I were to have kids and , God forbid , get married , would render me less promotable and less advertiser - friendly .
In fact , over the previous five months , I 'd been told , " Do n't get married , Charles .
We do n't need that . "
I 'd also been told not to have children .
In essence : " You 're the main anchor and you 're gay , but let 's not push it . "

On his radio show today , Glenn Beck argued that democracy does not work because voters have the ability to directly elect the president .
Beck said , “ This direct vote just put Barack Obama into office .
Congratulations on that direct vote . ”
The problem is that the United States does not directly elect the president , and the system is n’t a direct democracy .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Beck said , Direct - issue voting is a democracy .
Democracies have never , ever stood .
They — our Founders did an awful lot of work and an awful lot of study of different systems .
Democracy does not work .
You need a republic .
You ca n’t have direct voting . ”
( If he is discussing direct democracy that is correct , but not democracy itself , as there are many forms ) .
Advertisements
He then continued to mix up his terms , “ We have the government that quite , frankly , we deserve .
We have the government that — we have direct vote .
Here it is :
This direct vote just put Barack Obama into office .
Congratulations on that direct vote .
The last direct vote put George W. Bush in office , and the one before that put Bill Clinton in office . ”
( Has Glenn never heard of the Electoral College ?
Was he asleep or drunk in 2000 ) ?
Beck started to make a good point later , but he went off the rails , “ That ’s not what this is .
We take our elections as seriously as we take American Idol , and that ’s a slam , I know , on how seriously we take American Idol .
I think we take American Idol perhaps a little more seriously as a people , but once we said in our own lives , “ You know what ?
It really does n’t matter . ”
I mean , you can be a good guy at work and a bad guy at home , or a good guy at home and a bad guy at work .
Well , as soon as we accepted that in our own lives , we started to accept that from our leaders and that ’s when we became unhinged .
We have the directly elected representative government that we deserve . ”
I agree with Beck that there is something wrong in this country when we take more seriously than a presidential election , but did he forget about 2008 ?
That election was taken very seriously .
People were paying attention and they went to the polls and voted .
The problem is that it took something as dire as the Bush years and an economic collapse to get their attention .
Let ’s break out a little Civics 101 here .
The United States is not a direct democracy , some states have a version of direct democracy when voters can directly vote up or down on ballot measures , but presidents and not directly elected .
It is an indirect election where voters are voting for a slate of Electoral College electors , and state laws determine how the electors are allocated .
This is basic stuff that kids learn and elementary school , and Beck is completely clueless .
How any person can take a man seriously who does n’t know how his own country elects a president is beyond me .
Beck is always evoking the Founding Fathers , but I think he needs to go back and closely read their work , because he obviously does n’t get it .
In the wake of the death of Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mahsud in Wednesday , the Pakistani newspaper Dawn writes that a power struggle broke out between two other Mahsud leaders :
‘ According to sources , commanders Hakeemullah Mehsud and Waliur Rehman , the two leading contenders for the chief slot , exchanged hot words at the shura meeting in Sara Rogha over the choosing of a successor to Baitullah .
A shootout followed , leading to the death of Hakeemullah while causing life - threatening injuries to Waliur Rehman .
However , a government official in Peshawar said that both Hakeemullah and Waliur Rehman had been killed in the clash .
The names of Hakeemullah , Waliur Rehman and 50 - year - old Azmatullah Mehsud were shortlisted at a meeting of senior Taliban leaders from the Mehsud tribe , but a decision was put off following differences over who would succeed the slain leader . ’
Facebook shares its users ' personal information with developers who create games and quizzes in a way that breaches Canadian privacy law , the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has found .
The popular social networking site , which is used by 12 million Canadians and 200 million people worldwide , also keeps personal information indefinitely after users deactivate their accounts , contrary to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
Act , says the report released Thursday by assistant privacy commissioner Elizabeth Denham .
The office 's main concern was that users could not always give " meaningful consent " to the use of their personal information due to a lack of transparency on the site .
" We found that , although Facebook provides information about privacy issues , it is often confusing or incomplete , " Denham said at a news conference .
Users should be able to opt out of actions that could lead them to lose control over their personal information , she added .
In some cases , that information could then be used for marketing purposes or even identity theft .
Facebook declined interview requests
Thursday , but issued a statement saying it is about to introduce new privacy features that it believes " will keep the site at the forefront of user privacy and address any remaining concerns the commission may have . "
It added that in the meantime , it will continue to work with the commissioner 's office and to raise awareness about its privacy controls .
4 areas of concern
The Office of the Privacy Commissioner 's report found that Facebook continues to breach PIPEDA in four ways and it made recommendations to correct the problem .
It found :
Facebook does n't have enough safeguards to prevent 950,000 third - party developers around the world from getting unauthorized access to users ' personal information , nor does it ensure users have given " meaningful consent " to allow their personal information to be disclosed to the developers .
Recommendation : Developers should only get the information needed to run the application .
Users would have to specifically consent to the release of that information after being told why it is needed .
Information about anyone other than the user would not be disclosed .
Facebook keeps information from accounts deactivated by users indefinitely .
Recommendation : Facebook should have a policy to delete the information after a reasonable length of time , and users should be informed of the policy .
Facebook keeps the profiles of deceased users for " memorial purposes " but does not make this clear .
Recommendation : Information about use for memorial purposes should be in Facebook 's privacy policy .
Facebook allows users to provide personal information about non-users without their consent .
For example , it allows them to tag photos and videos of non-users with their names , and provide Facebook with their email addresses to invite them to join the site .
It keeps the addresses indefinitely .
Recommendation : Facebook should only keep non-users ’ email addresses for a reasonable , specific length of time and should make its users aware that they need to seek consent of non-users before posting information about them .
Users ' responsibilities
Denham and privacy commissioner Jennifer Stoddart emphasized , however , that they are n't telling people to stay away from social networking sites .
" We all understand that social networking sites can be a wonderful way to connect , " Stoddart said at the news conference .
She added that not everyone sees privacy in the same way , and some people may be more willing to share personal information more widely than others .
Denham added that users also need to take responsibility by reading privacy policies and using the information to make their own choices .
The investigation was launched by the privacy commissioner 's office in response to a complaint from the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic , which is based at the University of Ottawa .
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
Act PIPEDA specifies how private sector organizations may collect , use or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities .
Under the act , under most circumstances : Personal information must be collected for a specific purpose and cannot be used for other purposes .
The information cannot be collected unless the person that the information belongs to has been informed and has provided consent .
The information can only be kept for a specified amount of time , and must be destroyed when it is no longer needed to fulfil its original purpose .
Jordan Plener , a law student who initiated the complaint on behalf of CIPPIC , said he had a number of concerns about areas such as Facebook 's default privacy settings and the personal information available to developers .
" For a hangman application , for example , there is no use for the developer to know where the person lives or have their personal email address . "
The complaint cited allegations on 12 topics .
Denham deemed allegations about four topics unfounded .
Facebook accepted Denham 's recommendations and resolved problems in four other areas .
Plener said that was a good start .
But he noted that so far , Facebook has refused to accept Denham 's other recommendations .
With respect to the four remaining topics , the assistant privacy commissioner has asked Facebook to reconsider its recommendations to resolve the problems and said she will follow up in 30 days .
If Facebook does not comply at that point , the privacy commissioner 's office can have its recommendations enforced by the Federal Court .
Denham noted that the company has been co-operative throughout the investigation , and she is hopeful that it will comply .
Recent debate over " health care " ( oh , how I hate that term ) presumes to pit advocates of 100 % government management of medical services against advocates of the status quo…which is only about 95 % government - managed .
Some political cretin ( this term is from the DRD , the Department of Redundancy Department ) explains that , because current government management of hospitals compels treatment of indigent patients with the full spectrum of available , expensive procedures , resulting in innocent taxpayers getting stuck with the bill , the fix is to …what ?
Force all people to pay the government for insurance ?
The underlying premise is that if there ’s any way that one man can unilaterally thrust an unasked for burden on another , a trespass if you will , then the only remedy is to treat us all like interchangeable worker bees in the hive .
The problem with this is that it is government intervention causing the trespass in the first place .
Without government intervention , a business providing medical services at a profit would not treat someone who had no ability or intention to pay for those services .
The indigent person could not burden his neighbors because he could not compel them to pay for his use of goods and services in the market .
Before collectivists scream " heartless conservative " at me , they are free to join like - minded friends and establish free or reduced - price " bare bones " clinics for people who are truly down on their luck .
No , such collectivists are not happy to be charitable by themselves .
Afraid others might " game " them , they insist that their standards for compassion be exported to all their neighbors at the point of a government gun .
" Pay your u2018 charity ’ to the IRS or we ’ll put you in jail , take your bank account , and if you resist , we might shoot you . "
Now that ’s compassion we can all learn to love .
Instead of the senator ’s fallacious false dilemma , why not try different a path that lacks the threats , the force , the extortion … one that actually treats people like people ?
First , get the government ’s " do this or we ’ll ruin your life " coercion out of medical care .
Let all hospitals be owned by people expecting to sell their services at break even or better ( even charities ca n’t hemorrhage money indefinitely ) .
If a medical business wishes to provide some basic care for people who ca n’t or wo n’t pay , that ’s a choice the owners of that business have to make for themselves .
It ’s their wealth ( capital ) at risk .
Privately funded charities could open as many clinics as they want .
Cut taxes and once people are no longer ripped off to the same extent by the IRS , natural compassion will fuel an explosion of true charity … you know , the old , traditional , voluntary kind .
Next , separate the government from the insurance industry and all forms of payment for medical services .
Sure , some people would still choose to under -insure .
By doing so , they would risk the need for care that they could not afford , and they ’d then have to rely on charity , if available .
The one thing they would not be able to do is use the 800 - lb gorilla called government to force others to pay for their care .
They would n’t be able to demand the most expensive care as their " right , " that ’s for sure .
And those " frequent fliers " who kept trying to suck at the teat of people ’s honest charity would be identified and left to suffer for their con artistry .
A voluntary system would evolve where people are free to commit as much of their wealth as they wish to insure against unforeseen risks in health ( just like every other aspect of their lives ) .
That ’s the responsibility that comes with freedom , not the insect - like sameness being crammed down our throats by the political con game .
We would have true voluntary charity instead of this extortionate " I gave at the office when they robbed my pay for tax withholding and FICA . "
We would have poor people still getting some care , but not suing those who donated to their well - being in good faith .
We would exit a world where government managers tear down natural fences and invite people to trespass on our hard - earned wealth by promising those trespassers unlimited access to things we have to pay for .
Best of all , we should expect an entrepreneurial explosion in higher quality and lower cost as human ingenuity mixed with self - interest in an environment of voluntary interaction yield for medical care what they have for the production of personal computers , where we get better and better machines for lower and lower prices each year , and even poor people can afford a PC that outperforms the most expensive machines of a couple years ago .
Do I expect these proposals to carry the day any time soon ?
No .
Politicians know the magic word for shallow - thinking people : " Free . "

Red state GOP Congressmen returning home for the August recess will find two epidemics sweeping their districts , crises they seem intent on ignoring .
The first is the plague that is the " birther movement , " the apparently contagious delusion primarily afflicting Southern Republicans that President Obama was not born in the United States .
The second is dismal health care .
As it turns out , health care performance is worst in precisely those reddest of states which voted for George W. Bush and John McCain .
While even Karl Rove ridiculed the latest bogus Kenyan birth certificate as " likely a forgery , " his red state acolytes remain unconvinced .
In a jaw - dropping DailyKos / Research 2000 poll released last week , a stunning 58 % of Republicans did not believe ( 28 % ) or were unsure ( 30 % ) that President Barack Obama was in fact born in the United States .
And to be sure , this is a uniquely Southern pathology , a region home to 69 % of all birthers and not coincidentally the only part of the country to increase its Republican presidential vote in 2008 .
But this disturbing denial of the indisputable truth of Obama 's U.S. citizenship is far from the only sign of trouble in red state America .
There , the health care systems are in critical condition .
A 2007 Commonwealth Fund report , " Aiming Higher : Results from a State Scorecard on Health System Performance , " examined states ' performance across 32 indicators of health care access , quality , outcomes and hospital use .
Topping the list in the chart above were Hawaii , Iowa , New Hampshire , Vermont and Maine .
Bringing up the rear were the Bush bastions of Kentucky , Louisiana , Nevada , Arkansas , Texas , Mississippi and Oklahoma .
The 10 worst performing states were all solidly Republican in 2004 .
( 8 voted for McCain in 2008 . )
The extremes in health care performance are startling .
For example , 30 % of adults and 20 % of children in Texas lacked health insurance , compared to 11 % in Minnesota and 5 % in Vermont , respectively .
Premature death rates from preventable conditions were almost double ( 141.7 per 100,000 people ) in Tennessee , Arkansas , Louisiana and Mississippi compared to the top performing states ( 74.1 per 100,000 ) .
Adults over 50 receiving preventative care topped 50 % in Minnesota compared to only 33 % in Idaho .
Childhood immunizations reached 94 % in Massachusetts , compared to just 75 % in the bottom five states .
As the report details , federal and state policies such as insurance requirements and Medicaid incentives clearly impact health care outcomes .
In May , the Washington Post rightly noted it would be blue state residents funding health care reform for their red state brethren in an article titled , " A Red State Booster Shot . "
( The grandstanding of Sarah Palin , Bobby Jindal et al notwithstanding , the same one - way flow of taxpayer dollars from Washington to red states , of course , is a permanent feature of federal spending in general . )
And yet a 2008 survey predictably showed 68 % of Republicans believe the U.S. has the best health system in the world , compared to only three in 10 Democrats .
For his part , Senator James Inhofe , whose home state of Oklahoma ranked dead last in the Commonwealth Fund scorecard , boasted his party would " stall " President Obama 's health care initiative to ensure a " huge gain " in the 2010 election .
Meanwhile , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell claims that Americans do n't want health care reform that " denies , delays , or rations health care . "
Of course , de facto rationing is precisely what their constituents face today .
But first things first : let 's see that birth certificate .
UPDATE : In the New York Times , Bill Kristol 's shoe - filler Ross Douthat argues that Texas should serve as an economic model for the nation .
While Ezra Klein demolishes that claim in the Washington Post , other data on working conditions , education performance and other social indicators suggest that things are generally worst in the reddest of the red states .
Let 's be clear : Britain needs wind turbines .
Lots of them .
But just about the worst place to erect them is on top of peat bogs , which are huge stores of carbon that can easily leak carbon dioxide into the air when damaged by the inevitable roads or drains .
So there are serious questions about the green credentials of plans to build Europe 's largest onshore wind farm on 187 square kilometres of thick peat on the Shetland Islands .
The fate of the £ 800 m project will be decided by the Scottish government in the coming weeks .
More than half of the wind turbines in Scotland are on highland peat .
This is not sensible .
Scottish peat bogs hold three - quarters of all the carbon in British ecosystems – equivalent to around a century of emissions from fossil fuel burning .
Apart from water , peat bogs are largely composed of huge volumes of saturated , undecayed plants .
A single hectare typically contains more than 5000 tonnes of carbon , ten times more than a typical hectare of forest .
But any disturbance leads to lower water levels and to the peat drying , oxidising and releasing its carbon , says biochemist Mike Hall of the Cumbria Wildlife Trust .
The bog can decompose for hundreds of metres round every turbine , potentially releasing millions of tonnes of carbon .
The process is slow , but frequently unstoppable , Hall says .
So many wind farms may eventually emit more carbon than an equivalent coal - fired power station .
Is that the case on the Shetlands project , which will have 150 giant turbines and 118 kilometres of roads , most of them on deep bog ?
The promoters , Viking Energy , say the " payback time " for the turbines – that is , the time they will have to run before they recoup the carbon emissions from peat loss – could be as little as 2.3 years , or as much as 14.9 years .
The higher figure is three - fifths of the assumed 25 - year lifetime of the wind farm .
But dig deeper and even this high figure seems little better than guesswork .
An appendix in the project 's environmental statement shows that just 10 out of 69 criteria are responsible for the difference between the best and worst - case scenarios of carbon loss .
The criteria cover things such as how much peat would be drained , and how much the water table would fall as a result .
But , worryingly , none of those 10 criteria were backed up by site data .
The input figures for each were " assumed values " .
Moreover , some critical input data that did not vary between the best and worst cases also seemed somewhat arbitrary .
Thus the time required for the bog to stop leaking carbon after the closure of the site and the blocking of drains was set at 10 years .
Why ten years ?
This is described as a " default value " .
Not reassuring .
One of the big risks for any construction on peat bogs is that the disrupted drainage will cause whole hillsides of waterlogged or dried out peat to slide and eventually oxidise .
Such a peat slide happened at a wind farm at Derrybrien in Ireland in 2003 , probably cancelling out all the benefits of building the wind farm .
Peat slides are a regular feature of the Shetland bogs .
An independent technical assessment for the company raised serious issues , finding 54 problem areas .
But that has n't stopped Viking 's environmental statement from stating that the risk of a slide , even in a worst - case scenario , is zero .
It blandly states : " It has been assumed that measures have been taken to may [ sic ] limit damage so that C losses due to peat landslide can be assumed to be negligible . "
I asked David Thomson , the project officer for Viking Energy , about the veracity of these payback calculations .
He said : " It 's not perfect , but as a developer we submit a defendable ranged estimate using an accepted methodology and then it is for others to judge ...
Ultimately it is a model .
It has calculations .
The quality of the answer is entirely subject to the initial inputs . "
I appreciate that candour .
But , much as we need more wind turbines to harness one of our most valuable natural resources , I think we deserve better information than that before deciding where to put them .
When erecting wind turbines on the nation 's largest carbon store , we need estimates of the likely carbon loss that are more than simply " defendable " , and are not " entirely subject " to " assumed values " .
As the RSPB 's Lloyd Austin put it last month : " There is no point in building renewable [ energy projects ] that potentially emit more carbon than they save . "
I just watched an advance screening of The Cove in South Beach .
The only reason I was there was because it was free .
I had n’t heard of the investigative journalism film before , nor had I heard of the subject matter .
Now I ’ve been exposed , and I ’ll never be the same .
Dolphins , precious descendants of my beloved Flipper , are being killed like sardines between September and March in Taiji Cove .
Some call it Kill Cove .
Ruthless Japanese fishermen with zero foresight and serious cigarette problems bleed these cetaceans to death , and it has nothing to do with their culture , their tradition .
Meanwhile , Mr Joji Morishita , the Japanese Commissioner at the IWC [ International Whaling Commission ] , plays the quintessential villain with his effete hair , stylish eye glasses , and a litany of lame excuses that fail to justify the actions of his murderous fishermen .
Mammals are being slaughtered here , not fish but mammals just like you and me with high intelligence and an acute sense of self - awareness .
There is nothing humane about the way Taiji goes about this blood bath either .
These fishermen are unadulterated brutes concerned only with killing , smoking , and mocking the world for letting them get away with it .
They are barbarians , shameless and ignorant barbarians .
And the worst part about it : the dolphin meat – every ounce the Japanese fisheries sell in their dirty commodities market – is contaminated with mercury .
You heard me right : the meat they bloody the Taiji cove with six months out of every year is downright poisonous , and they feed it to their fellow countrymen for profit !
Like I said before , nothing to do with their culture or tradition .
Just their rapacity .
O how greed warps the mentality of the feeble - minded .
Of the dolphins that are spared , they are sold for as much as $ 150,000 and made into theme - park attractions .
In captivity , many perish from excessive stress and improper filtration .
Do not visit Sea World and everything related to Sea World .
Do not take a vacation to places where dolphins and whales are held in tanks and jump through hula hoops .
Spend your lucre elsewhere .
Maybe swimming with the dolphins in the wild ?
But The Cove is n’t about boycotting Sea World and everything related to Sea World .
I ’m getting off - topic .
The Cove is about ending the massacre that happens regularly in Kill Cove , a quaint place on the coast of Taiji operated by a faction of dolts that is quite small and insular .
The film aims to bring peace to Kill Cove .
To stop this barbaric war and save 23,000 dolphins each year .
If we ca n’t fix this problem that ’s already identified and contained to Taiji Cove , how can we expect to fix anything ?
There , I said it , and I ’m still alive .
In fact , I think I ’m more alive for having said it .
Learn more .
Spread the word .
Get involved .
Save the dolphins .

Great Van Susteren last night on Fox News ran a segment exploring whether or not illegal immigrants were going to be dragged into the health - care debate by conservatives eager to find anything to latch onto to drag the legislation down .
Most notably , Sen. Jon Kyl has been giving them aid and comfort :
Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) on Tuesday defended critics of Democratic health care reform plans who claim the proposals would provide subsidized health care to illegal immigrants .
Kyl said Democrats have long sought to block curbs on public services for people illegally in the country .
“ It ’s a logical question for people to ask , ” Kyl said during a conference call with reporters , maintaining that during last year ’s State Children ’s Health Insurance Program debate and other legislative fights , Democrats blocked efforts by Republicans to include curbs on health care for illegal immigrants .
“ In the last couple of bills … there were efforts to ensure that only eligible people would get the benefits … those efforts were defeated by Democrats , ” Kyl argued , pointing out that hospitals currently are required to provide illegal aliens — as well as anyone else — with health care if they are in need .
“ That illegal immigrants get care ... it ’s a big burden on hospitals , ” Kyl said .
Well , just like the " death panels " and " euthanasia " and " socialized medicine " claims , this one is wholly false , with no basis in reality whatsoever .
Media Matters has compiled a handy list of health - care myths propagated by right - wing talkers , and the " illegal immigrants will receive benefits " is No. 4 on the list :
REALITY : House bill stipulates that those " not lawfully present " may not receive subsidies to purchase insurance .
Under the " Individual Affordability Credits " section of the America 's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 : SEC .
242 . AFFORDABLE CREDIT ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL .
( a ) DEFINITION . -- ( 1 ) IN GENERAL . --
For purposes of this division , the term '' affordable credit eligible individual ' ' means , subject to subsection ( b ) , an individual who is lawfully present in a State in the United States ( other than as a nonimmigrant described in a subparagraph ( excluding subparagraphs ( K ) , ( T ) , ( U ) , and ( V ) ) of section 101 ( a ) ( 15 ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ) -- [...]
SEC .
246 . NO FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS .
Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States .
Senate HELP bill excludes those " not lawfully present " from federal funding .
Under the " Making Coverage Affordable " section of the Affordable Health Choices Act : ( h ) NO FEDERAL FUNDING . --
Nothing in this Act shall allow Federal payments for individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States .
PolitiFact has a further debunking .
Antonio Olivo in the LA Times had a good piece examining the issue awhile back .
Have no fear :
The fact of the claim 's provable falsity will not deter the teabaggers from adopting it .
Indeed , it probably increases the chances we 'll be hearing it a lot more in the days to come .
( CNN ) --
The guitarist stands in front of a mirror messing with his mohawk .
The drummer strikes a wild tempo .
The singer rips off his T - shirt and begins to scream the lyrics .
Basim Usmani is bassist for The Kominas , a group that blends traditional sounds with punk rock beats .
They 're young .
They 're punk .
And they 're rocking both their Muslim and American worlds with their music , lyrics and style .
" A lot of times people say , ' Oh wow , look , brown people playing music ' [ but ] it 's more than that , " said 25 - year - old Pakistani - American Shahjehan Khan , the lead singer for a Muslim punk band , The Kominas .
The Boston - based band is one of a handful of Muslim punk bands that emerged in the United States in the past few years .
The members of this four - person rock group with South Asian roots hold varying views on religion .
One says he's an atheist ; three others identify as Muslims -- both practicing and non-practicing .
For them , punk music is a way to rebel against their conservative cultural upbringing and the frustrations of growing up a young Muslim in America .
" We are n't [ just ] some alternative to a stereotypical Muslim .
We actually might be offering some sort of insights for people at large about religion , about the world , " said 26 - year - old bassist Basim Usmani .
Blending traditional South Asian rhythms with punk rock beats , they sing in both English and Punjabi .
( Kominas means " scum- bag " in Punjabi , according to the band . )
Their songs can be at once political , serious , satirical and insinuating .
Audio slide show :
On tour with Muslim punk rockers »
Their risqué lyrics and provocative song titles such as " Sharia Law in the USA , " " Suicide Bomb the GAP " and " Rumi was a Homo " -- a protest song against homophobia in the American Muslim community -- have drawn the attention of Muslims , non-Muslims , fans and critics alike .
" You sort of have to throw it in peoples ' faces and be shocking in order to give people a different way to think about stuff , " said Usmani .
" These punk , metal and rap scenes - so - called extreme music scenes -- are addressing issues that mainstream music doesn't , " said Mark LeVine , a professor of Middle Eastern history at University of California , Irvine , who is also a musician and author of " Heavy Metal Islam . "
" [ Punk ] allows them to rebel against society and their own culture at the same time , " he said .
iReport : Is Islam at odds with American values ?
Before the Islamic punk movement in North America had a voice , it had a story .
The Muslim punk scene began to gel in 2003 when novelist and convert to Islam , Michael Muhammad Knight self - published his book , " The Taqwacores " about a fictional Muslim punk scene in Buffalo , New York .
The book opens with a poem called " Muhammed was a Punk Rocker " and describes both conventional and unconventional characters including a Shi'ite skinhead , a conservative Sunni Muslim , a burka - wearing feminist punk and a Sufi who sports a Mohawk and drinks alcohol .
" The punk rock kids I would hang out with were n't even Muslim , " 31 - year old Knight recalls .
" They were so fiercely individualistic -- I wish that I could be a Muslim in that way : not be ashamed of my confusion , not be ashamed of my doubts .
Just be myself and be proud of who I am . "
The novel 's title , " Taqwacore , " is a hybrid word stemming from the Arabic " taqwa , " meaning " god consciousness , " and " core " referring to " hardcore " -- a genre of punk music .
It 's now a general term for Muslim punk rock .
The popularity of the book , which Knight said was born out of a search to find his identity as a Muslim - American , grew in underground youth circles and online .
It did n't take long before real - life " taqwacore " bands like The Kominas began blooming across the country .
" It makes sense why punk has been the music of choice for young , politically active Muslims who are musical , " said LeVine .
" The straight edge movement in punk which was about no drugs , no alcohol , was clean yet very intense and political .
It 's a way for them to rebel against their families in some extreme ways yet still be ritualistically , ' good Muslims . ' "
" Taqwacore " gave voice to many young Muslim - Americans who felt muted by circumstances and created an opening for bands like Al - Thawra , Vote Hezbollah , and Secret Trial Five -- an all - girl punk band out of Vancouver , Canada .
In the summer of 2007 , five of the taqwacore bands organized a " taqwa - tour " of the northeastern United States .
They played in city after city , traveling in a green school bus with TAQWA painted on the front bought by Knight for $ 2,000 on eBay .
This summer , The Kominas continue to strike a chord with audiences around the country , hitting cities from San Francisco to New York on a multi-city tour .
The taqwacore movement has also inspired two upcoming films - a dramatic feature film based on the book and a documentary .
Many conservative Muslims may peg young taqwacores as heretic for their suggestive and irreverent lyrics .
But the musicians say they are just trying to show both cultures how broad the spectrum of belief can be .
Like many young adults balancing their religious beliefs with American culture , some young Muslims in the United States say it 's a constant struggle to be accepted in both worlds .
" I had a lot of conflicted feelings growing up a Muslim in America , " said 25 - year - old Kominas drummer Imran Malik .
" It was hard not being able to do the same things that everyone else around you is doing without feeling guilty about them . "
Knight , who grew up with a Catholic mother and white supremacist father , converted to Islam when he was 16 .
He said his message is not one of blasphemy but rather an extension of his discontent with the rigid etiquette that dictates certain practices within Islam and the stereotypes of Muslims in American .
" Muslims have n't been fully accepted as Americans but the American experience has n't been accepted as something that can contribute to the Muslim world , " said Knight .
Knight said writing the book helped him and others connect through shared experiences .
" When I first wrote it , I felt like there would never be a place for me in the Muslim community and that has really turned around a lot , " he said .
" The book gave me the community I needed , it connected me to all these kids that were also confused and who also went through the things that I went through . "
That connection is vital to taqwacore music , bassist Usmani said .
" The music is great , but the conversation is the key to all of this .
The dialogue that we have inspired is really invaluable . "
" I do n't think Islam is ever going to go away , I 'm just trying to see how it best fits in my life . "

GLADNEY THE UNINSURED ACTIVIST ….
Over the last few days , a conservative activist in St. Louis named Kenneth Gladney seems to have become something of a cause celebre in far - right circles .
Depending on which version of events you choose to believe , Gladney either initiated or was involved in a scuffle at a town - hall event late last week .
At least one prominent conservative blogger said Gladney was “ brutally attacked ” by SEIU members outside the event .
After watching the video , there ’s ample reason for skepticism .
Gladney was , in fact , pulled to the ground during the fracas , but he seemed to bounce back up quickly , and is seen walking around soon after without any obvious injuries .
His attorney has argued that Gladney was beaten during the fight , but there ’s nothing in the clip to support that .
Gladney later went to the hospital , claiming to have sustained injuries to his “ knee , back , elbow , shoulder and face . ”
Yesterday , about 200 conservative activists held a protest outside the SEIU office in St. Louis .
Gladney was there — bandaged and in a wheelchair — as a featured guest .
Some of the activists held signs that read , “ Do n’t Tread on Kenny . ” Reader R.D. alerted me to this tidbit in the local news account of the protest :
Gladney did not address Saturday ’s crowd of about 200 people .
His attorney , David Brown , however , read a prepared statement Gladney wrote .
“ A few nights ago there was an assault on my liberty , and on yours , too . ”
Brown read .
“ This should never happen in this country . ” Supporters cheered .
Brown finished by telling the crowd that Gladney is accepting donations toward his medical expenses .
Gladney told reporters he was recently laid off and has no health insurance .
[ emphasis added ]
Wait , the conservative opponent of health care reform , fighting ( literally ) to defeat a plan that would bring coverage to those who lose their jobs , lost his coverage because he got laid off ?
I ’m not in a position to say whether Gladney sustained genuine injuries or whether he ’s exaggerating for 15 minutes of Fox News fame and a lucrative out - of - court settlement .
Either way , the new right - wing cause celebre needs to take up a collection to pay for his medical bills because he does n’t have health insurance .
It ’s a fascinating sign of the times .
* Update : The Washington Independent spoke to Gladney ’s attorney , who said the St. Louis Post - Dispatch article is mistaken .
Gladney did lose his job , the attorney said , but now has health insurance through his wife .
It ’s unclear , at this point , a ) why Gladney initially told reporters he has no insurance ; and b ) why he would need to solicit contributions from far - right activists to pay his medical bills if he already has coverage .
According to the document we just received , Sony has an unannounced PS3 product that is to be revealed during the Sony GamesCom Press Conference tomorrow .
The conference which is to be presented by Kaz Hirai and Andrew House , lists the following during the presentation :
2 x PlayStation 3 TOOL 1 x PlayStation 3 ( Unannounced Product / Discretion advised by Client ) 2 x PSPGo !
1 x White
1 x Black 2 x PlayStation EYE Camera ( NOTE : Is not a Video Camera for recording Presentation , no fee required )
Since the unannounced PS3 is listed with the rest of the hardware , it ’s suggesting that it ’s some type of new PS3 SKU .
Then again , this was sent in as by a tipster so we cannot confirm the validity of the document especially when the document has the incorrect date of 18/09/2009 .
However the tipster mentions that this is “ 100 % legit ” from a GamesCom employee .
We will find out tomorrow , stay tuned to PlayStation LifeStyle for our GamesCom coverage .
Thanks to smeg orz for the tip !
NEWPORT -- Philip Wormington awoke in his bunk in the wee hours Tuesday to the sound of breakers slamming into the fishing vessel Lori Ann -- formerly Little Linda -- and knew instantly it was in trouble .
And how .
Skipper Travis Vitale , 25 , of Eureka , Calif. , had fallen asleep , allowing the 54 - foot vessel to run aground just outside Nye Beach .
" It was crazy , " Wormington said Tuesday .
" Travis kept putting it in gear and trying to back off , but that was n't happening .
There were breakers coming over the stern and all the way into the galley . "
The pair contacted the U.S. Coast Guard , donned survival suits and waited .
Finally , fearing for their lives , they launched the lifeboat and made it safely to shore .
Crews worked Tuesday against a rising tide to pump fuel off the vessel and inspect it for damage .
The news was good , said Petty Officer Luke Potter of the U.S. Coast Guard .
The boat had grounded on a " nice , sandy beach " and was undamaged .
The crew was safe .
Only a tiny amount of its 1,800 gallons of diesel spilled -- and it was quickly contained .
" All things considered , things are going really well , " Potter said .
" Generally , these things will take a couple of tide cycles to work out .
Usually you need an external force to coax it back to sea , " Potter said .
Wormington , 39 , of McKinleyville , Calif. , said he and Vitale had hoped to refloat the boat at high tide Tuesday afternoon , said But the insurance company put the kibosh on those plans .
An attempt to tow the vessel from the beach will begin this morning .
Wormington chuckled about the saga that began about 2 a.m.
Tuesday , but he admitted , the experience was harrowing at the time .
" I wo n't lie , I cried .
I thought I was done .
I grabbed my cell , my wallet , and put it in my survival suit .
I thought , ' There is the town .
At least when my body washes up , they 'll know who I am . ' "
Luckily , that was not the case .
The Coast Guard was waiting when the two made it to shore .
" We did n't launch our boat right away just due to the proximity of the vessel to the shore , " said Petty Officer Robert Decker , who is stationed at Yaquina Bay .
" In such limited depth of water , our vessel would not be able to get in safely .
We were trying to get them to stay on the boat until we could find the best avenue to get to them . "
Tuesday , as the Coast Guard investigated , Vitale searched for a buyer for 5 tons of albacore tuna they 'd caught in the past 11 days of fishing .
That bounty had a lot to do with the predicament the two found themselves in , said Vitale , owner of the Lori Ann .
" Too many hours up , " he said , sheepishly .
" I went to sleep for little bit and then I heard it .
Bang ! "

I wonder which Apple slogan is more appropriate :

Sorry for posting this so late but I feel really burned out lately .
I 've been spending way too much time typing these review as quite frankly I 'm not sure what I 'm going to do once the fall shows start .
I 'll probably stop recapping what happened and instead give a brief review of the episode and score it .
I wo n't be recapping this episode today , but check back in tomorrow and I might have added a recap .
For now , I have review .
Episode 4 was the most coherent episode so far .
This is what exactly what Leverage was in season 1 and what it is supposed to be .
The pacing was great and I felt the character focus on Sophie was maybe one of the best of the whole series .
After her mystery boyfriend breaks up with her for not really knowing her ( who can blame him ? ) , she has a very personal moment , actually telling the truth , and completing the con in the process .
Nate and Sophie is looking real good on the horizon .
The 2 FBI agents from last season Taggert and McSweeten were also back , so Parker and Hardison play along with their old role .
McSweeten is hitting on Parker the whole time and she is just annoyed by him leading to some funny scenes with her ( which scene with her is n't ? )
Hardison is a little jealous , but I do n't think anything will happen in that department soon .
There were some fun scenes with Eliot posing as the gym teacher and him fighting someone .
I had one weird observation , when Nate first introduced himself as the German principal , saying " My name is ... "
I thought he sounded almost exactly like Borat .
I 'm not sure if that was Timothy Hutton 's intent , but I immediately thought Borat when I heard it .
Score : 9.5/10
Meet Banjo , Matilda and Clancy - the first large Australian dinosaurs to be discovered in almost three decades .
Three new species of Australian dinosaur have been discovered by scientists and volunteers in a prehistoric billabong in western Queensland .
Premier Anna Bligh announced the discovery in the central western town of Winton on Friday as she opened the first stage of the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History .
The dinosaurs have been nicknamed after characters created by poet Banjo Paterson , who is said to have written Waltzing Matilda in Winton in 1885 .

Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co. said Monday it will cut about 800 jobs through a combination of buyouts and layoffs that will affect an undetermined number of workers in the Bay Area .
Lockheed 's Space Systems division designs and builds everything from weather satellites to ballistic missiles .
It employs about 18,000 people , about 7,700 of whom work in Sunnyvale , with a few hundred others based in Palo Alto and Santa Cruz .
Lockheed said it is offering an incentive package to attract early retirements or voluntary buyouts but did not disclose the terms .
After that offer expires on Aug. 28 , the company will start making layoffs that should be completed by the first week of November .

Lockheed spokesman Steve Tatum said the process makes it impossible to know at this time how many local employees will take the buyout or be laid off .
Lockheed , which employs 146,000 people overall , reported revenue of $ 42.7 billion in 2008 .

The opinion has often been expressed that literary criticism has merely been marking time since Aristotle invented it in his POETICS .
This may or may not be an exaggeration .
But the venerable Greek provided a couple of insights that are useful in understanding certain trends in contemporary American fiction .
In the century that just fizzled out , Plot was generally the province of trash literature , while Character , Diction and Thought were reserved for the serious stuff .
This rift did not exist in the nineteenth century , when the best novelists tended also to be the most popular .
Dickens was the prime novelistic technician and psychologist of his day , as well as the greatest myth - maker .
However , by the time Hemingway decided to blow out his brains with a shotgun in Idaho , the discontinuity between art and escapism had become wide as the Grand Canyon , so that even the average citizen could n’t fail to notice .
It required the diseased genius of Madison Avenue to bridge the gap , or at least to stick a Lady Liberty - sized band - aid over it .
And Saul Bellow was right there , with his HERZOG–a book about a man who does nothing but write letters to dead people –to claim the dubious distinction of being the first author whose " novels " were sold to millions but actually read by several thousand , at the most .
Such hype , when exerted upon the rudimentary awareness of a world mesmerized by television , can even go so far as to garner the highest accolades for its beneficiaries .
But , unfortunately , it has far less auspicious effects on the development of the work itself .
Nobel Prize and multi-million - dollar bank account notwithstanding , Bellow is a classic case of arrested development , in the Aristotelian sense .
Premature recognition , especially in America , where fame brings an infinitude of distractions and temptations , almost inevitably stunts the growth of novelists .
It ’s the sad story of American fiction , from Mark Twain to Mark Helprin ; and Saul Bellow is one of the saddest episodes in that story .
At the tender age of twenty - nine , he had his first book published , to the critical coos of his crowd .
He realized , while still a tyro , that he was into something profitable .
It takes a greater genius than Bellow , or a greater fool , to tamper with the goose that lays the golden eggs–even if the fowl does show the potential of becoming a swan .
" Beginners , " says Aristotle , " succeed earlier with Diction and Character than with construction of a story . "
Bellow was just such a beginner , and a very promising one at that .
But , having already amassed most of the money and ego - gratification he could ever hope to absorb , he had no reason to develop beyond his exquisite Diction and Character , and into the Action that could set his works firmly in the collective awareness of the human race .
The result is the unhappy spectacle of a man pushing a hundred , who provides us , every year or so , with a compilation of profound insights , well expressed , but going nowhere –in short , yet another novice work , marketed as a full - fledged novel .
He ’s not a novelist at all , but an essayist , as the late John Gardner observed .
At the extreme opposite end of the spectrum wallows Stephen King , who has hawked more words and banked more royalties than any writer in the history of this planet .
And the only advertisement his books require is his name and likeness on the dust jacket .
The people who buy his books actually read them , voraciously , from cover to cover .
Old reliable Aristotle preemptively blew the whistle on Stephen King as well : " Plot is the end and purpose of tragedy .
One may string together a series of characteristic speeches of the utmost best … and yet fail to produce the true tragic effect ; but one would have much better success with a tragedy which , however inferior in these respects , has a Plot … .
There can be tragedy without Character , but not without Plot . "
Presumably the permissible deficiencies extend to the areas of Thought and Diction as well .
In his tales of talking cars and cannibalistic toddlers , King is utterly virginal of Thought .
And , of course , he eschews the delicacies of Diction so as not to offend the ears of his lowbrow clientele .
But he can tell a story .
Why can he do it , and not Bellow , who is his superior in every other respect ?
The answer is almost certainly genetic , or at least congenital .
Various young boys wander through King ’s books , effortlessly spouting well - shaped impromptu anecdotes .
If they can be construed as self - portraits , we might assume that their creator is a natural - born story teller , a former prodigy in that primeval art form .
Chatterton , Mozart and Picasso notwithstanding , child prodigies are usually the least promising members of any artistic generation .
It ’s a giant ’s step from semi-conscious infantile knacks to considered adult craftsmanship .
In the field of music we hear again and again of the actual handicap that childhood genius can be .
Yehudi Menuhin had to lay his fiddle aside for a time in adolescence , to give his heart and brain a chance to catch up with his precocious fingers .
Advertising agencies are full of natural painters , musicians and poets , who never mustered the gumption to make that explicitly moral leap into imaginative adulthood .
And the bestseller racks are peopled with similarly idiotic savants , the most conspicuous today being Stephen King .
Go to the video shop incognito and rent PET SEMATARY .
Steel yourself and observe the close - up of the small boy ’s face contorting in agony as the six - inch hypodermic needle is slowly inserted into his jugular vein .
And ask yourself : is it possible to accuse Mr. King of being anything but ethically a child–and a very naughty one at that ?
And yet he is a novelist , in a truer sense than Bellow , the great " Dean , " can ever be .
If one were named dictator of the world tomorrow and asked which author ’s work should be set on fire in an attempt to expunge it forever from human awareness , one would be obliged to choose King’s .
But the irony is that , once their topicality has vanished in the smog of time , Bellow ’s works will be utterly forgotten , while King ’s , even if put to the torch , will undoubtedly survive in the more debased nightmares of the working classes and the nasty little jokes hissed around the campfire by pubescents at Boy Scout jamborees .
His works , and the works of other trash writers like him , are symptoms of our civilization ’s regression and decline , rather than curative agents which may arrest it .
As Joseph Campbell , the late hireling of George Lucas , once observed , the stories which define vigorous societies are created not by the masses , but by the elite : Saul Bellows with moral imaginations and the psychic virility to weld them into mythos .
Needless to say , such a Saul Bellow is not on the scene today–or at least Manhattan has so far scorned his works .
That very neglect , that sin of omission , is a self - fulfilling prophecy of doom .
Campbell ’s mythopoeic elite are not embraced by nations in the petulant throes of decline .
Jesus had a reason for weeping over Jerusalem : she killed all her prophets .
There was a time in the neighborhood of Canaan when Moloch and the wicked Baalim held sway over the people ’s imaginations .
Then Abraham came out of Ur . And now who commands ( at least nominally ) the most regiments , Abraham ’s god or Jezebel ’s ?
We are aware of the Ammonite practices of temple prostitution and baby sacrifice , but most of us perform less racy rituals on Sunday mornings , our vicarious behavior over the VCR the night before notwithstanding .
The Moloch myth , as currently expressed in Stephen King ’s fiction , emerges in the darker moments of human history .
It caters to the appetites of vicious merchant civilizations , such as doomed Carthage and the USA of today .
The wholesome tales of Miriam and Moses , of Joseph and his brothers , of John the Baptist and his younger , brighter cousin , are not being retold now .
The time is ripe for Abraham Redivivus .
He ’ll come looming out of the desert and chase away the cannibal pantheon with fresh monolithic insights into the individuated human psyche .
The new Abraham ’s spike will be raised over Isaac ’s jugular , blunt and gruesome enough to capture the jaded attention of the American people .
But when he lowers it , unmoistened with blood , his gesture will be so mighty and beautiful that all who see it will be transformed .
And no more forests will be flattened to produce deluxe editions of Stephen King ’s works , and Madison Avenue will drop Saul Bellow just as it did the Hula Hoop .
He is white , about 30 years old , with short brown hair .
He 's a big man , 6 feet 2 and more than 300 pounds .
On his last day of life , he chose a green shirt and khaki pants .
As of Monday -- a full week after he apparently jumped to his death off a bridge near Energy Park Drive in St. Paul -- no one had called police to identify him .
His body might still be under that secluded bridge if not for his shoes and for a decent young woman with whom he is now forever linked .
Susan Lee , 24 , was riding her bike home from work at the University of Minnesota 's St. Paul campus on July 6 .
It was a beautiful late afternoon , and Lee , a year - round cyclist with thick brown hair and an engaging smile , was planning to chill with her boyfriend .
Then she saw the shoes .
They had been placed with seeming care , tidily , one next to the other .
They pointed toward the concrete - and - wire railing on the bridge , which shuttles buses between campuses .
Lee wanted not to see them , not to think about what might be below .
She peered over " sort of haphazardly , " she said , and saw nothing .
People flew by on bikes , in buses .
No one stopped to consider the shoes .
Lee wanted to believe that , maybe , they were abandoned there by a free spirit who longed to go barefoot on a gorgeous summer day .
" But it was so hot on the cement , " she said .
" It did n't add up . "
She carefully pulled herself up onto the concrete barrier , higher this time , balanced against the wire , and looked over .
" I called police right away , " Lee said .
She used her little Canon PowerShot to take one poetic photograph : her bike , his shoes .
Then she waited for the police .
It took the officers several minutes to find her .
To find them .
" It 's hard to imagine living with that much sadness , " Lee said , " and they still do n't know who he is .
That possibly shows how alone he really was . "
Of course , that remains conjecture until someone steps forward who knows his story .
Another summer of record - breaking temperatures brought power failures , heat waves , droughts and tropical storms throughout the U.S. , Europe and Asia .
Only one place seemed to remain cool : the air - conditioned offices of the editorial board of the .
As New York City wilted beneath them , they sat insouciant and comfortable , hurling editorials of stunning misdirection at their readers , continuing their irresponsible drumbeat that global warming is junk science .
Now I have nothing against the Wall Street Journal .
It is an excellent paper , whose science column and news reporting have accurately and carefully carried the story of global climate change .
Even the corporate advertisements that surround the editorial page tell of BP 's commitments to renewable energy and General Electric 's commitments to environmentally sound technologies .
The editorial page sits in its own redoubt , separated from the reporters and from the truth .
One recent editorial , " Hockey Stick Hokum " ( published July 14 , 2006 ) , epitomizes the editorial approach of recent years .
The climate change " hockey stick " is a graph first published in 1998 by Michael Mann et al. that attempted to reconstruct the mean surface temperature on the planet during the period A. D. 900 to the present , using multiple proxies , such as tree rings , to measure temperatures before formal instrumentation was in use .
The conclusion of that study was that we are now in that interval 's warmest range of temperatures , therefore adding support to the overwhelming evidence from other sources and models that man-made climate change is already well underway .
The Wall Street Journal editorial page has for years railed against these scientific findings on climate change , even as the global consensus has reached nearly 100 percent of the scientific community , including the reports commissioned by the skeptical Bush White House .
Thus , the hockey stick became the bte noire of the editorial page as well as of the dwindling " climate skeptic " community , and right - wing Congressional officials such as Representative Joe Barton of Texas , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality , took up the attack .
In response to these growing political pressures , the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences conducted a major independent scientific review and updating of the hockey stick data and analysis .
While acknowledging a range of uncertainties , that report came down squarely on the side of the Mann study .
The NRC noted that " presently available proxy evidence indicates that temperatures at many , but not all , individual locations were higher during the past 25 years than during any period of comparable length since A.D. 900 . "
It went on to say " the committee finds it plausible that the Northern Hemisphere was warmer during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period over the preceding millennium . "
They noted significant uncertainties that remain for global temperatures before 1600 , but emphasized " surface temperature reconstructions for periods prior to the industrial era are only one of multiple lines of evidence supporting the conclusion that climatic warming is occurring in response to human activities , and they are not the primary evidence . "
The Wall Street Journal editorial page completely ignored this report .
Instead , it cited a report commissioned by Congressman Barton from three statisticians with no background in climate science , who quibbled with aspects of Mann 's methodology .
Yet climate scientists quickly showed that addressing the criticisms has no practical effect on Mann 's conclusions .
Nonetheless , on this thoroughly flimsy and misleading basis , the editorial page declared that " there 's no reason to believe that Mr. Mann , or his ' hockey stick ' graph of global temperature changes , is right , " called the research " dubious , " and said that the climate science community " often more closely resembles a mutual - admiration society than a competitive and open - minded search for scientific knowledge . "
In other words , it hid the evidence and trashed climate science .
The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray .
— Oscar Wilde
A while back I read a book called Real - Time Relationships , by Stefan Molyneux .
It ’s a book about creating relationships that are healthy , enjoyable , loving , and virtuous .
The author hosts a philosophy podcast called Freedomain Radio , which deals with everything from overcoming procrastination and how to be a good parent , to the ethics of taxation and philosophical analyses of current events .
This article is not a review of the book , so I ’ll avoid any comments on its read - worthiness as a whole .
But I would like to share with you an extract that forever changed the way I look at things .
It ’s a quote from the book that concisely summarizes what the whole thing is about :
The Real - Time Relationship ( RTR ) is based on two core principles , designed to liberate both you and others in your communication with each other : 1 . Thoughts precede emotions .
2. Honesty requires that we communicate our thoughts and feelings , not our conclusions .
Molyneux ’s point is that so much of the negative communication in relationships arises because we treat feelings as facts , and tend to skip over the thoughts that underly those feelings .
This results in arguments that are , in essence , based on mythology .
So let ’s say one day Alice says to her husband Bob :
You ’re so lazy !
You never help around the house !
This is an example of communicating a conclusion — that Bob is lazy — rather than communicating just her thoughts and feelings .
It is not necessarily true that Bob is lazy .
Perhaps he does n’t help clean up after dinner because he assumes that , since he cooked dinner , the cleaning task should naturally fall to Alice .
Or maybe he left washing the dishes to Alice because he did the vacuuming earlier in the day .
Alice calling Bob “ lazy ” bypasses these possibilities .
It ’s a conclusion derived from anger , rather than an honest deployment of what she ’s experiencing on the inside .
A more sincere approach would be for her to tell Bob that she feels frustrated because he left her to do the dishes , which makes her feel disrespected , makes her think that Bob does n’t care , and so on .
Replacing the name - calling with an accurate testimony of what it made her feel opens the door for Bob to address those feelings .
On the one hand , it might make Bob realize that he really is lazy , and if he cares about his partner he better work on that .
On the other hand , he has a chance to clarify a misunderstanding .
He could talk to Alice about how he assumed that since he cooked dinner , he thought it was okay if he left the clean up to her .
Whether that division of labour is something they can both accept is a separate issue .
The point is that communicating with integrity requires describing your thoughts and feelings , not rushing to conclusions about what ’s really going on .
RTR’ing Yourself
In my experience , the Real - Time Relationship is an excellent model not only for productive communication between two people , but also for communicating with yourself .
In particular , it ’s a powerful tool for dealing with negative emotions .
Let ’s revisit those two core principles of the RTR , to see how they apply to dealing with one ’s own negativity :
Thoughts precede emotions .
Emotions , in and of themselves , tell you nothing about the facts of reality .
Feeling hopeless about your chances of meeting an amazing girl does not actually mean that you have no hope of meeting an amazing girl .
And just because losing that game damaged your confidence so much that you feel like you ’ll never win again does not mean you actually will never win again .
Honesty requires that we communicate our thoughts and feelings , not our conclusions .
The best way to deal with negative emotions — which are often negative conclusions we ’ve come to about ourselves — is to examine the thoughts and feelings behind them .
For example , I have always had a fear of losing .
As a chess player during my teenage years , this fear surfaced in the form of offering draws to higher rated players when I had a clearly better position .
Other times it just kept me out of tournaments altogether : by not playing , I guaranteed not losing .
Recently that fear resurfaced when I started playing go ( a board game invented in China 4,000 years ago . )
One particular loss a few weeks ago was particularly hard to swallow .
I was a solid 50 points ahead in the game , and my opponent was ready to resign .
But my follow through was so terrible that he ended up beating me by about 50 points instead .
I do n’t mind when I lose because my opponent just outplayed me , but I get really frustrated when I outplay myself .
And after this particular loss , my confidence was deeply shaken :
How the hell could I play so badly ?
Why did I try to get so fancy ?
It ’s impossible to blow a lead that big .
If anything I had to congratulate myself for being able to fail so spectacularly .
And on it went , to the point that I wondered whether I should just quit playing altogether .
What was the point of all the studying I was doing if I was just going to blow games like that ?
How would I regain my confidence to actually win a won position ?
Would I ever even win another game again ?
Challenging Negative Thoughts
When you start thinking negative thoughts like this , do n’t try to ignore them .
If you ’ve ever tried to repress negative feelings you know that it just does n’t work .
If anything , it amplifies them .
Further , trying to stamp out bad feelings gives you no actionable way out of that state .
There are underlying premises , beliefs , and assumptions about you and the world around you that have led you to feeling that way , and those need to be addressed .
So the way out of negative emotional loops is not to ignore them , subdue them , or even “ just let them be there ” , but to challenge them .
Confront the negative self - talk directly and identify exactly why you feel that way .
Extract the thoughts that precede the emotions .
Returning to my go example , I knew I loved the game and I had no intention of actually giving it up , so I forced myself to figure out how to better handle major upsets like the one I ’d just endured .
I did that by taking a close look at the thoughts that were going through my head .
Here are some examples :
How could I play so badly ?
Easy : by making mistakes .
Everybody makes mistakes .
When a doctor makes a mistake , he might kill someone and / or get sued .
When a computer programmer makes a mistake , it might lead to a huge security flaw in his software .
When an investor makes a mistake , she might lose a few million bucks .
And when a go player makes a mistake , he loses a game of go .
Easy : by making mistakes .

When a computer programmer makes a mistake , it might lead to a huge security flaw in his software .
When an investor makes a mistake , she might lose a few million bucks .
And when a go player makes a mistake , he loses a game of go .
How could I lose such a won position ?
Because deserving to win is not the same as winning .
And by the way , this probably wo n’t be the last time you blow such a big lead .
This is more like “ the first major screw up of the rest of your ( go playing ) life . ”
But the more it happens , the better you ’ll learn to deal with it .
Because deserving to win is not the same as winning .
And by the way , this probably wo n’t be the last time you blow such a big lead .
This is more like “ the first major screw up of the rest of your ( go playing ) life . ”
But the more it happens , the better you ’ll learn to deal with it .
Will I ever win again ?
Erm , seriously ?
Do you really think that if you play another five or ten thousand games you ’re going to lose all of them ?
Do you really think that if you spend a couple hours a day studying and playing go , and constantly seek out opportunities to learn from stronger players , that you ’re going to be the same strength in five years from now that you are today ?
Not. Likely .
The more I cranked up the resolution on my thoughts , the more I realized how silly they were .
Sure , I still fear losing and I still hate blowing won positions , but challenging those feelings and forcing myself to reveal the thinking behind them has greatly diminished their control over my actions .
And they no longer threaten my continued enjoyment of the game .
I ’ve intentionally given a rather tame example here of course , but I use these same principles to confront all kinds of fear , uncertainty , and doubt .
I have the same kinds of worries about my writing , my consulting work , my health , my relationships , etc. , and I ’ve found this process to be extremely helpful for putting things in perspective .
" Thanks for the wild turkey and the passenger pigeons , destined to be shit out through wholesome American guts . "
- William S. Burroughs , Thanksgiving Prayer
Once , there were many billions of passenger pigeons in America .
Then the " settlers " arrived .
As one of those settlers wrote in the 1600's : " There are wild pigeons in winter beyond number or imagination , myself have seen three or four hours together flocks in the air , so thick that even have they shadowed the sky from us . "
" By anyone ’s estimation , it was the most abundant bird on Earth , " writes Alan Wiesman in his book , The World Without Us .
" Its flocks , 300 miles long and numbering in the billions , spanned horizons fore and aft , actually darkening the sky . "
As late as April 1873 , residents of Saginaw , Michigan witnessed " a continuous stream of passenger pigeons overhead between 7.30 in the morning and 4 o'clock in the afternoon . "
By 1900 , however , all the wild passenger pigeons had been killed by humans .
Fourteen years later , the last passenger pigeon died in captivity .
Once , there were many billions of passenger pigeons in America .
Now there are none .
This might have been the most dramatic example of avicide .
Today , the methods by which human activities kill birds are far more varied but no less deadly :
* As many as 80 million birds are killed each year by collisions with plate glass windows .
* 60 to 80 million birds are killed each year by motor vehicles .
This averages out to roughly 15 bird deaths per mile per year .
* 120 million birds are murdered by hunters each year .
* Feline companions allowed to roam free kill about 4 million birds each day in North America alone .
Worldwide , the yearly number of birds killed by domestic cats is in the billions .
* There are 77,000 radio - transmission towers higher than 199 feet in the U.S. and nearly 200 million birds collide fatally with these towers per year .
Add in 175,000 cell phone towers and the number of dead birds approaches a half - billion annually .
* Then , of course , you have habitat loss , environmental toxins , introduced diseases , and the biggest bird killer of all : the meat - based diet , e.g. every day , 23 million chickens are killed in the U.S. for food .
That 's 269 dead chickens per second .
It 's Hitchcock in reverse as the planet 's most destructive species systematically slaughters everything in its path .
Once , there were many billions of passenger pigeons in America .
Now there are none .
I do n't wanna live on a planet without birds .
Do you ?
In fact , I can't live on a planet without birds and neither can you .
So , what should we do about it …now ?

Black on “ Big Bang ”
CBS has let slip …and by “ let slip , ” I mean that they ’ve released a formal press release … that comedian Lewis Black will be appearing on the second episode of the new season of “ The Big Bang Theory . ”
Black will guest star as Professor Crawley , a brilliant professor of entomology – he even has a dung beetle named after him – who works at Caltech with the guys .
Unfortunately , Crawley ’s life is falling apart : his department ’s being shut down because of budget cutbacks , his wife left him for someone who studies birds , and he ’s moving in with his daughter in Oxnard … not Oxnard on the beach , but Oxnard by the onion fields .
None of these things , however , prove nearly as aggravating as Sheldon , who keeps pestering him to settle a bet with Wolowitz about a cricket .
The third season of “ The Big Bang Theory ” premieres Monday , Sept. 21 , at 9:30 PM , so Black ’s episode should – at least in theory – air on the 28th .
In tribute , here ’s a clip of Mr. Black talking religion with Bob Schieffer , followed by my favorite moment in “ Big Bang ” history :

Erik Prince ’s security enterprise has a division for pretty much everything .
Need planes or choppers ?
See Aviation Worldwide or Presidential Airways .
A compliment of Colombian mercs ?
Greystone at your service .
For - hire spooks ?
Total Intelligence Solutions — emphasis on total — is standing by .
And for the super - double - secret covert work — the kind that the CIA keeps even Congress in the dark about —
Prince has a division for that too .
According to the New York Times , it ’s called Blackwater Select .
Building on its scoop that the company played a role in the CIA ’s abandoned program to assassinate Al Qaeda operatives , the Times reports today that this secret division also plays a part in the agency ’s predator drone program .
The division ’s operations are carried out at hidden bases in Pakistan and Afghanistan , where the company ’s contractors assemble and load Hellfire missiles and 500 - pound laser - guided bombs on remotely piloted Predator aircraft , work previously performed by employees of the Central Intelligence Agency .
They also provide security at the covert bases , the officials said .
The role of the company in the Predator program highlights the degree to which the C.I.A. now depends on outside contractors to perform some of the agency ’s most important assignments .
And it illustrates the resilience of Blackwater , now known as Xe ( pronounced Zee ) Services , though most people in and outside the company still refer to it as Blackwater .
It has grown through government work , even as it attracted criticism and allegations of brutality in Iraq .
You ’d think that after repeated controversies Prince ’s government clients would tire of the enduring PR nightmare and cut their ties .
But they wo n’t , because they can’t .
By many , the company is viewed as indispensable .
This did n’t happen by accident .
It ’s long been Prince ’s business model .
“ Make yourself indispensable to the client , and you ’ll always have work , ” Prince is quoted as saying in Suzanne Simons ’ new book , Master of War .
Certainly the company did n’t rise up from its modest origins to become a contracting behemoth without a lot of help .
That is , if the company is indispensable , that ’s largely because we made it that way .
The more jobs the government contracts out to Blackwater ( and other industry players ) , the more the government loses the internal capacity to do them itself .
Think of it this way : Blackwater operators were originally trained by the government to carry out the drone work .
If the government decides it wants to assume this role again one day , will its personnel need to be trained by Blackwater ?
It ’s not just about outsourcing — it ’s the kind of jobs that are being outsourced to Blackwater that raise questions .
Writing in Time , ex-CIA officer Robert Baer points out :
It ’s one thing , albeit often misguided , for the agency to outsource certain tasks to contractors .
It ’s quite another to involve a company like Blackwater in even the planning and training of targeted killings , akin to the CIA going to the mafia to draw up a plan to kill Castro .
I suspect that if the agreements are ever really looked into — rather than a formal contract , the CIA reportedly brokered individual deals with top company brass — we will find out that Blackwater ’s assassination work was more about bilking the U.S. taxpayer than it was killing Osama bin Laden or other al - Qaeda leaders .
More than a few senior CIA officers retired from the CIA and went to work at Blackwater , the controversial private security shop now known as Xe Services .
Not only did those officers presumably take their CIA Rolodexes with them out the door , but many probably did n’t choose to leave until they had a lucrative new contract lined up .
But more to the point , Blackwater stood no better chance of placing operatives in Pakistan ’s tribal areas , where the al - Qaeda leadership was hiding in 2004 , than the CIA or the U.S. military did .
Still , whether by virtue of Blackwater ’s revolving door relationship with the CIA , or the agency ’s own manpower shortages , the company has now been entrusted with some of the intelligence community ’s most senstive work .
Thanks to the Times , we now know more details about Blackwater ’s CIA work , but this likely represents a fraction of the covert contracts ( or handshake agreements , as the case may be ) the company and its affiliates have undertaken for the agency .
Add in the many non-secret jobs these companies perform for the government , and it becomes hard to imagine the Obama administration extricating itself from its inherited relationship with Prince ’s companies even if it wanted to .
In some ways , Prince ’s operation is the military world version of AIG — too big to fail .

A few days ago , X - Files News reported that Gillian Anderson said at the Sarajevo Film Festival that X - Files 3 is coming by 2012 .
Now assuming that the rough translations are correct , there should be something going on behind the scenes .
I know the second movie did n't do so well in the movie theaters , but if you look closely , Fox made decent money on the movie .
The domestic gross was pathetic , but internationally , it made $ 68 million .
Remember that IWTB was released the week after The Dark Knight and I 'm guessing no one notice while this behemoth was still on screen .
The budget for the movie was fairly low and I 'm guessing advertising was n't too much either .
So what do I want to see for the next XF film ?
I had no problem with IWTB , but I think wrapping up the alien story or at least advancing it would be the best option .
There are loose ends everywhere , and some conclusion would be nice .
The clock is ticking and I would hate to see our favorite heroes not do battle with the government and / or aliens one last time and be wasted on another standalone .
Fox should give Chris Carter a bigger budget .
We know what he can do with money , just watch Fight the Future .
With more advanced technology , there can be much more .
Just imagine the visual effects people can do today compared to 10 years ago .
There was also talk about doing a reboot à la Star Trek , and Battlestar Galactica .
Just like there is no Buffy movie without Joss Whedon , there is no X - Files without Gillian , David , or Chris .
There is no way in hell I would ever settle for some random people to come in and just put their ideas over something that worked fabulously for 9 years .
The X - Files is just 15 years old , the actors are still viable , so why would they need to adapt ?
I 'm sure there is an audience out there that wo n't settle for the pathetic Transformers and GI Joes out there .
Chris Carter has proven himself to be able to write amazing scripts that can blend all the different emotions out there and create compelling stories that keep people engrossed .
I want to believe that there will be a third movie .
Fans can continue to write letters and send emails to Fox , you will be heard .
For now , we 'll keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best .

A bull filmed rampaging around a supermarket after escaping from a cattle market has put a small town in the west of Ireland on the international map .
CCTV footage from the security cameras in Cummins ' SuperValu store in Ballinrobe , County Mayo , put on YouTube has been viewed by thousands of people around the world .
Residents ' relatives have been calling from as far afield as Sydney and Hong Kong to say they have seen it .
It was market day when the bull jumped out of the cattle ring and headed up the main street .
The supermarket owner John Cummins said today : " He got out of the mart about a kilometre away and galloped right up the town – past Tesco – turned left , then right and came straight into the front door .
" He went straight through the shop , out into the store , had a good look about , turned around and went straight out again .
I could not believe my eyes . "
While Mr Cummins is laughing about it now , he said it could have been a very different story .
" It is a good news story but it could have been a bad news story , a pregnant woman could have been hurt , a child could have been hurt , anyone in the store .
There could have been a lot of damage or there could have been damage to cars , thank goodness no one was injured . "
The film footage , put together from various CCTV camera's in the store , shows the bull entering through the electronic double doors and racing to the rear of the store before , appropriately , a butcher tries to corral it with a shopping trolley .
But the bull turned and charged at him .
Another camera showed the bull 's owner running into the store , then running out even faster when the beast decided to chase him .
Mr Cummins said : " No one can say we do n't have the freshest beef in my store – and we have full traceability ! "
" It has been very , very busy the last few days with people coming in – it's amazing the comments we have been getting .
" One customer said he had had a call from a relative in Sydney and another from a brother in Hong Kong . " .
Mr Cummins praised his staff for their calm reaction to the incident .
" They were excellent . "
One staff member , Helen McDonnell , said : " I could smell the bull and when he was charging out again I never moved so fast in my life . "
The bull was later recaptured and returned to the cattle market .
Karateka
Thanks to guesst some aditional information has been added :
This game was made by none other than Jordan Mechner .
Jordan Mechner was more an independent film maker than a game maker when he started writing Karateka , hense the reason for the cinematic quality that had never been seen before .
After Karateka Mr. Mechner went on to refine his digital story telling prowis producing Prince of Persia and Prince of Persia 2 .
An evil overlord has kidnapped the love of your life .
You reach his palace on a high mountain and Karateka begins .
It was an excellent game when it came out and it still has n't lost much .
The graphics are CGA , but they still look nice ( they do n't hurt your eyes ) , you can easily recognize what 's what suppose to be , and so on .
It even does n't look pixelated ( which is an excellent achievment ) .
The sound is PC speaker , but not unpleasant and the game features something I think no other game before ever did – CUT SCENES !!!
As the game progresses , more cut scenes appear to give you an update on what 's going on deep down in the enemy 's stronghold .
The enemies get harder as you continue , increasing the challenge .
OK maybe it's a little repetitive – fighting one guy after the next , but at that point they could n't have done any better .
Speaking of fighting , you move with the arrow keys , but to perform kicks and punches you need to use the following : Q , A , Z for high , mid and low punch ; W , S , X for high , mid and low kick .
I think space is for side step , but I was n't able to use it in combat .
So what are you waiting for , go on and save your lovely lady out of the claws of the evil lord , before he has his ways with her .
You need to press space as soon as you see the " Brøderbund Software , Inc. " credits .
If you do n't you 'll see a message asking you to place the disk in your drive and the game will hang .

White Collars Turn Blue
A note to readers :
This was written for a special centennial issue of the NYT magazine .
The instructions were to write it as if it were in an issue 100 years in the future , looking back at the past century .
When looking backward , one must always be prepared to make allowances : it is unfair to blame late 20th - century observers for their failure to foresee everything about the century to come .
Long - term social forecasting is an inexact science even now , and in 1996 the founders of modern nonlinear socioeconomics were still obscure graduate students .
Still , even then many people understood that the major forces driving economic change would be the continuing advance of digital technology , on one side , and the spread of economic development to previously backward nations , on the other ; in that sense there were no big surprises .
The puzzle is why the pundits of the time completely misjudged the consequences of those changes .
Perhaps the best way to describe the flawed vision of fin- de - siecle futurists is to say that , with few exceptions , they expected the coming of an " immaculate " economy -- an economy in which people would be largely emancipated from any grubby involvement with the physical world .
The future , everyone insisted , would bring an " information economy " , which would mainly produce intangibles ; the good jobs would go to " symbolic analysts " , who would push icons around on computer screens ; and knowledge rather than traditionally important resources like oil or land would become the main source of wealth and power .
But even in 1996 it should have been obvious that this was silly .
First , for all the talk of an information economy , ultimately an economy must serve consumers -- and consumers do n't want information , they want tangible goods .
In particular , the billions of Third World families who finally began to have some purchasing power as the 20th century ended did not want to watch pretty graphics on the Internet -- they wanted to live in nice houses , drive cars , and eat meat .
Second , the Information Revolution of the late 20th century was -- as everyone should have realized -- a spectacular but only partial success .
Simple information processing became faster and cheaper than anyone had imagined possible ; but the once confident Artificial Intelligence movement went from defeat to defeat .
As Marvin Minsky , one of the movement 's founders , despairingly remarked , " What people vaguely call common sense is actually more intricate than most of the technical expertise we admire " .
And it takes common sense to deal with the physical world -- which is why , even at the end of the 21st century , there are still no robot plumbers .
Most important of all , the prophets of an " information economy " seem to have forgotten basic economics .
When something becomes abundant , it also becomes cheap .
A world awash in information will be a world in which information per se has very little market value .
And in general when the economy becomes extremely good at doing something , that activity becomes less rather than more important .
Late 20th - century America was supremely efficient at growing food ; that was why it had hardly any farmers .
Late 21st - century America is supremely efficient at processing routine information ; that is why the traditional white - collar worker has virtually disappeared from the scene .
With these observations as background , then , let us turn to the five great economic trends that observers in 1996 should have expected but did n't .
Soaring resource prices .
The first half of the 1990s was an era of extraordinarily low raw material prices .
Yet it is hard to see why anyone thought this situation would continue .
The Earth is , as a few lonely voices continued to insist , a finite planet ; when 2 billion Asians began to aspire to Western levels of consumption , it was inevitable that they would set off a scramble for limited supplies of minerals , fossil fuels , and even food .
In fact , there were some warning signs as early as 1996 .
There was a temporary surge in gasoline prices during the spring of that year , due to an unusually cold winter and miscalculations about Middle East oil supplies .
Although prices soon subsided , the episode should have reminded people that by the mid-90s the world = s industrial nations were once again as vulnerable to disruptions of oil supply as they had been in the early 1970s ; but the warning was ignored .
Quite soon , however , it became clear that natural resources , far from becoming irrelevant , had become more crucial than ever before .
In the 19th century great fortunes were made in industry ; in the late 20th they were made in technology ; but today 's super - rich are , more often than not , those who own prime land or mineral rights .
The environment as property .
In the 20th century people used some quaint expressions -- " free as air " , " spending money like water " -- as if such things as air and water were were available in unlimited supply .
But in a world where billions of people have enough money to buy cars , take vacations , and buy food in plastic packages , the limited carrying capacity of the environment has become perhaps the single most important constraint on the average standard of living .
By 1996 it was already clear that one way to cope with environmental limits was to use the market mechanism -- in effect to convert those limits into new forms of property rights .
A first step in this direction was taken in the early 1990s , when the U.S. government began allowing electric utilities to buy and sell rights to emit certain kinds of pollution ; the principle was extended in 1995 when the government began auctioning off rights to use the electromagnetic spectrum .
Today , of course , practically every activity with an adverse impact on the environment carries a hefty price tag .
It is hard to believe that as late as 1995 an ordinary family could fill up a Winnebago with dollar - a - gallon gasoline , then pay only $ 5 to drive it into Yosemite .
Today such a trip would cost about 15 times as much even after adjusting for inflation .
The economic consequences of the conversion of environmental limits into property were unexpected .
Once governments got serious about making people pay for the pollution and congestion they caused , the cost of environmental licenses became a major part of the cost of doing business .
Today license fees account for more than 30 percent of GDP .
And such fees have become the main source of government revenue ; after repeated reductions , the Federal income tax was finally abolished in 2043 .
The rebirth of the big city .
During the second half of the 20th century , the traditional densely populated , high - rise city seemed to be in unstoppable decline .
Modern telecommunications had eliminated much of the need for close physical proximity between routine office workers , leading more and more companies to shift their back - office operations from lower Manhattan and other central business districts to suburban office parks .
It began to seem as if cities as we knew them would vanish , replaced with an endless low - rise sprawl punctuated by an occasional cluster of 10 - story office towers .
But this proved to be a transitory phase .
For one thing , high gasoline prices and the cost of environmental permits made a one - person , one - car commuting pattern impractical .
Today the roads belong mainly to hordes of share - a- ride minivans , efficiently routed by a web of intercommunicating computers .
However , although this semi-mass - transit system works better than 20th - century commuters could have imagined -- and employs more than 4 million drivers -- suburban door - to - door transportation still takes considerably longer than it did when ordinary commuters and shoppers could afford to drive their own cars .
Moreover , the jobs that had temporarily flourished in the suburbs -- mainly relatively routine office work -- were precisely the jobs that were eliminated in vast numbers beginning in the mid-90s .
Some white - collar jobs migrated to low - wage countries ; others were taken over by computers .
The jobs that could not be shipped abroad or handled by machines were those that required the human touch -- that required face - to - face interaction , or close physical proximity between people working directly with physical materials .
In short , they were jobs best done in the middle of dense urban areas , areas served by what is still the most effective mass - transit system yet devised : the elevator .
Here again , there were straws in the wind .
At the beginning of the 1990s , there was much speculation about which region would become the center of the burgeoning multimedia industry .
Would it be Silicon Valley ?
Los Angeles ?
By 1996 the answer was clear ; the winner was ...
Manhattan , whose urban density favored the kind of close , face - to - face interaction that turned out to be essential .
Today , of course , Manhattan boasts almost as many 200 - story buildings as St. Petersburg or Bangalore .
The devaluation of higher education .
In the 1990s everyone believed that education was the key to economic success , for both individuals and nations .
A college degree , maybe even a postgraduate degree , was essential for anyone who wanted a good job as one of those " symbolic analysts " .
But computers are very good at analyzing symbols ; it 's the messiness of the real world they have trouble with .
Furthermore , symbols can be quite easily transmitted to Asmara or La Paz and analyzed there for a fraction of the cost of doing it in Boston .
So over the course of this century many of the jobs that used to require a college degree have been eliminated , while many of the rest can , it turns out , be done quite well by an intelligent person whether or not she has studied world literature .
This trend should have been obvious even in 1996 .
After all , even then America 's richest man was Bill Gates , a college dropout who did n't seem to need a lot of formal education to build the world 's most powerful information technology company .
Or consider the panic over " downsizing " that gripped America in 1996 .
As economists quickly pointed out , the rate at which Americans were losing jobs in the 90s was not especially high by historical standards .
Why , then , did downsizing suddenly become news ?
Because for the first time white - collar , college - educated workers were being fired in large numbers , even while skilled machinists and other blue - collar workers were in high demand .
This should have been a clear signal that the days of ever - rising wage premia for people with higher education were over , but somehow nobody noticed .
Eventually , of course , the eroding payoff to higher education created a crisis in the education industry itself .
Why should a student put herself through four years of college and several years of postgraduate work in order to acquire academic credentials with hardly any monetary value ?
These days jobs that require only six or twelve months of vocational training -- paranursing , carpentry , household maintenance ( a profession that has taken over much of the housework that used to be done by unpaid spouses ) , and so on -- pay nearly as much as one can expect to earn with a master 's degree , and more than one can expect to earn with a Ph.D. .
And so enrollment in colleges and universities has dropped almost two - thirds since its turn - of - the - century peak .
Many institutions of higher education could not survive this harsher environment .
The famous universities mostly did manage to cope , but only by changing their character and reverting to an older role .
Today a place like Harvard is , as it was in the 19th century , more of a social institution than a scholarly one -- a place for the children of the wealthy to refine their social graces and make friends with others of the same class .
The celebrity economy .
The last of this century 's great trends was noted by acute observers in 1996 , yet somehow most people failed to appreciate it .
Although business gurus were proclaiming the predominance of creativity and innovation over mere routine production , in fact the growing ease with which information could be transmitted and reproduced was making it ever harder for creators to profit from their creations .
Today , if you develop a marvelous piece of software , by tomorrow everyone will have downloaded a free copy from the Net .
If you record a magnificent concert , next week bootleg CDs will be selling in Shanghai .
If you produce a wonderful film , next month high - quality videos will be available in Mexico City .
How , then , can creativity be made to pay ?
The answer was already becoming apparent a century ago : creations must make money indirectly , by promoting sales of something else .
Just as auto companies used to sponsor Grand Prix racers to spice up the image of their cars , computer manufacturers now sponsor hotshot software designers to build brand recognition for their hardware .
And the same is true for individuals .
The royalties the Four Sopranos earn from their recordings are surprisingly small ; mainly the recordings serve as advertisements for their arena concerts .
The fans , of course , go to these concerts not to appreciate the music ( they can do that far better at home ) but for the experience of seeing their idols in person .
Technology forecaster Esther Dyson got it precisely right in 1996 : " Free copies of content are going to be what you use to establish your fame .
Then you go out and milk it " .
In short , instead of becoming a Knowledge Economy we have become a Celebrity Economy .
Luckily , the same technology that has made it impossible to capitalize directly on knowledge has also created many more opportunities for celebrity .
The 500 - channel world is a place of many subcultures , each with its own culture heroes ; there are people who will pay for the thrill of live encounters not only with divas but with journalists , poets , mathematicians , and even economists .
When Andy Warhol predicted a world in which everyone would be famous for 15 minutes , he was wrong : if there are indeed an astonishing number of people who have experienced celebrity , it is not because fame is fleeting but because there are many ways to be famous in a society that has become incredibly diverse .
Still , the celebrity economy has been hard on some people -- especially those of us with a scholarly bent .
A century ago it was actually possible to make a living as a more or less pure scholar : someone like myself would probably have earned a pretty good salary as a college professor , and been able to supplement that income with textbook royalties .
Today , however , teaching jobs are hard to find and pay a pittance in any case ; and nobody makes money by selling books .
If you want to devote yourself to scholarship , there are now only three options ( the same options that were available in the 19th century , before the rise of institutionalized academic research ) .
Like Charles Darwin , you can be born rich , and live off your inheritance .
Like Alfred Wallace , the less fortunate co-discoverer of evolution , you can make your living doing something else , and pursue research as a hobby .
Or , like many 19th - century scientists , you can try to cash in on scholarly reputation by going on the paid lecture circuit .
But celebrity , though more common than ever before , still does not come easily .
And that is why writing this article is such an opportunity .
I actually do n't mind my day job in the veterinary clinic , but I have always wanted to be a full - time economist ; an article like this might be just what I need to make my dream come true .
Paul Krugman is a ( full - time ) Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Plainfield , Vt .
It was strange to find in this economically stressed , rural region of Vermont , not far from the state capital of Montpelier , a good news story about health care .
Those who live in the area , no matter what their income , can get high - quality primary care , dental care , prescription drug services and mental health assistance at a price they can afford .
All they have to do is call or stop by the Health Center at Plainfield , which is part of a national network of centers that are officially ( and clumsily ) known as Federally Qualified Health Centers .
I was somewhat skeptical when Senator Bernie Sanders , an independent from Vermont , told me that these centers ( there are 39 sites of various size in the state ) had “ essentially solved the problem of primary care ” for local residents .
Politicians are in the business of making big claims .
Most of the time you do n’t hold it against them .
But you do n’t take the claims as gospel , either .
In this case , the senator ’s claim seems to be very much on the money .
The center at Plainfield is modern and well equipped , spotlessly clean , quiet and efficient .
Patients that I spoke with marveled at the friendliness of doctors and staffers and said they never felt intimidated .
Appointments are easily made , and if it is necessary to see a physician on the same day , or within 24 hours , that is usually not a problem .
Forced to lie for the MoD : Tormented spin doctor blows whistle on the deceptions fed to loved ones of fallen heroes
A civil servant has broken ranks to reveal how he was forced to lie about the war in Iraq and Afghanistan .
John Salisbury - Baker , 62 , was working in the Ministry of Defence when he says he was ordered to deliberately mislead bereaved families and the public .
He claims he was instructed to issue official statements through the media which were ' heavily spun ' and clearly at odds with the reality .
Traumatised : MoD Press Officer John Salisbury - Baker was forced to ' defend the morally indefensible ' says his partner , Christine Brooke ( right )
Mr Salisbury - Baker was caught up with the huge political storm that has raged for years over the inadequacy of equipment and the safety of the controversial Snatch Land Rover which has been blamed for a series of soldiers ' deaths .
Only when the contradictory evidence was overwhelming did the official line from the MoD change , he claims .
Under the Official Secrets
Act he is banned from speaking out for fear of prosecution and a possible jail sentence .
But yesterday his partner spoke of his mental anguish and accused the Government of treating the British public like ' fools ' .
' Morally indefensible ' :
The spin doctor was forced to tell the media that Snatch Land Rovers , which have been blamed for dozens of soldiers deaths , were safe
' He was expected to lie for the MoD , ' said Christine Brooke , 65 .
' It was part of his job and a burden he simply could n't bear .
John tried to speak up but was swimming against the tide . '
In his role as a press officer for the MoD he often came into contact with the families of those soldiers killed in action .
It was his duty to act as a ' media shield ' - to provide the space for the family to grieve in peace - and to help with the arrangements for repatriation and their funerals .
But in doing so he struggled to cope with the moral dilemma , having previously lied at the behest of the MoD .
Guilt : Mr Salisbury - Baker near his home in York
' He was plagued by the thought that some of them might have previously believed their loved ones were safe , because of what he himself had told the media , ' said Mrs Brooke .
' He felt responsible and guilty .
He felt he was having to defend the morally indefensible .
' The Snatch vehicles clearly did not give adequate protection from roadside bombs and yet here he was having to say they did . '
She added : ' John cannot find it in his heart to forgive himself , let alone expect others to forgive him and this has torn him apart . '
Mr Salisbury - Baker , whose stepson served in the Navy during the Falklands War , has since been diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder which he claims was brought on by the lies he was forced to peddle .
He joined the MoD in 1996 as an information officer .
By the time Britain invaded Iraq in 2003 he had been promoted to defence press officer , covering the Armed Services .
' Everything changed with Afghanistan and Iraq , ' said Mrs Brooke .
' Put bluntly , he was expected to lie until the evidence was incontrovertible .
These lies were centred around members of the Armed Forces being satisfactorily equipped to do their duty in Iraq and latterly Afghanistan .
' Sadly , most of the time they were ill - equipped to do their duty .
This meant that when John attended military funerals and spoke with the families , he felt that he was being frugal with the truth .
' He wanted to say that many fatal situations were needless and could have been avoided if the correct equipment was provided to the individuals . '
She said that when questions were first raised about troops being ill - equipped , Whitehall simply issued a statement denying any such thing .
It was only after the death of Sergeant Steve Roberts - the tank commander who was shot dead three days after being ordered to hand over his body armour to another unit because of shortages - that the official line was amended .
The truth was that the Government had delayed for five months before buying life - saving body armour for UK soldiers in Iraq .
' John would hear from journalists and families on many occasions that equipment was not adequate , ' said Mrs Brooke , a retired teacher .
' He was told there were shortcomings in the body armour and with the vehicles .
' But John would speak to superiors within the MoD , and they would again tell him that the equipment was adequate and again issue the same statement or amend it to say that new equipment was being ordered .
' When it came down to it , it was all about spin - never about the truth .
' It took a grieving widow fighting for justice or a soldier 's death before they would even consider telling the truth , or going some way towards it .
' Even then it was simply respun , packaged up and sent out . '
In 2006 , the MoD defended its use of the Snatch Land Rover in Afghanistan despite claims that it was wholly inadequate in protecting soldiers from roadside bombs .
Armed Forces Minister Bob Ainsworth - now Defence Secretary - said other vehicles were ' not suitable for the task they were doing in the area in which they were required to work ' .
Mr Salisbury - Baker was again relied upon to push the official line that the Snatch Land Rover was an incredibly useful vehicle for entering the narrow streets run by the Taliban .
It was only after the death of intelligence officer Corporal Sarah Bryant in a Snatch Land Rover in June last year that the MoD amended its official line , adding that it had ordered replacement vehicles .
Mrs Brooke said : ' John is an honest , sensitive and moral person , and he was having to peddle Government lies that soldiers in vehicles such as the Snatch Land Rovers were safe from roadside bombs , which made him very stressed indeed . '
He began to suffer from angina and has since been diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
He went on sick leave in August 2007 and is on half - pay .
He is now suing the MoD for disability discrimination , on the grounds that the stress of what he was being asked to do effectively made him disabled .
He will attend an employment tribunal later this year .
A spokesman for the MoD said : ' It would be inappropriate to comment when proceedings are pending . '

Stocking a bar is a difficult task .
Stocking a bar for $ 100 is even more difficult .
Let 's take a look at three different methods for gearing up your liquor cabinet for parties of various sizes on the cheap .

Note : Now is a good time to remind everyone of the dangers of alcohol .
College is definitely a time to make mistakes , but please — for the love of God — do so safely .
You do n't need to be a college student to invite 15 of your closest friends over for some drinks , but like it or not , alcohol is an integral part of most people 's college experience and good things ( like new friendships ) can come from it .
This is one of the more popular posts on HackCollege , and it 's also one of my favorite .

Limiting Factors :
Cost
Number of People
Length of Party
This is a lot of stuff .
Take everything with a ( margarita ) grain of salt and make changes as you see fit .
No party is exactly the same ; likewise no party has the same requirements .
And — depending on your state 's liquor laws , taxes , or store rip - off - ness — prices vary .
Building the Bare Bones Bar :
Before having a solid house party , you need a good foundation .
If you want a full - out bar , you 'll need all of these things , but pick and choose depending on the situation .

The essentials ( some of which you only buy once in a blue moon )
Tonic water
Sour mixes
Soda water
Ginger ale
Light cream
Lime juice
Grenadine
Triple sec
Stuff that you probably already have but need to get if you do n't
Milk
Water
Ice ( about a pound per person )
Salt
Nutmeg
Limes / lemons
Garnishes
Juices ( OJ , cranberry )
The essential liquor combos :
2 lights
2 darks
Vermouth
$ 100 Bar for a Cocktail Party ( 10 - 15 People ) :
With a cocktail clambake , quality of alcohol is key .
Dumping Monarch rum into a potentially delicious daiquiri is just plain unacceptable .
You wo n't be able to stock a bar with every alcohol you can imagine and still afford the mid-shelf liquors that any cocktail party needs .
We chose alcohols for covering your cocktail party drink bases , rather than providing the ability to make that obscure drink out of your friend 's iPhone drink mixing widget .
Gin and Tonics , not Sex on the Beach .
Advertisement
For a cocktail party with less than 15 people , you will need 4 to 5 fifths of booze .
For a well - rounded bar , we recommend :
First Priority - Spirits :
Vodka , 750 mL ( $ 14 -$ 19 ) : Smirnoff , SKYY or Finlandia
: Smirnoff , SKYY or Finlandia Rum , 750 mL ( $ 14 - $ 18 ) : Sailor Jerry's , Captain Morgan , Barcardi
: Sailor Jerry's , Captain Morgan , Barcardi Gin , 750 mL ( $ 15 - $ 23 ) : Seagram's , Beefeater or Bombay
: Seagram's , Beefeater or Bombay Whiskey , 200 ml ( $ 8 - $ 12 ) : Jack , Jim Bean , or Johnnie Walker
Second Priority - Beer and Wine :
Classy Beer , 12 pack ( $ 16 - $ 20 ) : New Castle , Guiness , or something along those lines
: New Castle , Guiness , or something along those lines Kickass Cheap Wine , ( $ 5 - $ 8/ bottle ) : See our interview with Gary Vaynerchuk of WineLibraryTV HackCollege Podcast Episode 18

The spirits here will equate to roughly 2.5 liters of 80 proof booze .
That 's 56 shots for those keeping track .
With the beer and wine , that means each person is getting the D.A.R.E. equivalent of 4 - 6 drinks per person depending on how many people attend .
The number of fifths bought can be increased if your fans are n't fans of beer .
Or if you refuse to serve gin , just balance everything out .
Remember though : you are n't building this bar for yourself , but for all of your attendees .

$ 100 Bar for a Soirée ( 30 People ) :
Unfortunately , this is tough .
You 'll be forced to skimp on quality to come in under budget .
So , do one thing and do it well .
You 'll want to choose 1 or 2 drinks that you 'll be serving and stick with those .
Long Islands are too complicated .
Instead , think Screwdriver or Slow Gin Fizz .
Plastic handles will be your best friend for the 30 - person soirée .
Here is an example :
White Russians
Our target here is 5 drinks per person .
Here 's your standard White Russian recipe :
2 shots vodka
1 shot coffee liqueur
1 - 3 oz . milk
Vodka tends to be much less expensive than coffee liqueur .
Once the party 's over , vodka is going to be much more flexible in mixing other drinks in the future .
But if you insist on drinking the Dude 's drink , go for it .
The results will be delicious .

A note : Kahlua is going to destroy your budget .
Side with another coffee liqueur .
We prefer Copa de Oro for our wallet - friendly White Russians .
$ 100 ingredients for White Russians :
2 handles Vodka ( $ 20 each )
1 handle Copa De Oro ( $ 17 )
2 gallons milk ( $8 )
Remainder on beer ( $ 35 ) ( perhaps the milky Guinness ? )
Mix your drinks right , serve in small Solo cups and you 've got yourself a soirée .

The 100 - Person Rager on a Budget :
Those who have left college need n't read on .
If you 're just going to get crazy for a night , you can't really have a budget — but you should know what you 're getting yourself into .
If you 're planning on having a rager with 100 people for about 6 hours , you 'll spend about $ 380 in the cheapest situation , given the breakdown below .
This allots each person a drunkness of 7 - 8 drinks .

2 kegs ( $ 100 - $ 140 a piece ) :
This is the mainstay of college drinking .
You 'd rather run out of liquor than beer .
: This is the mainstay of college drinking .
You 'd rather run out of liquor than beer .
9 handles , varying alcohols ( $ 15 - $ 20 per jug ) :
If you really want to class it up , you 'd get 19 fifths instead and vary your liquor brands even more .
If you 're too lazy to tend a bar , buy the same amount , and mix up some Jungle Juice .
: If you really want to class it up , you 'd get 19 fifths instead and vary your liquor brands even more .

5 standard box wines ( $ 9 - $ 12 per box ) :
This might offend some people , but it 'll only account for about an eighth of the budget / ham - boned - ness at your party .

I'VE COMMENTED ON EMAILS HERE before , mostly with an eye to exposing propaganda , but this one actually has quite a bit of merit .
According to the email ( I have n't checked , because it does n't really matter ) a reader wrote to the St. Petersburg Times with a suggestion for fixing the economy .
He said that since there are about 40 million people over fifty working in America , we should just give them each a million dollars , with a few strings attached .
They would have to retire , pay off their mortgage , and buy a new car .
He figured that this way we could create 40 million new jobs , solve the housing loan crisis , and save the auto industry all with a single program .
I think this idea has merit , and not just because I 'm over fifty .
It aims at the right target : the drop in demand .
But we can do even better .
My own suggestion , although it wo n't make me as rich , might have the benefit of bi-partisan support .
I suggest that we do two things :
We raise the minimum wage to the level at which it 's actually a decent living .
We give a tax credit to very small businesses for every employee they hire .
It would work something like this .
If you are a very small business , for the sake of argument say a schedule C business netting less than $ 100,000 a year , for every employee you have you get 75 % of the new , increased , minimum wage back as a non-refundable tax credit .
This is true even for employees you 're paying more than the minimum wage to .
You still have to pay into their social security , etc. , as you do now , and the the tax credit does n't cover those costs .
This credit decreases on a straight line as your net profit moves above $ 100,000 , until it completely disappears at some figure , say half a million .
If you 're making half a million in profit ( after paying out wages ) you can afford to pay your employees yourself .
The usual arguments against an increase in the minimum wage are that it 's unfair to small businesses , and that it increases unemployment by discouraging hiring .
The beauty of this approach is that it actually benefits small business — we could triple the minimum wage , and small businesses would still come out ahead .
At the same time , by giving a hiring incentive , it would decrease unemployment .
And it would save the government money , maybe even increase tax income , in the process .
Every one of those people who get hired by a small business which can now afford the help because of the tax credit is one more person who does n't end up on welfare or extended unemployment , costing the taxpayer money .
And every one of them will end up paying taxes on a good , living wage .
In addition , such a plan would probably end up pushing real wages even higher .
By increasing the demand for employees , and consequently decreasing the supply , market forces should push wages upward .
All of this would mean that those very workers could afford to buy houses , solving the housing crisis , pay their loans off , solving the banking crisis , and start spending money again , which would kick - start the economy .
It would also save many small business owners , who could now afford to buy houses , pay off their loans , and start spending , and even create new small business owners who would do the same .
It 's a no- brainer : a win - win - win .
Except , of course , I 'll miss the million .
At least , that 's what I think today .
I have written previously about the various attempts to reverse engineer the brain and to develop artificial intelligence ( AI ) .
This is an exciting area of research .
On the one hand researchers are trying to model the working of a mammalian brain , eventually a human brain , down to the tiniest detail .
On the other , researchers are also trying to build an AI – either in hardware or virtually in software .
In the middle are attempts at interfacing brains and computer chips .
Remember the monkeys who can move robot arms with their minds ?
All these efforts are synergistic – modeling the mammalian brain will help AI researchers build their AI , and building AI computers and applications can teach us about brain function .
The more we learn about both , the easier it will be to interface them .
However , it is very difficult to say how far away specific milestones and applications are on all these fronts .
Progress is steady and promising , but predicting the future is hard .
That has not stopped Henry Markram from predicting at the current TED Global Conference that we can have a virtual model of the human brain in 10 years .
“ It is not impossible to build a human brain and we can do it in 10 years , ” he said .
“ And if we do succeed , we will send a hologram to TED to talk . ”
I hope he ’s right – that would be a huge milestone .
Markram works on the Blue Brain project , and right now they have managed to build a virtual model of a rat cortical column .
This simulates about 10,000 neurons .
Markram says that each neuron requires the processing power of a laptop to model , so they use an IBM Bluegene machine which has 10,000 processors .
This is definitely not a desktop application .
And that ’s just one cortical column .
Modelling the entire brain would require 100 billion neurons – that gives you an idea of the processing power of the human brain .
That ’s 10 million supercomputers .
It seems to me that hardware is going to be the biggest limiting factor on Markram ’s prediction .
If we assume Moore ’s Law of doubling processor power every 18 months , then it will take 36 years for supercomputers to exceed the power of 100 billion neurons .
Of course , simulating virtual neurons requires much more processing power than building artifical neurons directly – building a massively parallel processor to duplicate a brain in hardware , rather than creating a virtual brain .
But that is also hard to predict because it requires the development of new hardware – not just software and information .
While I share Markram ’s enthusiasm for this technology , and his optimism that all the components will eventually come into place ( modeling the human brain and developing fast enough computers ) – 10 years seems to be pushing it .
I hope to be proven wrong .
This may be one of the most important decisions you will make at this time .
We are often asked this question – “ How do I choose the best lawyer for me ? ”
Basically , you can only go on reputation , referral , and trust .
This is what we suggest :
Talk to the lawyer .
Make sure that you feel comfortable with that person .
Make sure that you feel heard .
While a lawyer may not always agree with what you say , nor you agree with what the lawyer says , a lawyer should not act without your instructions , and you should be able to work with your lawyer to come to some mutual understanding and agreement of how you should proceed .
Ask about that lawyer .
Ask other lawyers about the lawyer you are considering , ask your family physician or counselors , ask friends who have been involved in similar situations or who know lawyers who practice in the field of Family Law .
Ultimately , all you can assess is whether you feel that you have a good working relationship with your lawyer .
Whether you feel that the lines of communication are open … and working .
And whether you feel understood … and represented .
The US and Russia today agreed a nuclear disarmament road map that would see them cut their arsenals by up to a third , in a preliminary agreement signed by Barack Obama during his Russia trip .
Pledging to reverse a " sense of drift " in Washington 's relations with Moscow , the US president said he hoped a new nuclear arms reduction treaty to replace the Start - 1 pact , which expires this December , would be ready by the end of the year .
" We must lead by example and that is what we are doing here today , " he said in Moscow .
Under terms of the outline deal the sides have agreed to reduce their nuclear stockpiles to between 1,500 - 1,675 warheads each and that strategic delivery systems – ballistic missiles , submarine - launched missiles and heavy bombers – be cut to between 500 and 1,100 .
But it was unclear today whether negotiations between the US and Russia would actually yield a new treaty – or whether both sides could bury their differences over the former 's missile defence plans .
The Kremlin has made it clear that a deal is impossible if the US administration goes ahead with its missile defence shield in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Obama said today that a review of that shield would be completed as early as this summer .
But he gave no indication whether he was willing to dump it – instead merely predicting that the diametrically opposed positions of the two nations on the shield " could be reconciled " .
Obama also insisted the purpose of the shield was to intercept missiles from Iran or North Korea or other states rather than from Russia .
But he conceded that convincing Moscow of this would be hard work .
" It 's going to take time to break down existing suspicions , " he noted .
Despite Obama 's pledge to reset " US - Russian relations " , there was little sense from today 's summit that the two sides had managed to overcome the hostility and suspicion that characterised relations between George Bush and Vladimir Putin .
Nor was there much of the sparkle that has accompanied previous summits between US and Russian leaders .
Asked whether he trusted Dmitry Medvedev , Obama responded by calling Russia 's president " straightforward and professional " .
But he also had problems pronouncing his Russian counterpart 's name – dubbing him on one occasion : " Mededev " – and appeared tired after the flight from Washington .
Analysts said the nuclear deal at the very least revived the notion of disarmament , which had been lost amid the hostilities of recent years , and was realistic .
" The negotiations are going to be tense , " said Paul Ingram , the executive director of the British American Security Information Council .
" The Russians will be playing hardball but the Americans know Moscow has a strong interest in getting a treaty signed .
Both sides have too much invested in reaching an agreement . "
Once the treaty is signed , the next question will be how much further the US and Russia have to go .
Obama has dedicated himself to a world free of nuclear weapons , but that remains a theoretical target .
Hovering in the gilded rooms of the Kremlin like an unwelcome ghost was Putin , whom Obama meets tomorrow for a brief working breakfast .
Asked whether he thought Putin or Medvedev ran Russia , Obama replied : " Medvedev is the president and Putin is the prime minister . "
Russia did offer one significant concession , agreeing to let the US fly troops and munitions across its airspace to provide an air corridor for its forces in Afghanistan .
The two sides also agreed to resume military co-operation , suspended following Russia 's invasion of Georgia last year .
Obama reaffirmed US support for Georgia 's " sovereignty and territorial integrity " .
There was no mention of Ukraine , whose admission to Nato Moscow ardently rejects along with that of Georgia's .
Keith Olbermann and Bill O’Reilly have been ordered to cease their long - running on - air “ feud , ” said Glenn Greenwald in Salon , according to a “ remarkable story ” in The New York Times .
Jeffrey Immelt , the chairman of General Electric ( which owns MSNBC ) , and News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch ( owner of Fox News ) had Charlie Rose mediate an end to the sniping , because it was bad for GE and News Corp .
That ’s “ nothing less than corporate censorship . ”
It sound more like the “ grown - ups ” at Fox and MSNBC finally putting an end to this “ silly feud , ” said Don Suber in the Charleston , W. Va. , Daily Mail .
“ Good call . ”
It was a “ great marketing tool ” for Olbermann , but GE did n’t need the “ bad publicity ” and News Corp. was wary of angering “ a major advertiser . ”
And you know what ?
“ Immelt and Rupert Murdoch are the bosses .
They sign the paychecks . ”
The real tragedy of NBC ’s cowardly promise to ease off on Fox , said Ryan Tate in Gawker , is that it ruins the rare reminder that “ corporate media did n’t have to be toothless or dull media . ”
The feud also made for surprisingly “ good journalism , ” with each host calling out the other side ’s falsehoods , mistakes , and “ tasteless moments . ”
Olbermann “ is n’t declaring peace , he ’s declaring cease - fire , ” said Aaron Barnhart in The Kansas City Star .
( Watch Olbermann 's explanation )
But even as a temporary detente , “ I ’m not buying it . ”
Show - business feuds are too good for business .
So no , “ the Billo - Keith feud is , like ‘ Grey ’s Anatomy , ’ on hiatus , and will return someday with new episodes .
And boy , I ca n’t wait for that . ”

From Chapter 9
“ Being a father and running a major corporation in his thirties was a serious challenge , and it required sacrifice and scheduling .
If he was in town , Bill was always home for breakfast and dinner .
Saturdays were the children ’s days .
He took them to see the ships and the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis or to watch boat races on the Potomac River . ”
The chapter continues , “ After dinner , Bill would retire to his den to work , but he had an open - door policy for the kids .
It was in that den that they received some of their most treasured encouragement and counsel .
“ He made us feel like we were the most important people in his life , ” Debbie said [ Bill Marriott ’s daughter ] .
[ Debbie ] remembered only one fight her parents had .
“ It was over a piece of banana cake .
I was eight .
Ten hours a day he ’d work , and then bring four or five hours of paperwork home .
He was so busy that night he would n’t come back to the table for dessert .
Mom was upset .
She got her bags out ; she was going home to her mother .
“ Dad started to laugh .
I thought it was the end of the world .
[ Then ] he put his arms around her and told her he loved her . ”
As we enter the precious holiday season , let ’s all take time to pause and cherish our family and friends .
I ’m Bill Marriott and thanks for helping me keep Marriott on the move .

: XCB developers also hang out on IRC , and have occasional meetings .
Of course , there 's still a lot to do .
Documentation
The XCB API is documented .
There is also a tutorial and some random notes .
People wanting to implement higher level applications can use xcb-util .
XCB is built atop an XML description of the X core protocol and common extension protocols called XML / XCB .
This protocol can be used in other interesting ways .
Documentation of the X Window System protocol is also available at X.org 's website , and can be used in combination with XCB documentation as XCB functions largely reflect the protocol .
To aid in porting applications , you can configure Xlib to use XCB for the transport layer .
We call this Xlib / XCB .
There is automatically - generated documentation for the XCB protocol bindings .
The Windows ( 32 bit ) port of XCB will be merged into the main code base soon .

" I never really notice whether things have got an apostrophe in them or not and I 'm not really sure what the rules are about their use , " she confessed , conceding that with a Grade B in GCSE English language and literature she ought to know better .

BBC News education reporter
MPs say degree standards must be made more consistent Universities in England are failing to safeguard degree standards , according to a damning report from MPs .
The current system for ensuring quality is " out of date and should be replaced " , the Commons universities select committee concluded .
" Inconsistency in standards is rife , " said committee chairman , Phil Willis .
Universities UK attacked the report as " ill - thought through " and rejected the accusation that university leaders were " defensive and complacent " .
The hard - hitting report calls for urgent action to improve how universities safeguard the quality of degrees .
It describes as " absurd and disreputable " the claim that the growing demand for courses , including from overseas students , is proof that university standards are being maintained .
' Unacceptable '
The cross-party committee attacks university leaders for failing to " give a straightforward answer to the simple question of whether first class honours degrees achieved at different universities indicate the same or different intellectual standards " .
REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS
Consistent degree standards required across all universities Independent standards watchdog needed Accreditation checks every 10 years Better protection for whistleblowers National bursary system More support for mature and part - time students
Oxford or Oxford Brookes : MPs compare degrees
And the MPs question why universities have failed to explain the rapid increase in the number of top grade degrees being awarded .
To protect the " integrity " of degrees , the committee calls for a radical overhaul of the current watchdog , the Quality Assurance Agency , replacing it with an independent body charged with maintaining academic standards .
The report casts doubt on the reliability of self - regulation by universities and calls for tighter rules for external examiners and a way of comparing standards in different institutions .
" We are extremely concerned that inconsistency in standards is rife and there is a reluctance to address this issue , " said Mr Willis , chair of the Commons Innovation , Universities , Science and Skills Committee .
The report says it is " unacceptable " for higher education to receive £ 15bn in taxpayers ' funding " but be unable to answer a straightforward question about the relative standards of the degrees of the students " .
As an example , the report says that there was no clear answer to MPs ' attempts to find the answer to whether an upper second history degree from Oxford University and Oxford Brookes were equivalent .
Bursaries
Where whistleblowers have revealed worries about degree standards , the committee says they must be given better protection .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme MPs also recommend a national system of bursaries to support students , removing differences in the amounts offered by individual institutions .
This proposal for a national bursary has been supported by the National Union of Students and the Million + group of new universities .
NUS president , Wes Streeting , also welcomed the questions raised about value for money from degree courses .
" Tuition fees in England were trebled in 2006 , but students have not seen a demonstrable improvement in the quality of their experience .
" We find it astonishing that universities continue to demand ever higher fees without showing how they make a difference to the people who pay them , " said Mr Streeting .
But university leaders have rejected the criticism levelled at the higher education sector .
' Outburst '
" We are rather dismayed and surprised by this outburst , " said Wendy Piatt of the Russell Group of leading universities .
" Universities are not schools .
An essential feature of a university is its academic freedom and autonomy , with the responsibility to award degrees and uphold standards , " she said .
Diana Warwick , head of Universities UK , said : " We reject the suggestion that the way to improve the system that protects standards is to create some super - quango or Ofsted - style Quality and Standards Agency .
This seems to us a sledgehammer to crack a nut . "
But Paul Wellings , chair of the research - intensive 1994 Group of universities , emphasised the need for maintaining quality across a diverse higher education sector .
The QAA watchdog , which the MPs want to replace , warns that " care needs to be taken that we do not put at risk the benefits of a diverse and flexible higher education system " .
The report has also been challenged by Lord Mandelson , Secretary of State for Business , Innovation and Skills .
" I do n't recognise the committee 's description of our higher education sector , which is in fact world class and second only to the USA as a top destination for overseas students , " said Lord Mandelson .
The Conservatives ' university spokesman , David Willetts , said the report was a " refreshingly frank assessment of where things stand " .

An NYPD cop was busted yesterday , just hours before he planned to retrieve nearly $ 1 million for a drug dealer who had stashed it in a Manhattan apartment before being deported to the Dominican Republic , authorities charged yesterday
Shawn Jenkins , 41 , a 15 - year veteran who was assigned to the 23rd Precinct in East Harlem as a highway safety officer , allegedly was ordered to give the dealer ’s mother $ 500,000 of the drug money .
The officer had once been the dealer ’s bodyguard , according to a federal complaint ,
Jenkins was arrested at 3:45 a.m. yesterday at the Washington Heights apartment after a man he thought would be his accomplice turned out to be an informant and caught him on tape Tuesday saying his scheme was on for later that night , the feds said .
Bail was set at $ 200,000 at his arraignment in Manhattan federal court .
According to the complaint , Jenkins had a hand - scrawled floor plan supplied by the dealer .
" Four pm is the time which all the polling stations will be closed but if someone is there they will have the right , up to 4 or 5 o'clock , to give their vote , " said electoral commission spokesman Noor Mohammad Noor

“ It ’s about time ! ”
“ Did n’t you already do that ? ”
“ It ’s not broken , so why fix it ? ”
When Mozillians hear that we ’re updating the Mozilla brand identity , they respond with enthusiasm , impatience and confusion in equal measure .
A brand identity – logo , tone , tagline , typeface – is n’t something to be trifled with , especially with a brand as well respected as Mozilla .
Here ’s what ’s happening .
Back in late 2014 , the creative team began working on a new look for Mozilla , a so - called living logo .
The graphic heartbeat of this logo came from real - time data about our engagement with the world .
Having a brand identity that reflected the daily number of Bugzilla requests , Mozilla contributors , and Firefox users , for instance , was a brilliant idea .
Except that , in the end , it could n’t be made to work .
Chalk that experience up to good learning .
Fast forward to today .
As you heard Chris say onstage in Orlando , our mission and vision are now clearer and stronger than before .
We ’ve built a new brand position for Mozilla : being a true personal advocate for online life .
We promise to advocate for people both within their online experience and on their behalf for the health of the Internet .
From that solid foundation , we ’re ready to explore how our brand will look and sound in the world , reinforcing what we believe and what we can deliver .
A 2016 goal for Mozilla is to Grow Our Influence in the world , and a new identity will make it easier .
Why are we doing this now ?
Brands need to evolve to stay relevant .
Introducing a refreshed identity will be a milestone for Mozilla , will provide a new badge of belonging to our movement , and will help tell the world what we stand for .
When more people grok our mission , they will want to walk shoulder to shoulder with us and contribute more .
Yes !
The need for a new Mozilla identity is also long overdue ( see posts below ) .
The word “ Mozilla ” and a handful of muted colors are no match for modern communication .
Lacking an icon to represent our brand in social media , for instance , we have shown up as a heart , a whimsical unicorn , and even a famous candy .
( Mozilla melts in your mouth , not in your hands ? )
Our whole organization , especially our Mozilla global communities , is eager for direction and a bigger toolkit of creative assets .
Like everything at Mozilla , this will be open source , including :
An invitation to contribute .
If you have an idea for what the Mozilla brand identity should look like , please write to me , send me a sketch or shoot a video .
We ’ll formalize design challenges through our Community Design github repo as well .
A Brand Advisory Group .
Made up of a cross-section of Mozillians , this group will bring different viewpoints and expertise to the table as we review our work in progress .
Access to working documents .
Those who are interested and disclosed will be invited to view strategy , positioning , and briefing docs not available publicly .
An opportunity to geek out on branding stuff on the Engagement # Projects / 2016 _Brand_Identity_Initiative on the Mozilla wiki .
What ’s next ?
We ’re now selecting an agency partner for this work .
Following a few rounds of creative review ( highlights posted here ) , we hope to have a new Mozilla identity defined and ready to share later this year .
Oh , and we ’re also starting to think about the Firefox identity .
But that will have to wait for our next post .
Meanwhile , the comments box awaits your cursor .

The only other thing that hit me was that Sinclair said BO was not circumcised .
When my son was born in a hospital that was done as a matter of routine without even consulting us .
Would the same be for Hawaii ?
OTOH
People born at home or in some other cultures are not circumcised .
thecodont :
A relative of mine was born ( in a hospital ) a couple of years after BO 's alleged birth date .
He was circumcised also ( as a matter of routine , not according to any family request ) .
afraidfortherepublic :
My son was born in June of 1961 in a hospital in CA , and the nurses released us because of miscommunication in a day and a half before the circumcision was done .
We had to go back to the doctor ’s office to have it done a week later , and the doctor was NOT HAPPY .
My second son was born in the same hospital 4 years later .
I do n’t remember them asking me about it .
Routine procedure for little boys .

Wish we had someone to make a phone call to the hospitols in HI and ask if they routinely do circumcism and when that practice started .

General Fusion 's reactor design consists of 220 pistons that simultaneously ram a metal sphere .
This creates a shock wave inside the sphere , so that plasma rings in the center create a fusion reaction .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Currently , most nuclear fusion power plants are large , expensive projects that will take decades to benefit from .
But a startup company in Vancouver , Canada , called General Fusion is taking the fast track to fusion , with a plan to build a working prototype fusion power plant within the next decade at a cost of less than a billion dollars .
General Fusion has recently raised enough financial support - $ 13.5 million - from public and private investors to start the project .
Rather than using expensive superconducting magnets ( tokamaks ) like the $ 14 - billion ITER project in France or powerful lasers like those used by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US , General Fusion plans to try a relatively low - tech approach called magnetized target fusion .
The reactor consists of a metal sphere with a diameter of three meters .
Inside the sphere , a liquid mixture of lithium and lead spins to create a vortex with a vertical cavity in the center .
Then , the researchers inject two donut - shaped plasma rings called spheromaks into the top and bottom of the vertical cavity - like " blowing smoke rings at each other , " explains Doug Richardson , chief executive of General Fusion .
The last step is mainly well - timed brute mechanical force .
220 pneumatically controlled pistons on the outer surface of the sphere are programmed to simultaneously ram the surface of the sphere one time per second .
This force sends an acoustic wave through the spinning liquid that becomes a shock wave when it reaches the spheromaks in the center , triggering a fusion burst .
Specifically , the plasma's hydrogen isotopes - deuterium and tritium - fuse into helium , releasing neutrons that are trapped by the lithium and lead mixture .
The neutrons cause the liquid to heat up , and the heat is extracted through a heat exchanger .
Part of the resulting heat is used to make steam to spin a turbine for power generation , while the rest goes back to recharge the pistons .
The biggest challenge with the design will likely be showing that the technique actually works ; no one has ever demonstrated that spheromaks can be compressed enough - while maintaining their donut shape - to create fusion .
The design also takes advantage of digital control technologies that have only recently been developed , which are required to ensure that all 220 pistons strike the sphere at once .
General Fusion has just started developing simulations of the project , and hopes to build a test reactor and demonstrate net gain within five years .
If everything goes according to plan , they will then build a 100 - megawatt prototype reactor to be finished five years after that , which would cost an estimated $ 500 million .
According to fusion experts interviewed in MIT Technology Review , the design will likely face many challenges , but the idea is scientifically sound .
As Ken Fowler , professor emeritus of nuclear engineering and plasma physics at the University of California , Berkeley , explained , the culture of a private startup might enable the process to proceed more quickly , with less worry about potential risks .

Very inspirational man , and bless by God , IMO .-------------------------------------------------------------Nick Vujicic ( born December 4 , 1982 ) is a preacher , a motivational speaker and the director of Life Without Limbs , an organization for the physically disabled .
He regularly gives speeches across the world on the subject of disability and hope .
Many of those opposed were also at the Denver event .
And as it turns out , many of those opposed had driven up from Colorado Springs and other places outside the 7th Congressional District , and they were incensed that Rep.
Perlmutter did n't represent them -- even though , in fact , he does not represent them .
The opponents were typically outlandish in their claims about supposed " death panels " and " socialism , " any typically disruptive by clogging the line of people waiting to meet with Ed even though they knew they would be turned away since they do n't live in the district .
And while in line , they screamed like idiots , revealing their true intent -- to disrupt , to insult , and to debase a discussion on a critically important issue .
On the whole , the event went well considering , but for me the ugliness that infused the actual event was trumped by what I encountered as I was leaving the event .
When I got to my car , I found that it had been trashed :
The best I can tell , the damage was done mostly by kicking , though it 's clear the hood damage was done with someone 's fist .
There 's a smudged , greasy fist print right in the dent .
My understanding is that there is surveillance footage from several cameras , and the Brighton Police are going through it to find the perpetrators .
I have every reason to believe that it is one of the more animated opponents of healthcare reform who perpetrated this .
You can see why near the end of the video .
My car is seven years old .
It cost $ 12,000 when it was new .
If it were a run -of - the - mill vandal , they would have targeted something of higher value , of which there were several nearby ( including a gorgeous 1954 Chevrolet sedan ) .
And they would n't have punched the hood with their fist .
That 's an act of rage , not random vandalism .
And while I agree that it's too far a leap to associate all opponents of the healthcare reform with this kind of act , it is only opponents who are engaging in this kind of disruptive behavior , overheated rhetoric , and violent behavior .
The people egging them on -- Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh , and others -- need to stop it .
It 's gone way too far .

Former Labor secretary Robert Reich says action needs to be taken to ensure there is a public option .
Reich calls for ' march on Washington '
Robert Reich , the former Labor secretary , scholar and commentator , called Tuesday for a “ march on Washington ” on Sept. 13 — “ Grandparents Day ” — in support of a health care bill that offers a public option .
While he said organizing was not his strength , he would be prepared to assist .
“ If enough people feel that ’s the best way for their voices to be heard , and ca n’t be heard in any other way , then we march , ” Reich said in a reader question - and - answer session in POLITICO ’s Arena .

A group of conservatives have already announced a “ tea party ” movement march on Washington for Sept. 12 .
An opposing march the next day , if one were to materialize , could make for an interesting weekend .
Reich ’s suggested march is the latest manifestation of liberal anger about signs that the Obama administration may be willing to live without a public option if it means a health care bill can become law .
“ Very few things happen in Washington that are in the public 's interest when corporations have huge financial stakes in the game , as they obviously do with health care — unless the public is actively involved , engaged and organized , ” Reich wrote .
“ We wo n't get a public option , or anything close to it , unless people who feel strongly about it make a racket . ”
The “ first step is to be very loud and very vocal : Write , phone , e-mail , your congressional delegation and the White House .
Second step :
Get others to do the same .
Third step :
Get voters in Montana , North Dakota , Nebraska , and other states where Blue Dog Dems and wavering Senate Dems live , and have them make a hell of a fuss .
Fourth step : March on Washington . ”
He suggested the morning of Sept. 13 because “ that 's a Sunday , and it's also Grandparents Day .
I 've just become a grandparent , and I 'm worried as hell about the kind of world my little granddaughter is inheriting . “

Yesterday an applicant from China came to my office and introduced herself to me as Runxiao ( " Moist Dawn " ) .
However , in previous correspondence , she had always referred to herself as Layn ( a variant of Lane ; other variants of the name Lane are : Laen , Laene , Lain , Laine , Laney , Lanie , Layn , Layne , and Laynne ( " living near a lane " ; " descendant of Laighean or Luan " in Gaelic ) — so say the name books .
When I asked her which name she preferred , she said , " You can call me Runxiao . "
" But what about Layn ? " I asked .
" Did n't you used to go by the name Layn ? "
" Oh , yes ! " she replied cheerfully with a gleaming smile .
" When I was in China , I called myself Layn , but now that I 'm in America , I call myself Runxiao . "
" Is n't that a bit unusual ? " I queried .
" You call yourself by your English name in China and call yourself by your Chinese name in America ? "
" All my friends do that , " she answered merrily .
" We all take English names in China , but we feel better using our Chinese names in America .
Of course , Americans can't pronounce ' Runxiao , ' so I tell them just to call me Run .
Now I 'm Runxiao to my Chinese friends in America , Run to everybody else in America , and Layn to my old associates in China . "
This strikes me as completely counterintuitive .
However , since the practice is so widespread , there must be some compelling psychological reason for it .
Here are just a few of the Chinese students and friends I know who went by Western names in China or Taiwan , but have switched to Chinese names in America :
China / TW America
Sophie –> Xiaofei
Tess –>
Lei ( her American graduate school is trying to make her use this , but she prefers to remain Tess )
Shelly –> Xiaolei
David –>
Dawei
Mary –>
Mali
Löwen –> Li-wen
Peter ( not Petra ! ) –>
Li-ching ( " Li " to her American friends )
Gianni –> Xiang
Naturally , they had the Chinese names first when they were young ( given to them by their parents ) , but for one reason or another had decided to go by a Western name when they got older .
Given the large flap over North Texas State Representative Betty Brown 's complaint about the difficulty of pronouncing Asian names ( “ Rather than everyone here having to learn Chinese — I understand it ’s a rather difficult language — do you think that it would behoove you and your citizens to adopt a name that we could deal with more readily here ? ” ) [ see the comment by Lance to this blog ] , one might think that some of the arrows would be turned in the opposite direction .
Perhaps it is precisely because progressive Americans want Chinese to feel comfortable using their original names that they actually do decide to resurrect them after they come to America .
Indeed , I have often encountered situations where a Chinese student comes to America with a Western name he / she has used for many years and feels comfortable with , even proud of , only to be told by a well - meaning American that it sounds " silly " or " odd " for a Chinese to have a Western name .
Nearly all Americans I know who go to China to stay for more than a few months take Chinese names .
This is especially true of those who speak one of the Chinese languages .
For example , my Chinese name is Mei Weiheng and my brother Denis ' name is Mei Danli .
When I am in China , I become Mei Weiheng , and nobody calls me Victor Mair there .
Similarly , in China Ed Shaughnessy is Xia Hanyi , William Baxter is Bai Yiping , Jerry Norman is Luo Jierui , and so forth .
Not only do we take Chinese given ( personal ) names , we also adopt Chinese surnames , whereas Chinese ( whether in China or in the West ) maintain their Chinese surname , regardless of whether they go by a Western given ( first , personal ) name or by a Chinese given name .

Late yesterday the Senate overwhelming passed the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes
Act by a margin of 63 - 28 , despite objections from many Republicans , including former presidential nominee Senator John McCain .
The legislation passed as an amendment to what many consider a must - pass Department of Defense authorization bill .
And therein lies the rub .
While President Obama supports hate crimes legislation , he may veto the bill because of wasteful spending .
… Obama has told Congress he will veto the defense bill if it includes more money for an F - 22 fighter program he is trying to terminate .
The House in April passed a similar hate crimes bill , but did it as independent legislation not tied to a larger bill .
Five Republicans voted for it , zero Democrats voted against it .

Grab a Coffee and Pet a Rabbit at Japan 's Usagi - to - Cafe
The owners of Japan ’s Usagi - to - Cafe ( “ The Rabbit and Cafe ” ) know there ’s nothing like starting and ending a day with a good round of rabbit caressing .
When patrons visit for a coffee or light snack , they also get the opportunity to pet one of the shop ’s 18 “ staff bunnies . ”
At almost a dollar a minute , the cafe ’s bunny - petting is n’t cheap , but the animal - loving patrons do n’t mind .
As pets are banned in many Japanese apartments , the Usagi - to - Cafe – much like the Cat Cafe Calico covered by Trend Hunter back in April – meets a basic , primal need : playing , cuddling , and caressing a furry creature .
This is probably why the shop is packed on weekends .
The Usagi - to - Cafe also offers a BYOB policy , in which rabbit - owners can bring their own pets for bunny socialization .
This presumably lets house bunnies mix and mingle with other bunnies and learn the necessary social skills they need to survive in the real world .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama appealed Wednesday to faith - based groups to help garner support for his plan to overhaul the nation 's health care system .
President Obama speaks at the White House Wednesday .
" I need you to knock on doors , talk to neighbors , spread the facts and speak the truth , " he told religious leaders and reporters on a conference call that was streamed over the Web at faithforhealth.org .
" This debate over health care goes to the heart of who we are as a people , " he said .
" I believe that nobody in America should be denied basic health care because he or she lacks health insurance . "
Some 140,000 people participated in the call , the coalition of more than 30 faith - based groups that organized the event said in a written statement .
Obama urged the listeners to reject misinformation about his plans , noting , " There are some folks out there who are , frankly , bearing false witness . "
He referred to some assertions as " ludicrous , " and cited as an example rumors that the government is planning to set up " death panels " to determine the fate of the nation 's elderly .
" That is just an extraordinary lie , " he said , adding that it was based on a provision in the House legislation that would allow Medicare to reimburse someone who voluntarily sought counseling on how to set up a living will for the end of life .
" It gives an option that people who can afford fancy lawyers already experience , " the Harvard - trained lawyer said .
In addition , the plan does not provide health insurance to illegal aliens , it does not represent a government takeover of health care and it would not lead to government funding of abortion , he said .
" These are all fabrications that have been put out there in order to discourage people from meeting what I consider to be a core ethical and moral obligation : that is , that we look out for one another ; that is , I am my brother 's keeper , I am my sister 's keeper .
And in the wealthiest nation in the world right now we are neglecting to live up to that call . "
Watch a discussion of the emotion and rhetoric of some town hall meetings »
Obama , who took no questions , said the opposition was no surprise .
" Throughout history , whenever we have sought to change this country for the better , there have always been those who wanted to preserve the status quo , " he said .
" These always boil down to a contest between hope and fear . "
Prior to the call , Obama 's director of domestic policy , Melody Barnes , said the president still believes that including a public option is the best way to achieve low - cost , affordable health care .
The public option has been a sticking point among some Republicans , who consider it to be the camel 's nose under the tent of government - run health care .
But , she added , " he also said he 's open to other ideas . "

Consider the following health insurance plan .
It refuses to pay for certain medical care and then does n’t offer a clear explanation .
It does pay for unhelpful care that ends up raising premiums .
Its customer service can be hard to reach or unhelpful .
And the people who are covered by this insurer have no choice but to remain with it  or , at best , to choose from one or two other insurers that are about as bad .
In all likelihood , I have just described your insurance plan .
Health insurers often act like monopolies  like a cable company or the Department of Motor Vehicles  because they resemble monopolies .
Consumers , instead of being able to choose freely among insurers , are restricted to the plans their employer offers .
So insurers are spared the rigors of true competition , and they end up with high costs and spotty service .
Americans give lower marks to their health insurer than they do to their life insurer , their auto insurer or their bank , according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index .
Even the Postal Service gets better marks .
( Cable companies , however , get worse ones . )
No wonder President Obama ’s favorite villain is health insurers .
You might think , then , that a central goal of health reform would be to offer people more choice .
But it is n’t .

If Phishing is a new term to you then please read this post .
Wikipedia will tell you that “ phishing is the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames , passwords and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication . ”
Often it may look like a message from your bank , or it could be Paypal or eBay .
The phisher does not know whether you really have an account , but tries everyone in the hope that some may fall from it .
Here is one of the best phishing exploits I have seen .
I have now twice received a message apparently from Google within the past three days that read as follows :
When you click on the link , then you see the familiar Google Gmail Welcome page .
Except that this is not the regular Google page .
If you look up at the address field , you will find the URL is on the domain , .
Checking
WhoIs for this page you will find that the administrative contact is the following person .
Undoubtedly if I had keyed in my Gmail username and password , that gentleman would have had access to my Gmail account and could do whatever he wished with it .
Needless to say I immediately changed the password , in case he had already been there .
This is a particularly difficult one to spot , so it is important to be extra vigilant .
Google has some good information about Messages asking for personal information .
It also provides more detailed information about Suspicious results and strange behavior : Phishing attacks in other words .
You can forward such phishing Gmail messages to phishing@google.com and can send the Phishing URL to the Google Phishing team using their Phishing Report .
Google also provides a link to Stopbadware.org , where you can learn more about malware that can infect your computer .
Some phishing attacks are not too difficult to spot , often including spelling mistakes and somewhat curious links .
This particular current Gmail phishing incident is highly professional and the only clue is that URL address when you click on the apparent Google link .
Please spread the word rapidly .
If you are on Twitter , then please ReTweet the message below .
Pl.RT : Important Alert : Latest Gmail phishing exploit is very tough to spot : http://su.pr/5SFqGS
: pass it on .
Undoubtedly many people will be taken in .
Maybe we should add this to the long list of
Chuck Norris
super human facts :
When candidates for Alabama governor go to sleep at night they do n't check their closet for the boogeyman , they check it for Chuck Norris .
Or at least maybe they will now after the martial arts star , excise equipment pitchman and cultural phenomenon endorsed Roy Moore for Alabama governor this morning .
In a statement announcing Norris ' endorsement , the Moore campaign pointed out that in addition to their shared conservative values , Moore and Norris share a bond as martial arts fans .
Norris rose to notoriety in a string of action movies in the 1980s that featured his martial arts skills and later in the long - running television show Walker Texas Ranger where the weapon of choice in most episodes was a punch or a high leg kick rather than a gun .
Like Norris , Moore at one point made a living with his feet and legs as a kick - boxer in both the United States and Australia .
In endorsing Moore , who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor in next year 's June primary , Norris called Moore the strongest , best qualified candidate in the race and the candidate best qualified to lead the state forward in the difficult times ahead .
In 2008 Norris endorsed then - GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and his appearances with the former Arkansas governor at campaign stops and on television became features of the Huckabee campaign .
The " birthers " may have just jumped the shark , said Jimmy Orr in The Christian Science Monitor .
Orly Taitz , " a longtime chieftain of the birther posse ( and a dentist ) , " imploded during an MSNBC appearance Monday , ( watch Orly Taitz on MSNBC ) accusing anchor David Shuster of being one of President Obama 's " Brownshirts " in the media .
And all Shuster did was ask perfectly legitimate questions about why Obama 's mother would have lied and put birth announcements in Hawaiian newspapers if he had really been born in Kenya .
The Orly Taitz vs. David Shuster shouting match was " a video testament to the buffoonery of both sides , " said Allahpundit in Hot Air .
" Taitz was on to promote a Kenyan birth certificate for Obama that was debunked within about 10 minutes after it hit the web . "
MSNBC was out to " humiliate her " by exposing the document 's flaws , " except that they , er , forgot to ask her about it .
Good stuff . "
A lot of people are melting down over the question of President Obama 's birthplace , said Steve Zorn in the Chicago Tribune .
Last week , Survey 2000 reported that 28 percent of Republicans surveyed did n't believe that Obama was born in the U.S. , which would make him ineligible to be president .
There are plenty of nutty Democrats out there , but the size and imperviousness to facts of the GOP 's " crazy caucus " is a sign of a " party in crippling , delusional disarray . "
Inspired
by the ideas of 18th century Latin American independence hero Simon Bolivar ,
Venezuela 's Bolivarian revolution , led by President Hugo Chavez , has been
shaking up Latin America and the world over the past decade in its struggle for
independence from United States imperialism and for an alternative to rapacious
neo-liberal capitalism .
In 2005 ,
Chavez declared the aim of the revolution was to build socialism of the 21st
century .
This new kind of socialism , he said , would be a " humane socialism ' '
and emphasise democratic participation .
Direct
democracy and popular participation has certainly flourished in Venezuela , expressed
in a range of organising forms including urban land committees , health
committees , grassroots assemblies , workers ' councils and communal councils .
However , many of these developing bodies remain localised or disconnected from
each other , and often come into conflict with the traditional structures of the
capitalist state .
A new but
developing initiative that aims to connect and extend popular participation in
the struggle towards a new political and economic system is the formation of " socialist
communes . "
Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network member Kiraz Janicke , who is
currently living in Venezuela , spoke to Daniel Sanchez , a leader of the Rebirth
of the South Commune in the city of Valencia , about how the development of " people's
power '' is transforming Venezuela .
Daniel
Sanchez and Yoly Fernandez will be addressing public forums around Australia in
their " People 's power speaking tour " during August and September .
See the
accompanying advertisement for details .
The idea of the commune
The
formation of the communes in Venezuela comes from a proposal by President
Chavez , Sanchez explained .
" We know that the idea of the commune is not new ;
communes have existed in the past and exist in various countries today , " he
added , pointing to examples such as the Paris Commune in 1871 and forms of
organising by indigenous communities in Latin America .
" But in
Venezuela , we are not copying other models .
Our model is constructed by
ourselves , by the people themselves , by the grassroots organisations
themselves , in the specific geographic territories where the commune experience
is being developed . "
The
emphasis on experimentation is a key feature of the Bolivarian revolution ,
perhaps best encapsulated in an often quoted phrase by Bolivar 's teacher Simon
Rodriguez : " We invent , or we err . "
Sanchez explained that there is no blueprint
for building the communes : " Up until now we have been experimenting . "
" We are
part of a national network of communes that we have been developing over the
past two years in collaboration with the Ministry of Participation and Social
Development .
Now , a new Ministry of Communes has been created and together with
both ministries we are developing a network of 17 communes nationally . "
Commenting
on the relationship between the communes and the traditional state structures ,
Sanchez said , " There is a direct relationship with the national executive , but
we are working at the grassroots level to make sure that this relationship is
not one of imposition and control , and that there is a harmonious relationship
of working together . "
A key
aspect of this relationship between the popular and communal organisations and
the government , he said , is to facilitate the search for solutions to community
issues , such as housing , transport , crime , poverty and other social problems .
Communes
in urban zones present different challenges to those being built in the
countryside , Sanchez explained .
" Most of the experiences [ of communes ] are in
the countryside .
I work in an urban zone , in Valencia , Carabobo [ state ] , one of
the most important cities in the country , and in one of the poorest parishes in
the country , Miguel Pena parish . "
One of the
most important challenges in the debate about how to build the communes " is to
make sure the people are incorporated - the popular organisations , the cultural
organisations , and the revolutionary organisations and parties , " he said .
There is no
exact number of communal councils or organisations that form a commune .
Rather ,
Sanchez said , an ongoing discussion is needed about the " best mechanisms to
integrate all the different organisations in the same geographical area , and
the best structure for the people to govern themselves in a commune .
The
structure of the communes is fundamentally a socio-political question , which ,
of course , has to do with empowering the social bases . "
Another
important aspect of the communes , Sanchez said , is " to achieve the equitable
distribution of resources .
As President Chavez explained , the ownership of the
means of production has to be in the hands of the commune . "
" We want
to show the world what this socialism we are talking about really is , " Sanchez
declared .
" We are putting it into practice , designing our own forms of communal
government , advancing in our own project so that everyone can participate in
transforming the current reality . "
But in
addition to transforming people 's material reality , Sanchez argued , it is also
necessary to transform human consciousness in order to achieve socialism .
" We do n't
want to transform Venezuela just on a material level ; we do n't believe the
communes should simply be directed at resolving the material problems of the
communities , such as housing , schools , transport , work , etc .
All this is very
important , but what is also important is the transformation of the human being ,
the development of human potential . "
Therefore ,
" the type of structures we create logically have to correspond to the type of
socialism we want to build ; that is , a humanistic socialism .
We are building
structures based on a social sensibility , a human sensibility , that promotes
solidarity and participation . "
Sanchez
believes that " the biggest challenge we face in building a new society has to
do with the construction of the new human being .
We need to leave behind
individualism , egoism and consumerism - all the ‘ isms ' of capitalism . "
When asked
what Venezuela and the Bolivarian revolution represents for the world today ,
Sanchez replied with one word , " Hope . "
" Hope that
a better world is possible , " he added .

Want An HDTV For $ 100 ?
How Bout An Oven Door ?
Police in San Leandro police busted a man this week who was trying to sell a Sony HDTV in a Wal - Mart parking lot for just $ 100 .
As a savvy consumer I ’m sure you ’re asking … what ’s the catch ?
Well , it ’s not a TV .
It ’s an oven door with some Sony stickers and a bunch of cables crammed into the back .
The perp was called in by an anonymous tipster who said the man tried to sell the TV , claiming he had purchased it for $ 60 at a flea market .
The man was clearly committed to his sale – he packed electronic cables in the back , found some Sony stickers , and even included installation instructions .
Though the police did n’t file charges for the attempted sale , they did confiscate the TV .
Guess who ’s going back to the station to try to play Halo 3 ?

Have you ever paid close attention to the signs on the door of restaurants and grocery stores that say , “ No shirt , No shoes , No service ” ?
Well , apparently a manager at the Sunset Hills Burger King in Missouri takes it to the extreme .
On Tuesday , August 4th , a young mother ordered at the Burger King .
With her was her six month old baby .
The baby did not have shoes on .
Babies do not walk around , or get their feet dirty and grimy .
The mother stated the baby ’s feet were too small for shoes .
The manager of the Burger King told the mother to either put shoes on her barefoot baby or leave .
With the continuous demand of the Burger King manager , the group the mother was with ate as fast as they could and then left .
The manager continued to insist that the mother leave because she would not put shoes on the baby .
The mother of the barefoot baby , having no shoes for the baby , pulled out some socks to try and comply .
The manager then threatened to call the police if no shoes were put on the baby .
The mother , clearly upset , put the message on facebook about her barefoot baby .
She said she felt that others should know that she was asked to leave because her baby did not have shoes on .
Barefoot babies were not welcome at Burger King .

The signs put on the doors of these businesses are for the safety of others .
Dirty , grimy feet can be a health hazard in an eating atmosphere .
However , was the law meant for barefoot babies , the smallest of us all ?
With the heat , most mothers leave their baby ’s feet bare in order to keep them cooler .
Shoes and socks can overheat babies .
Six month old babies cannot even walk .
Yet , apparently , babies may be asked to leave if they are barefoot , even though their feet are often the cleanest feet to enter a restaurant .
Unfortunately , the manager of the Burger King did not understand the law meant to provide protection for public health .
Hopefully this was an unfortunate incident and mothers can bring their babies into restaurants and not have to worry about putting shoes on the baby ’s feet .
Hopefully barefoot babies will once again be welcome at Burger King !

Are Obama and his still fully operating campaign staff and organization , ACORN and its numerous affiliates , and Google via its search engines and staff for its main organization and subsidiaries … engaging in increased cyber - warfare against Obama opponents online ?

“ 31 Jul 2009 – Update : Denial of Service ( DOS ) attacks are being reported at various websites on the net which have been critical of Obama and his lack of eligibility under our Constitution to be the President .
The official “ The Birthers.org ” website was temporarily blocked for about 9 hours from access by normal users by a coordinated DOS attack late Thursday and early Friday .
Others have reported similar attacks .
We believe these DOS attacks are being orchestrated via ACORN and affiliated groups using “ zombie programs ” installed on the computers of 10s of thousands of their members nationwide and even worldwide ( they have 1 million members outside the USA ) and that these zombie sleeper codes in these thousands of computers are being controlled by a central “ war room ” operation operated by ACORN and / or the Obama campaign staff , to engage in cyber - warfare against there target of interest , which is still in operation .
I believe they also engage paid and / or volunteer ACORN chapter members as bloggers who are turned loose when needed to flood conservative blogs with trolling type messages in any blog where any a thread about the Obama eligitiblity issue is gaining traction or in the news .
This internet war room , with its paid bloggers and 10s of thousands of zombie computers world wide , can then send out a simple internet coded command at any time at will to attack any website on the net at any given time with massive , overwhelming numbers of internet “ page serve ” requests or emails to block access to the site by normal users , and to cause servers to crash and to clog up email in boxes with robotically generated page serve requests and emails .
Keep you firewalls and virus checkers up to date and report any DOS attacks to your ISP immediately and request they report it to law enforcement and / or report it yourself directly to the FBI cyber crimes unit for investigation .
I believe ACORN and all its affilations and “ cousins ” should be investigated under the RICO laws .
and under international criminal conspiracy crime laws . ”

' A Wonderful Resource '
In accepting that position , Mr. Debevoise , a lanky six - footer who loved trout fishing and hiking in the mountains , spoke of the value that wilderness living might have for the youngsters .
'' Developing a love of the great outdoors is a marvelous thing , '' he said .
'' To me it has become a wonderful resource that I have drawn on all my life . ''
Born in Manhattan on Dec. 14 , 1899 , and named after his great - great grandfather , Eli Whitney , the inventor of the cotton gin , Mr. Debevoise graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville , Conn. , in 1917 .
Shortly after graduation , he enlisted in the Army and eventually attained the rank of second lieutenant .
Mr. Debevoise graduated from Yale University in 1921 and from the Harvard University Law School in 1925 .
He immediately entered practice in Manhattan in the office of his father and , later , was an associate in a firm headed by John W. Davis , the Democratic candidate for president in 1924 .
In 1931 , with a total of $ 2,366 in their account , Mr. Debevoise and William E. Stevenson , both then 31 , formed a partnership under the name Debevoise & Stevenson .
The firm soon enjoyed success when it was named counsel to the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings involving the collapsed empire of Ivar Kreuger , the '' Swedish Match King . ''
Mr. Kreuger , head of the International Match Company , killed himself in February 1932 , in what was a sensational end to his tangled and well - publicized financial affairs .
A Hunt for Communists
Later , Mr. Debevoise would play a leading role in the firm 's representation of Alger Hiss during the former State Department official 's two trials for perjury in the post - war hunt for Communists in government .
In the early 1950's , Mr. Debevoise served as legal adviser for the Ford Motor Company as it became a public corporation .

Sometimes on the weekends , I will be rambling about thoughts I 've been having that week .
Feel free to comment , add to my thoughts , or disagree with anything I say .
But please remember that I do n't like being called an idiot , even if I 'm being one .
So keep your comments respectful .
My husband and I have an ongoing argument about whether or not an environmentally or socially responsible company should get big .
My feeling is that when a company gets too big , it loses sight of its original goals and values .
And when there 's too big of a gap between the people at the top and those at the bottom , the people at the top care less about how their actions affect those at the bottom .
I sometimes talk about " evil companies , " which annoys my husband .
He argues that businesses either have to get big or die , though frequently that involves selling out to a larger company that might not share its values .
I say , Why can't they just get big enough ?
He says that 's not the way our economy works .
Etc. , etc. , etc .
We 've had this conversation a dozen times .
Some examples of companies that frequently enter into our discussion : Burt 's Bees sold out to Clorox .
Tom's of Maine is owned by Colgate .
Dagoba Chocolate is owned by Hershey .
Chipotle sold out to McDonalds .
Ben & Jerry 's is part of Unilever .
I could go on ...
I 've been thinking about this topic this week for a couple of reasons .
One is because I was writing about saving money on organics , and unfortunately , I think one of the ways we will see price drops in organic foods is when big business really gets involved .
Namely , Walmart .
And as much as I 'd like to see cheaper organics , that thought still makes me sad .
But the other reason I 've been thinking about this topic is because I 've read a few related quotes this week by big name environmentalists who surprisingly seem to side more with my husband than me .
For example ...
From Josh Dorfman , the Lazy Environmentalist :
As we transform our economy — which I really believe is what we have to do — into sustainability , I just think that these large corporations are going to be part of that change .
They have to be .
Some of them will go out of business , but most of them are going to be here and they have to transform .
These are the steps corporations have to take to transform and sometimes it ’s hard for us as environmentalists to operate in this gray area .
We want to see the world in terms of good guys and bad guys , black and white , and that ’s not a luxury that we have if we ’re really serious about creating change that ’s going to make a real difference .
[ Up ] until a year ago while we were in a very close dialogue with Wal - Mart and working to help them become a more sustainable and responsible business , we were not comfortable selling to them .
But the progress that Wal - Mart has made in the past three to four years is astounding and absolutely an incredible inspiration for what ’s possible of a large company .
Does that mean they ’re perfect today ?
No , but they have made more progress than just about any company that I can think of and that progress has led us to experiment with them in a small group of stores ....
I do n’t believe that we can solve the urgent problems that face us — whether it ’s global warming , or whether it ’s a crisis of fresh water or species disappearance — without aggressive leadership from the business community .
Part of the role that Seventh Generation wants to play is showing business that being responsible is good business and being sustainable is good business , and that we ca n’t afford to have business stand in the way of the progress we need to make to become more sustainable .
Cradle to Cradle
[ Just ] as industrialists , engineers , designers , and developers of the past did not intend to bring about such devastating effects , those who perpetuate these paradigms today surely do not intend to damage the world .
The waste , pollution , crude products , and other negative effects that we have described are not the result of corporations doing something morally wrong .
They are the consequence of outdated and unintelligent design .
" How can you work with them ? " we are often asked , regarding our willingness to work with every sector of the economy , including big corporations .
To which we sometimes reply , " How can you not work with them ? " ...
Eco-effectiveness sees commerce as the engine of change , and honors its need to function quickly and productively .
But it also recognizes that if commerce shuns environmental , social , and cultural concerns , it will produce a large - scale tragedy of the commons , destroying valuable natural and human resources for generations to come .
Eco-effectiveness celebrates commerce and the commonweal in which it is rooted .
Where do your opinons lie in this argument ?
Are big business and environmentalism at opposite ends of the spectrum ?
Or can they work together toward a sustainable future ?

The beleaguered All Blacks have been hit with another body blow , with in - form hooker Keven Mealamu ruled out for the rest of the international season .
Mealamu left the field late in the All Blacks ' 31 - 19 defeat to the Springboks in Durban last Sunday morning after rupturing a chest muscle .
All Blacks doctor Deb Robinson said Mealamu underwent an MRI scan in Auckland yesterday which confirmed a ruptured major tendon on the left side of his chest .
" It 's incredibly disappointing for Keven but he is in a positive frame of mind and will undergo surgery on Friday , " Robinson said .
Mealamu will be out of rugby for a minimum of four months , ruling him out of the remainder of the Tri-Nations as well as the All Blacks ' end of year tour .
It leaves Andrew Hore as the All Blacks ' clear No1 hooker and opens the door for Waikato 's Aled de Malmanche as his understudy .
Hawke's Bay 's Hika Elliot now comes into the frame for a callup as the third choice rake .
Several All Blacks have been made available for Air New Zealand Cup duty over the next two weeks , All Blacks assistant coach Wayne Smith admitting that it was a backflip decision designed to get players in form .
North Harbour 's Luke McAlister , Cory Jane and Tamati Ellison ( Wellington ) , de Malmanche and Brendon Leonard ( Waikato ) , Bryn Evans ( Hawke 's Bay ) , John Afoa ( Auckland ) and Tanerau Latimer ( Bay of Plenty ) are all available this weekend .
Piri Weepu , Neemia Tialata and Rodney So'oialo ( Wellington ) , Kieran Read ( Canterbury ) and Jason Eaton ( Taranaki ) are available for round three .
The All Blacks will hold a one - day training camp in Auckland next Wednesday before assembling in Sydney on August 16 to prepare for the Bledisloe Cup test against Australia on August 22 .
With the Fall season rapidly approaching , and the Horror Movie Season starting tomorrow with Rob Zombie ’s Halloween 2 , I thought this a perfect time to take a look at one of the most prolific , collectible , and shocking pieces of media that always goes hand in hand with the films themselves : Movie Posters .
And in no film genre are the posters more abundant and often strikingly beautiful , while at the same time ferociously chilling , than Horror .
When a company wants to one - up either themselves or the last company ’s artistic attempt to scare someone , they roll out the most hideous and unrelenting pieces of art imaginable .
But there are limits , at least to what you ’re able to show the pubic in theaters .
But that does n’t mean envelopes ca n’t be pushed .
And then there ’s the entirely different and equally as spine - tingling pictures that accompany DVD releases .
It can get pretty brutal and spectacular all at once .
So if you ’re a huge horror movie buff like I am and really relish in the nasty , brutal , visceral artwork that goes into making a movie poster , you ’re gonna love these .
I think what shocks the most about this poster is both the butcher knife in the baby doll ’s back , and the empty - eyed mask at the bottom of the grocery bag .
It just screams slasher film , and the film itself is pretty damn brutal , too .
This movie is absolutely revolting in a couple of parts .
Perhaps it might do you well to look up the word .
I ’ll wait .
There ya go , basically a cannibal .
So , in the final scene ( I ’ll spare you the description of the first ) , the beast is dispatched with an ax , but before he succumbs to death , he tries to eat himself .
That ’s the image you get here on the poster .
This poster appears on a lot of ‘ Best - Of ’s ’ pretty much for the same reason : a demonic monster with a wicked hair - lip , disgusting teeth , and a rivulet of discolored drool .
It ’s enough to make you turn away .
As werewolf movies go ( and they do go … ) , the Howling is easily one of the best .
The poster is rife with horrific imagery , especially the ripped ( flesh ? ) background hiding the screaming woman .
Very nice .
Boy , 1981 was a good year for Horror !.
Anyway , this one stars everyone ’s favorite blind Ingalls from Little House on the Prairie as a bat - shit crazy chick bent on revenge .
And boy is the revenge sweet .
The scene where they ’re all sitting , dead , at the dinner table is just classic .
In the poster we see but one way a victim is dispatched .
Though the poster is supposed to illustrate the beasts that live beneath the London city streets , it almost ends up coming across as a zombified version of Moses and his monstrous disciples .
Maybe that was the point .
Either way : pretty creepy .
Though not standard to its horror film genre , the scenes in which we actually see the alien transforming the dogs and the scientists into malformed monstrocities are stunning .
On the poster , just the idea of that bright flash of light becoming something only found in nightmares is very intriguing .
Wonderfully artistic and pop-style for the early 60’s , it almost sits as a sign of the times - especially considering movie posters from those few years all share the same basic idea .
Though this one , as a horror movie , has the added benefit of a severed , angry , head .
The artwork in this poster does a great job of using it ’s harsh color scheme to represent the torment and reached breaking point in the woman ’s psyche .
Look closely at the moon …
Though the movie retells the historic tale of the eponymous creation of Shelley ’s Frankenstein as well as the Vampire mythology , it ’s the poster that conjures up the most disturbing image .
A Hell - spawn imp perches curiously on a sleeping woman .
I have two incurable fears , both of which play strongly in ways I ’d rather not shuffle this mortal coil .
Drowning is one , and the other is somehow getting buried alive .
Now you can see why this poster is so damn freaky .
Eyeball ( 1978 )
Not exactly the best movie of all time , but for what it lacks in cinematic brilliance , it more than makes up for with its ridiculously gory poster .
The girl being eluded to in the title is none other than Jodie Foster .
So , in the silhouette there on the poster , we get something of a question as to what it is she wants and who she really is .
Scary , that ’s what .
It ’s hard to scream when you ’re in a coma .
It ’s even more difficult to scream when you wake and begin having visions of a suicidal cult leader .
Yeah , much like the burnt remains of the hand that mutes her on the poster .
If you ’ve ever wanted to see a movie where a duo of remarkably unintelligent turkey - farmer scientists actually become the very bird they work on , well , you ’ve come to the right place .
Actually , maybe you ought to leave .
The poster is easily the best part .
An absolute Who ’s Who of ’ 80 ’s sitcom stars ( William Katt , George Wendt , and Richard Moll ) make this movie one of the funniest horror - comedies ever .
And the poster ?
Dude , it ’s a disembodied hand ringing a doorbell !
What more do you want ?
Sometimes simplicity is the name of the game .
What could possibly be more innocuous and ordinary than a plain old baby bottle ?
Likely nothing .
But what if the bottle had a hideous , sinister creature in it ?
What then …
More or less a retelling of the Red Riding Hood myth by none other than Angela Landsbury , its not the movie that moves most .
No , it ’s the visage of a wolf snout - and presumably the rest of the canine - attempting to squeeze through a person ’s mouth .
Amazing piece of artwork .
When Ruggero Deodato ’s gory , nauseating film originally saw release , he was brought into a lawsuit where he had to prove that no one ( especially the girl skewered on the poster here ) was actually killed by bringing the actor into court .
It is a painful film to witness .
This movie is really disturbing .
Not especially gory at all , but just the prospect of those Blind Dead horsemen you see on the poster hunting their hapless victims by sound alone is just so very creepy .
See this movie .
If you have n’t seen the original and far , far superior Halloween from John Carpenter , well , you are really missing out .
On the poster , the only thing that belays the otherwise spooky innocence of a jack o’ lantern is Michael ’s butcher knife .
Classic .
“ When there ’s no more room in Hell , the dead will walk the Earth . ”
Now there ’s a tag - line if I ’ve ever read one .
Basically just a head peeking out of the ground with nasty red scars laced across it .
Gruesome and perfect .
The Lord of the Rings trilogy notwithstanding , I firmly believe Peter Jackson should have stayed on making more movies like this .
Absolutely one of my favorites with a poster that just draws you in to its gory carnival ride .
Easily one of the Master ’s , Alfred Hitchcock ’s , finest works .
The movie itself has a slew of posters but I found this one , of birds forming a human skull , to be particularly unnerving .
PS : I ’ve gotten some questions as to where this poster came from , and as it turns out it ’s a Fan - Made poster done by Jeff Ammons .
Nice job !
Quite possibly the most blatant , in your face , dirty , hellish Horror Movie poster of all time .
It speaks volumes with it ’s images alone , though never once gleaning to the treasures you ’ll find in the film itself .
A masterpiece in poster making .
In a new approach to an effective " electronic tongue " that mimics human taste , scientists in Illinois are reporting development of a small , inexpensive , lab - on - a - chip sensor that quickly and accurately identifies sweetness — one of the five primary tastes .
It can identify with 100 percent accuracy the full sweep of natural and artificial sweet substances , including 14 common sweeteners , using easy - to - read color markers .
This sensory " sweet - tooth " shows special promise as a simple quality control test that food processors can use to ensure that soda pop , beer , and other beverages taste great , — with a consistent , predictable flavor .
Their study was described August 17 at the American Chemical Society 's 238th National Meeting in Washington D.C .
The new sensor , which is about the size of a business card , can also identify sweeteners used in solid foods such as cakes , cookies , and chewing gum .
In the future , doctors and scientists could use modified versions of the sensor for a wide variety of other chemical - sensing applications ranging from monitoring blood glucose levels in people with diabetes to identifying toxic substances in the environment , the researchers say .
" We take things that smell or taste and convert their chemical properties into a visual image , " says study leader Kenneth Suslick , Ph.D. , of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
" This is the first practical " electronic tongue " sensor that you can simply dip into a sample and identify the source of sweetness based on its color . "
Researchers have tried for years to develop " electronic tongues " or " electronic noses " that rival or even surpass the sensitivity of the human tongue and nose .
But these devices can generally have difficulty distinguishing one chemical flavor from another , particularly in a complex mixture .
Those drawbacks limit the practical applications of prior technology .
Suslick 's team has spent a decade developing " colorimetric sensor arrays " that may fit the bill .
The " lab - on - a- chip " consists of a tough , glass - like container with 16 to 36 tiny printed dye spots , each the diameter of a pencil lead .
The chemicals in each spot react with sweet substances in a way that produces a color change .
The colors vary with the type of sweetener present , and their intensity varies with the amount of sweetener .
To the scientists ' delight , the sensor identified 14 different natural and artificial sweeteners , including sucrose ( table sugar ) , xylitol ( used in sugarless chewing gum ) , sorbitol , aspartame , and saccharin with 100 percent accuracy in 80 different trials .
Many food processors use a test called high - pressure liquid chromatography to measure sweeteners for quality control .
But it requires an instrument the size of a desk that costs tens of thousands of dollars and needs a highly trained technician to operate .
The process is also relatively slow , taking up to 30 minutes .
The new sensor , in contrast , is small , inexpensive , disposable , and produces results in about 2 minutes .
Those minutes can be critical .
Suclick noted that the food and beverage industry takes great care to ensure consistent quality of the many products that use sweeteners .
At present , when a product 's taste falls below specifications , then samples must be taken to the lab for analysis .

This paper discusses some uses for so - called '' supermacros ' ' in C ++.
Supermacros are header files which are used much in the same ways as traditional preprocessor macros , but have a lot more flexibility and power , and do not suffer from some of the more notorious problems which classical macros do .
The entire text of this article is released into the Public Domain .

13 Aug 2004 : Initial publication .
During your C or C++ career you 've probably heard several different takes on the religious wars surrounding C's preprocessor , in particular the use ( and abuse ) of macros .
While i believe i can safely say that most experienced programmers abhor macros , i think i can also safely say that most programmers understand that macros are , like it or not , basically a necessary part of C and C++ developement .
Granted , nobody really loves macros , but when they 're useful , they 're really useful , and we would have much more difficult programming careers without them .
Well , that 's not 100 % true - we 'd simply have to start pre-filtering our source files with , e.g. , Perl , before compiling them .
While that option does exist , is arbitrarily flexible , and is practiced in many cases , it is of course not platform - portable , nor portable across build environments , and is not an in - language approach .
Some purists would go so far as to say that any code generation , except possibly purely in - language techniques such as class templates ( which , as others wiser than i have pointed out , are code generators ) has no good place in C++ projects .
i wo n't go quite that far , but i must admit that i shy away from code generation when practical , if for no other reason than the interest of build portability .
But that 's not what we 're here to talk about ...
Some would argue that macros themselves are not technically an in - language feature , and they may be correct , but macros are such a part of the C and C++ environment that they can be considered , for our purposes , as being inseparable from C++ development , and therefor are considered here to be an in - language mechanism .
This paper focuses on one of macros ' more glaring weaknesses : the difficulty of physically maintaining large macros , particularly those which span more than a few lines .
Here we will explore what i call '' supermacros ' ' , and we will see how to add them to our own projects .
They serve the same purpose as classical macros , but have some fundamental differences , some of which we explore in this paper .
Historically , macros have been used to handle everything from defining types to adding member functions to types to refering to global data to wrapping up function calls ( e.g. , C's venerable assert ( ) macro ) .
Despite the general utility of macros , they have a number of limitations and ' ' gotchas ' ' , some of which are :
They are easy to abuse , used for things which are much better accomplished using more traditional , in - language C++ mechanisms .
( IMO , the assert ( ) macro is one of these abuses , as it does nothing if NDEBUG is set ( even if it is set to a logically - false value like 0 ) , and we normally learn this the hard way after realizing that our asserts ( ) suddenly do n't work any more ! )
macro is one of these abuses , as it does nothing if is set ( even if it is set to a logically - false value like 0 ) , and we normally learn this the hard way after realizing that our suddenly do n't work any more ! )
They are notoriously difficult to edit once they get more than a couple of lines in length , as each end - of - line in the macro must be backslash - escaped .
For big macros , getting useful error diagnostics from the compiler is essentially impossible , as macros technically live on a single line of code , no matter whether they are one line or 25 .
The main implication of this is that error line numbers from the compiler are almost certainly incorrect , and may inadvertently point the user at some completely different part of the code .
To be clear , i mean '' incorrect ' ' in the sense of , '' not what the user would expect , '' not '' technically wrong . ''
different part of the code .
To be clear , i mean '' incorrect ' ' in the sense of , '' not what the user would expect , '' not '' technically wrong . ''
They are difficult to publically document , as some documentation generation systems do not process documentation for macros .
This particular paper evolved from the libs11n project ( http://s11n.net), where supermacros are used to :
Register types with their classloader .
Install user - supplied classes or preferences into the framework .
Create class template specializations from a common code snippet , replacing only certain elements .
i.e. , a class template template .
Map type names to stringified forms of their names ( something which C++ does not internally support ) .
i cannot claim to have come up with the technique of using supermacros - i am quite certain that many developers have used a similar technique over the years , even if they have n't called them '' supermacros . ' '
However , i have never personally seen this technique used in source trees other than that of the s11n project , and so this paper is intended to help prod the imagination of other C++ users who might get some use out of this mechanism .
A supermacro is a header file which is written to work like a C++ macro , which essentially means that it is designed to be included , potentially repeatedly , and '' passed parameters . ''
Potential uses of supermacros include :
Register types with , e.g. , a classloader .
Install classes within the source tree at compile - time .
e.g. , libs11n uses supermacros to install user - extended specializations of a number of class templates .
Set up code which is to be run when static / global data is initialized by the runtime environment .
Generate '' similarly - typed ' ' helper / back - end classes in such a way as to avoid ODR ( One Definition Rule ) violations .
A supermacro can handle anything a normal macro can , plus many more cases , using a single - yet extendable - interface .
Supermacro arguments can contain characters , like commas , which break conventional macros .
Supermacros can do arbitrary tasks , like classloader registration .
Arbitrary new sets of supermacros can be introduced at any time without impacting existing code , which means , for example , client code can use a #define to swtich between interfaces by including different registration macros .
to swtich between interfaces by including different registration macros .
When using macros to generate types , ODR violations can be more easily eliminated with supermacros ( in theory , completely ) .
( This was one of the major drivers behind libs11 n 's move from classical macros to supermacros for classloader registrations . )
As they are implemented in ' ' real header code ' ' , they are completely immune to the editing - related limitations of macros , and are simply much easier to maintain .
easier to maintain .
Supermacros can be arbitrarily large , wheres macros get very tedious to edit once they are longer than a few lines .
They are much , much easier to debug when something does n't compile : unlike conventional macros , we even get proper file names and line numbers ( yes !!!! ) .
easier to debug when something does n't compile : unlike conventional macros , we even get proper file names and line numbers ( ) .
Supermacros can accept any number of arguments without modifying their interface , and can do some degree of sanity checks on parameters .
They can , e.g. , provide useful error messages when a user fails to set a specific parameter .
Parameters passed to supermacros are named , not positional .
Use of a supermacro looks something like this :
# define MYARG1 '' some string ''
# define MYARG2 foo :: AType
#include '' my_supermacro.hpp ''
my_supermacro.hpp
MYARG1
MYARG2
By convention , and for client convenience , the supermacro is responsible for unsetting any arguments it uses after it is done with them ( even if it does not use them on a given invocation ) , so client code may repeatedly call the macro without #undef 'ing them .
Sample :
#define S11N_TYPE MyType
#define S11N_TYPE_NAME
" MyType "
#define S11N_SERIALIZE_FUNCTOR
MyType_s11n
#include < s11n.net/s11n/reg_serializable_traits.hpp >
#define S11N_TYPE MyOtherType
#define S11N_TYPE_NAME
" MyOtherType "
#define S11N_SERIALIZE_FUNCTOR
MyOtherType_s11n
#include < s11n.net/s11n/reg_serializable_traits.hpp >
Here we show a small supermacro .
Keep in mind that supermacros can do anything which normal header files can do , and thus can be of arbitrary size and complexity .
One particular aspect of Supermacros which differs from standard header files is that they typically do not have a so - called '' include guard ' ' , as they are intended to be included multiple times .
Because of this , care must be taken to ensure that all required parameters '' passed ' ' to a supermacro are set up before the macro is used and undefined before the macro ends ( i.e. , before the end of the file ) .
For this example we are going to steal some code from the s11n project .
In that project we have a mechanism for mapping types to their type names , something which C++ , very unfortunately , does not provide .
( Do n't even start on about typeid : : name ( ) , because it officially provides undefined behaviour . )
To this end we have a class , which is not part of a supermacro , which looks like the following :
namespace { // anon namespace required for this particular case
template < class T > struct class_name
{
typedef T value_type ;
static const char * name ( )
{
static const std:: string tid = typeid(( value_type *)0 ) .name ( ) ;
return tid.c_str ( ) ;
}
} ;
} // end anonymous namespace
#define NAME_TYPE FooT
#define TYPE_NAME '' FooT ' '
#include < s11n.net/name_type/name_type.hpp >
name_type.hpp
class_name <>
#ifndef NAME_TYPE
# error " You must set both NAME_TYPE and TYPE_NAME before including this supermacro . "
#endif // NAME_TYPE
#ifndef TYPE_NAME
# error " You must set both NAME_TYPE and TYPE_NAME before including this supermacro . "
#endif // TYPE_NAME
#include " class_name.hpp " // import base class_name <> implementation
namespace { // anon namespace important for our particular case
template <> struct class_name< NAME_TYPE >
{
static const char * name ( ) { return TYPE_NAME ; }
} ;
template <> struct class_name < NAME_TYPE * >
{
static const char * name ( ) { return TYPE_NAME ; }
} ;
} // anonymous namespace
#undef NAME_TYPE
#undef TYPE_NAME
Things to note about the supermacro :
There is no '' include guard ' ' , as is normaly used in header files .
Sometimes parts of a supermacro require one , however .
of a supermacro require one , however .
Supermacros make use of traditional macros for '' passing of parameters ' ' , as it were , and these parameters are named , not positional .
The supermacro checks it's '' parameters ' ' before it starts , to avoid really weird ( and potentially really long ) error messages when a user fails to set a specific parameter .
This can also be used to , e.g. , support backwards compatibility by re-assigning macros as needed .
libs11n uses this , e.g. , to set the S11N_TYPE_NAME macro if the user has used it 's older ( deprecated ) variant , S11N_TYPE .

The undefining of all parameters at the end of the macro , to allow easy multiple - inclusion by clients .
Supermacros can call each other , to arbitrarily deep levels .
When a given supermacro is made obsolete , it is often feasible to re-implement it to forward the ' ' call ' ' to another supermacro ( presumably the obsolete one 's replacement ) .
This affords clients some degree of backwards compatibility , for example .
It 's '' logical interface ' ' can often be changed without changing existing client - side calls to the macro .
Can effectively act as an ' ' overloaded ' ' macro , taking a variable number of arguments , using default values for those which a user does not pass in .
For reasons too complex to go into here , anonymous namespaces are often useful for isolating types and preventing ODR violations .
This is not specifically a trait of supermacros , but in my experience anonymous namespaces are very useful in many supermacros , especially when type generation is needed and ODR violations are a problem .
This is especially true , over classic macros , because supermacros can selectively guard sections of their code from multiple inclusion .
That 's about all there is to it !
So where 's the catch ?
There is none , really .
Granted , supermacros have a more verbose calling convention than normal macros , but that is , as far as i'm concerned , the only down - side to using them over their more primitive cousins .
Given their much greater flexibility , the verbosity is a cost which i , as a developer , happily pay .
Supermacros do not completely replace traditional macros and , as we 've seen here , makes use of them to do it 's own work .
They are not suitable for many cases which standard macros are , such as acting as function call wrappers .
Thus i will not for a moment propose that C++ coders should ( or could ) eliminate the use of macros altogether .
i will , however , suggest that supermacros can fit many roles much better than standard macros , and that they are worthy of consideration whenever non-trivial , macro - driven functionality is needed .
The s11n library uses supermacros which create behind - the - scenes template specializations for performing tasks like registering types with their classloaders and registering i/o handlers with the framework .

To follow up on yesterday ’s blog post , here are the findings of yet another just published study that the mainstream media will undoubtedly ignore .
Effects of cannabis on lung function : a population - based cohort study
via nih.gov
The effects of cannabis on lung function remain unclear and may be different to tobacco .
We compared the associations between use of these substances and lung function in a population - based cohort ( n=1037 ) .
…
Cumulative cannabis use was associated with higher forced vital capacity , total lung capacity , functional residual capacity , and residual volume .
Cannabis was also associated with higher airways resistance but not with forced expiratory volume in 1 second , forced expiratory ratio , or transfer factor .
These findings were similar amongst those who did not smoke tobacco .
By contrast , tobacco use was associated with lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second , lower forced expiratory ratio , lower transfer factor , and higher static lung volumes , but not with airways resistance .
Cannabis appears to have different effects on lung function to those of tobacco .
Just in case you think that this is the first time that researchers have failed to document a decline in lung function in marijuana users , well , think again .
And again .
And again .

4 . Your blood pressure .
Blood pressure — the force of blood against the walls of your arteries — rises and falls normally during the day .
When it remains elevated , you have hypertension ( high blood pressure ) and this carries a higher risk or atherosclerosis , heart disease and stroke .
A reading of 140/90 mm
Hg or more is considered high , and if it ’s between 120/80 and 139/89 , you may still be at risk and should be taking steps to prevent the development of hypertension .
How to check :
Your doctor will check your blood pressure at every visit , but you can also buy a home blood pressure monitor , and studies have shown that people who check their blood pressure at home keep it under tighter control .
But home monitoring should never replace the regular checks by your doctor or nurse — or visit a pharmacy , many of which have free - to - use blood pressure machines .
How often to check :
Ask your doctor how often you should have your blood pressure ( BP ) measured .
You can request a BP check every time you go to the office .
July 23 , 2009 --
The nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) is suing the national restaurant chain Denny's , claiming the restaurant has too much sodium in its food .
In a statement , Denny 's calls the lawsuit " frivolous " and says its nutrition information is posted on its web site .
The lawsuit , filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey in Middlesex County , seeks to make Denny 's put on its menus the sodium content of its food and a warning about high sodium levels .
In a news conference , Michael Jacobson , the CSPI ' s executive director , said that the CSPI had negotiated with Denny 's starting in December 2007 and decided to file the lawsuit when those negotiations " fell through . "
" They said they 'll try to lower sodium but they want to do it at their own schedule , which , unfortunately , could be decades , " Jacobson said .
In a news release , the CSPI states that Denny 's made " small " sodium cuts in several items , but those change did n't go as far as CSPI wanted and did n't include menu disclosures .
Noting that the CDC recommends most adults get no more than 1,500 milligrams per day of sodium , Jacobson said that certain Denny 's dishes contain far more sodium , such as the 2,580 milligrams of sodium in the Moons Over My Hammy ham , egg , and cheese sandwich .
That sandwich is one of the items that lawsuit plaintiff Nick DeBenedetto , a 48 - year - old New Jersey man with hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , said was one of his favorite Denny 's meals over the past 20 years .
In the news conference , DeBenedetto said he tried to live a healthy lifestyle and that he was " astonished and shocked " to learn how much sodium was in the Denny 's items he typically ordered .
" I would n't have selected these items if I 'd known the extreme amount of sodium in this food , " DeBenedetto said .
Jacobson says that although Denny's has posted sodium and other nutritional information online , that information should go on the menu .
" If you drop into a Denny 's , you 're not going to the web .
It 's a totally inadequate means of informing consumers , " Jacobson said .

I know it ’s on your mind too , but unlike me you ’re too scared to say it : we need Soylent Green biscuits to help save humanity .
Our cities run riot with crime and debauchery , plunging our very existence into a Hades - like nightmare ; about a billion people die every day from starvation !
We need to do some serious lateral thinking and come up with a solution that combines these two major problems hindering our continuance as a species .
If we do n’t think of something , Hell will be a holiday resort compared to the dysfunctional dystopia our children will inherit !
Oh , but wait , the answer has been around since 1973 , in the form of a speculative fiction movie starring Charlton Heston !
They are protein - packed biscuits called Soylent Green , and they will be our salvation .
Set in the not - too - distant future of 2022 , real food like fruit , vegetables , and meat are extremely rare ( and just as expensive ) commodities only the fabulously rich can afford .
Try $ 150 a jar for strawberry jam .
Violence and crime are rife on the streets as the disenfranchised struggle to survive .
Hope is a word long robbed of any real meaning .
The massive Soylent Corporation ( the name derived from soy and lentils ) is in charge of feeding the starving masses with rations of “ high - energy vegetable concentrates ” called Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow .
Great , so even back then they saw soy as a superfood of the future , you say , so how does this help solve the rest of our ills ?
Enter Soylent Green .
Rather than base this product on nutritious pulses , they looked to the bounty of the sea .
This small green wafer was apparently produced from “ high - energy plankton ” , and was much more nutritious and palatable than the red and yellow varieties .
However , it was also in short supply , which often lead to even more food riots .
Why not just send out more ships to scour the oceans for greater harvests of plankton ?
That ’s because the real secret ingredient in Soylent Green was actually human beings !
In this bright future , people can opt for “ going home ” – assisted suicide or active , voluntary euthanasia .
And it seems that underneath these government facilities there are trucks just waiting to ship loads of corpses to the factories for processing into Soylent Green crackers .
You may be horrified at this , but I think it is absolutely awesome !
I mean cremation is probably just adding to climate change , and burial just feeds a few worms .
What better way to dispose of the dead , as there are no ecologically - threatening by - products , and those without food can benefit from your demise .
But you can see how Soylent Green could easily fall into short supply , as the human spirit is strong , and most continue to fight for their pathetic existence rather than opt for the easy way out .
As selfish as this seems .
But hey , what if we pumped up the supply with those on Death Row ?
Hmmm , a few more bickies making it down the line .
And all those food rioters being scooped up in huge shovel trucks – do n’t just put them back on the streets to cause more trouble , convert them to Soylent Green !
Prisoners of war ?
Hmph , you know what my answer is there .
And we all know Soylent Green wafers made with political dissenters taste just that much better !
And repeat - offending drunk drivers ?
Hmmm … do n’t get me started on that one !
Anyway , as you can see , Soylent Green really is the way of the future .
I mean , it really is inevitable , unless we manage to evolve somehow .
And like that ’s really going to happen .
And in case you ’re wondering how the world of Soylent Green could be so dismal , well , besides the obvious overpopulation caused by a species that just could never come to terms with the limits of living on a finite planet , the food shortage was not so much that there were too many mouths to feed , but not enough arable land due to a series of ecological disasters we were too stubborn and stupid to foresee .
In other words , humans killed the world and only then started complaining when it affected them .

Four people have been trampled to death by cows in just over eight weeks this summer , prompting British farmers and the Ramblers Association to warn yesterday of the potential dangers .
The spate of incidents is regarded as highly unusual ; in the past eight years there have only been 18 deaths in total caused by cattle of all kinds – including incidents involving bulls , which have always been known to present risks .
Cows have been thought to be generally docile , and this remains true , the National Farmers ' Union emphasised yesterday .
However , the NFU pointed to the fact that at least two of the four deaths involved walkers with dogs , which may be a factor in turning cows from placid cud-chewing bystanders into potential killers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Cows can get aggressive in the presence of dogs , especially if they have their calves with them , " Robert Sheasby , the NFU 's rural surveyor , said yesterday .
" They see the dog as a threat , and take exception to it .
Cows are generally placid and docile , but when a mother animal feels the protection of her offspring is at risk , temperaments can change . "
The first of this summer 's fatal incidents seems to have conformed to that pattern : it occurred on 21 June in the Yorkshire Dales when a veterinary surgeon from Warrington in Cheshire , Liz Crowsley , was walking along the Pennine Way near Hawes with her two dogs , a spaniel and a collie .
She was found dead , having apparently been trapped against a wall and then trampled .
Police speculated that Ms Crowsley 's dogs may have sparked the attack .
In what may have been a similar incident , 63 - year - old Anita Hinchey was trampled to death on 18 July when walking her dog in a field on the outskirts of Cardiff .
Three days earlier , 65 - year - old Barry Pilgrim was killed when walking with his wife in the countryside near Sheldon in Derbyshire .
It is believed Mr Pilgrim did not have a dog with him , but he was attacked by cows who were accompanied by their calves .
This summer 's fourth fatal incident occurred on 11 August , when a 75 - year - old farmer , Harold Lee from Burtle in Somerset , was trampled and killed by his own herd .
It is thought the animals may have been frightened by a passing fire engine .
This total of four deaths , in such a short time , has caused concern .
" It 's certainly something we 're not used to seeing .
This year has been very unusual , " Mr Sheasby said .
" It is very unfortunate that three walkers can be killed in the space of a few weeks , and we would hope that this is an unfortunate coincidence . "
There are about 7.5 million cows in the fields of Britain , who share the landscape with millions of rambling Britons in the summer .
No one knows just how many walkers are out on a given day , but the numbers are clearly very high – each of Britain 's 18 national parks will chalk up between 20 and 40 million day visits every year .
As a fully - grown cow can weigh anything from three - quarters of a tonne to a tonne , it does not take much for serious injury to be inflicted on anyone unfortunate enough to be on the end of a sudden bout of bovine bad temper .
Someone who can testify to this painful truth is David Blunkett , the former Home Secretary , who was attacked by a cow while walking in the Peak District on 6 June , his 62nd birthday , and suffered bruising and a broken rib .
Once again , a dog was involved – in this case , the blind MP 's trusted guide dog , Sadie .
The NFU joined with the Ramblers yesterday in offering a key piece of advice : if you feel menaced by cows when you have a dog with you , let it go , as it may well be the dog that is causing the problem .
" Your dog will outrun the cattle and you can then make your own way to safety , " Mr Sheasby said .
" At most times it is important to keep your dog on a lead in the countryside , but if you feel under threat because of it , let it go and put it back on its lead later . "
Cows are not generally dangerous , he added .
" They are naturally curious , rather than naturally aggressive , as well as short - sighted , and they will often come right up to you just to see who is in the field with them . "
But it was important , he said , not to let your dog get between a cow and its calf .
Wild animals : Creatures on the attack
* Cows are not the only livestock causing problems this summer .
Yesterday a farmer described his ordeal after becoming one of the first people in Britain to be bitten by an alpaca , the South American relative of the llama .
Rob Rawlins , 52 , had to be airlifted to hospital after an animal at the Wellground Alpaca Stud Farm , near Westbury , Wiltshire , sank its teeth into his lower left arm as he tried to stop a " dominance fight " with another male .
" I tried to intervene , which was when I was caught on the arm by one of them , " said Mr Rawlins .
" The bite had not been intended for me but unfortunately my arm got in the way .
I was able to remove my arm using my other hand and that really was the end of the incident , although I did end up with quite a nasty wound . "
Allen Brown , treasurer of British Camelids Association , representing llamas and alpaca farmers , said he had never heard of anyone being bitten in that way by the animals .
* Two people have died in recent days after being stung by wasps in separate attacks .
Farmer Mark Evison , 47 , of Ellerker , East Yorkshire , disturbed a wasps ' nest while clearing a dyke and was attacked by the swarm .
Mr Evison was allergic to wasps and when emergency services reached him , he was already in the advanced stages of anaphylactic shock – a life - threatening allergic reaction – and died at the scene .
Joan Russell , 81 , of Holt , Norfolk , collapsed within minutes of being stung on her hand while washing up and never regained consciousness .
A worldwide shortage of radioactive isotopes used for medical procedures -- including heart tests and cancer treatments -- has affected some midstate hospitals .
Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center has had to delay some procedures .
PinnacleHealth , which operates Harrisburg Hospital , is carefully scheduling treatments to be sure it has enough materials for tests and treatments .
Hershey and Pinnacle said most patients continue to receive tests and treatments as they normally would , although the shortage has posed problems in emergency cases .
Two nuclear reactors that produce about two - thirds of the world 's isotope supply have been shut down for repairs .
One reactor is in Canada , and the other is in the Netherlands .
Isotopes are injected into patients and the radiation they produce is recorded by cameras , which feed the information into a computer .
An image is then produced of the organ or tissue in question .
A shortage of an isotope called molybdenum - 99 is especially problematic for hospitals .
The isotope decays into a substance called technetium that is most often used to scan for heart disease , but can also be used to detect cancers .
There are no nuclear reactors in the United States that produce molybdenum .
Some Hershey Medical Center patients can be scheduled for tests , but procedures for patients who need more radioactive materials are being delayed , said Dr. Douglas Eggli , vice chairman of radiology .
In some cases , an older isotope , thallium , is used instead , Eggli said .
The thallium allows the tests to be done on a vast majority of patients , he said .
Eggli said the biggest impact of the shortage has been felt after hours , in providing emergency services to patients .
" In many cases , there are alternative tests that can be done , " he said .
" But for some patients , there are no alternatives .
In those cases , physicians are having to rely on medical judgment rather than diagnostic testing . "
He said situations like that represent " a very small number of our total patients , " however , and that in most cases , the other diagnostic tests can be done .
" Even though the shortage is severe , for us at Penn State Hershey , the clinical impact has been limited , " he said .
PinnacleHealth also is being impacted .
Karen Botts , director of imaging , and Dave Rheem , assistant supervisor for nuclear medicine , have been experiencing the shortage for about two months .
It 's affecting procedures such as bone scans , cardiac studies , nuclear stress tests and gastrointestinal studies , Rheem said .
" We deal with several pharmacies in the area and as far as we know , everybody 's been experiencing the same kind of shortage , " she said .
The hospital system still can perform all the tests it 's requested to do , Botts said , but has had to carefully plan treatment schedules .
" We know when we get the shipments of the isotope , and we 've been trying to schedule these patients on the days we are relatively certain the isotopes are going to be available , " Botts said .
" If it 's an emergent situation , we have been able to get doses if we need them , but no one is really sure how long that 's going to continue . "
Rheem said that the availability of technetium has improved because reactors in South Africa and Australia are increasing production .
But they 're still keeping a close eye on the treatment schedules .

KABUL , July 4 ( Reuters ) - Afghanistan 's only known pig trotted out of quarantine on Saturday , two months after he was locked away because of swine flu fears , to bask again in the mud at the Kabul Zoo .
The pig , a curiosity in Muslim Afghanistan where pork and pig products are illegal because they are considered irreligious , was quarantined because visitors to the zoo were worried it could spread the new H1N1 flu strain , commonly known as swine flu .
" Our people did not understand that the disease only passes from person to person and felt that the swine influenza might even be spread from the zoo because we have a pig here , " zoo manager Aziz Gul Saqib told Reuters .
" Other zoos abroad told us not to worry ... when people began to realise the disease does n't come from the pig itself we decided to release the pig , " he said .
" Khanzir " -- Pashto for pig -- appeared unperturbed as a team of zoo workers used sticks to gently prod him out of his temporary concrete home into his usual enclosure of lush green shrubs and a mud puddle .
Unsuspecting zoo visitors scattered as Khanzir dashed through the centre of the zoo towards his enclosure .
One visitor , 17 - year - old - Razaa , covered his nose and mouth with his t- shirt as the animal trotted past .
" It 's a pig , it 's the dirtiest thing , it might give me a disease , " he said .
Two goats grazed quietly as their portly , pink porcine pal enthusiastically rubbed his snout in a small pool of mud .
Some human onlookers were not so comfortable .
" It is very haram ( forbidden ) and should not even been looked at .
I do n't think it should even be in the zoo , " said another visitor named Nassim .
But others were intrigued .
" I think it 's an interesting animal in terms of the way it looks .
You can't really use it for anything ... it is haram and you should n't eat it , " said 22 - year old biology student Fatemeh .
Shabby and run-down , Kabul Zoo suffered badly during Afghanistan 's three decades of war but is slowly improving .
Mujahideen fighters ate the deer and rabbits and shot dead the zoo 's sole elephant during the 1992 - 94 civil war .
Incoming shells shattered the aquarium .
Khanzir , who is about eight or nine years old according to Saqib , was one of a pair given to the zoo by China in 2002 .
His partner died about two years ago .
Afghanistan has reported no cases of the H1N1 flu virus .

Imagine that a woman shows up at the front door of your house one day and says , " I 'm here to see the home for rent that was advertised on craigslist .
Can I take a look around ? "
This might be a normal thing to hear if you had actually advertised your house for rent on craigslist , but what if you had n't and were instead being scammed by someone else looking to make a buck off of gullible renters ?
This particular scam has surged in popularity lately , even reaching to the very hatch of the Ars Orbiting HQ .
In the interest of journalism , we decided to indulge our scammer to see where the scenario would lead .
Knock , knock
The story began in late July when Technical Director Kurt Mackey received a knock on his door from someone asking to view the inside of the home he just purchased .
He asked the woman where she had learned that his house was for rent ; she told him that it was listed on craigslist .
Then he got another knock .
And another .
People were driving in from around the Chicagoland area to see this wonderful house that was listed for $ 700 / month — a steal .
These frequent visits quickly become an inconvenience , forcing Kurt to post a sign on his door sending prospective renters away .
In reality , it was a Nigerian scammer who had listed Kurt 's house for rent .
The home rental scam has grown so popular that it has even generated a public warning from the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Scammers , often from outside the country , pick up on real estate listings online , yank the pictures and details , and voila : a new craigslist ad .
Scammers count on renters to communicate with them largely over e-mail and commit to sending a " security deposit " to Africa — where the scammer has allegedly had to go on short notice due to family or missionary concerns — before ever finding out that the place does n't even belong to the scammer .
Kurt 's scammer , going by the name of Engel , fit this profile perfectly .
I played the role of house hunter and responded to Engel 's ad , asking for more information about the house .
Engel was quick to explain to me why " she " was no longer living in it .
" The house is still available but presently I 'm not around ..
I did bid for a portion of petroleum land sometimes ago in West Africa and fortunately I won the bidding so I have to move quickly down to Africa to have my company set up , " she wrote .
Engel explained that she and her husband had built the house with their own hands when they got married and cared deeply for the property .
" We are not after the rental fee but the absolute care for the property .
Please note than you will only be able to drive by the house for now but not have a look at the interior until i have sent the keys and documents of the house to you ... and the requirement for getting the keys and documents of the house is a fully refundable payment of $ 700 USD , which is the security deposit . "
Attached was a renter 's application form asking for typical information such as my full name , address , phone number , current employer , marital status , what kinds of pets I have — and , of course , when I plan on sending the $ 700 security deposit to Nigeria via Western Union .
I filled out the application and proceeded to explain to Engel my situation :
" Hi Engel , Thank you for your response !
I am very interested in renting the house , but I have some concerns .
I play in a heavy metal band and we make lots of noise — will the neighbors be agreeable to our band playing only at night hours when it is quiet ?
I am not currently married , although I get around ( if you know what I mean ) and have people over all the time .
I take very good care of the places I rent , except for that one time , but the court let me off with a restraining order .
I would make a very reliable tenant .
I can send you the $ 700 deposit immediately if you choose me as your tenant .
I do n't have any pets except for several rats who are my best friends , and we would be happy to take care of your house for you .
Please let me know when you decide ASAP !
Thank you ! "
Surprise of surprises — I was accepted !
Not only that , but that there 's an extra room I could use for anything I want .
" I want you to know that i'm satisfied with your profile and also believe l can trust in you because l will not like to experience what l experienced from my last tenant again , l showed your profile to my husband and daughter , they said they are ok with it , " Engel wrote .
" We will come and pay you a visit after you have moved into my House to see how you are maintaining it , I will be receiving the first months deposit payment from you via Western Union because l think it reliable , secured and fast , l wish you best of luck in your work , from your profile l can see that you are responsible and a hard working person may the almighty God bless you in what ever you wish to do . "
I told Engel that my band , my rats , and I were all thrilled to be able to move into the house , and that the news about the extra room was very welcome — " I can totally use that as my grow room , or maybe even cook up some meth .
Would you and your family be okay with that ?
I could even hook you up sometime when you 're back in the US . "
I did , however , have a few questions , mostly relating to the whole Western Union thing .
After all — I can't afford to wire $ 700 to a Nigerian just for the sake of an article .
Plus , as a renter , I would never wire someone money without seeing the place first .
I asked Engel if I could do a walkthrough of the house before sending the deposit and whether she would accept personal checks .
" I do n't have access to a Western Union and can't easily drive there , as my driver 's license was suspended last year for a DUI , " I wrote .
" Thank you , and God bless YOU , Engel . "
This must have been the tipping point for the scammer — was it the meth ? — because she did not respond to my e-mail .
I pressed her again a few days later , which got a response reiterating that I must wire transfer the $ 700 deposit in order to get the keys to the place , end of story .
I tried to provoke her further by asking flat out how I could be sure she was n't a scammer and how I might get my deposit back , but it did n't work .
Engel dropped me like a hot potato and never responded to further e-mails .
The truth is , I 'm not an experienced scam baiter , and while many Nigerian scammers can provide some temporary entertainment , they 're not ( usually ) stupid .
They can tell when they 're beginning to get jerked around , and you have to be a semi- pro to reel them back in after they begin to suspect you .
After all , there are legions of people who are on a nonstop quest to scam the scammers — scammers are going to walk away from time to time .
The whole experience was entertaining in its own twisted way , though I 'm not the one whose house was being advertised for rent .
Kurt was n't nearly so amused .
The White House unleashes a viral tool aimed at online combat on everything from ' rationing ' to euthanasia .
Obama opens viral front in health war
Facing an onslaught of opposition to health reform , the White House on Monday opened a “ Reality Check ” website with a viral tool aimed at online combat on everything from “ rationing ” to euthanasia .
The site incorporates lessons learned from the Obama campaign ’s “ Learn the Truth About Barack Obama ” site , which covered everything from the birth certificate to William Ayers to “ a recent e-mail smear falsely claims Michelle ordered room service , but she never even stayed at the hotel . ”

Aides to President Barack Obama say the key is to respond to viral rumors with an aggressive , equally viral response .
“ We 're offering the site and tools to empower individuals across the country to take this content into their own hands and share it among their networks , ” a senior administration official said .
“ That 's the sort of bottom - up process that got us to the White House , and it's what 's going to deliver meaningful change to the health insurance system . ”
Kevin Smith , communications director for House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , said in response : “ While Democrats are playing defense , Republicans are educating the American people about the cost and consequences of the Democrats ’ government takeover of health care and promoting our better solutions to lower health care costs , increase access , and preserve the doctor - patient relationship . ”
The new offensive came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer charged in an opinion article in USA Today that disruptions at congressional town halls have been “ simply un-American .
Drowning out the facts is how we failed at this task for decades . ”
At the same time , the Democratic National Committee is urging supporters to visit the local offices of their senators and House members .
DNC interns called lawmakers ’ offices to find out their hours of operation .
Organizing for America , the Obama grass - roots network now operated by the DNC , offers custom - tailored e-mails telling supporters where and when they can show up .
The new White House site has built - in tools allowing users to e-mail every page and video to their friends and families and is linked to social networks with preloaded messages to encourage folks to share the content .
The videos feature administration officials putting a face on reform by tackling issues in a casual , straightforward way .
There 's also an FAQ that , when e-mailed , includes a long message full of the facts about reform — in a similar format to some chain e-mails that offer what the White House considers a long list of falsehoods .
The 2,000 - word FAQ covers everything from “ rationing ” to “ a lot of seniors seem to be concerned about a provision in the House bill that would provide counseling for end of life care .
They think it sounds like the government will come along every five years and require you to talk about how you want to end your life . "
The site will be promoted heavily on the White House ’s rapidly growing social networks and with an e-mail to the WhiteHouse. gov list .
Linda Douglass , communications director of the White House Office of Health Reform , said Sunday on CNN ’s “ Reliable Sources ” : “ One of the things we learned during the campaign was that if you give people all the facts , … people really paid attention .
They understand what the truth is when they see it . ”
Macon Phillips , White House director of new media , offers a tour of his team ’s handiwork , in a pre-dawn blog post :
“ The first set of videos addresses a wide scope of topics and debunks some of those common myths :
— CEA Chair Christina Romer details how health insurance reform will impact small businesses .
— Domestic Policy Council Director Melody Barnes tackles a nasty rumor about euthanasia and clearly describes how reform helps families .
— Matt Flavin , the White House 's director of veterans and wounded warrior policy , clears the air about veterans ' benefits .
— Kavita Patel , M.D. , a doctor serving in the White House 's Office of Public Engagement , explains that health care rationing is happening right now and how reform gives control back to patients and doctors .
— Robert Kocher , M.D. , a doctor serving on the National Economic Council , debunks the myth that health insurance reform will be financed by cutting Medicare benefits .
— In a video first released last week , Linda Douglass from the White House Health Reform Office addresses fears about the end of our private insurance system and reiterates that if you like your current plan , you can keep it . ”

Riding on top of Strawberry Perl for Windows , now Windows is the easiest platform for Padre installation .
Compared to that installing Padre on Linux or Mac OSX is still a headache .
We have several directions on how to improve the situation .
Friendly people at Debian , Ubuntu , FreeBSD , Mandriva , Fedora and probably elsewhere are working on including Padre in the upcoming releases of those distributions but there are people who would like to try Padre now .
We would like to make their first time experience better by allowing them to download a single file , unzip it and have Padre up and running in minutes .
We have started to work on it and we have outlined our plans but we would love to see some people come along and help with either of these directions .
So if you are into PAR packaging , know Shipwright or is experienced in building code ( perl , Gtk , etc ) on Linux or Mac OSX we would love to get your help .
The best way to contact us is via IRC or on our mailing - list .

For months , issuers have raised credit card rates and fees at a dizzying pace .
Now , a growing number are starting to tack on new card fees for inactivity or purchases made outside the U.S .
In June , Fifth Third Bank began charging a $ 19 fee if credit card borrowers have no account activity in 12 months .
Discover now levies a 2 % fee on purchases made outside the U.S. , and Chase has introduced a $ 30 annual fee on its popular Freedom credit card for certain cardholders .
Citigroup , meanwhile , has rolled out a policy where certain credit card borrowers who pay late are subject to a " reinstatement fee " to be able to redeem accumulated points for rewards .
This fee is currently $ 0 .
But it wo n't stay that way , predicts Robert Hammer , who consults with the industry , if Citigroup finds cardholders are n't objecting to the policy .
Citigroup spokesman Samuel Wang says , " We currently have no plans to raise it . "
The fees represent issuers ' latest attempt to mitigate the effects of a credit card law passed in May , which restricts rate increases and marketing to college students .
Analysts say that because most provisions do n't take effect until February 2010 , issuers are finding ways now to bolster their income despite consumers ' precarious financial situations .
Issuers are " hoping to slip in fees where they 're least likely to be noticed , " says Adam Jusko , founder of IndexCreditCards.com , a card comparison site .
One fee making a comeback is the annual fee .
In this economy , issuers are sending fewer credit card offers to U.S. households , yet a higher proportion of the offers have fees , according to Synovate , which tracks direct mail .
Issuers justify the new fees as a way to respond to the tough economy or keep their prices on par with their competitors .
Chase also points out that Freedom card borrowers who do n't want to pay an annual fee still get a reward program with 1 % cash back on purchases .
This new program , however , tends to be less generous than the old one , analysts say .
The changes in card terms mean that consumers need to read their credit card bills and notices extra carefully , says Curtis Arnold of CardRatings.com .
Many of the same banks are also extending some of their most profitable — and controversial — credit card fees to bank accounts .
One way they 're doing so is making it easier or costlier for consumers to spend more than they have in their checking accounts , just as they allow borrowers to spend past their card limits and charge them a fee .
In June , Bank of America raised its monthly fee on certain checking accounts and imposed a fee on accounts that remain overdrawn .
( Bank of America did , however , lower its fee on overdrafts of $ 5 or less . )
Citigroup , meanwhile , has raised foreign - transaction fees on debit cards .
Last week , " The Colbert Report " spoofed a decision by Memorial Library of Nazareth and Vicinity to rescind the library privileges of Tatamy resident Dominick Philip , 7 .
Stephen Colbert followed up on his report Monday night , offering a solution to deal with the " bookworm bandit . "
He claims librarian Lynn Snodgrass - Pilla 's decision to extend Dominick 's access to the library through the end of the year sends the wrong message .
Instead , he suggests taking a similar approach to when his uncle caught him smoking and forced him to smoke an entire carton of cigarettes to cure the bad habit .
Colbert whips out an enormous box of books and threatens to send them to Dominick .

Two years ago , Google sent out an army of hybrid electric automobiles , each one bearing nine cameras on a single pole .
Armed with a GPS and three laser range scanners , this fleet of cars began an endless quest to photograph every highway and byway in the free world .
Victoria Highway , Gregory , Australia
Consistent with the company ’s mission “ to organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful , ”  this enormous project , titled Google Street View , was created for the sole purpose of adding a new feature to Google Maps .
308 1st Ave. Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania
Never hiding its presence , but never announcing its arrival , the Street View vehicle is a systematic pursuer of fleeting moments .
Every ten to twenty meters , the nine cameras automatically capture whatever moves through their frame .
Computer software stitches the photos together to create panoramic images .
To prevent identification of individuals and vehicles , faces and license plates are blurred .
20 Rue de la Vicarie , Saint Brieuc , France
Street View ’s facial recognition software sometimes fails , unintentionally revealing an individual ’s identity .
Today , Google Maps provides access to 360° horizontal and 290° vertical panoramic views ( from a height of about eight feet ) of any street on which a Street View car has traveled .
For the most part , those captured in Street View not only tolerate photographic monitoring , but even desire it .
Rather than a distrusted invasion of privacy , online surveillance in general has gradually been made ‘ friendly ’ and transformed into an accepted spectacle .
Subjects of their own gaze : the Street View car departs central HQ in Mountain View , CA to the enthusiastic cheers of Google employees .
One year ago , I started collecting screen captures of Google Street Views from a range of Street View blogs and through my own hunting .
This essay illustrates how my Street View collections reflect the excitement of exploring this new , virtual world .
The world captured by Google appears to be more truthful and more transparent because of the weight accorded to external reality , the perception of a neutral , unbiased recording , and even the vastness of the project .
At the same time , I acknowledge that this way of photographing creates a cultural text like any other , a structured and structuring space whose codes and meaning the artist and the curator of the images can assist in constructing or deciphering .
Eagle Point Dr , Sherwood , Pulaski , Arkansas
Street View collections represent our experience of the modern world , and in particular , the tension they express between our uncaring , indifferent universe and our search for connectedness and significance .
A critical analysis of Google ’s depiction of experience , however , requires a critical look at Google itself .
Initially , I was attracted to the noisy amateur aesthetic of the raw images .
Street Views evoked an urgency I felt was present in earlier street photography .
With its supposedly neutral gaze , the Street View photography had a spontaneous quality unspoiled by the sensitivities or agendas of a human photographer .
It was tempting to see the images as a neutral and privileged representation of reality — as though the Street Views , wrenched from any social context other than geospatial contiguity , were able to perform true docu- photography , capturing fragments of reality stripped of all cultural intentions .
S. Avalon Park Blvd. Union Park , Florida
The way Google Street View records physical space restored the appropriate balance between photographer and subject .
It allowed photography to accomplish what culture critic and film theorist Siegfried Kracauer viewed as its mission : “ to represent significant aspects of physical reality without trying to overwhelm that reality so that the raw material focused upon is both left intact and made transparent . ” 

A momentary glimpse of a Street View driver .
This infinitely rich mine of material afforded my practice the extraordinary opportunity to explore , interpret , and curate a new world in a new way .
To a certain extent , the aesthetic considerations that form the basis of my choices in different collections vary .
For example , some selections are influenced by my knowledge of photographic history and allude to older photographic styles , whereas other selections , such as those representing Google ’s depiction of modern experience , incorporate critical aesthetic theory .
But throughout , I pay careful attention to the formal aspects of color and composition .
Within the panoramas , I can locate images of gritty urban life reminiscent of hard - boiled American street photography .
Or , if I prefer , I can find images of rural Americana that recall photography commissioned by the Farm Securities Administration during the depression .

I can seek out postcard - perfect shots that capture what Cartier - Bresson titled “ the decisive moment , ”  as if I were a photojournalist responding instantaneously to an emerging event .
Rue de la Huchette , Paris , France
The ‘ indifferent ’ gaze countered even the sentimentality of the ubiquitous embracing Parisian couple of French street - photography .
At other times , I have been mesmerized by the sense of nostalgia , yearning , and loss in these images — qualities that evoke old family snapshots .

If Google chooses , their systematic storing of panoramic views serves photography ’s historic role of cultural preservation .
Or I can search for passing scenes that remind me of one of Jeff Wall ’s staged tableaux .
Rue du Faubourg du Temple , Paris , France
Although Street View stills may exhibit a variety of styles , their mode of production — an automated camera shot from a height of eight feet from the middle of the street and always bearing the imprimatur of Google — nonetheless limits and defines their visual aesthetic .
The blurring of faces , the unique digital texture , and the warped sense of depth resulting from the panoramic view are all particular to Street View ’s visual grammar .
Warwick Street , Gateshead , England
Is n’t it appropriate that Google hides our identities ?
Do I not often see my neighbor ’s face as an indistinct blur ?
Many features within the captures , such as the visible Google copyright and the directional compass arrows , continually point us to how the images are produced .
For me , this frankness about how the scenes are captured enhances , rather than destroys the thrill of the present instant projected on the image .
Calle del Padre Pedro Vallasco , Valencia , Spain
Berwick Rd. Belfast , Northern Ireland , United Kingdom
Although Google ’s photography is obtained through an automated and programmed camera , the viewer interprets the images .
This method of photographing , artless and indifferent , does not remove our tendency to see intention and purpose in images .
10 IJsselmeerdijk , Zeevang , Netherlands
The new form of photography may have removed the photographer from the mechanical process , but Street View photographs nonetheless remain cultural texts demanding interpretation .
This very way of recording our world , this tension between an automated camera and a human who seeks meaning , reflects our modern experience .
As social beings we want to matter and we want to matter to someone , we want to count and be counted , but loneliness and anonymity are more often our plight .
51 E. Claremont St. Edinburgh , Scotland
This tension between meaning and non-meaning is especially evident in those images that seek out the significance of the human , even if it is by illustrating its absence .
But Google does not necessarily impose their organization of experience on us ; rather , their means of recording may manifest how we already structure our experience .

Some , while searching Google Street View , adopt an investigative attitude and regale us with possible or actual crimes , such as muggings , break - ins , and police arrests .
Via Valassa , Rho , Lombardy , Italy
Others with a more libidinal nature may single out images of prostitutes captured by the roving Google vehicle .
Street Views can suggest what it feels like when scenes are connected primarily by geographic contiguity as opposed to human bonds .
24 Rue Neyron , Saint Bienne , France
A street view image can give us a sense of what it feels like to have everything recorded , but no particular significance accorded to anything .
26 Little St SE .
Atlanta , Georgia
The detached gaze of the automated camera can lead to a sense that we are observed simultaneously by everyone and by no one .
These collections seek to convey contemporary experience as represented by Google Street View .
We are bombarded by fragmentary impressions and overwhelmed with data , but we often see too much and register nothing .
In the past , religion and ideologies often provided a framework to order our experience ; now , Google has laid an imperial claim to organize information for us .
Sergey Brin and Larry Page have compared their search engines to the mind of God and proclaimed as their corporate motto , “ do no evil . ” 
Although the Google search engine may be seen as benevolent , Google Street Views present a universe observed by the detached gaze of an indifferent Being .
Its cameras witness but do not act in history .
For all Google cares , the world could be absent of moral dimension .
Rue Saunier , Toulon , France
In theory , we are all equally subject to being photographed , but the Street View collections often reveal it is the poor and the marginalized who fall within the purview of the Google camera gaze .
31 Calle de San Dalmacio , Madrid , Spain
Even though Google places a comment , ‘ report a concern ’ on the bottom of every single image , how can I demonstrate my concern for humanity within Google ’s street photography ?
308 SW Rose Garden Way , Portland , Oregon
It is we who must make sense of Google ’s record of our experience , for good or for ill .
The collections of Street Views both celebrate and critique the current world .
To deny Google ’s power over framing our perceptions would be delusional , but the curator , in seeking out frames within these frames , reminds us of our humanity .
The artist / curator , in reasserting the significance of the human gaze within Street View , recognizes the pain and disempowerment in being declared insignificant .
The artist / curator challenges Google ’s imperial claims and questions the company ’s right to be the only one framing our cognitions and perceptions .

But it seems clear from forums like this one and so many others that people 's early experiences with mathematics resonate far down the line .
And with math there 's the feeling of absolutes .
Either you are good at it or you 're not , either you get it or you do n't , either you are smart or you are not supposed to get it anyway .
Because math is hard right ?
At the start of the new school year I was embarrassed to show up on the first day and face the other kids who asked me why I was n't in the " smart class . "
I was n't by any means the highest achiever at school , but I still played on the team .
Failing made me want to cling to my smart label even more , yet because of that one class I felt it all slipping away .
My sense of identity was at a fragile state , resting timidly on band stickers I put on my book covers and the macrame in my locker .
I think failing math hit my sense of self confidence pretty hard .
I hated math .
I hated it for making me feel stupid , and I hated it because there was nothing enjoyable about it .
It was just there , like a big black wall I would run into every once in a while .
It would stare me down , not letting me know why it was there or why I should care , just intimidating me and forcing me to walk around it .
Like a good teenager , in the face of my frustration and my shortcomings , I rebelled .
I slunk into my new class with scowling eyes and a plan of attack : I would push my frustration back on the establishment .
I would not conform to math !
Math was pointless , suppressive and totalitarian .
The whole thing stifled my creativity and individuality .
I , forward thinking 8th grader that I was , would not be contained by such a bourgeoisie institution .
Like I said , it was 8th grade .
Passions were high and political terminology was new .
I believed there was nothing this teacher could do to make math any less frustrating , or to make me feel better about being held back .
I was ready to hate the crurel , toad - like miser who would waddle up to the chalk board and scratch out meaningless equations that he would force me to memorize .
Oh , what a shock he was in for .
And then my plan immediately started to crumble when I found out that my teacher was young and female , and began the class with a hands - on demonstration about geometry and a short lesson in physics .
This was the first real class she 'd taught , and while I still harbored hopes that she would be mean or useless , she turned out to be neither .
She was funny .
She talked to us about what math meant , where we could find it in the world , how it was applied and why she loved it .
Maybe that was more of a shocker than learning what math was good for .
Finding someone who liked it just because .
I did n't know on the first day that I would eventually come to trust this woman like a close friend , and confide in her the anger I felt at not understanding .
And while I did n't realize it at the time , the fact that she was female was also having an affect on me .
That 's not to say things turned around right away .
The first few weeks of class went something like the previous year - I 'd sit up late at the kitchen table with my dad , trying to make headway on my assignments and frequently breaking down into tears of frustration .
I felt like a failure , and I was anxious and afraid to go to school the next day with yet another incomplete assignment .
Worst of all I felt helpless to change the situation .
No text book could tell me what I needed to know , and this was before we were privy to any online homework sites .
My dad did the best he could , but he was n't a math whiz either .
He tried to be patient and would sit and read through my text book , trying as hard as I did to understand it all .
A few times I turned my frustration around on him and would storm up to my room , doors slamming .
The big black wall was surrounding me .
I could n't find a way around it , I could n't see where I was going and I was starting to feel like any confidence I had in my intelligence was all wrong .
The first Friday afternoon in class , my new teacher opened up a book called " Five Minute Mysteries . "
These short stories were all like episodes of Law and Order or Murder She Wrote , in which a tantalizing mystery needs to be solved .
At the end of the story you are asked to solve the case , and the answer is listed at the end of the book .
Personally , I thought of them more like episodes of The X - Files ( in retrospect I still harbored the geek gene ) .
I had read shorter versions of these stories as a kid and I loved them .
I loved hearing them and thinking , thinking , thinking , and then getting the answer .
These stories were a strong teaching tool , because through them my teacher revealed the essence of mathematics .
Each problem is a mystery waiting to be solved .
If you learn to speak the language and acquire the tools , you can break down the mystery , interview the witnesses and balance the equation .
Quite frequently , the path to the solution is not straight forward , but the result of a series of creative moves .
This connection to something that I loved so much started to push back the big wall .
It gave me some space to breath .
I felt like maybe I could stick with a math problem if I thought the ending would be like solving a little mystery .
I can't recount all of the teaching techniques that my teacher used to help me understand things .
I do remember afternoons in her classroom , still struggling with problems .
She saw the tears a few times .
I remember in class playing with demonstration toys and doing group exercises .
I remember when the after school homework sessions started to change .
I was still getting the answers wrong , but at some point I finally trusted my teacher , and her abilities , enough to start asking the " stupid " questions I 'd kept hidden in my previous classes .
I was n't afraid to tell her , after fifteen minutes of struggling , that I still did n't get it .
And I remember that she was not only patient but happy to be there , excited by math and glad to walk me through things as many times as I needed .
It takes a lot of questions to get the answers in mathematics , and quite frankly , I think many teachers are not equipped or not willing to listen to them all .
One winter day , I distinctly recall sitting all the way through algebra , tapping my foot in anticipation of its end .
As soon as the bell rang , I hopped up and ran to the front .
I grabbed my teachers attention and began to spout off what I felt was a perfectly wonderful and exciting story of how I 'd solved one of the homework problems .
I 'd told her how I 'd thought it was funny that I could n't do it at first and how I finally figured it out .
After that day , I genuinely started to look forward to math class .
Slowly the dark , unreachable cliff that stretched up before me and all around me , fell away .
The wind came in and the sun came out and I was sailing over a vast open sea .
New skills appeared on the horizon like islands , and I navigated the rough waters with patience and confidence .
It was fun to see how fast I could shake the answer out of a short problem , or take a tricky word problem and gently extract the equation .
I was Moulder .
I was Scully .
I was good at math .
I still did n't think I 'd become a physics major , even at the end of high school when I 'd finished up two years of calculus .
With two more great teachers along the way I 'd fallen in love with that subject as well , although I was still never the very best at it .
I just acquired the tools and continued to crack the cases .
There are many people who can't focus on math unless they have the application close at hand , and while I like this , I think there are many people who would truly enjoy the satisfaction of solving math puzzles if they only had someone to help them overcome the big wall .
It 's a mind block for many people to learn the language of math , but it 's not impossible .
Like learning any language it's often stressful enough to try to string together the correct words in the correct order without considering implication and tone .
But at some point the words just start to flow .
This topic seems to generate more discussion than many others on this site .
There are probably many folks who feel the way I did , maybe without realizing it : that they want to understand math , and want to get around that wall , they just do n't know how .
I give so much credit to this teacher I had , and many others I had after her , and I continue to believe that good teaching has everything to do with getting kids to move past that wall early .
Students should have the resources and support to approach their frustration with math as many times as it takes to move past it .
In my time at the American Physical Society I worked with members of the education department there .
Their group explored how one of the biggest problems in our primary school education system so far as math and physics goes , comes down to a lack of communication between teaching departments and math and science departments at universities .
Quite often , even if undergrads want to become math and science teachers , they are separated from taking real math and science classes .
This lack of communication also means that those departments do not assist in building curriculum that the future math and science teachers take .
Just like any other subject , teaching mathematics is not the same as teaching English or history , and the curriculum needs to reflect that .
So it 's true that math class is tough .
But I so titled this post in a swing of irony .
When the phrase " Math class is tough , " was uttered by Teen Talk Barbie at her debut in 1992 , Mattel was met with some understandable outrage .
The comment , coming from a female cultural icon , was not sympathetic or followed up by a " But we 'll get through it ! "
It implied what too many people have already pointed out : giving girls the notion that they will do worse in mathematics than boys , or are less apt to do well , is a self fulfilling prophecy .
Talking G.I . Joe never uttered such a phrase .
I wo n't ever be able to measure how much of a difference it made that my eighth grade algebra teacher was a woman , but I know it did .
The struggle that I had with math was definitely not unique to my gender , but in a male dominated field , it did change how I overcame it .
I 'm not sure where I 'd be if I had n't accepted the idea early on that not only could I do math , but I would not be anomaly or rarity if did .
Women do math , just like men .
And some women will fight to study what they love no matter what ; but why should they have to ?
Talking Teen Barbie is only one example of the many gender biased sentiments expressed by kid's toys these days .
Comedian Jared Logan remarks that commercials for girls ' toys during Saturday morning cartoons are alarming in their disregard for eliminating stereotypical gender roles ( " It 's like Susan B. Anthony caught an assassin 's bullet and suffrage never happened . " )
He goes on a rant about a fictional " Shop ' till You Cook " game for girls .
On that note , I 'll leave you with a segment of an NY Times article that some of you may remember from 1993 , when a group of people took this issue into their own hands :
Your son tears the wrapping paper off his fierce new " Talking Duke " G. I .
Joe doll and eagerly presses the talk button .
Out comes a painfully chirpy voice that sounds astonishingly like Barbie 's saying , " Let 's go shopping ! "
Does your son :
A ) Furiously vaporize the doll with his own phaser rifle ?
B ) Go shopping with Joe ?
C ) Say : " Mom , I suspect we 're the lucky victims of an elaborate nationwide publicity stunt designed to ridicule sexual stereotyping in children 's toys .
This barbaric little action figure you gave me may turn out to be a valuable collector 's item . "
If the answer is C , your son may be a collector 's item himself , for he has correctly divined the latest socially conscious news media prank to hit the nation 's toy stores .
Painstaking Alterations
For the last several months , a group of performance artists based in the East Village of Manhattan has been buying Talking Dukes and " Teen Talk " Barbies , which cost $ 40 to $ 50 each , painstakingly swapping their voice boxes and then , with the aid of cohorts , replacing dolls on the shelves of toy stores in at least two states .
The group , which asserts it has surgically altered 300 dolls , says its aim is to startle the public into thinking about the Stone Age - world view that the dolls reflect .
The result is a mutant colony of Barbies - on - steroids who roar things like " Attack ! " " Vengeance is mine ! " and " Eat lead , Cobra ! "
The emasculated G. I . Joe 's , meanwhile , twitter , " Will we ever have enough clothes ? " and " Let 's plan our dream wedding ! "
The Home Office is unlikely to respond to an invitation to see how a UK identity card was cracked and cloned .
A Home Office spokesman confirmed it had received an offer from Adam Laurie , an expert in radio frequency identification ( RFID ) technology , to demonstrate how he cloned a government - issued ID card with little more than a mobile phone and a laptop .
The spokesman said the Home Office was developing an industry - wide approach to implementation and security issues associated with the card and could not respond to individual matters .
He could not give details of how or when such an approach would be made .
Security features
" The identity card includes design and security features that are extremely difficult to replicate , " the Home Office said in a statement .
Earlier it described the widely reported story of Laurie 's hack as " rubbish " .
Laurie told Computer Weekly that he was waiting for the Home Office to respond to his offer to disclose how he did it .
He said it was normal among security researchers to give suppliers a chance to fix security breaches in their systems before taking the matter further .
Laurie said he had been interested in security weaknesses with respect to the RFID technology used in the UK 's e-Passports .
He had wondered if there were similar weaknesses in the ID card , which is now being issued to foreign nationals .
" It turns out there are , " he said .
Fake ID card
Laurie corrected one aspect of earlier reports that he had changed and added information to the original card .
" What I did was use the information on the card as a template for a new card that I wrote my own data to , " he said .
That data included a digitised picture of himself , his digitised fingerprints , and a message that read , " I am a terrorist - shoot me on sight . "
" That data was read and accepted by the Golden Reader tool , which is the same reader used at border control to read the passports , and presumably by the readers that the Home Office has still to issue , " said Laurie .
The Golden Reader tool was developed by secunet Security Networks AG for the German Federal Office for Information Security ( BSI ) .
It is a piece of software designed to read passports securely .
It supports extensive cryptographic methods and has been used widely to test the interoperability of ID systems .
A German researcher , Lukas Grunwald , demonstrated at the 2006 Black Hat security conference how he used Golden Reader to clone an ICAO ( International Civil Aviation Organisation ) e-Passport of the type issued in Britain .
The Home Office spokesman said , " The card readers we will deploy will undertake chip authentication checks that the card [ Laurie ] claims to have produced will not pass . "
This Glenn Beck boycott is fascinating .
I wrote a post for Andrew Sullivan on the substance of the matter last week , and I think it holds up okay .
Let me just say that I continue to be amazed that some people think there is a free speech issue here .
It seems to me that the right to free speech does not give you the right to massive corporate underwriting .
Glenn Beck can defend " the white culture " and call Obama a " racist " in poverty and in private .
What I 'm interested now is the economics of the boycott .
Thirty - six companies have apparently signed on .
And while it appears that some of them never advertised with Beck in the first place ( oops ) , many if not most of them did .
To which Fox responds :
While the advertising boycott has generated substantial media coverage , Fox News said it has not impacted the network 's revenues or Beck 's audience .
" The advertisers referenced have all moved their spots from Beck to other programs on the network so there has been no revenue lost , " a spokeswoman said .
I have had enough tangential experience with the wacky world of marketing and advertising to believe that what this Fox News spokeswoman says is true .
But I still wonder :
Why is it true ?
It 's not clear that there should be " no revenue lost " in this situation .
The major components of a net - zero energy home as part of GE's Net - Zero Energy Home project .
Credit : General Electric .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Using solar panels , wind turbines , appliance monitoring , and on - site energy storage , General Electric has a plan to enable homeowners to cut their annual energy consumption ( from the electric grid ) to zero , in some cases , and at least minimize consumption in others .
GE is piloting the technology this year , and hopes to commercialize the system by 2015 .
The GE Net - Zero Home Project encompasses a variety of technologies , as well as consumer incentives .
The most expensive part of the project involves on - site power generation through solar panels or wind turbines , where applicable .
As GE executives explained during a recent symposium at the company 's Global Research Center in Niskayuna , New York , a 3,000 - watt solar panel array could be enough to supply all of a home 's consumption , and cost about $ 30,000 to install .
GE is also converting its appliances ( for about $ 10 per appliance ) to be able to communicate with a home 's smart meter , allowing consumers to find out how much energy individual appliances use .
The information will hopefully allow users to control appliances by using them during off - peak times ( peak times are usually morning and early evening ) , encouraged by time - of - use pricing plans .
Homeowners would also use an energy monitoring device called Home Energy Manager , which costs about $ 200 - 250 .
The Home Energy Manager is designed to control and optimize on - site energy generation and consumption , such as by running the dishwasher or clothes dryer at times when the solar panels are operating , and not during peak times .
As part of the project , plug - in electric vehicles would be charged during the night .
The vehicles and other storage batteries could also be used to store electricity for use during peak times .
Overall , a net - zero energy home would cost about 10 percent more than the conventional kind , but would help homeowners save money in the long run , as well as make the electricity grid more efficient .
If the system is easy to use and offers financial incentives for customers , GE hopes that it can encourage involvement where everyone can benefit .

“ Over the last year or two with all the difficult problems in the financial services sector , many of us have lost track of the fact that most of these stocks do follow economic growth .
So when GDP is doing well , financial services tend to do well at the same time , ” she said .
The third quarter is looking stable for companies , said Cohen as most firms have held profit margins up well even during the difficult portion of the recession .
She said the cost containment and improvement in margin would be beneficial for companies in the second half of the year .
Additionally , because companies and investors tend to look at profits on a year - over - year basis , " the third and fourth quarters of last year were dreadful so the third and fourth quarters of 2009 will not only good , but fabulous by comparison , ” she said .
In terms of the unemployment situation , Cohen said there are slow , but steady signs of improvement in the labor market .
“ Whether the [ employment ] number comes in light or unpleasant tomorrow , we ’re seeing improvement even in the labor market — it appears the job losses are slowing and there is some job creation going on , ” she said .
“ But labor markets are unlikely to turn all at one or on a dime .
We have many more months of difficult labor situation ahead even if the recession using GDP or industrial production is almost over . ”
The trend now is to eliminate all of the borders and leave just the text or icon .
The main argument is that it 's visually cleaner , but to me , it makes it really hard to tell what you can and can't interact with .
If you 're lucky , the person who designed it at least used controls that show borders when you mouse over them .
Otherwise , you have to click all over the window like an idiot , trying to figure out which of the icons do something and whether they do something different than the nearby widgets and text .
It makes me feel like I 'm playing an old LucasArts adventure , mousing everywhere trying to find some object in the dark cave that I can light to get to the two - headed squirrel .
When I first started using UIs that had the 3D look , I loved it because it gave visual cues as to what could be interacted with and what was a container .
Raised objects were things you could drag or twiddle .
Impressed areas grouped things or could accept things .
Flat objects were static indicators .
Sure , there were people who overdid it and made their UI look like an obstacle course , but for the well designed UIs I thought it made a huge difference .

For well - designed UI , the point is moot since the invention of standard controls .
Yuri Khan - 03 08 09 - 18:01
OP , you are 100 % correct , flat buttons are a stupid gimmick and part of the de-functionalization of UI .
It 's just bad design .

Yeah , you 're absolutely rigth .
It seems that pixel - hunting is back again ... Not to mention those ribbon - like interfaces that are clear and useful like that can of gas on mars ...

Please make new flat UI for VirtualDub .
The old one looks very bad compared to other programs ' .

Too much eye candy is sick .

All that together should make a proper comment , but I cant figure how .

User Interface is not about art , it 's about technology .
It 's about ergonomics .
It should n't and must n't and may not Take User 's Attention Away from his / her TASKS .
Otherwise it 's A TOY , not a GUI .
Phaeron , you 're absolutely right !
Jam_One - 04 08 09 - 04:10
IMHO , the current trend is not only to eliminate 3D look  the trend is to produce clean UIs .
If all your windows are dead simple and straightforward to use ( and by that , I mean really - really - really simple , with all optional controls eliminated ) , flat controls wo n't do any harm .
You know , if you need 3D borders to find out how to interact with a window , the application is already doomed .
Andrey Tarantsov - 04 08 09 - 04:29
Most of these modern apps may look " pretty " but who needs a bug ridden app with a shiny UI ?
I prefer an app with less bugs - even if it has an old " Bevel - UI " .
Just look at Office 2k7 - who needs this colorful ribbon ?
They threw away all the customization options for this static crap ?
Still can't believe it !
Murmel - 04 08 09 - 05:11
Do n't forget the trend to make all the UI elements much larger as well , and the trend to remove customisability .
I remain unconvinced that allowing toolbars to be docked to more than one side of the desktop at a time is some awful usability problem , yet in Windows 7 they 've removed that functionality .
Torkell ( link ) - 04 08 09 - 05:19
12 years after WinAmp , the skin craze is still alive and well .
Plus , the Ribbon is just Microsoft cutting support costs .
GrofLuigi - 04 08 09 - 06:17
Outlook express ( windows live mail ) also suffered this horrible flattening .
There is another trend too , getting rid of the menu .
Gabest - 04 08 09 - 08:54
It has nothing to do with cleanliness .
When you have to hover / click on everything , you tend to get more ad clicks .
This is why sites are being designed this way , to further confuse the user into clicking on link ads , moving the cursor around to activate those popup Javascript and Flash ads , etc .
Since the entire world runs on clickthroughs , it seems this design choice is creeping into mainstream desktop apps .

mappy - 04 08 09 - 16:30
@anonymous : Fair enough , although I do n't spend a whole lot of time on my web site .
:)
The kinds of flat UI I was thinking of , though , do n't even have borders of any kind -- they 're literally just floating icons until you hover over them , at which time maybe you might get a border highlight .
I should note that I was talking about desktop app usability .
If we 're talking about web pages , then you could fill an entire book with the WTFs found on the intarwebs .
I 'd attribute it more to ineptitude than to driving ad clicks , though .
As for VirtualDub and enabling the XP visual style , I 've discussed this before : http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/ent..
Phaeron - 04 08 09 - 16:36
I believe that the " flat " look started because of UI situations where there was a limited amount of pixels and 3D effects like drop shadows , highlights , and other " chrome " just eat up valuable pixels .
For some reason , someone decided that flat UIs look cool and started writing desktop software and now operating systems with them .
Personally , I hate those " skinned " desktop apps where the windows are irregular shapes and they do n't have traditional menu bars .
They usually have all sorts of bumps and doodads on their photoshopped app " frame " ( if you can call it that ) and some are clickable , others are not .
This is the sort of thing I 'm talking about , though I 've seen MUCH worse ...
krick ( link ) - 05 08 09 - 13:03
The " flat " button look was just an ongoing evolution in UI design by ( guess who ? ) : some people have short memories .
Rich - 05 08 09 - 16:12
I have to admit that , at least in a toolbar , the lack of borders is less of an issue because you expect everything in a toolbar to be interactive .
What REALLY drove me nuts about the switch to rebars is that they made the menu a rebar too .
That drove me crazy when I first switched to VC6 , because I was in the habit of clicking on the X repeatedly to close all my open docs , and inevitably I 'd undock the menu bar too .
Fortunately , I soon found the well - hidden " use screen reader compatible menus " to save my sanity .
Someone mentioned consistency , which makes a lot of sense .
You can make a good case that flat UIs are perfectly fine as long as the user 's expectations of static versus interactive gadgets hold .
Which unfortunately , they do n't , given how a lot of UIs are laid out .
I have to admit to trying to click on the envelope across from " Inbox " in Outlook , just to see if it was some hidden trove of goodies .
I suppose it 's a good thing I use OpenOffice right now , because if I used a recent version of Office , I might have posted about the Ribbon instead .
Phaeron - 05 08 09 - 16:36
@ PhaeronWell , brace for impact :
Hurd - 05 08 09 - 21:55
We 'll see how it turns out .
Right now it just looks like an AWTesque sea of odd sized buttons , but the devil 's in the details of how it handles organization , resizing , minimization , etc .
The thing that worries me is that OpenOffice has a lot of other issues to work out , and this will be a distraction .
It was only recently that Writer got overlining ....
Phaeron - 06 08 09 - 18:22
The complaints I 've seen around Ribbon before has mostly been from " experienced " people that just do n't like to " learn " a new UI .
I know several " inexperienced " people that had trouble with the older Office UI , but could get started with Ribbon right away .
Personally I think Ribbon is great .
Intuitive grouping of buttons / icons instead of tons of small buttons / icons cluttering the toolbar .
I hope you did n't switch to OOo just because of Ribbon , considering all the faults of OOo .
Nekoneko - 06 08 09 - 18:59
Nope , I have n't actually tried a version with the Ribbon yet .
I actually installed OpenOffice because I needed to draw diagrams and was too cheap to buy Visio .
I 've been tempted to go get a recent version of Excel , though , because OpenOffice Calc 's AutoFilter is missing some options , and I really love AutoFilter .
It 's a great way to avoid having to write a real interface for viewing profiling data .
Phaeron - 06 08 09 - 19:14
IMHO the Ribbon interface can be useful for newbies and occasional users , but for abitual and professional users is a real pain in the ass .
It would be nice to have a setting to disable the ribbon - like UI if you need the classic one ( as in the last Autocad release ) .
@PhaeronDo n't ever use a ribbon - like or a bloated eye - candy UI on VirtualDub !!!
The Bishop - 06 08 09 - 19:44
> Personally I think Ribbon is great .

I find it anything but intuitive - I tried using Office 2007 for a while , but gave up in the end , because I spent too much time searching for the less common commands ( I know keyboard shortcuts for the commonly used stuff ) , and there 's a ton of stuff that simply is n't available on the ribbon ( and you need to add it to that one pathetic toolbar at the top of the screen that they still allow you to customize ) .
Not to mention that the ribbon completely ignores system colour scheme , making Office 2007 yet another application with ugly skinned buttons and no respect for user preferences ( but hey , the programs in Windows 7 do the same thing , so it should be fine , right ? )
ender - 07 08 09 - 03:13
I have to say , this discussion has gotten a lot more amusing .
Probably the only conclusion I can derive is that no matter what UI change is involved , someone will hate it bitterly .
Phaeron - 07 08 09 - 16:03
I agree , this is just dumb .
While I 'm fond of minimalistic design , in the UI department visuals need to assist intuitive functionality .
If designers are so in love with a trend that they lose sight of this principle , they fail at their job .
chevkoch - 08 08 09 - 02:55
An application - ui should seamlessly integrate into the style of the current desktop .
On win7 it should show a ribbon and on xp not .
And this default should be changeable in the applications config .
phobie ( link ) - 12 08 09 - 22:05
Everything is great unless a designer gets his hands on it .
I myself have to develop user interfaces that shuuld match both , practical usage and to comply with the style guide of the designers .
This is always impossible and for usual our customers are not happy with the useability of our software although the group of designers calls themselves " Ease of Use " .
We have just been through to design all our rectangualar buttons to circle - shaped ones .
The problem for me was that round buttons need much more details to make the circle look like a circle and not like part of jigsaw puzzle .
So now on our slow Window CE handheld it takes just 3 seoónds instead of 1 before to switch from one dialog to another .
But for the customer the problem was more evident :
While I could write three lines containing up to 10 characters in a rectangular button the message in a round button is only two line with 7 chars .
That meant lots of abbrevations and misúnderstandings .
Some of the designers also came up with the idea to change the color of the background with the function invoked insteas of highlighting or outlinig the button .
Looked good for two functions but with 64 buttons and 64 colours it is a mess to use .
Our customers could not remember the colours and wanted back the function of outlining the button if its function is active .
Back in 1990 I was always longing for a new version of EXCEL , Windows or WinWord .
The new functions were intuitive and easy to find .
There was no need of a user manual .
Everything was evident .
AND : Old functions kept their location and their design .
Now new functions of those programs are made for a few people only .
Essentially I do n't need them .
However to be up to date I have to upgrade and spende most of my time for the new version in finding my old and needed functions in their new clothes .
They changed view and location ( and sometimes also functionality ) .
So designers put fashion into software .
What shape of button is modern , which one is obsolete .
I just came back from a shopping - tour I saw that designers even do not stop when fahsioning Software .
No now they 're putting hands on hammers , screw - drivers , wrenches , saws , pinces etc .
They just gave the grip of those tools a fancy flower pattern and my wife was really happy with it .
Of course she does not have to work with and will not be shocked these tools are covered with black grease of my car bearings .

It sounds like you had more of graphic designers driving your UI rather than usability experts .
I would expect a usability expert to be at least familiar with some basic principles of accessibility , and specifying a UI that had 64 colors for signaling is even worse for color - blind people .
Also , if you were going to modify the shape of the buttons , it would make far more sense to vary the shape of the buttons according to function rather than change from one uniform shape to another ....

The point is not " flat " , " 3d " or any other design , the point is " Dose the icon behave like an icon ? "
A icon is ment to represent some thing with out the need for words .
E.G. Witch icon represents " Photo's " better the one on iOS 6 or on iOS 7 or some other icon ?
Which icon represents " Settings " better ?
Yes I know they have words under them but the hole point is a icon should not need words .
Being dyslex .....
I understand this and so should a good designer .

In light of the upcoming return of the human race to the Moon , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) has partnered , among others , with Goodyear for the development of an airless tire to be used on extra-terrestrial surfaces .
Called the " Spring Tire , " it features 800 load bearing springs , designed to carry much heavier vehicles over much greater distances than the wire mesh tire previously used on the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle ( LRV ) .
" With the combined requirements of increased load and life , we needed to make a fundamental change to the original moon tire , " Vivake Asnani , NASA principal investigator said in a release .
" What the Goodyear - NASA team developed is an innovative , yet simple network of interwoven springs that does the job .
The tire design seems almost obvious in retrospect , as most good inventions do .
" The new tire is very different than the ones seen on Earth roads .
Due to the fact that regular rubber , pneumatic ( air - filled ) tires are as useful on the Moon as " cash for clunkers " is without government money , its creators had to think up new ways of designing the tire .
With that in mind , the new tire was created to withstand the sharp temperature differences .
According to Asnani , the Spring Tire will not blow out if it is punctured .
Should a puncture occur , it would affect only one or a few of the 800 load bearing springs .
" Along with having this ultra- redundant characteristic , the tire has a combination of overall stiffness yet flexibility that allows off - road vehicles to travel fast over rough terrain with relatively little motion being transferred to the vehicle , " Asnani said .
Fun and interesting , you might say , but not as fun and interesting as what is to come .
Presented at NASA 's recent " " exhibit at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington , DC , the tire turned a lot of heads ... Heads which have the decision - making - skills required to make the technology available for Earth roaming vehicles .
" Virtually everyone I spoke with was blown away by the idea that this technology may one day be used , not only for extraterrestrial vehicles , but also , perhaps , for vehicles here on Earth , " Asnani concluded .
This is the fourth post in the article series " Vim Plugins You Should Know About " .
This time I am going to introduce you to a plugin called " snipmate.vim " .
If you are intrigued by this topic , I suggest that you subscribe to my posts !
For the introduction and first post in this article series , follow this link - Vim Plugins You Should Know About , Part I : surround.vim .
Snipmate.vim is probably the best snippets plugin for vim .
A snippet is a piece of often - typed text or programming construct that you can insert into your document by using a trigger followed by a < tab > .
It was written by Michael Sanders .
He says he modeled this plugin after TextMate 's snippets .
Here is an example usage of snipmate.vim .
If you are a C programmer , then one of the most often used forms of a loop is " for ( i=0 ; i< n ; i ++ ) { ... } " .
Without snippets you 'd have to type this out every time .
Even though it takes just another second , these seconds can add to minutes throughout the day and minutes can add to hours over longer periods of time .
Why waste your time this way ?
With snippets you can type just " for<tab > " and snipmate will insert this whole construct in your source code automatically !
If " i " or " n " were n't the variable you wanted to use , you can now use < tab > and < shift - tab > to jump to next / previous item in the loop and rename them !
Michael also created an introduction video for his plugin where he demonstrates how to use it .
Check it out :
How to install snipmate.vim ?
To get the latest version :
1. Download snipmate.zip .
2. Extract snipmate.zip to ~/.vim ( on Unix / Linux ) or ~\vimfiles ( on Windows ) .
3. Run : helptags ~/.vim /doc ( on Unix / Linux ) or : helptags ~/ vimfiles /doc ( on Windows ) to rebuild the tags file ( so that you can read : help snipmate . )
4. Restart Vim .
The plugin comes with predefined snippets for more than a dozen languages ( C , C++ , HTML , Java , JavaScript , Objective C , Perl , PHP , Python , Ruby , Tcl , Shell , HTML , Mako templates , LaTeX , VimScript ) .
Be sure to check out the snippet files in the " snippets " directory under your ~/.vim or ~\vimfiles directory .
If you need to define your own snippets ( which you most likely will need ) , create a new file named " language - foo.snippets " in the " snippets " directory .
For example , to define your own snippets for C language , you 'd create a file called " c- foo.snippets " and place snippets in it .
To learn about snipmate snippet syntax , type " : help snipmate " and locate the syntax section in the help file .
Have Fun !
Have fun with this time saving plugin !
I 'll take six of the $ 200,000 ramen - making robots Yoshihira Uchida built for his noodle shop Momozono Robot Ramen .
The robot crafts completely customized ramen broth — there are over 40 million flavor possibilities you can configure .
Mmmmm .

The robot makes the soup , which customers order from a computer screen , where they can switch up the amount of soy sauce , saltiness and richness to make the perfect broth .
Uchida has n't quite figured out how to completely replace humans yet , however , since they still make the noodles and add the toppings , though automating those tasks is next on his list .
Still , even using meatbags , the entire process of assembling a bowl of ramen takes just two minutes .
Yeah , faster than crappy instant noodles .

The Property Council of Australia says Sydney 's CBD has suffered the biggest drop in demand for office space on record .
In the six months to July , vacancy rates rose from 5.4 per cent to 7.7 per cent - which is above the national CBD benchmark .
Walsh Bay was the only exception , with demand for office space increasing .
The council 's Executive Director , Ken Morrison , says the figures are not surprising given the economic downturn .
But he says that he is concerned about new spaces planned in the next two years .
" We have seen a number of projects cancelled or deferred , " he said .
" But there are still projects going forward so really all eyes will be on the demand for office space and those employment numbers to see whether those projects get filled up or not . "
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. regularly provides its top clients with stock - trading tips that differ from the firm 's published research reports , The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday .
The report said that the firm's GS , +2.12 % researchers hold weekly meetings , referred to as the " trading huddle , " at which analysts discuss their latest views of individual stocks , and that those views are passed on to the firm 's top clients and Goldman traders who run the firm 's own money .
The paper , citing company documents , said few of the firm 's clients who receive written stock research from Goldman ever hear or know about the views that emerge from the meetings .
The report cited research on asset manager Janus Capital Group Inc. JNS as an example of the practice .
See full story at WSJ.com
It said Goldman issued a report on Janus on April 1 , 2008 , rating the stock neutral , and a day later at one of the weekly meetings told a group of Goldman traders that the stock was likely to go higher .
Following that meeting , the paper reported that research department employees called about 50 favored clients , and passed on the information about Janus from the meeting .
Goldman 's clients who receive written research did not find out about the bullish update until six days after the call to top clients , according to the report .
The report cited critics of the practice , who argue that the policy hurts customers who do not receive the updates .
The report quoted a Goldman Sachs spokesman in its story saying , " Analysts are expected to discuss events that may have a near - term or short - term impact on a stock 's price . "
He further told the paper that earnings estimates or stock - price targets " must be published and disseminated broadly to all clients . "
Goldman Sachs declined to comment to MarketWatch on the story .
There have been demonstrations in Egypt over the killing Germany has defended its response to the stabbing of a pregnant Egyptian , saying Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet Egypt 's president to discuss it .
Marwa Sherbini , 32 , was stabbed to death last week in a court in Dresden , a killing that caused outrage in Egypt .
She had been giving evidence against her killer after he called her a " terrorist " in a playground .
The head of the Arab League told the BBC the incident reflected a failure of dialogue between civilisations .
Ms Sherbini was stabbed 18 times by a 28 - year - old Russian identified as Alex W , who leapt across the courtroom during an appeals hearing and attacked her in front of her husband and son .
Prosecutors said the Russian , who had been found guilty in November of insulting and abusing the woman , had a deep hatred of Muslims and acted alone .
' Hate crime '
Ms Sherbini 's husband was attacked by the assailant as he tried to defend his wife and was also accidentally shot by German police .
He is in hospital in critical condition .
This is an abhorrent deed , one that has left us all dismayed and shocked
Thomas Steg
German government spokesman
The Egyptian media have expressed outrage , asking how the incident was allowed to happen and dubbing Ms Sherbini " the martyr of the Hijab " , in reference to her Islamic headscarf .
The German government was criticised for what was seen to be a muted reaction .
On Tuesday , spokesman Thomas Steg defended the government 's reaction , saying Germany had " not been silent " , and that early details about the case had not been sufficiently clear for a " spontaneous reaction " .
" This is an abhorrent deed , one that has left us all dismayed and shocked , " he said .
He added that Chancellor Merkel would discuss the incident with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at this week 's Group of Eight summit in Italy .
The Egyptian Secretary - General of the Arab League , Amr Moussa , called the incident a " totally unjustified hate crime " .
" I believe and many of us here believe that what happened is one dimension of the failure of international dialogue and the dialogue of civilisations , " he told the BBC's Newshour programme .
" Many of us believe that it did not trickle down to individuals in so many countries . "
Mr Moussa said he was confident that the German authorities would ensure a just outcome to the affair .

PARIS — It was the French equivalent of former U.S. Senator Ted Stevens ’ description of the Internet as “ a series of tubes , ” which made him the subject of endless mockery on the Web .
In a video shot for an online news site , French legislators were asked whether they were familiar with peer - to - peer file - sharing technology .
“ No , ” one lawmaker responded , rolling his eyes .
“ I speak French .
Excuse me . ”
While France has often prided itself on its contrarian approach to information technology — remember the Minitel ? — the response summed up the ham - handedness of the latest digital initiative by the French government .
The video appeared this spring , at the height of debate about a plan by President Nicolas Sarkozy to set up a government agency to disconnect persistent copyright pirates from the Internet .
The proposal , approved by Parliament last month after an earlier setback , was shot down last week by the country ’s highest judicial review body , the Constitutional Council , which ruled that it violated constitutional guarantees of free speech and the presumption of innocence .
Only a court of law is entitled to sever Internet connections , the council ruled .
The submarines are of the Akula class , a counterpart to the Los Angeles class attack subs of the United States Navy , and not one of the larger submarines that can launch intercontinental nuclear missiles .
According to Defense Department officials , one of the Russian submarines remained in international waters on Tuesday about 200 miles off the coast of the United States .
The location of the second remained unclear .
One senior official said the second submarine traveled south in recent days toward Cuba , while another senior official with access to reports on the surveillance mission said it had sailed away in a northerly direction .
The Pentagon and intelligence officials spoke anonymously to describe the effort to track the Russian submarines , which has not been publicly announced .
President Obama spoke by telephone with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia on Tuesday , but it was not clear whether the subject of the submarines came up , although another source of friction between the two countries did .
Mr. Medvedev called Mr. Obama to wish him a happy birthday and the White House said the president used the opportunity to urge Russia to work through diplomatic channels to resolve rising tensions with Georgia .
The submarine patrols come as Moscow tries to shake off the embarrassment of the latest failed test of the Bulava missile , a long - range weapon that was test fired from a submarine in the Arctic on July 15 .
The failed missile test was the sixth since 2005 , and some experts see Russia ’s assertiveness elsewhere as a gambit by the military to prove its continued relevance .
Chris :
In that sort of time frame I reckon the answer is roughly the same .
It does increase by a small amount .
I think the stated geological figure is about 1 inch every 20,000 years or so .
That 's extrapolated over the lifetime of the Earth .
Most of the water we have comes in the form of comets hitting the Earth .
When the Earth first formed , of course , there was a disc of stellar debris which was basically the material left over from when the sun formed .
Out of that we condensed planets as planetesimals .
They slowly aggregated more material and formed bigger planets .
The material left over was comets and other asteroids and other bodies which were out there in orbit .
Comets are viewed as what are called , " dirty ice balls , " basically lots of water with some other stuff chucked into them .
Occasionally one of them 's going to cross the orbit of another planet , get drawn in by gravity and crash land .
Most of the water on Earth , we think , comes from comets , originally .
Given that they 're not actually that common these days but over the millions of years time scale I 'd say the amount of water on Earth has n't changed a huge amount .
I would add that it probably is increasing very , very slightly .
What do you think , Dave ?
Dave :
There is also the mechanism whereby the Earth loses water .
What happens is , in the upper atmosphere you 've got a little bit of water vapour high up in the atmosphere and it gets hit by ultraviolet light from the sun .
That can split apart into hydrogen and oxygen .
This light hydrogen will tend to float up really high and then get blown away by the solar wind .
It 's a very , very slow process but we are losing hydrogen from the water all the time .
The oxygen will stay on the Earth because it is much heavier .
Chris :
The same thing happened to Mars , did n't it ?
About 4 billion years ago , when Mars was about 400 million years old , it lost its magnetic field because the planet got too cold to have a liquid iron core .
Because that 's how the planet generates its magnetic field , it could n't therefore have a magnetic field .
That meant it was vulnerable to the solar wind which was just plucking all of the gas , the atmosphere and the water from the planet and it dried out .
Dave :
And also to Venus .
Venus is very similar to the Earth but has a much weaker magnetic field which tends to protect it from the solar wind .
We think that Venus at the moment is about 500 degrees centigrade on the surface and the difference between Venus and Earth is that the Earth has a magnetic field which stops it losing water .
Venus has lost all its water .
Megan Fox vs Angelina Jolie : Who ’s Hotter ?
THE GREEK GODDESS
This is literally one of the hottest debates in showbiz .
On one side there is Megan Fox who is hot , sexy and young and on the other there is Angelina Jolie who has established her sexiness a long time ago .
Who is hotter ?

Several comparisons have been drawn between the Transformers and Tomb Raider stars .
Megan had even been called the ‘ Angelina clone ’ and ‘ Angelina 2.0 ’ .
Apple 's App Store is never short of controversy , from shaking babies , to explicit racy content .
The latest disputable app to be approved by Apple and hit the store is ' Cannabis , ' an application that assists users in finding the nearest available marijuana supply .
The application is available for $ 2.99 , and is developed by the " Cannabis lifestyle " folks over at Ajnag , yet they insist that the app should be used for medicinal purposes only .
It will not share the location of illegal dealers , and Ajnag claims not to promote the illegal use of the drug .
' Cannabis ' currently works via location based services , pulling in a users current location and using that knowledge to display relevant information , such as where the closest legal source of Cannabis can be found .
For example it will show users of the application legal dispensaries in over a dozen U.S. States , and for those states lacking medical marijuana laws , the app will point you in the direction of a nearby Cannabis organization .
For International users a display of local legal Cannabis coffee shops will be offered .
In addition to sharing where users can find Cannabis , users can also locate local doctors , clinics , attorneys and more .
It is fairly clear that this application is setting out to make positive steps towards marijuana legalization , but whether people will see it that way is yet to be seen .
This story , " Need Medical Marijuana ?
Yep , iPhone 's Got an App For That " was originally published by PCWorld .

The White House has defended its decision to award the highest civilian honour in the United States to former president Mary Robinson .
President Barack Obama named Mrs Robinson as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom last week .
However , some Jewish groups have criticised the move over her stance on Israel .
US pro-Israeli lobby group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) expressed concern at the award .
" Mary Robinson , who was one of the people responsible for the 2001 Durban conference against racism descending into an anti-Israel propaganda forum , is not an appropriate recipient for one of our nation 's highest honors " , the Committee said in a statement issued yesterday .
" In fact , awarding the Medal of Freedom to Mary Robinson does great dishonor to the many outstanding men and women who have received it in the past , " the coalition said in a statement .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Mrs Robinson was being recognised because she was a prominent advocate for women ’s rights in Ireland and around the world .
Mr Gibbs said she had made statements that President Barack Obama did not agree with , but that was likely to be the case with a number of the 16 people he planned to recognise for their lifetime achievements .
Last week , the White House praised Mrs Robinson ’s contribution to human rights rights at home and internationally .
" Mary Robinson was the first female President of Ireland ( 1990 – 1997 ) and a former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( 1997 – 2002 ) , a post that required her to end her presidency four months early .
Robinson served as a prominent member of the Irish Senate prior to her election as President , " The White House said in its citation .
" She continues to bring attention to international issues as Honorary President of Oxfam International , and Chairs the Board of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations ( GAVI Alliance ) .
Since 2002 she has been President of Realizing Rights : The Ethical Globalization Initiative , based in New York , which is an organization she founded to make human rights the compass which charts a course for globalization that is fair , just and benefits all " , it concluded .
Mr Obama will award the medals at the White House on August 12th .

Expertly said , Gadfly Brad :
" All of that in contrast to the massive and real grassroots protests that occurred over the last eight years over disastrous and actually illegal Bush Administration policies that were carried out with nary a peep of corporate media coverage ( other than to marginalize , lampoon , and otherwise disparage them as " unAmerican " ) ... "
I KNOW and it 's killing me .
I can see this freight train trend barreling it's way down the tracks at us with all the force of the recent super - sonic corporate and alternate media coverage of the freaky , felonious birthers .
Nothing better exemplifies the " Braindead Megaphone "
http://kottke.org/07/09/the-braindead-megaphone
( visionary , must read essay by George Saunders that describes in detail this right wing " town hall " strategies outlined , above . )
Why did n't we think of this eight years ago ?
Silly us .
We spent all that time trifling with facts and evidence .
Stupid of us to have been so smart .
How retarded to be consumed with the veracity of our stats , data and our glass reputations --- when it did n't make a snow - mogul hold of a difference .
Clearly , I should 've just stormed Kathy Dent 's office and started screaming about how she likes to kill kittens while waving around a little plastic baggie full of Kitten Skulls .
At least the ramping and amping of this frenzied , wild - eyed fear and hatred from the radical right wing base further confirms our suspicions surrounding the REAL national dynamic we all thought ( and Steve Freeman / Joel Bleifuss confirmed ) might be closer to the actual demographics in 2004 .
That " One State , Two State Red State , Blue State " was a giant lie and a crazy , crooked , loud , white , nasty minority had seized control and were calling the shots .
And now I sigh , dejected , to realize that they still are .
Stupid oxygen pigs eating up all the airtime on both my bastardized , demon - seeded TV and my less - than - virgin - but - still - sacred , holy internet .
As always , your astute take on these megaphone morons is refreshing , and much appreciated .
But please Brad , please do n't continue to feed them to me .

Civil unrest seems to be increasing by each passing day .
I see the GOP using freedom of speech to incite folks while trying to take away my freedom of speech , i.e. , Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin .
And then there are those birthers against Obama ; yet the real birther story was the VP pick that continually spewed lies to the American people .
http://palingates.blogsp...gnancy-is-hot-topic.html
Now bloggers on personal blogs telling their stories are accused of being journalists and being outed causing threats of harm or lawsuits .
Or the allegation that bloggers are operatives for Obama working on a plan .
The GOP new strategy tactics are a threat to me and my safety and security .

Karen from Illinois - re : ~obama has always said he wants a public option , wether the reps and the pretend blue dog dems give that to him and us is another story ~
Uh , so no .
Obama has not " always said " this .
http://www.salon.com/opi...ature/2009/05/22/moyers/ quoted from the link above - " May 22 , 2009 | In 2003 , a young Illinois state senator named Barack Obama told an AFL - CIO meeting , " I am a proponent of a single - payer universal healthcare program . "
There was only one thing standing in the way , Obama said six years ago : " All of you know we might not get there immediately because first we have to take back the White House , we have to take back the Senate and we have to take back the House . "
Fast - forward six years .
President Obama has everything he said was needed --- Democrats in control of the executive branch and both chambers of Congress .
So what 's happened to single payer ?

And , even now Obama 's supposed support for the very weak Public Option ( as put forth in H.R. 3200 ) is full of equivocation .
The H.R. 3200 version of the Public Option is a gift to " Healthcare Insurance Companies " .
Obama says " health insurance reform " nowadays .
Hmmm ... right .

In reality it is different , but in practice it is not different .
They have legislated an almost seamlessly clear road for vampire capitalism , corporatism so powerful as to be hurtling toward frank fascism .
So even if they forgot to clear something , left a loophole upon which to hold them liable , they will not be held liable .
In a fascist state , the elite are exempt from prosecution for any crime ... even war crimes and treason and murder ... while the general public can be prosecuted just about at whim , or on the flimsiest excuses ... with no habeas corpus , no rights ... slaves that can just fuck off and die if they do n't like working and paying their brains out ... including if they outright CAN'T .

In any event , I certainly was n't paying attention to HuffPo at the time .

Brad 's coverage of this ( the 2004 debacle ) , from the get go , was stellar .
Oh , and , Kerry totally sucked when this post- election eve stuff started coming down , and thenceforth .

My Mother
In - law died of smoking related illness 10 years ago .
Lung cancer that progressed to a systemic cancer .
She died in a hospice that gave 24 - 7 care by angels in human form .
About 6 months from diagnosis to death .
Want to know the total cost of the Chemo , of the surgery , of the hospice care ... nothing , zero , nadia , not a single dollar .
I live in New Zealand and have a population of about 4,000,000 people ... can somebody tell me why America can not match this or even better this health care ?
I think I know the answer , a handful of people are using you for their betterment , they do n't care if you live or die .
They only see you as " profit or lose " .
I have watched your Elections be stolen , your country do pre-emptive war and all of your " freedoms " trod on but em-mass you espouse to be the " only super power " ... fuck how glad I am to live in a country that is n't a " super power " , I can not remember how many years I 've watched America decline , I was a " Founding member " at Blackboxvoting.org .

Disruptive sabotage of discussion and debate is an old but effective right wing intimidation tactic .
I first noticed it used in 2000 and the Florida recount ; the * Brooks Bros. riot * .
The town hall disruption tactic and Brooks Bros. riot type shenanigans are so reminiscent of Nazi Germany it 's eerie ... I 'm not exaggerating .
Our MSM has been totally bought up , bought out and put to sleep .
The MSM are lapdogs to corporate right wing interests , and they air - publish - spew corporate right wing lies and propaganda with impunity .
That 's the only reason that a crazy clown like Michelle Malkin can have a seat at the table on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos and be taken seriously ... It was amusing to watch Cynthia Tucker glare at Malkin when she parroted right wing lies ... George Stephanopoulus should be shot for not challenging Malkin 's stupidity ... Malkin was allowed to spew her filth unchallenged .
This small but highly vocal right wing robot army has hijacked our country ...

The health care insurance industry spent $ 130 million in the past quarter to preserve its multi-billion dollar profits --- profits for the select few at the expense of the health and very lives of the American people .
We are all aware of the degree to which corporate monies in the form of campaign contributions and lobbying , and limitation of corporate media coverage to corporate - sponsored candidates , has corrupted our political system .
But this new tactic entails an effort to silence the people 's voices at one of the oldest forms of democracy in these United States --- the town hall meeting .
These staged wing - nut protests are , according to Keith Olbermann , being carried out by " a front group maintained by corporate funded Americans for Prosperity , now busing people all over the country to town halls . "
Their organized verbal assaults are being misrepresented in the right - wing echo chamber as reflective of how " we the people " truly feel --- this , despite polls showing that 2/3 of Americans favor a single - payer system .
One way to counter the echo chamber ’s propaganda would be for people like Sibelius to ask all those in the audience at the town hall meeting who came out of a desire to bring meaningful change to a corrupt , dysfunctional and deadly for - profit health care system to first raise their hands .
Then , with cameras rolling and 90 % of the audience holding up their hands , to stand , face the wing - nuts and shout , in unison , “ Leave ! Leave ! ”
The other way to counter the valid criticism of the costly , hybrid " public option " legislation , is for the Obama administration and the Democratic leadership in Congress to abandon this pseudo - reform in favor of the only measure now before Congress that offers real reform --- H.R. 676 Medicare for
All which would eliminate the unnecessary parasites --- private for - profit carriers & HMOs .
The health of our people is not a commodity !
Beyond that , the question remains as to whether we are still the United States of America , or whether we should now be known as the United Corporations of America .
The choice is not right or left , but democracy or oligarchy .

Mick ,
Nice to hear from someone else with the good stuff .
Here in the Czech Republic they still do n't fully grasp the angels at the hospice concept , but they 'll soon be there .
My wife 's three years of repeated surgical procedures and rounds of chemotherapy did pretty much wreck my life , but at least my healthcare were minimal - about 50 dollars ( per diem hospitalization charges ) in total .
The 60 or 70 bucks a month I spend ( used to be 25 bucks a month when the bubble frenzy was in full bloom ) covers full health , including eyes and teeth and psyche .
It 's utterly transparent : the only people who do n't want a single - payer system are the scoundrels who have been , are , and hope to continue making a killing off of the misfortunes of the rest of us .

The example you provided , Big Dan , is an excellent one .
Voter News Service exit- polls proclaimed Al Gore the winner in Florida by a whopping 7.3 % --- some 435,000 votes .
This prompted some networks to announce a Gore victory , a decision abruptly reversed when John Ellis , Bush ’s cousin , later that evening , announced over Fox News that George W. Bush had won .
NBC seconded Fox ’s call at the behest of GE CEO Jack Welch .
Within minutes the other networks followed suit .
Upon its acceptance across the spectrum of the corporate media , it mattered not that the initial pronouncement came from Bush ’s cousin over the airwaves of America ’s most ideological network or that the scientific evidence to support the pronouncement was sorely lacking .
Bush won .
We know that because the corporate media said he won .
Operating at a perceptual disadvantage from the outset , the Gore legal team did not help its cause by focusing on punch cards in Miami - Dade when the real story lay in Florida ’s patchwork quilt of disparate voting systems and in voter suppression .
Miami - Dade used a hand - held stylus .
Fail to apply sufficient pressure and the ballot is left with a dimpled or a hanging chad that interferes with the machine counting , but which does not prevent a tedious , ballot - by - ballot examination , like the court - ordered one which had been underway when staffers from the offices of Republican Congressmen Tom DeLay and Tom Sweeney , along with the future U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations , John Bolton , staged what to most Americans appeared to be a spontaneous protest but was actually a carefully orchestrated , Nazi brown - shirt like riot .
The count stopped , never to start again .
The Gore team not only failed to recognize that the evidence of Republican electoral theft lay in the technological manipulations of electronic DREs and optical scanners .
Gore failed to appreciate the duplicity of the corporate - owned media or its ability to manipulate perception through image .
The televised image of Miami - Dade Canvassing Board officials squinting , staring at dimples and hanging chads , suggested an exercise in futility .
Gore was not simply a sore loser ; he was the Caine Mutiny ’s Commander Queeg ordering a search for the missing strawberries .
The image of clean - cut men in starched white shirts and ties , by itself , did nothing to suggest that the “ Brooks - Brothers riot ” was merely a calculated event carried out by Republican ideologues .
To the contrary , it conveyed the image of otherwise law - abiding citizens whose anger had been aroused by an illegitimate effort by the Gore team to steal the election .

BlueHawk , there 's another method to keep the people down .
It 's the opposite of the " fake grassroots crowd " raising hell .
It 's where the officials start accusing people in their presence of being x , y , z where x = disruptive , y = threatening , and z = violent .
It 's all pure crap , but it give them an excuse to use local law enforcement against the public , end the discussion and clear the room .
And to the guy who said " it 's beyond belief they keep getting re-elected "
It is n't beyond belief it 's physics and science is how they get re-elected .
physics where electronic signals can have no public oversight .
and science where the corporate media can eliminate candidates or steer issues to where the average busy human has no time or will to research and counter the propaganda .
America is broken .
And it 's going to get much worse now , the liars in the fed and the oath breaker enablers in the Senate have guaranteed we will be seeing some pretty bad shit pretty soon .
As soon as the boyz stop reach the end of their rope and their book cooking lies can't be hidden anymore .
Already the math is fucked .
Anyone with a 6th grade math skill set can see the shit does not add up .
I expect the forthcoming bond market collapse may finally wake the masses up to the corruption running our country .
And yeah I already do n't like Obama .
Everyone whined about how he was only in for less that 100 days , well he 's not straightening out our constitution , the spying , the torture , the wars , the looting of our country .
You want to get these fuckers out of our government the only way I see it is to get the electronic voting machines out of our elections and have 100 % public oversight until the election is made official .
This means no mail in voting , no electronics , no corporate media allowed to steer issues .
Otherwise I really do n't see much of America except more death , destruction , mayhem , corruption , media propaganda , Oath Breakers , basically hell on Earth .
So screw it .
Let 's let the fucking thing crash , instead of fighting against each other .
Really a full fall off the cliff of bullshit , is the only way we can restore the constitution at this point .
I am sure some well armed cops and veterans would disagree with me , but they need to step back from their meds , and ask themselves why the fuck they allowed the media to do what it does now , where they were when the electronics infiltrated the election process , and lastly what part of protecting the constitution against all enemies they did n't get .
A simple compare of where the Constitution was --- oh lets say 10 years ago compared to where it is currently .
They screwed the pooch is what happened .
It should have been challenged to the death when the first fucker said they were going to shread it .
So as you sow , so shall you reap .
( to steal back from a bible expression )
My advice is have some extra food water , and sit back and watch as the whole thing goes to shit .
I hope I am wrong , but I doubt I am .

They need to be smacked down early and loudly .
If you do n't , it will end up being a game played on their court and they will win .
If the ' birther ' idiots had been met with loud and aggressive resistance immediately the debate on that would have ended long ago .
I suggest local pro-universal health - care groups to go to the meetings and just shout the disruptor 's down with things like ' bully " ' whore ' etc .
Then go to any meeting by a Republican or Blue Dog and as a group use either the same tactics or other very aggressive tactics ( verbal ) to shut down the Republican Representative 's propaganda session .
Ca n't the Dems and the pro-universal health care people get it together enough to rent a bus and cart some folks around like the knuckle dragging insurance company whores do ?

You want our food , fine eat , be merry and weigh 750 pounds , I hope you have a heart attack .
I hate .
and I mean HATE officials who go around with that arrogant attitude , that some person from the unwashed masses is n't more coherant then they are , that what the unwashed masses say is n't as important at their standard operating procedure and policy .
Even when you tell them their policy is allowing terrorists to pick our officials in our elections --- they still have you removed .
I say fine .

Mick Sorry to hear about your mother in law but am glad of the care she got from hospice .
My own mother died very recently and also recieved some care from the Hospice .
Their facilities and care are unsurpassed .
I think the entire world may be at risk with a push for a global currency in which case we will loose even more of our soverenty to the people who control the international monetary system .
Those people have the US millitary at their disposal so it may be very difficult for anyone to oppose .
Sorry to say
Mick that this may not just affect the US in the slightly longer term .
We must all fight now if its possible and it probably is n't .
My own health and circumstances are not in a good state or I 'd be doing much more .

Bloody Wingnuts
They have advised our NZ national party in past elections and I 'm sure did at the last election .
The media spin machine , the moneyd elite and the polling companies were in full throttle here in NZ during our last election .
Pollsters never mentioned or researched the undecideds much who amounted to about 10 % of voters .
They presumed that those voters were an even mix of right and left wing voters which migh have been correct .
I did a bit of research and found a poll that questioned the undecideds on a taxation issue and they sided heavily ( 98 % ) with the far left of the spectrum .
Had that 10 % of voters been tossing up between NZ Labour , the Green Party or the Maori Party then we could have had a left wing alliance here in NZ if they had voted .
However the media and polling companies kept ignoring that 10 % as unimportant or unfathomable .
The end result was that we had the lowest election turnout in many years and the right wing party won .
The question remains " Did left wing voters not turn out because the polls predicted an overwhelming National Party victory "
If that 10 percent had been mostly left wing voters and had voted we would have had a completely different outcome here .
In NZ the Nats get electerd when there are poor election turnouts .
The right wing National Party know this and I suspect our polling companies assited them to victory buy leaving out important information , making a left wing alliance seem impossible to keep left wing voters away from the polls .
I
may be wrong here but without analysis of the undecided voters we will never know .

valley girl ,
i have heard obama say that if he was starting from scratch , single payer would be the way to go but since so many peops are happy with their employer insurance that creating a public option would help keep insurance companies " honest " as to what a public option would look like perhaps those of us that have too high an income for medicaid could simply pay into it on a sliding scale .. that is basically how kid care is handled in illinois ... my grandson has good insurance for $ 15 per month thru the state the thing i worry about with the goverment getting involved in healthcare is that they will use our own medical records against us ( in illinois if you have cancer and u test positive for mj they will with hold chemo if u have medicaid ) if obama doesnt get this done before the 2010 elections , it wont get done .. even tho the public is fed up with the neo con crowd , they still own the machines and even worse the neo cons own the soe reporting programs ( bbv/ s middleman articles ) so dems are gonna lose seats and possibley a few govenorships ( imagine illinois going red ) i am personally angery with our new president about a number of issues ( illegal wiretapping , lack of justice in the justice department , refusal to prosecute cheney , bush , rove ) but so far his handling of the healthcare debate has been what he promised on the campaign trail ( as i see it )

What comments in particular are wingnutty ?
The comments that Obama is mr status quo , continuing illegal wiretapping , continuing to hold prisoners indefinitely without charge , to refuse to push for a single payer solution , to support corporate interests over those of the people ?
How about the fact that republican operatives actually did fabricate phony protests in the Florida recount debaucle ?
( well documented see reference ) .
Reference : http://politicalhumor.ab...rary/blfloridagopmob.htm
How about that the current town - hall shennanigans have exactly the same demeanor as the FL 2000 recount phony protests ?
Which one of those is wingnuttery ?

It was good to hear Olbermann last night , right out there talking about fake grass roots movements .
I have n't heard that on my television before .
I do n't just think these groups are infuriating , I think they have been instrumental in doing all the damage we 've seen over the last 35 years .
There are SO many of them : American Enterprise Institute
Heritage Foundation
Club For Growth
Americans For Tax Reform
The Christian Coalition
The Moral Majority
Family Research Council
On and on and on !
There are also local fake groups too .
Until yesterday , these groups have not been exposed at all , and if fact show up all the time on C - Span without explanation as to what they 're up to .
There is a need to get this out there .
A real grass roots movement should have honorable goals that do n't involve getting rich .
I better stay away from these town hall meetings because if one of these damned tea - baggers starts yelling in my ear that he does n't want health care for the express purpose of shutting down a conversation , I 'm going to yell him down until be both get thrown out .
The bad thing is that the media will take his side , even knowing what is going on .

Of course , the alternative to either of our group actions would be to erect a set of rules of decorum for town hall meetings , provide warnings and ask the police to cuff & frog march those who insist on engaging in disorderly conduct after being given fair warning .

84 , Lottakatz Technically it's a strategy .
NOT a surrender .
I am thinking bigger .
Like restoring the Constitution bigger .
So if everything comes crashing down cause these fascists are given everything they want and drive it all off the cliff .
The end result is the fascists go off the cliff and we can all start fresh .
Having 65 Trillion stolen dollars in a backpack is n't going to help the theif swim across a river , or run from an angry mob , but it will ultimately bring an end to theft .
If officials want to live in a bubble away from the unwashed masses , then let 's make damn sure the bubble is completely air - tight , so when it 's finally screwed up , they carry the can , or bubble fate if you will .
Technically the surender has already happened , as we have been tricked ( by Corporate media and government corruption ) into allowing the Constitution to be shreaded ( because terrorism will never stop ) , and we allow our officials to operate outside of the rule of law ( in a war which will never end . )
Questions like what ( Can a Citizen , or Active Duty Military ) do to stop an oath of office breaker are not ever going to be clarified to the public , law enforcement or the military by the same people who are breaking their oaths on a daily basis .
Would n't it be funny if the next group of military recruits when raising their hand for the oath , stopped and asked , what do we do if we find someone who has attacked our constitution ?
Probably not funny , because there is no answer !
I been asking this question for several years now .
And if they are answered it will be where the citizen , law enforcement or military will have made some mistake or be powerless and without a toolset to take action .
Absolute authority is not going to accept the fact they themselves are corrupt , instead you will be the one who is corrupt , I will , etc .
They can't maintain absolute authority , if they follow the rule of law to hold them accountable .
In essence they are never wrong , We are .
Which is also why our elections have been compromised from every possible angle they can get into .
Invisible Electronics , no oversight , registration deletion , Corporate Media issue / candidate steering , etc .
They will do anything to protect this power base from being subjected to the rule of law .
Which is why they just change the law to justify their authority .
Ultimately , if you press officials too hard they can make you can disappear forever under some fucking patriot act / terrorism law .
So what part of the constitution is that in ?
What part is adding a fios splitter ?
This is nuts , and it 's just like
The sheriff of Nottingham , only our little towns are big cities and the taxes are going to the fascist banksters who do n't have to take any oath .
Fighting directly is n't working .
Since 2004 most of us here have fought to get rid of these machines , so what has the results been ?
Have we made it better ?
Forced Mail
In Voting = FAIL ( no oversight )
Electronic Tabulation Devices = FAIL ( no oversight )
Public Oversight = FAIL ( blocked by untrained cops , instead of supported by local cops )
COURT BATTLES = FAIL ( timing as a weapon , irrelevence at judgement time )
Legislation = FAIL ( bad legislation , over and over )
internet voting = FAIL ( the brave new world )
auditing = FAIL
( After years of battle over getting some kind of evidence that election fraud has happened , instead we showed everything was crackable , penetrated , abused and yet here we are still using the same unauditable electronic devices with the same flaws )
Corporate Media = FAIL ( blacklisted discussion , while showing how smooth everything is . )
We are arguing against ourselves .
We are already divided .
We are good people , who live under a failed government on the brink of monetary destruction .
Corporate Media has turned our minds to mush .
There are so many mental mind fuck contradictions now , it would be a simple matter to declare someone suffering from PTSD .
Except we do n't have insane people officially ( sic ) --- more to do with not taking responsibility -- and monetary reasons .
If you try to fight this system , depending on how far you go , you are going to suffer , be humiliated , or die .
I can argue and argue and type these blog messages over and over and it does n't mean a damn thing , nothing will change until corrupt officials and banksters die of old age .
We should smile , give them what they want , and help them expedite it to their dungen .
We are not far from a bond collapse .
( No longer is it * IF * , it 's * WHEN * )
The electric bill wo n't get paid and it will be time to oust these corrupt officials , as we will no longer have a choice as their malfeasance has run it 's course and gone too far .
My prediction
If there is another unknown , uninvestigated " terrorist attack " at or around the same time the bond market collapses it wo n't be a coincidence , it will be a false flag distraction .
Just like the anthrax letters were .
Boy they sure investigated that well .

Note to Tea Baggers ;
You 'll notice a lot of white hair in the photos of the screaming mob .
They want to keep the health insurance they have .
Guess what , it 's called medicare .
It 's NATIONAL GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTHCARE .
My parents love it .
The private health care they had before was the result of hard bargaining by my mother 's teacher 's union .
Yet they are in the front lines of the " Tea Baggers " and these events , because they 've been told to believe " Obama Care " means health care will be rationed and old people will be left to die .
And they will have to sign over their social security ( which their boys tried to take away ) to get it .
Although the legislators are now in recess and have a month to look this over and make improvements ( write your representatives NOW )
They keep screaming " They gave it to the legislators with only one night to read it and said they had to pass it ! "
Unlike the Patriot Act , this has not happened , but they keep repeating this .
It is insane .
They spit ' socialism !!'
every chance they get .
Most of my friends are self - employed entrepreneurs .
Small business people .
And they would like to see some relief .
I personally pay almost $ 7,000 a year in premiums , my employer pays the other half .
Cancer is not covered , a lot is not covered .
The deductibles for my family add up to another $ 3,000 + so if we get sick we are looking at a minimum of $ 10,000 not including co-pays , not allowed charges etc .
One of my self - employed friends is paying $ 19,000 / year in premiums alone .
I challenge every one of the ' protestors ' to give up their medicare , their military medical or their corporate plan and pay out of pocket what my friend and I pay .
We have no choice .
My employer offered 3 choices ;
Sucks , Really sucks and you 're not going to get much of anything covered , but you 'll still have a job .
My daughter has now aged out of my plan and we can not afford to cover her and she can not afford to cover herself .
Hip hip hooray for privately run health insurance !
I can't answer questions about the specifics in the legislation suggested .
I am very disturbed by the change in rhetoric from health care reform to health insurance reform .
If these idiots would listen instead of making it impossible for the legislators to explain what is being considered , they might discover how many of us are really on the same page .

There is no comparison .
I did n't need a memo to tell me that the war is corrupt .
They ( you ? ) definitely needed a memo to convince you to fight against your own interests .
You hear these people saying stuff like , " keep government out of my Medicare ! "

And it 's ignorance fomented by those who would profit the most from that ignorance .
Nobody makes money on stopping the war - on the contrary - right ?
Nobody has a stake in my success in my fight to stop the war , get good health care for all , have an economy that works for everyone etc .
Nobody - except for all of the people in this great country .

Wait a minute , we 've got two meanings to this headline .
1 . Hired GOP Wingnuts are traind to disrupt Town Hall Meets .
2 . Anyone who is upset about the Health Bill and expresses it , is considered disruptive AND , therefore , a GOP thug .
See what I mean ?
-----------------------------------------
This country is broke .
We , The People , have lost our inalienable rights .
Socialism seems like a wise choice when we 're facing a future with no health care at all .. maybe for most Americans .
HOWEVER , when you have no Constitutional Rights to protect community , yourself and your family , Socialism becomes something else , entirely .
If we had our US Constitution intact , as well as a Congress we could trust to defend the Republic ( aka inalienable rights ) ... no matter what the Democratic ( majority rule ) Congress votes on , then The People could trust this sort of policy making to be fair .
We are all concerned with what is best for the disadvantaged , disabled , elderly and those facing destitution due to our economy being in such peril .
If you READ THE HEALTH CARE BILL , you 'll find there is much ABOUT YOU in it .
Enough to really make your hair stand on end - and you 'll have plenty of questions you 'll want to confront your Congressman about .
But being a Left - Winger , like me , you might feel uncomfortable about that .
After all , we would n't want to be stereotyped as a GOP informant if we feel upset and express that .. we would n't want to look like we actually have something in common with Republicans , either .
Folks ... I come from a VERY LeftWing upbringing and ancestry .
I have opened my eyes to a new insight about ' mass manipulation ' of the ' Left vs Right ' paradigm .
I have seen how this polarity is used against us , making damn sure we NEVER see eye to eye , as fellow Americans .
As long as we fight each other for the crumbs , we 'll never see the truth ( which is making its getaway in a Brinks Security Truck )

At about 8:00 pm Sunday night , as he was waiting to depart at JFK , a Delta Airlines pilot spotted something strange floating through the early afternoon sky , seemingly coming down to land on runway 22 R .
He radioed the control tower , reporting what " looks like a guy on a paraglider " approaching the airport .
The controller then warned nearby pilots to look out for a " kite . "
Shortly after , the Delta pilot radioed back in to say that the paraglider had touched down , dropped something off , and quickly took off into the night sky .
" Looks like he hit the ground , dropped something off .
Now he 's airborne again , " the pilot reported , adding , " I guess it ah , looks like some guy on a parachute . "
The unidentified object / person then took off in the direction of oncoming traffic .
The location of the supposed touch - down was " near the Varig cargo building , on the northern border of the airport , adjacent to the approach paths for 22 R and 22L , " FlightGlobal.com reports , but after authorities reportedly searched the area , they " found no trace of the UFO . "
YouTube user aeronauticstud who posted the tower communications sums up the incident , writing , " Something flew over 22L and 22R causing an American 767 to go around 22L to avoid it .
Later ended up closing 22 R for 5 Police helicopters to search for him and forcing several aircraft to divert due to being restricted to one runway .
Seemed to come down to about 10 - 20 feet off the cargo ramp possibly dropping an object and then climbing to 1000 feet flying outbound on a 030hdg on an active final approach ! "
If something was indeed dropped off , and never recovered , this presents a pretty serious security breach at the city 's busiest airport .
Gizmodo is thankful nothing happened , but aggressively questions the incident , writing , " What the hell was he or she dropping ?
Why nobody has found the dropped object yet — if there was actually anything ? "
Almost a week later , nobody knows .
You can listen to the radio communications below .

Joe the lead role in the movie he 's making at the moment : Orgazmo , which is about a sex superhero who fights crime with his Orgazmorator , and ChodaBoy , his sidekick .
Joe , against his beliefs , takes the job so that he can pay for the wedding he plans for himself and his fiancée , whom he does n't tell about his risqué new acting job .
However , when the movie becomes an amazing hit just about everywhere and he finds out that Ben ( ChodaBoy ) has created a real Orgazmorator , Joe is in some serious hot water !

Kerala has an abundant supply of coconuts , but few people to pick them A southern Indian state is offering 1 m rupees ( £ 12,500 ) to anyone who can invent a coconut - picking machine .
A labour shortage in Kerala has reduced the size of the state 's once - bountiful coconut harvest .
The offer of funding from Kerala 's industries department is open to anyone around the world who can devise a machine to reach coconuts at 30 metres .
The number of coconut pickers in India has declined since the decline of the country 's ancient caste system .
Coconuts have to be plucked once every 45 days and those who own the trees are finding it increasingly difficult to find professional pickers .
Many young men now shun coconut - picking in favour of white collar jobs , meaning there is no longer a guaranteed labour force .
The total production of coconuts in Kerala fell from 6,001 million to 5,564 million between 2005 and 2008 .
Huge demand
The winning machine must be operated from the ground , Kerala 's industries department insists , and must reach 30 metres into Kerala 's coconut palms .
It also has to be inexpensive to construct and operate , and easy to move around , the government says .
Industries Minister Elamaram Kareem said current machines that operate at tree level were not good enough .
" We call upon anyone to develop a product that can be used to pluck coconuts standing on the ground .
" Anyone wanting to go ahead with this should submit a design and if it is approved they will be given Rs 1,000 , 000 to develop this product , " the minister said .
The winning machine was certain to be hugely popular because there would be so much demand for it , he added .

When Amazon got rightly torn to shreds for remotely killing copies of 1984 on the Kindle , I thought it would be the most idiotic tech story of the year .
But I was wrong .
Apple ’s just upped the ante by banning rude words from a dictionary application – stripping us of the virtual equivalent of looking up obscenities in French class .
Ninjawords Dictionary , a dictionary app from the creators of the excellent website of the same name , is available from the iTunes Store for £ 1.19 .
When you go to download it you will be faced with a warning that it “ might contain material objectionable to children under 17 ″ .
Based on conversations I overhear on the train daily , I think that ’s unlikely .
That warning is just the start of Apple ’s interference with the dictionary .
It ’s also made the creators omit words it considers objectionable , such as the “ c- word ” , as my nan would put it .
That ’s right app fans , Apple just censored a dictionary .
Go in to any school and you ’ll find English dictionaries on the shelf , accessible to children and absolutely chock full of “ objectionable ” words .
Best start burning them because Apple ’s made us realise that words can definitely hurt you .
Or at least , your sales in the iTunes App Store .
Initially Apple refused to approved the app because it contained rude words , so the developers made it possible only to find them if you explicitly ( pun intended ) searched for them .
That was n’t enough – Apple wanted them removed completely .
Apple emailed the developers to remind them that : “ Applications must not contain obscene , pornographic , offensive or defamatory content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs etc ) … ”
Finally it told Ninjawords that the only way the app could make it into the iTunes App Store was with a +17 age rating .
Even after Apple had forced the developer to sanitise the dictionary , it was not allowed to be made available to everyone .
This confused and contradictory approach to approving apps is becoming a common occurrence but it ’s disappointing from a company with the marketing skill of Apple .
In 1984 , Apple produced and aired a one time only TV ad .
Directed by Ridley Scott , the “ 1984 ” spot featured an unnamed heroine smashing the screen on which a Big Brother - like dictator was lecturing a docile lecture hall .
It made major allusions to George Orwell ’s Nineteen Eighty - Four and was an unqualified hit .
It ’s time someone in Apple got their copy of Nineteen Eighty - Four out again and had a little read .
The protagonist , Winston Smith , works at the Ministry Of Truth amending records and articles to make them conform with Big Brother ’s will .
Sounds familiar does n’t it ?
Protecting children from porn and violence content is one thing , erasing words from a dictionary is quite another .
Come on Apple , use some common sense .
NEW DELHI : India could be inching towards becoming a net rice importer by 2020 , an Assocham study has warned .
Rice Report of 2009 , brought out by The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India ( ASSOCHAM ) warns that India might become a net importer of Rice by 2020 in case it fails to maintain 1.75 % per annum growth in its yield for next 10 years .
The rice yield growth in India at current rate is estimated at 1.18 % and needs to be accelerated at 1.75 % consistently for a decade , otherwise at 1.18 % growth rate , India���s rice production would reach at levels of 108 million tones by 2020 against its projected requirement of 118 million tones .
In such a scenario , India would naturally become a net importer of rice , forewarns the ASSOCHAM Rice Report of 2009 , findings of which are released here today by its President , Mr. Sajjan Jindal .
The situation is likely to worsen in the coming time if the current scenario of faster growth in consumption over production continues in future .
If remedial measures are not taken on timely and targeted manner , it will challenge the self sufficiency of the country in rice .
Yield growth is likely to slowdown if the new high yielding varieties are not introduced in a time bound manner and efforts to improve the irrigation facilities are delayed .
Consumption , on the other hand , is expected grow at a rapid pace in the country even if there is slight decline in per capita consumption population growth will keep pushing it .
The consumption growth is likely to outpace production increase , which might hurt the exports of the country and in case of pronounced slowdown in productivity growth it will inevitably lead to insecurity and deficiency on food front .
If we presume less severe conditions for next decade and expect population growth to decline to 1.6 % and assume per capita consumption to remain steady at current 78.5 kg per year , the country will still require about 109 million tonnes of rice in 2020 , the study says .
Further , if the acreage remains stagnant in the next decade and the country manages to keep the average yield growth of 1.18 % of the last decade in the forthcoming years , the production is likely to grow to about 108 million tonnes .
So , in such a case , the country will become net importer of rice .
The report , therefore , suggests that there is a dire need to increase production of rice to cope with the growing demand with increasing population .

A Nowra man is in a stable condition in hospital after he was impaled by a garden stake in a motorcycle crash , then reportedly robbed and assaulted at the accident scene .
A South Eastern Sydney Illawarra Area Health Service spokesperson said the 39 - year - old man , who was airlifted to St George Hospital on Sunday afternoon , was originally admitted in a serious but stable condition but had since improved .
The man allegedly stole a motorbike and was riding it along Adelaide St , Greenwell Point , when he lost control and slid into a garden bed at 1.45 pm on Sunday .
Crash victim robbed while impaled on stake A timber metre- long garden stake was driven through his right armpit and out his back , while a puncture wound was also found on his leg .
NSW Ambulance officers said they responded to reports of a man who had a garden stake in his torso and required surgical intervention .
Paramedics arrived to find the man conscious and the stake already pulled from his body .
Nowra police said there was no motorcycle at the scene when authorities arrived .
A source said the owner of the bike had caught up with the rider , pulled out the stake and punched him on the nose before taking his wallet and reclaiming the motorcycle .
The injured man was taken to hospital suffering internal injuries and a suspected broken nose .

This is a simulation of a double pendulum .
For large motions it is a chaotic system , but for small motions it is a simple linear system .
You can change parameters in the simulation such as mass , gravity , and length of rods .
You can drag the pendulum with your mouse to change the starting position .
The math behind the simulation is shown below .
Also available are : open source code , documentation and a simple - compiled version which is more customizable .
For small angles , a pendulum behaves like a linear system ( see Simple Pendulum ) .
When the angles are small in the Double Pendulum , the system behaves like the linear Double Spring .
In the graph , you can see similar Lissajous curves being generated .
This is because the motion is determined by simple sine and cosine functions .
For large angles , the pendulum is non-linear and the phase graph becomes much more complex .
You can see this by dragging one of the masses to a larger angle and letting go .
We regard the pendulum rods as being massless and rigid .
We regard the pendulum masses as being point masses .
The derivation of the equations of motion is shown below , using the direct Newtonian method .
Kinematics of the Double Pendulum
Kinematics means the relations of the parts of the device , without regard to forces .
In kinematics we are only trying to find expressions for the position , velocity , and acceleration in terms of the variables that specify the state of the device .
x = horizontal position of pendulum mass
horizontal position of pendulum mass y = vertical position of pendulum mass
vertical position of pendulum mass θ = angle of pendulum ( 0 = vertical downwards , counter - clockwise is positive )
angle of pendulum ( 0 = vertical downwards , counter - clockwise is positive ) L = length of rod ( constant )
We place the origin at the pivot point of the upper pendulum .
We regard y as increasing upwards .
We indicate the upper pendulum by subscript 1 , and the lower by subscript 2 .
Begin by using simple trigonometry to write expressions for the positions x 1 , y 1 , x 2 , y 2 in terms of the angles θ 1 , θ 2 . x 1 = L 1 sin θ 1 y 1 = −L 1 cos θ 1 x 2 = x 1 + L 2 sin θ 2 y 2 = y 1 − L 2 cos θ 2
The velocity is the derivative with respect to time of the position .
x 1 ' = θ 1 ' L 1 cos θ 1 y 1 ' = θ 1 ' L 1 sin θ 1 x 2 ' = x 1 ' + θ 2 ' L 2 cos θ 2 y 2 ' = y 1 ' + θ 2 ' L 2 sin θ 2
The acceleration is the second derivative .
x 1 '' = −θ 1 '2 L 1 sin θ 1 + θ 1 '' L 1 cos θ 1 ( 1 ) y 1 '' = θ 1 '2 L 1 cos θ 1 + θ 1 '' L 1 sin θ 1 ( 2 ) x 2 '' = x 1 '' − θ 2 '2 L 2 sin θ 2 + θ 2 '' L 2 cos θ 2 ( 3 ) y 2 '' = y 1 '' + θ 2 '2 L 2 cos θ 2 + θ 2 '' L 2 sin θ 2 ( 4 )
Forces in the Double Pendulum
upper mass
lower mass upper masslower mass
We treat the two pendulum masses as point particles .
Begin by drawing the free body diagram for the upper mass and writing an expression for the net force acting on it .
Define these variables : T = tension in the rod
tension in the rod m = mass of pendulum
mass of pendulum g = gravitational constant
The forces on the upper pendulum mass are the tension in the upper rod T 1 , the tension in the lower rod T 2 , and gravity −m 1 g .
We write separate equations for the horizontal and vertical forces , since they can be treated independently .
The net force on the mass is the sum of these .
Here we show the net force and use Newton 's law F = m a . m 1 x 1 '' = −T 1 sin θ 1 + T 2 sin θ 2 ( 5 ) m 1 y 1 '' = T 1 cos θ 1 − T 2 cos θ 2 − m 1 g ( 6 ) For the lower pendulum , the forces are the tension in the lower rod T 2 , and gravity −m 2 g . m 2 x 2 '' = −T 2 sin θ 2 ( 7 ) m 2 y 2 '' = T 2 cos θ 2 − m 2 g ( 8 ) In relating these equations to the diagrams , keep in mind that in the example diagram θ 1 is positive and θ 2 is negative , because of the convention that a counter - clockwise angle is positive .
Direct Method for Finding Equations of Motion
Now we do some algebraic manipulations with the goal of finding expressions for θ 1 '' , θ 2 '' in terms of θ 1 , θ 1 ' , θ 2 , θ 2 ' .
Begin by solving equations ( 7 ) , ( 8 ) for T 2 sin θ 2 and T 2 cos θ 2 and then substituting into equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .
m 1 x 1 '' = − T 1 sin θ 1 − m 2 x 2 ' ' ( 9 )
m 1 y 1 '' = T 1 cos θ 1 − m 2 y 2 '' − m 2 g − m 1 g ( 10 )
Multiply equation ( 9 ) by cos θ 1 and equation ( 10 ) by sin θ 1 and rearrange to get
T 1 sin θ 1 cos θ 1 = −cos θ 1 ( m 1 x 1 '' + m 2 x 2 ' ' ) ( 11 )
T 1 sin θ 1 cos θ 1 = sin θ 1 ( m 1 y 1 '' + m 2 y 2 '' + m 2 g + m 1 g ) ( 12 )
This leads to the equation
sin θ 1 ( m 1 y 1 '' + m 2 y 2 '' + m 2 g + m 1 g ) = −cos θ 1 ( m 1 x 1 '' + m 2 x 2 ' ' ) ( 13 )
Next , multiply equation ( 7 ) by cos θ 2 and equation ( 8 ) by sin θ 2 and rearrange to get
T 2 sin θ 2 cos θ 2 = −cos θ 2 ( m 2 x 2 ' ' ) ( 14 )
T 2 sin θ 2 cos θ 2 = sin θ 2 ( m 2 y 2 '' + m 2 g ) ( 15 )
which leads to
sin θ 2 ( m 2 y 2 '' + m 2 g ) = −cos θ 2 ( m 2 x 2 ' ' ) ( 16 )
Next we need to use a computer algebra program to solve equations ( 13 ) and ( 16 ) for θ 1 '' , θ 2 '' in terms of θ 1 , θ 1 ' , θ 2 , θ 2 ' .
Note that we also include the definitions given by equations ( 1 - 4 ) , so that we have 2 equations ( 13 , 16 ) and 2 unknowns ( θ 1 '' , θ 2 '' ) .
The result is somewhat complicated , but is easy enough to program into the computer .
θ 1 '' = −g ( 2 m 1 + m 2 ) sin θ 1 − m 2 g sin( θ 1 − 2 θ 2 ) − 2 sin(θ 1 − θ 2 ) m 2 ( θ 2 ' 2 L 2 + θ 1 ' 2 L 1 cos(θ 1 − θ 2 ) ) L 1 ( 2 m 1 + m 2 − m 2 cos ( 2 θ 1 − 2 θ 2 ) ) θ 2 '' = 2 sin(θ 1 − θ 2 ) ( θ 1 ' 2 L 1 ( m 1 + m 2 ) + g( m 1 + m 2 ) cos θ 1 + θ 2 ' 2 L 2 m 2 cos(θ 1 − θ 2 ) ) L 2 ( 2 m 1 + m 2 − m 2 cos ( 2 θ 1 − 2 θ 2 ) )
These are the equations of motion for the double pendulum .
Numerical Solution
The above equations are now close to the form needed for the Runge Kutta method .
The final step is convert these two 2nd order equations into four 1st order equations .
Define the first derivatives as separate variables :
ω 1 = angular velocity of top rod
angular velocity of top rod ω 2 = angular velocity of bottom rod
Then we can write the four 1st order equations :
θ 1 ' = ω 1
θ 2 ' = ω 2
ω 1 ' = −g ( 2 m 1 + m 2 ) sin θ 1 − m 2 g sin( θ 1 − 2 θ 2 ) − 2 sin(θ 1 − θ 2 ) m 2 ( ω 2 2 L 2 + ω 1 2 L 1 cos(θ 1 − θ 2 ) ) L 1 ( 2 m 1 + m 2 − m 2 cos ( 2 θ 1 − 2 θ 2 ) ) ω 2 ' = 2 sin(θ 1 −θ 2 ) ( ω 1 2 L 1 ( m 1 + m 2 ) + g( m 1 + m 2 ) cos θ 1 + ω 2 2 L 2 m 2 cos(θ 1 − θ 2 ) ) L 2 ( 2 m 1 + m 2 − m 2 cos ( 2 θ 1 − 2 θ 2 ) )
This is now exactly the form needed to plug in to the Runge - Kutta method for numerical solution of the system .

The right - wing media have been aghast at the unpleasant realities being reported about all those shouters and disruptors at town - hall forums -- namely , that their anger is being ginned up by corporate interests using right - wing populists to derail their political opponents ; and that their ranks are riddled with extremists .
And to the extent that the critics of these protesters try to portray the scenes as purely a product of corporate machinations , they have a point .
There is real anger out there , and the anti-reform interests are successfully tapping into it .
But the anger they 're tapping into is not a new thing ; in fact , it 's been around a long time .
It 's a larger anger at the federal government , stoked ( as we 've seen in the health - care debate ) by a combination of real grievances and a pathological belief in explanations for those grievances that are provably untrue , wrapped in paranoid conspiracy theories about government officials and a conspiracist view of history .
In the 1990s , they called themselves militias or " Patriots . "
Nowadays , they 're organizing around the so - called " tea parties " and now the health - care town halls .
These are the wellspring of the anger at these meetings -- but this faction has a long history of being motivated by anger anyway .
This is not to downplay the vital role behind the scenes being played by ostensibly mainstream conservative operations , fueled by corporate money .
Adele Stan at AlterNet has a thoroughly devastating expose of the machinations behind the protests , beginning with Dick Armey 's FreedomWorks operation all the way down to the Birther nutcases who are bubbling up at these shows .
Indeed , Stan gets what the rest of the media are missing :
Not only are business and conservative interests ginning up these protests , but they 're doing so by empowering far - right extremists from the fringe .
We 've been reporting steadily on this phenomenon as it's been happening .
Perhaps the best signifier of this empowerment and energizing of the far right on the behalf of the mainstream right is the fact that every single right - wing extremist organization and forum -- ranging from far - right hate groups and white supremacists , such as Stormfront.org , to " Patriot " / militia organizations such as the Militia of Montana and the Constitution Party , to Bircherite conspiracists like Ron Paul and his followers -- are avidly advocating involvement in the " tea parties " and the health - care protests .
And these folks , frankly , are beginning to talk openly of armed revolt .
This is something that used to be relegated strictly to the fringes of the far right ; now , it 's being openly discussed at WorldNetDaily , , which ran a poll with the following headline :
SOMETHING IN THE AIR Is America on the verge of revolution ?
The results :
That 's right : Fully 95 percent of WND 's readership believes we 're on the verge of revolution -- and openly welcome it , with mildly varying rationales .
There is a lot of anger out there .
There 's also a lot of fear .
Both are manifested , I think , in the video I found above at YouTube , titled , " Are Red State Americans Ready for War ? "
You can see the answer , set to the dulcet tones of " Redneck Rampage . "
I 've interspersed it with outtakes of news reports about the ongoing ammo shortage out there in rural America .
So when Glenn Beck starts urging his audience not to indulge in acts of violence , the most disturbing fact is that it 's not only necessary to issue such warnings , it 's probably futile .
Indeed , the pleading -- such as it is -- in the end probably just winds up giving them ideas .
It 's true that people like Beck and the rest of the Fox crew are an important cog in the machinery that sets these protests in motion .
But we also need to be aware of just who they 're setting in motion , because that will have a profound effect on the outcome .

Human population expanded during Late Stone Age Genetic evidence is revealing that human populations began to expand in size in Africa during the Late Stone Age approximately 40,000 years ago .
A research team led by Michael F. Hammer ( Arizona Research Laboratory 's Division of Biotechnology at the University of Arizona ) found that sub-Saharan populations increased in size well before the development of agriculture .
This research supports the hypothesis that population growth played a significant role in the evolution of human cultures in the Late Pleistocene .
There has been a longstanding disagreement whether humans began to increase in number as a result of innovative technologies and / or behaviors formulated by hunter - gatherer groups in the Late Pleistocene , or with the advent of agriculture in the Neolithic .
Hammer 's team surveyed the genetic material of 184 individuals from seven human populations and used a computational approach to simulate the evolution of genetic lineages over time .
The researchers found that both hunter - gathers and food - producing groups best fit models with approximately ten - fold population growth beginning well before the origin of agriculture .
For the first time ever , Hammer 's team was able to investigate the timing of human population expansion by applying sophisticated inferential statistics to a large multilocus autosomal data set re-sequenced in multiple contemporary sub-Saharan African populations .
The team 's finely executed experimental design and use of supercomputing power enabled them to determine that this expansion in population size likely began at the start of the Late Stone Age - a period in prehistory that shows an intensification of archeological sites , an increased abundance of blade - based lithic technologies , and enhanced long - distance exchange .
The next step in the project is to gather more data by testing more populations and additional parts of the genome .

Certain artists establish such a niche for themselves that they become journalistic shorthand for a certain category .
For Chris Morris , the satirist behind The Day Today and Brass Eye , the category is the absurdity of modern media culture : these days , coverage of the latest reality - TV inanity or tranche of government - issued gobbledygook is pretty likely to include an accompanying note of surprise that Morris was n't involved .
From the man himself , however , there has been barely a peep since Nathan Barley aired on Channel 4 in 2005 : a cameo on The IT Crowd here , a report from the Cern Large Hadron Collider there .
Those paying close attention , though , will know that Morris has been at work for several years on a project that marks something of a departure for him in formal terms ( it 's a feature film ) if not in his proclivity for provocative subject matter : Four Lions is a comedy about suicide bombers .
Which is n't to say he is taking jihad lightly : he has embarked on serious research , talking to everyone from police and security experts to imams and Muslim community workers .
( There was also a public spat with Martin Amis along the way . )
On the set of Chris Morris 's Four Lions
Morris 's conclusion , according to the film 's producers , Warp Films , is that it 's a daft as well as a deadly business .
" Even those who have trained and fought jihad report the frequency of farce , " the company has said .
" At training camps young jihadis argue about honey , cry for their mums , shoot each other 's feet off , chase snakes and get thrown out for smoking …
Terrorist cells have the same group dynamics as stag parties and five - a- side football teams .
There is conflict , friendship , misunderstanding and rivalry .
Terrorism is about ideology , but it 's also about berks . "
Morris 's project , they maintain , " understands jihadis as human beings .
And it understands human beings as innately ridiculous . "
A still from Chris Morris 's Four Lions
Made with funding from Film4 , Four Lions includes writing from Peep Show 's Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain .
It was partly shot on the streets of Sheffield – this amateur picture shows Kevin Eldon as an armed police officer – and at one point locations in the Alps were being scouted to double for terrorist training camps .
Official stills released this week seem to be from such scenes .
With editing on the film under way , Warp reports that " its small tornado of industry is now trapped and humming in a box " .
It will be intriguing , to say the least , to see what emerges when that box is eventually opened .

It s simple and its easy to understand .
The People of the day , the Founding Generation , like so many of us today , recognized that a government of strictly limited powers is the only one that has a chance of protecting our liberty  and thats just the kind of government that the People created when they ratified the Constitution so many years ago .
They did this because they knew through their own life experience , that a government without limits is a tyranny .

The 10th Amendment was ratified as an exclamation point on the Constitution  and it lays out in plain English that our federal government is to be one of limited , enumerated powers  not the nearly unlimited , unchecked one that it has become today .
It truly is our modern line in the sand .
On one side , we have those who believe in limiting the power of politicians , and on the other are those that trust the government to do everything .
The 10th Amendment is the safety valve that makes it clear , especially in conjunction with the 9th , that it was The People who created the federal government to be our agent for certain enumerated purposes . and nothing more .
The federal government didnt create itself  and the state governments didnt create it either .
It was The People who created the federal government , and it is the People who are sovereign in the American system .
This couldnt have been more clearly stated than it was in the Federalist Papers , # 22 .
And heres the quote :
 The fabric of American empire ought to rest on the solid basis of THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE .
The streams of national power ought to flow immediately from that pure , original fountain of all legitimate authority . 
And that wasnt Madison or Jay .
It was the man who at the time was seen as the greatest believer in centralized power , Alexander Hamilton .
So , back then , even the great centralizer recognized that power comes from the People .
And that s the way it was at the beginning  and that s the way it is today .

Page styles and page numbering
Many people first encounter page styles when they want to number pages .
OpenOffice.org has a powerful system for numbering pages .
Preliminaries : fields
OpenOffice.org uses a feature called fields to manage page numbers .
To insert a page number field , position the cursor where you want to insert the number and choose Insert > Fields > Page Number .
The page number appears with a gray background .
The gray background denotes a field .
Note :
The gray background is simply there to denote a field .
This background is not printed .
Choose View > Field Shadings ( or press Ctrl + F8 ) to turn this feature off .
If you have seen lists in OOo , you might have noticed this gray background .
OOo lists use fields .
The page number field always displays the page number for the current page .
If you see the words “ Page number " instead of a number , press Ctrl +F9 .
This shortcut key toggles OOo between displaying the field 's contents ( what the field is for ) and the field 's results ( what the field creates ) .
Note :
For a full introduction to fields , see Chapter 14 ( Working with Fields ) .
Inserting a header
In Apache OpenOffice , headers are specified by page styles .
Open the Page Style dialog box for the desired page style ( right - click > Modify ) .
Select the Header tab .
Under Header , check Header on and click OK .
Turn on page header .
At this point you should see the ( empty ) header on the current page .
In the example below , the header area is identified , purely for illustrative purposes .
It would normally be empty immediately after being turned on , until you insert your own header text and formatting .
A page with a page header .
What 's so special about headers ?
The same text in the header appears on all pages with that page style .
( You can experience this yourself by entering some text into the header . )
This property of headers ( or footers ) , along with fields , forms the basis of Apache OpenOffice page numbering .
Tip :
You can also add a header through the Insert menu : Insert >
Header > [ page style ] .
Likewise , for footers : Insert >
Footer > [ page style ] .
Caution : The Insert Menu can also be used for deleting a preexisting header or footer for a page style .
If that page style has a check mark in front of it , pointing to it will open an Apache OpenOffice dialog box warning about this and asking whether you want to delete the header or footer for that particular page style .
Simple page numbering
The simplest case is to have the page number at the top of every page and nothing more .
To do this , put the cursor on the header and select Insert > Fields > Page Number .
Page number inserted in the header .
Presto !
Now , the correct page number appears on every page .
More complex variations
There are a lot of interesting variations that you can apply without further knowledge of page styles .
Here are some suggestions :
Right - align the header to make the page number appear on the top - right :
Place the cursor in the header .
Click the Align Right icon ( or right - click anywhere in the header and select Alignment > Right ) .
icon ( or right - click anywhere in the header and select ) .
Add ( type ) the word page so the header reads page 1 , page 2 , and so on .
This also requires using the Page Number field , discussed earlier .
so the header reads , , and so on .
This also requires using the field , discussed earlier .
Add the document title so the header reads , for example : Joe 's favourite poems , left justified , and page x with right justification , where x is the value of the Page Number field .
Consider using a tab to separate the title from the page number .
, left justified , and with right justification , where x is the value of the field .
Consider using a tab to separate the title from the page number .
Apache OpenOffice also has a Page Count field ( Insert > Fields > Page Count ) .
Using it , you could , for example , have a header that reads page 2 of 12 .
These variations are all illustrated below .
Variations on the simple page numbering method .
Many more variations are possible .
For example , you can use a footer instead of a header to make the page number appear at the bottom of the page .
You can also include the chapter number with the page number : see " Numbering pages by chapter " in Chapter 4 ( Formatting Pages ) .
Example : Restart page numbering : a preface
Some times you want to reset the page number back to 1 .
A typical example is the preface for a book .
A standard preface has the following properties :
Page numbers are displayed in Roman numerals ( i , ii , iii , iv , … ) .
After the preface , the document starts on a Default page .
page .
The page number resets to 1 , and the number format becomes Arabic ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) .
Resetting the page number requires page breaks .
First , let 's get the preliminary work done for the Preface style :
Create a new page style and name it Preface .
Set its Next Style to Preface because a preface could span multiple pages .
Add a header to Preface and insert the Page Number field .
Make the page numbers display as Roman numerals ( i , ii , iii , iv , … ) :
Open the page style window for Preface ( if not already open ) and click the Header tab .
Check Header on under Header .
( if not already open ) and click the tab .
Check under .
Click the Page tab .
Under Layout settings , in the Format drop - down list , set the format to i , ii , iii , .... ( See the bottom right of the figure below . )
Click OK to close the dialog box .
Set page number format to Roman numerals .
After the preface is written , we are ready to restart the page numbering in the main body of the document to Arabic numerals .
Follow these steps :
Make an empty paragraph at the very end of the preface .
Put the cursor on the blank line .
Choose Insert > Manual Break .
Select Page break and choose the Default style .
Select the Change page number check box and set the new value to 1 .
Click OK to close the dialog box .
These settings are shown below .
Set the new page number to 1 and the page style to Default .
Note :
You cannot assign an odd page number to a left page or an even page number to a right page .
OOo strongly adheres to the convention that odd page numbers go on right - hand pages and even page numbers on left - hand pages .
This change is also reflected on the status bar .
The Page section of the status bar now includes both the total page count and the entry of the page number field .
Page number in the status bar .
Example : Different headers on right and left pages
When you insert a header on a page style set up for mirrored pages or right - and - left pages , you can have the contents of the header be the same on all pages or be different on the right and left pages .
To allow different content in headers , clear the Same content left / right check box in the Header area on the Header page of the Page Style dialog box .
Different header content .
Now , you can put the page number on the left - hand edge of the left pages and on the right - hand edge of the right pages , put the document title on the right - hand page only , or make other changes .
An example is shown below .
Different content on left and right pages .
UPDATED : So how is NBC Universal chairman Jeff Zucker going to spin this with The New York Times ‘ Bill Carter ?
Remember when , a few weeks back , a NBC press release called Conan O’Brien the “ King Of Late Night TV ” ?
Looks kinda premature now , huh ?
I ’ve said it before , and I ’ll say it again , NBC ’s mantra that “ We do n’t need eyeballs as long as we have key demos ” does n’t fly .
Actually , both count .
But last week David Letterman posted his largest weekly victory over The Tonight Show since 2000 , while last week ’s Tonight Show posted its smallest audience since Dave premiered in August 1993 .
( Letterman was aided by the booking of Sir Paul McCartney last night ) .
“ This does not bode well for the fall , ” a CBS exec warned .
Here ’s what is worse : Dave ’s Late Show also matched Conan ’s Tonight Show in adults 25 - to - 54 .
Plus , O’Brien scored The Tonight Show ‘s lowest advertiser - coveted 18 - to - 49 rating since Letterman premiered on CBS .
Even Conan ’s margin of strength — 18 - to - 34 — has fallen one full ratings point since O’Brien ’s premiere week on The Tonight Show .
How can Zucker take that to the bank ?
Because Madison
Avenue knows full well that if they want younger audiences with fewer eyeballs , they can buy ads on cable , which is a hell of a lot cheaper than prime time .
Adding insult to injury , Letterman also scored 5 Emmy nominations this morning .
Here ’s the CBS bitchslap , er , news release :
CBS ’s LATE SHOW beat “ The Tonight Show ” by its largest margin in viewers since 2000 , placed first in adults 25 - 54 ( tie ) and narrowed the margin in adults 18 - 49 opposite Conan O’Brien to just - 0.3 of a rating point , according to Nielsen live plus same day ratings for the week ending July 10 .
LATE SHOW beat “ The Tonight Show ” in households ( 2.6/07 vs. 2.0/05 , +30 % ) and viewers ( 3.68 m vs. 2.82 m , +30 % ) .
It was LATE SHOW ’s largest margin of victory against an all first - run week of “ Tonight Show ” broadcasts in both households and viewers since the week ending Feb. 25 , 2000 ( the week David Letterman returned from heart surgery ) .
LATE SHOW has also closed the gap with “ The Tonight Show ” in adults 25 - 54 ( 1.2/05 ) to a tie , CBS ’s closest competitive position since the week ending Dec. 2 , 2005 ( the week Oprah Winfrey appeared ) .
In adults 18 - 49 ( 0.8/04 vs. 1.1/05 ) , LATE SHOW continued to cut “ The Tonight Show ’s ” ‘ lead : - 1.4 in Conan O’Brien ’s premiere week , - 0.6 in the week ending June 12 , - 0.5 in the week ending June 19 and - 0.3 in the week ending July 10 .
Among adults 18 - 34 ( 0.5/02 vs. 1.1/05 ) , LATE SHOW has cut “ The Tonight Show ’s ” lead from - 1.6 in Conan O’Brien ’s premiere week to - 0.6 in the week ending July 10 .
Last night ’s broadcast , featuring Sir Paul McCartney , topped “ The Tonight Show ” by its largest margin since Oct. 16 , 2008 ( Sen. John McCain ’s appearance ) .
This morning , LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN was nominated for five Emmy Awards including “ Outstanding Variety , Music or Comedy Series . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Bernard Madoff , the mastermind behind the largest and most sweeping Ponzi scheme ever , on Monday faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life behind bars .
Madoff is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Manhattan before Judge Denny Chin , who could sentence him to as many 150 years in federal prison .
That is the maximum sentence that Prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney 's office in New York requested , based on the number of Madoff 's victims , the amount of money he stole and the extent of the damage he caused .
Madoff , who was stripped of his property in a legal action Friday , confessed on March 12 to running a Ponzi scheme that stole billions of dollars from thousands of victims .
He pleaded guilty to 11 criminal counts , including fraud , money laundering , perjury , false filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , and other crimes .
Many of his victims were wiped out financially by the scam and they have sent letters to the judge requesting a life sentence .
Madoff 's lawyer Ira Lee Sorkin asked for a 12 - year sentence .
In his own letter to the judge , Sorkin explained that his septuagenarian client is n't likely to outlive his requested sentence by more than a year .
" Mr. Madoff is currently 71 years old and has an approximate life expectancy of 13 years , " wrote Sorkin .
" A prison term of 12 years -- just short of an effective life sentence -- will sufficiently address the goals of deterrence , protecting the public and promoting respect for the law . "
In his letter , Sorkin described Madoff as " non-violent , " noted his " voluntary surrender " to authorities and complained about the " desire for a type of mob vengeance " in the victims ' impact letters .
Madoff orchestrated the scam by masquerading his investment firm as a legitimate business , but the business became a front for a Ponzi scheme , in which the scammer uses fresh money from unsuspecting investors to make payments to more mature investors , creating the false appearance of legitimate returns .
Madoff sent statements to victims claiming that their investments had grown several times over , but in actuality he had stolen , not invested , their money .
Investigators said that Madoff maintained an aura of exclusivity , while his alleged accomplices courted new investors because they needed a constant influx of fresh funds .
Investigators believe that he had been running his scam since at least the 1980s until he finally ran out of money in December 2008 , when he admitted the fraud to family members .
Stripping them of their riches
In a $ 170 billion legal judgment against Madoff , the government announced Friday it had seized all of his property in a deal that also forces his wife to give up homes and property worth millions .
As part of the judgment , the court papers indicate that Bernard and Ruth Madoff will give up any claim on nearly $ 80 million worth of property , which includes $ 60 million and three homes : A Manhattan apartment valued at $ 7.5 million , a $ 7 million house in Montauk , N.Y. , and a $ 7.45 million home in Palm Beach , Fla .
The government will also get $ 1.48 million from the sale of a Madoff home in Cap d'Antibes , France , as well as furniture , artwork , jewelry other items .
The Madoffs will also lose their interest on " tens of millions of dollars " in loans they had made to family , employees and friends .
Previously seized assets include a home in Palm Beach , Fla. , an $ 800,000 yacht named The Bull , and a legitimate investment firm that Madoff kept separate from the scheme .
Restitution for the victims
The value of all the assets will eventually be used to compensate -- or partially compensate -- victims , based on how much they invested in Madoff 's firm .
The Securities Investor Protection Corporation , an organization that shields investors in brokerage firms , will also pay up to $ 500,000 for any eligible claimant who lost money to Madoff , based on how much they put in .
This coverage comes from dues paid by brokerage firms .
Thus far , federal investigators have identified 1,341 investors in Madoff 's firm , with losses exceeding $ 13 billion .
They 're still tallying the damage .
A group of victims sent the judge a 141 - page collection of letters detailing the extent of damage that Madoff had inflicted on them .
Many of the victims said they had banked their life savings with Madoff 's firm and were ruined as a result of his scam .
Eleven of the letter - writers requested , and were granted , the right to speak in court on Monday .
Some victims are unhappy with this compensation system .
Joe Stewart of Las Vegas explained , in a written statement to CNNMoney.com , that as an indirect investor he is not covered by SIPC .
Another victim , Dana Foy of Jemez , N.M. , complained that SIPC will only compensate him for the $ 150,000 he invested in the firm , not the $ 600,000 that the firm told him his investments were worth .
" In any other Ponzi scheme , the rule is [ that ] cash in , minus the cash [ that the investor took ] out , is going to be the value of your claim , " said SIPC Chief Executive Steve Harbeck to CNNMoney.com .
Harbeck said that indirect investors who unknowingly gave their money to Madoff through a separate firm are n't necessarily barred from compensation , depending on their particular case .
" There are very few things in law that are black and white , " he said .
Harbeck said that victims have until July 2 to file a claim with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York .
Madoff 's next home
For three months since his December arrest , Madoff managed to avoid jail by posting $ 10 million worth of bail .
He spent the time under house arrest , ensconced in his Manhattan apartment .
But since his confession in March , he has been incarcerated in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan , a holding facility for convicts awaiting sentencing .
This has given him a taste of life behind bars .
Once he is sentenced , he will probably be transferred to a medium - security federal prison , according to prison consultants .
Madoff 's status as a non-violent offender should keep him out of maximum - security , consultants said .
But they added that the massive scale of his crimes and his hefty sentence would make him ineligible for a low - security prison or a minimum - security prison camp , which inmates usually prefer because of safety , fewer restrictions and better quality of life .
In a medium - security prison , he would live in a cell , separated from the outer world by double layers of razor wire fencing with electronic detection systems , according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons .
He would have to work a menial job , possibly in a kitchen or laundry room , for 12 to 40 cents an hour .
The BOP will have the final say as to where Madoff will serve his sentence .
BOP spokeswoman Felicia Ponce said they try to place inmates within 500 miles of their families .
Keeping that in mind , Alan Ellis , attorney and author of the " Federal Prison Guidebook , " believes that Madoff will probably get sent to Federal Correctional Institute Otisville or FCI Ray Brook , both in upstate New York , FCI Fairton in New Jersey or FCI McKean in Pennsylvania .
Madoff will have to learn how to survive in the medium - security environment , where there are many violent offenders , according to prison consultants .
" There will be people who think that Bernie can give them stock tips , but I do n't see anyone being his big pal , " said Larry Levine , founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants who served 10 years for his ties to organized crime .
" I believe he 'll be treated like an outcast . "
I was asked to give two talks at the Boston Area Haskell User Group for this past Tuesday .
The first was pitched at a more introductory level and the second was to go deeper into what I have been using monoids for lately .
The first talk covers an introduction to the mathematical notion of a monoid , introduces some of the features of my Haskell monoids library on hackage , and starts to motivate the use of monoidal parallel / incremental parsing , and the modification use of compression algorithms to recycle monoidal results .
The second talk covers a way to generate a locally - context sensitive parallel / incremental parser by modifying Iteratees to enable them to drive a Parsec 3 lexer , and then wrapping that in a monoid based on error productions in the grammar before recycling these techniques at a higher level to deal with parsing seemingly stateful structures , such as Haskell layout .
Due to a late start , I was unable to give the second talk .
However , I did give a quick run through to a few die -hards who stayed late and came to the Cambridge Brewing Company afterwards .
As I promised some people that I would post the slides after the talk , here they are .
The current plan is to possibly give the second talk in full at either the September or October Boston Haskell User Group sessions , depending on scheduling and availability .

That ghoul Bill O’Reilly has already weighed in on Jay - Z ’s “ Off That , ” and now it ’s Rush Limbaugh ’s turn .
Rush responded to Jay - Z ’s warning to get off his balls by claiming that Barack Obama wants to cut off America ’s foreskins .
It makes perfect sense .
That is if you ’re batshit crazy , have no shame , have n’t actively thought with anything resembling a brain for at least the last 30 years and are genuinely afraid of black people .
The audio is below , as well as a transcript :
RUSH : Does this , Snerdley , mark a new development in my career to be singled out in a rap song by the famous rapper Jay - Z ?
I guess it is .
As far as I know I have never been mentioned in a rap song by anybody .
I guess it means I ’ve made it .
I ’m now in a rap tune by the famous rapper Jay - Z. “ [ T]ell Bill O Reilly to fall back .
Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls . ”
I would remind the rapper Jay - Z : Mr. Z , it is President Obama who wants to mandate circumcision .
We had that story yesterday ; and that means if we need to save our penises from anybody , it ’s Obama .
I did not know I was on anybody ’s balls , either .
I ’m happy to know that they think I am , though !
But I did n’t actually know that I was .
+ 1000 Lulz for saying he ’s happy to know he ’s on Jay - Z ’s balls .

In a never - ending quest to plumb the mysteries of men , women and sex , the journal Human Nature has published a study that minces no words in concluding that women " have higher standards " when engaging in a one - night stand .
Sure , sure , we 've all heard the evolutionary argument :
With the dangers of prospective childbirth and years of child care hanging in the balance , women would be expected to be choosier than men about whom they will mate with .
Bound by no such commitments and keen to maximize the propagation of their DNA , men will mate , shall we say , more indiscriminately .
But do we ever tire of hearing the details ?
We do not .
So here 's how they play out in the latest study .
A total of 427 men and 433 females from universities in the United States , Germany and Italy were asked to imagine their response to a request by a member of the opposite sex to : a ) go out on a date ; b ) go home with the requestor ; and c ) go to bed with him or her .
The person making the invitation could be " moderately unattractive , " " somewhat attractive " or " exceptionally attractive , " and the research participant was asked for his or her answer under each of these permutations .
Across the board , men were more likely to accept any and all of the invitations than were women .
There were a few national differences among the men : the German men were most reticent about going out or going home with any of the imagined women , and Italians were least discriminate about doing anything with anyone .
American men were more likely than their German counterparts to go to bed with a woman .
But they were n't quite as randy as the Italians .
As a group , the men also showed a preference for a somewhat or exceedingly attractive woman over a moderately unappealing one .
But as long as a woman was at least somewhat attractive , then men were equally ready to go off with her .
Extraordinary beauty was not required to secure their willingness to go out , go home or go to bed with a woman extending the invitation .
Not so women .
For female respondents who agreed they would go to bed with a man , only the best would do .
While they were equally likely to go out with a moderately handsome man than with an exceptionally handsome specimen , the women respondents were far more likely to accept only the exceptionally attractive man 's invitation to his home or his bed .
" While men are not entirely insensitive to their requestor 's attractiveness , women have higher standards and are more likely to engage in casual sex with an exceptionally attractive man than with a less attractive man , " said the study 's author , psychologist Achim Schuetzwohl of Britain 's Brunel University .
The differences among men appear to reflect " culural differences in sexual morals and preferences , " he added .
But the difference between men and women when it came to a roll in the hay ?
Human Nature , apparently .
Still not tired of reading about sexual differences between men and women ?
You could n't do better than the latest Kinsey report , published in the April 2008 Archives of Sexual Behavior .

Hidden beneath a four - ton slab of rock and surrounded by ancient carved symbols of prehistoric power , a spectacular high - status potentially royal tomb , dating back 4,000 years , has been discovered by archaeologists in Scotland .
The find – of international importance – is unique in Britain .
The excavations at Forteviot , near Perth , have yielded the remains of an early Bronze Age ruler buried on a bed of white quartz pebbles and birch bark with at least a dozen personal possessions – including a bronze and gold dagger , a bronze knife , a wooden bowl and a leather bag .
The discovery has huge implications for Scottish history .
Forteviot has long been known to have been a great royal centre in the early medieval period .
It was a " capital " of a Pictish Kingdom in the 8/9th century AD – and one of Scotland 's earliest kings , Kenneth MacAlpin , is said to have had a palace there .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But up until now nobody suspected that Forteviot 's royal roots might be thousands of years older .
The newly discovered prehistoric tomb is of particular importance because it lies at the very heart of Scotland 's largest pre-historic ritual / religious ceremonial complex .
The excavations are now revealing that back in around 2600 BC , local Neolithic people constructed a giant 250 m diameter circle of 200 timber obelisks with a ceremonial processional way leading to its entrance and an inner timber circle at its centre .
Each oak obelisk was up to a metre in diameter .
Then , by 2400 BC , a massive earthwork enclosure with a 10 m wide , 3 m deep moat was built inside that inner timber circle .
At roughly the same time two other similar earthwork enclosures – " henges " – were built , north of the large timber circle .
And finally in around 2000 BC the tomb was built underground in what was probably the most prestigious location – immediately opposite the entrance to the henge at the centre of the entire complex .
Uniquely , the tomb's stone wall , at the head end of the grave , was decorated with carvings of two bronze axes .
What 's more , the tomb 's great 2 m by 2 m , four - ton stone roof was decorated with a much older carving of a probable Neolithic stone battle axe or ceremonial mace head – a fact which suggests that it was removed from an older monument specifically for use in this ultra - high - status prehistoric tomb .
The use of white quartz pebbles and white birch bark as bedding for the dead man may well have been seen as a way of helping to guarantee rebirth in the next world .
The excavation is being directed by Professor Stephen Driscoll and Dr Kenneth Brophy of the University of Glasgow and Dr Gordon Noble of the University of Aberdeen .
" The sheer size of the stone slabs used to construct the tomb , the extremely rare rock engraving , the rare preservation of the leather , wood and bark items and the high status location make this a find of both national and international importance , " said prehistorian Dr Noble .
" In terms of preservation , location and scale , this tomb is unparalleled in Britain , " he said .

The excavation is continuing on site – and in Edinburgh where archaeologists are examining large blocks of excavated earth from the tomb under laboratory conditions .
2000 BC : A snapshot of prehistoric Britain ...
* In 2000 BC Stonehenge was in its heyday as a ritual centre .
* Society in Britain was becoming more hierarchical and the change brought a greater concentration of power in the hands of fewer people .
* It is likely that during this time Silbury Hill in Wiltshire , the world 's greatest ancient man-made mound , was undergoing expansion to make it even more impressive .
* Gold extraction was in full swing in Ireland – much of it was being sent to Britain .
Simultaneously there was a big increase in bronze production in Britain .
* Continental influence was increasing substantially in southern Britain .
... while in Egypt
* Ancient Egyptian civilisation was more than 1,000 years old by the time the Forteviot burial took place in Scotland .
* By 2000 BC the Great Pyramid at Giza was , at more than 500 years old , already an ancient structure .
The other great pyramids were completed by 2150BC .
* The world 's first calendar , based on the timings of the Nile floods , had been used by Egyptians for more than 1,000 years .
It split the year into 12 months and 365 days .
* Hieroglyphic writing had been developed at least 1,300 years earlier and by 2000 BC ancient Egyptians used 800 different symbols .
* The successful mummification of bodies had been carried out for more than 500 years .
* The first Book of the Dead texts had been created to describe the Ancient Egyptian concept of the afterlife and to provide instructions on how the deceased could overcome obstacles to reach it .

The fine folks at WorldNetDaily -- the wingnut outfit that was the original source of most of the Birther conspiracy theories , and remains their most ardent defender -- has a new theory it wants to trot out for mainstream consumption :
Barack Obama is actually the anti-Christ .
Jesus said so !
An American Christian has produced a brief film for YouTube that connects one statement by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke to President Barack Obama .
His 4 - minute video focuses on the direct quote : " I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven . " ( Luke 10:18 ) " When I started doing a little research , I found the Greek word for ' lightning ' is ' astrape ' , and the Hebrew equivalent is ' Baraq , ' " said YouTube contributor " ppsimmons , " a self - described Christian with a theological education and many years in the ministry , who spoke to WND under condition of anonymity out of concern for members of his local church .
" I thought that was fascinating . "
As he continued looking into the rest of the words in the phrase , he focused on " heaven , " and found that it can refer not just to God 's dwelling place , but also " the heights " or " high places . "
He then recalled Isaiah 14:14 , where Lucifer , another name for Satan , is quoted as saying , " I will ascend above the heights of the clouds ; I will be like the most High . "
" I wondered what the word ' heights ' is , " said ppsimmons , " and I looked it up in the dictionary , and it 's ' Bamah . ' "
Thus , on the video , the announcer notes , " If spoken by a Jewish rabbi today , influenced by the poetry of Isaiah , He ( Jesus ) would say these words in Hebrew ... ' I saw Satan as Baraq Ubamah . ' "
Of course , both the " Christian " and WND then go to some pains to try to claim that they 're not suggesting Obama is the anti-Christ .
Which is sort of like saying you 're not a racist after calling a black person the N - word .
I 'm just waiting for Lou Dobbs to trot this one out and start mainstreaming it for public consumption .
Or , more likely , Glenn Beck .

Thousands of people have been placed in quarantine in north - western China after a man died of pneumonic plague .
Chinese authorities say the man who died was a 32 - year - old herdsman from a sparsely populated area mostly inhabited by Tibetans .
Most of the other 11 people infected with the disease are relatives of the dead man .
The local government has not yet said when the man died but it has sealed off the town where the outbreak occurred .
It says there are enough supplies to feed the 10,000 or so people who live in the town of Ziketan , near Xinghai in Qinghai province , during the quarantine period .
Pneumonic plague is a virulent form of the disease that attacks the lungs .
It can spread from person to person , or from animals to people .
Initial symptoms include fever , headache and shortness of breath .
To reduce the chances of death , anyone infected needs to receive treatment within 24 hours of the first symptoms .
This is not the only contagious disease that China is grappling with at the moment .
It has taken very strict measures to control the spread of swine flu - which has also led to thousands of people being quarantined .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- If Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin thought her decision to step down might end ethics accusations against her , she quickly found out she was wrong .
One dismissed claim cited Gov. Sarah Palin 's decision to wear an Arctic Cat logo during a snowmobile race as a conflict of interest .
Just days after her bombshell resignation announcement , a new ethics complaint was filed with state authorities arguing that she should not be able to claim per diem funds when she stays at her Wasilla , Alaska , home instead of Anchorage or Juneau , where she has offices .
The complaint says she was charging the state when she stayed in Wasilla and commuted to her offices .
The governor 's mansion is located in Juneau .
Palin claims she is the target of the " politics of personal destruction , " as she and some staff members face 19 filings regarding allegations of ethical violations .
" It does n't cost the critics anything to file frivolous lawsuits or ethics violation charges .
It costs our state such a great deal -- thousands of staff hours , millions of dollars in public resources that are n't going to things that it should be going to , " Palin told CNN .
" We have n't violated the ethics code . "
The pressure and financial cost of such ethical investigations are a major reason cited by the governor in her decision not to finish her term .
She said her family is facing more than $ 500,000 in legal fees and has set up a legal defense fund to help defray the costs .
Many of the complaints have been dismissed .
But Palin last month reimbursed the state more than $ 8,000 for travel expenses for nine trips , accompanied by her children , after the state paid for them .
Another inquiry led to some new ethics training for a staff member .
In all , state officials say they have spent $ 1,963,840 to answer records requests from the ethics filings and to respond in other ways to them .
Records show that since January 1 , 2008 , the state has spent $ 296,043 on such investigations .
Of these inquiries , the one that cost the most and drew the most attention was centered on whether Palin inappropriately fired the state 's director of public safety .
This complaint had been filed weeks before Palin 's run for vice president .
The public safety director claimed he was let go because of his refusal to fire a state trooper who was Palin 's former brother - in - law and who was locked in a bitter divorce and custody battle with the governor 's sister .
Palin and her supporters argued it was because the director was insubordinate .
An independent counsel found she had a right to fire him , but in doing so had violated a state ethics law .
It found she had abused the powers of her office by pressuring employees to get the trooper fired .
Although the governor and her supporters have criticized the investigations , Andree McLeod , who has filed four complaints against Palin , thinks they are entirely appropriate .
" I do n't really care what other people think .
I am holding the governor accountable .
Other people 's ignorance is not going to stymie me , " McLeod told CNN , surrounded by stacks of state documents she has collected from filing information requests and ethics complaints .
" I am exercising my right to get these public records to discover what Sarah Palin is up to , " McLeod said .
McLeod , a registered Republican , has filed four complaints , including one alleging a friend of Palin 's was given preferential treatment in getting a state job .
That filing was dismissed by a state board which investigates the claims .
McLeod has also filed two lawsuits , including one regarding whether it was appropriate for state business to be discussed using private e-mail addresses .
When ethics complaints are filed against the governor or her staff , the state has to hire an independent counsel to investigate the claims to avoid conflict of interest .
Among other claims against Palin cite her wearing an Arctic Cat logo on a piece of clothing during a snowmobile race as a conflict of interest and another contending an interview she did after the presidential election in her state office was inappropriate .
Those were dismissed .
James Muller , a political science professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage , told CNN that , " Some of [ the complaints against Palin ] are clearly fanciful , farcical .
" I think most of these ethical complaints are trivial .
Almost all have been dismissed by the various levels of review that have taken them on , " Muller said .
Any filings already in process before she leaves office will be concluded .
Palin had signed a law making it easier to file such complaints .
" She 'd been pushing for that even before she was governor .
To have it used in this way , to have it abused in the manner that it was is shameful .
It 's much like the boy who cried ' wolf , ' " Thomas Van Flein , Palin 's attorney , told CNN .
All About Sarah Palin
Somewhere between the recording someone made of AOL refusing to let them cancel their service and the story about the woman whose father AOL insisted on billing for nine months after his death – once telling his daughter to “ shut up ” when she protested – I missed the part where AOL released all thirty - six million search queries that five hundred thousand of their users made over the course of three months .
They replaced the usernames with numbers , but some people might have refrained from searching for their own name – and then ‘ preteen lolitas naked ’ – if they ’d known their ISP planned to release their searches to the public .
So far pretty much everyone who ’s expressed disgust at this shocking a breach of privacy has also linked to mirrors of the data set or the searchable databases of it people have already put up .
But the privacy issue is far from the most interesting thing about the release of this data .
That honour goes to User 711391 .
Every night for the three month period , when her husband ’s snoring kept her awake ( the very first entries set the scene ) , she searched for anything and everything that was on her mind .
The four - thousand things she typed into that little white box over that period tell the story of her life in mercilessly candid detail , from the hard white pimple on her face she can’t seem to get rid of , to the extra-marital affair she has with a man she met online .

Like the huge majority of users , she has virtually no idea how to use a search engine , and ends up talking to it like a close friend or – more accurately – God .
She never searches for terms that are likely to come up in the piece of information she ’s looking for , she simply types her opinion or situation in .
A huge proportion of them start with “ is it ok to ” – although sometimes she knows it is n’t , and just wants to know to what extent .
As with God , we do n’t get to see much of what the internet has to say back to her ( the data names the domains of any sites she clicks on , but not the specific page she visited ) , but often her next search tells us what result her last one produced :

She ’s religious , but frequently has trouble working out how the Bible relates to her life .
She has children , and is worried Pop Rocks might be dangerous for them .
A few times a week she has lesbian fantasies , always focused on cunnilingus .
The male celebrities she ’s most attracted to are all camp , gay , or in the case of Jake Gyllenhaal , play a gay character in a movie she loved but found unsettling and haunting .
I ’m not embellishing , she simply types everything she thinks or feels into that search box .

She agreed to meet a man she ’d become friends with online .
She was nervous about meeting him in person , and tried to obtain anxiety medicine to calm herself .
She also feared that if she got her hair cut just before she met him , the haircut might go wrong , but she wanted to make it look fuller .
They arranged to go to a concert together – she ’d never been to one before , and did n’t know how long they usually lasted .
They had sex .
She was disappointed by how quickly he came , and he acted disgusted with her afterwards .
She half - hoped he might have climaxed quickly because he found her very attractive , but he broke it off and she decided he used her solely for sex .
The affair left her feeling incredibly empty .

Throughout this , the subplot of the pimple on her face obsesses her more than any of the sad drama of her love life .
Every night she searches ten times or more for firstly what it is ; then how to remove it ; then how long the cryosurgery scar will take to heal ; then whether her pores should be enlarged around it ; then whether she can put make - up over it ; and then – as you saw – how to remove the makeup it turns out she ’d already put over it , since it now seems stuck on .

The weighted balance between this cosmetic concern , her infidelity , her children , and her fascination with female celebrities ( she loves Neriah Davis but hates Brooke Burke , and cannot understand how they became friends ) paints a painfully human picture of her neurotic , insecure , quiet , sad , desperate and probably entirely typical life .
The irony is that she ’s one of the users who never searches for her own name ( unless she ’s Hilary Swank , in which case she really has the hots for herself ) .
I know more about her from the twenty minutes I spent invading her privacy before breakfast this morning than I think I have ever known about another human being , but I still do n’t know who she is .

User 711391 ’s search history is funny , beautiful and intensely tragic , and the most incredible collection of words I ’ve read in years .
I ’m hosting it here .
Chris and RJ reunite five years after coming out to their families and their church as gay men , where the factors that led to their separation are revealed as they mourn the death of their mutual friend Rodney .
Me : How does your company react to this story ?
McNelis :
We 've certainly observed what 's been going on .
A quick answer to what our reaction is would most accurately be described as amusement .
Me : Why do you say that ?
McNelis :
It 's pretty amusing the amount of fervour that some of the people bring to their arguments on this issue .
Me : People who believe in global warming ?
McNelis :
No , people on all sides .
Me :
Where did these signs come from ?
Was it the managers in each restaurant that put them up ?
McNelis : I do n't have those details .
Me : Have they all come down now ?
McNelis : I think so .
It 's the best I can tell .
Me : BK Corp issued a statement saying that ' global warming is baloney ' was n't their view and that they had asked you to take them down .
Is that your understanding of it ?
McNelis : I can't speak for them .
I would think they would run from any form of controversy kinda like cockroaches when the lights get turned on .
I 'm not aware of any direction that they gave the franchisee and I do n't think they have the authority to do it .
The franchisee can put on a sign whatever he wants .
Me :
They 're saying that within the terms of the franchisee contract it says something along the lines that signs outside a restaurant can't be used to express any political or religious views .
McNelis :
Well , it maybe a religious belief for some folks , but it 's certainly not for the franchisee here and I do n't think that it 's necessarily political either .
But I have to tell you that I do n't read the franchise agreement with regularity or else I would have a bad case of insomnia .
Me :
There have been some comments made about how MIC - owned Burger Kings all have Fox News playing inside them on TV sets .
Is that correct ?
McNelis : I can't say that it 's correct .
I do know that there are TV sets in a lot of the restaurants .
In fact , they very well maybe on Fox News but if you are asking me that 's a mandate of some sort I would think that 's not true .
Me :
So your reaction to this whole story that 's now gone around the world is bemusement and amusement ?
McNelis :
It certainly shows the power of internet communications and the society we live in , that it would even get played over across the pond .
Me : Apparently , it even featured on MSNBC ....
McNelis : I heard it even made that Keith Olbermann show which is , gosh , a real coup .
A small franchisee over in Memphis , Tennessee , can be the " Worst Person in the World " .
If that 's the case then we 've got a pretty good damn thing going .
Me : Are you not a fan of the show ?
McNelis :
Well , the technology now allows that anyone with a microphone can make a complete idiot of themselves and I 'm sure given the opportunity I might do it myself .
No , we do n't pay any attention to that .
The corollary to the comment I 've just made is that obviously this is today 's news and tomorrow they 'll be talking about something else whether it's what Barack Obama is apologising for over in Cairo , or any other number of things , and we 'll look at this in the rear - view mirror and be movin ' on .
Me :
So to clarify , it was n't MIC policy to put up these signs ?
It was just down to individual managers in each restaurant ?
McNelis : I do n't know .
Sometimes it 's like a wild fire in the west – things spread around and all kinds of stuff goes on .
But it certainly got some folks ' attention .
Me : Some people have been telling Memphis papers that they 've seen the signs at a dozen or so sites .
McNelis :
Well , they 're 40 - odd restaurants in the franchise so that would n't surprise me at all .
Me :
But that suggests that it might have come from some sort of central memo to put these signs up ?
McNelis :
It 's kinda like the old movie the Wizard of Oz ; there 's somebody back there behind the curtain turning the dials or something .
I have n't had a chance because I do n't have a little dog pulling on it .
Me : So , there 's was n't a memo ?
McNelis : I do n't know that .
I 'm just not privy to that kind of discussion .
I grew up in the Watergate era so there may have been some guys in the back room scheming and plotting but I do n't think any one is trying to take over the world with this thing .
Me : BK Corp are saying that they 've demanded that these signs get taken down and that they have now been taken down ...
McNelis : Burger King can tell me to use my left hand when I scratch my nose instead of my right but that does n't mean I 'm going to use my right .
They can say whatever they want .
The management team can put the message up there if they want to .
It is private property and over here in the US we do have some rights , not withstanding a franchise agreement that I could load a Brinks vehicle with I 've got so many of them .
By the time the BK lawyers work out how to make that stick we'd be in the year 2020 .
I do n't think the franchisees are particularly concerned about that .
BK can bluster all they want about what they can tell the franchisee to do but we have free speech rights in this country so I do n't think there 's any concerns .
Do n't come away from this conversation with the impression that the franchisee did anything because the BK Corporation told him he had to .
They 're only printed words on paper .
The contract is only as strong as the ability to enforce it .
Some things can be enforced , other things can't .
I know BK would like to have you believe they have the authority and the willingness to make us do all kinds of different things , but that 's not how the world works .
Me : Have you been using these road - side signs for years to display such messages ?
McNelis : I think that just about any restaurant that gets opened that has the ability to have one of these signs has one as they are used for marketing messages and any number of different things – new promotions , say , or " Happy Birthday George Bush " , or " Open Christmas Day " .
Me : But " Global Warming is Baloney " is certainly a different sort of message , a more political viewpoint ?
McNelis : I would agree that it's a viewpoint , but not necessarily a political one .
But we 're not sheeple around here , and while Barack Obama would like to have you believe that no one is entitled to have a view other than his , if someone wants to stand up and say " Global Warming is Baloney " , then I 'm all for it .
It does n't matter to me , whether I believe in it or not .
They have first amendment rights to say whatever 's on their mind .
And nobody dictates otherwise .
( CNN ) -- Episcopal churches in California and Minnesota moved toward appointing gay bishops over the weekend , less than a month after the denomination lifted a self - imposed freeze on promoting openly gay clergy into the top ranks of the church .
Mary Glasspool is a candidate for assistant bishop with the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles .
The Diocese of Los Angeles , one of the largest in the country , included a gay man and a lesbian on its short list for assistant bishop positions Sunday .
A day earlier , the Diocese of Minnesota put a lesbian priest on its list of three candidates to lead the statewide religious community .
The nominations seem likely to increase tensions in the 70 million - member Anglican Communion , the world 's third - largest Christian community .
The Anglican Communion has been wrestling with how to handle homosexuality , a question that shows signs of tearing the church apart .
The Episcopal Church , as the American branch of the Anglican Communion is known , voted overwhelmingly last month to allow gay men and lesbians to become bishops .
Individual dioceses have moved quickly in the wake of the vote .
Los Angeles announced six candidates for positions as assistant bishops , including Mary Glasspool and John Kirkley , both of whom spoke openly about being gay in statements on the diocese Web site .
Glasspool recalls wrestling in college with the question , " Did God hate me ( since I was a homosexual ) ? "
She refers to her " life partner , Becki Sander , " and discusses her discomfort at serving in a " relatively conservative " parish during the 1990s .
" My partner , Becki , was invisible as far as the parish was concerned , " writes Glasspool , who is based at the Diocese of Maryland in Baltimore .
Kirkley , rector of St. John the Evangelist in San Francisco , refers to himself as a gay man and is married to a man whom he calls " my husband , Andrew " on the Los Angeles Diocese Web site .
They have an adopted African - American son , he writes , admitting : " It was with some fear and trembling that we two white , gay men embarked upon raising our son . "
The head of the Diocese praised all six candidates for the two positions .
" I affirm each and every one of these candidates and am pleased at the wide diversity they offer this Diocese , " the Right Rev. J. Jon Bruno said in a statement .
The Los Angeles Diocese has a population of about 70,000 across six southern California counties .
It will elect its two new assistant bishops , formally known as bishops suffragan , at a convention December 4 - 5 .
Bonnie Perry , meanwhile , is one of three finalists to become bishop of Minnesota .
She has been with her partner , Susan Harlow -- who is also a priest -- for 22 years , she says on the diocese Web site .
Perry is currently based in Chicago .
Minnesota Episcopalians will chose their new bishop October 31 .
More candidates could be added before then .
Five years ago , the Episcopal Church appointed Gene Robinson , an openly gay man , to be bishop of New Hampshire , a move that tore apart the Episcopal Church and prompted a semi-official moratorium on naming new gay bishops .
A number of Episcopal dioceses broke with the official church structure , forming the breakaway Anglican Church in North America in protest of the church 's stance on homosexuality .
They say the mainstream Episcopal Church and the aligned Anglican Church in Canada " have increasingly accommodated and incorporated un-Biblical , un-Anglican practices and teaching . "
Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury and head of the worldwide Anglican Communion , has been trying to bridge the gap between liberals and conservatives on homosexuality .
Last week , he floated the idea that there might be " two styles of being Anglican " in the future .
" The ideal is that both ' tracks ' should be able to pursue what they believe God is calling them to be as Church , with greater integrity and consistency , " he said in a lengthy statement on his Web site in response to the new Episcopal Church position on homosexuality .
The Episcopalians also moved last month toward blessing same - sex marriages , although they will make no official decisions until their next general convention , three years from now .
Williams denounced anti-gay prejudice but said the Anglican Communion was not in a position to approve same - sex marriages .
" No Anglican has any business reinforcing prejudice against [ lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgendered ] people , questioning their human dignity and civil liberties or their place within the Body of Christ , " he wrote .
But changing the Anglican theological position on homosexuality would have to be " based on the most painstaking biblical exegesis and on a wide acceptance of the results within the Communion , " he wrote .
" A major change naturally needs a strong level of consensus and solid theological grounding , " he added .
" This is not our situation in the Communion . "

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo announced that she would shorten her visit to the United States to attend Mrs. Aquino ’s funeral on Wednesday .
Mrs. Arroyo had decreed that Wednesday would be a nonworking holiday and had declared a 10 - day period of mourning .

In a statement on Saturday , Mrs. Arroyo paid tribute to Mrs. Aquino  who in recent years had taken a role in street demonstrations against Mrs. Arroyo  calling her a “ national treasure ” who had “ helped lead our nation to a brighter day . ”
At La Salle Green Hills , the Catholic school in Manila where Mrs. Aquino ’s body had been brought for public viewing , mourners stood in a line stretching more than a half - mile since Saturday evening in heavy rain .
On Sunday , the line grew longer , with mourners wearing yellow shirts , caps , buttons and ribbons .
Image People wore yellow shirts and held up the " Laban , " or fight symbol , for Mrs. Aquino at her wake .

A soft - spoken homemaker who became a global icon of democracy , Mrs. Aquino was regarded in the Philippines with an affection that bordered on spiritual .
Her preference for the company of nuns and priests , and the familiar presence of a rosary in her hand  and in her coffin on Sunday  only deepened her appeal in this deeply Roman Catholic country .
An American president is launching the most ambitious , the most expensive , and certainly the most dangerous military campaign since the Vietnam War – and the antiwar movement , such as it is , is missing in action .
After a long and bloody campaign in Iraq and the election of a U.S. president pledged to get us out , our government is once again revving up its war machine and taking aim at yet another " terrorist " stronghold , this time in Afghanistan .
Yet the antiwar movement ’s motor seems stuck in the wrong gear , making no motions toward mounting anything like an effective protest .
What gives ?
We should n’t doubt the scope of the present war effort .
Make no mistake : the Obama administration is radically ramping up the stakes in the " war on terrorism , " which , though renamed , has not been revised downward , as the Washington Post reports :
" As the Obama administration expands U.S. involvement in Afghanistan , military experts are warning that the United States is taking on security and political commitments that will last at least a decade and a cost that will probably eclipse that of the Iraq war . "
There are always " warnings " in the beginning , are n’t there ?
For some reason , however , they are never heeded .
Instead , we just barrel ahead , undaunted , into the tall grass where ambush awaits us .
War opponents predicted the Iraq invasion would prove unsustainable – and we were right .
We said that , far from greeting us with cheers and showers of roses , the Iraqis would soon be shooting at us and demanding our ouster – and we were right .
We said the rationale for war was based on a series of carefully manufactured and marketed lies – and that was the truth , now was n’t it ?
Yet it seems we are caught in an endlessly repetitive nightmare , where the same prophetic voices are being drowned out by a chorus of " responsible " voices – to be followed by an all - too - familiar disaster .
The problem , however , is that the scale of these disasters seems to be increasing exponentially .
As Gerald Celente , one of the few economic forecasters who predicted the ’08 crash , put it the other day , " Governments seem to be emboldened by their failures . "
What the late Gen. William E. Odom trenchantly described as " the worst strategic disaster in American military history " – the invasion of Iraq – is being followed up by a far larger military operation , one that will burden us for many years to come .
This certainly seems like evidence in support of the Celente thesis , and the man who predicted the 1987 stock market crash , the fall of the Soviet Union , the dot - com bust , the gold bull market , the 2001 recession , the real estate bubble , the “ Panic of ’ 08 , ” and now is talking about the inevitable popping of the " bailout bubble , " has more bad news :
" Given the pattern of governments to parlay egregious failures into mega - failures , the classic trend they follow , when all else fails , is to take their nation to war . "
As the economic crisis escalates and the debt - based central banking system shows it can no longer re-inflate the bubble by creating assets out of thin air , an economic and political rationale for war is easy to come by ; for if the Keynesian doctrine that government spending is the only way to lift us out of an economic depression is true , then surely military expenditures are the quickest way to inject " life " into a failing system .
This does n’t work , economically , since the crisis is only masked by the wartime atmosphere of emergency and " temporary " privation .
Politically , however , it is a lifesaver for our ruling elite , which is at pains to deflect blame away from itself and on to some " foreign " target .
It ’s the oldest trick in the book , and it ’s being played out right before our eyes , as the U.S. prepares to send even more troops to the Afghan front and is threatening Iran with draconian economic sanctions , a step or two away from outright war .
A looming economic depression and the horrific prospect of another major war – the worst - case scenario seems to be unfolding , like a recurring nightmare , and there does n’t seem to be any way to stop it .
Are we caught , then , helpless in the web of destiny , to be preyed upon by those spiders in Washington ?
I have to admit that , at times , I ’m inclined to believe it : the early years of the Bush era , particularly the dark days right after 9/11 , were hard times for advocates of liberty and peace .
For us here at Antiwar.com , they were days of nearly unrelieved gloom .
As the Bush era drew to a close , however , there were many signs that we were in for a turnaround , that the dark ages were over and a new day was dawning .
The Iraq war was discredited , along with its cheerleaders , and the collapse of the War Party ’s political fortunes seemed all but assured with the rise of an insurgent movement within the Democratic Party , a movement that happened to coalesce around Barack Obama but could have rallied to any charismatic or even remotely appealing figure , so desperate were people for any sign of hope .
In the beginning , I was enamored of the possibilities of this electoral insurgency against the presumed nominee , Hillary Clinton .
By stubbornly sticking to her pro-war position and refusing to second - guess her decision to support the invasion of Iraq , Hillary turned the primary campaign into a tug - of - war between the interventionist faction of the Democratic Party – centered in the leadership – and the antiwar rank - and - file , many of whom were beginning to develop a comprehensive critique of interventionist foreign policy and were well on their way to becoming principled opponents of imperialism .
Then Obama stepped into the picture .
I am not among those who are currently whining that Obama has somehow " betrayed " his antiwar supporters – prominent among them the organizers of the principal peace coalition , United for Peace and Justice .
After all , he ’s just doing what he said all along he ’d do , and that is fight the " right war , " which , he averred , we ought to be waging in Afghanistan rather than Iraq .
At the end of this month , his generals will report to him on how many more troops they need to " do the job , " and you can bet they wo n’t be calling for any reductions .
History has shown that Afghanistan is practically unconquerable , and we could send an army of a million or more and still fail miserably .
But think how the endless expenditures will " stimulate " our economy !
Forecaster Celente has identified several bubbles , the latest being the " bailout bubble , " slated to pop at any time , yet there may be another bubble to follow what Celente calls " the mother of all bubbles , " one that will implode with a resounding crash heard ’ round the world – the bubble of empire .
Our current foreign policy of global hegemonism and unbridled aggression is simply not sustainable , not when we are on the verge of becoming what we used to call a Third World country , one that is bankrupt and faces the prospect of a radical lowering of living standards .
Unless , of course , the " crisis " atmosphere can be sustained almost indefinitely .
George W. Bush had 9/11 to fall back on , but that song is getting older every time they play it .
Our new president needs to come up with an equivalent , one that will divert our attention away from Goldman Sachs and toward some overseas enemy who is somehow to be held responsible for our present predicament .
It is said that FDR ’s New Deal did n’t get us out of the Great Depression , but World War II did .
The truth is that , in wartime , when people are expected to sacrifice for the duration of the " emergency , " economic problems are anesthetized out of existence by liberal doses of nationalist chest - beating and moral righteousness .
Shortages and plunging living standards were masked by a wartime rationing system and greatly lowered expectations .
And just as World War II inured us to the economic ravages wrought by our thieving elites , so World War III will provide plenty of cover for a virtual takeover of all industry by the government and the demonization of all political opposition as " terrorist . "
An impossible science - fictional scenario ?
Or a reasonable projection of present trends ?
Celente , whose record of predictions is impressive , to say the least , sees war with Iran as the equivalent of World War III , with economic , social , and political consequences that will send what is left of our empire into a tailspin .
This is the popping of the " hyperpower " bubble , the conceit that we – the last superpower left standing – will somehow defy history and common sense and avoid the fate of all empires : decline and fall .
We are in for some " interesting " times , and , these days , I know you wo n’t want to be without Antiwar.com , which is going to be more essential than ever before .
However , we ca n’t guarantee our continued survival – in fact , I can predict our imminent demise – if we fail to enjoy your continued financial support .
You ’ll notice that we are now embarked on our summer fundraising campaign , and , let me tell you , summers are always the worst .
Everyone who can afford to give is off on vacation , and these are difficult times , to boot .
I have the feeling this one is going to be a long , hard slog , but I ’d love to be pleasantly surprised .
So , please , surprise me .
The prospects of a major war just over the horizon are increasing by the hour , yet we have n’t heard much in the way of protest from the formerly " antiwar " liberal - progressive community , or , at least , not from their institutions and leaders , who are getting in line behind the Obama administration and are afraid to rock the boat .
Well , we are n’t afraid to rock the boat – indeed , that ’s what we ’ve always been about .
We are determined to make as many waves as we can , but we ca n’t do it without your financial assistance .
Our budget is minuscule , compared to similar groups : we get by on very little , but we need that comparatively tiny amount – $ 70,000 this quarter – to continue our work .
We run the tightest ship in the nonprofit sector and get an enormous bang for your buck .
With hundreds of thousands of readers each week and a worldwide audience , the cost - effectiveness of your tax - deductible donation is indisputable .
We ’re more – much more – than a Web site .
Antiwar.com represents a movement that can and must stand up if we ’re going to avoid a global catastrophe .
Put not your trust in politicians , my friends ; an informed and active citizenry is the key to peace and the maintenance of what is left of our liberties .
And that is what we ’re all about .
So do n’t delay .
When the Last Big Bubble – the bubble of empire – pops , we cannot let the sound of it drown out the demands of the people for peace .
As we hurtle toward World War III , remember : you can help put on the brakes and rein in our war - crazed rulers .

NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Monday Morning Update : I see that as of Monday morning , we are under $ 1,000 in contributions – a truly ominous trend .
If this goes on , we ’ll be off the Internet in a little over a week .
To all of my readers who appreciate this column and value what Antiwar.com is doing , I make this appeal : now is the time to give as you ’ve never given before .
The War Party , which never lacks for funding , would like nothing better than to see this Web site go kaput .
And make no mistake : we will be gone if we do n’t make our fundraising goal .
So please dig down deep in your pocket and help us out .
Your 100 % tax - deductible donation makes a big difference , so make it today .
Today , we ’re going to talk about faith .
You ca n’t say I do n’t tackle the Big Important Topics here .
In this one post , I ’m going to cover the entire foundation of almost every religion in the history of ever , the pillar on which all theology is founded , and the subject over which perhaps more hours of scholarly work and profound philosophising has taken place over the centuries than any other .
The one elusive , ethereal concept whose significance has plagued the most enlightened and learned thinkers for generations .
I do n’t know why they bothered , really .
It ’s all just bollocks .
Yep .
This is why you come here , for the intellectual rigour and thoughtful , sensitive analysis of all the delicate and complex issues .
Let ’s get on with it then .
“ Bollocks ” revisited
Let ’s be clear exactly what it is that I ’m dismissing so sweepingly , before we all agree that I ’m right .
“ Faith ” is often used more or less interchangeably with words like “ trust ” , in more day - to - day terms .
I have plenty of trust , but I do n’t think I could be accused of having faith , as I use the term here .
I have good reason to expect the world to continue functioning as it has , in many ways , based on previous experience .
I do n’t need “ faith ” that my toaster will scorch any bits of bread I put into it ; it logically follows , from my incomplete but often useful understanding of the mechanics of the universe .
Other times , the word “ faith ” is just used to refer to any belief in anything religious or supernatural .
Regardless of the rationality or otherwise , if it ’s about God , then it ’s faith .
And , well , okay .
That ’s fine , and does n’t preclude faith from being a perfectly rational activity .
I ’m not railing against every possible usage of the word , only this one concept it often represents .
Just like Tony Jaa is n’t out to utterly destroy the entire population of Thailand , just the ones who stole his elephant .
The sort of faith I have no time for is the blind , unreasonable , unjustified belief sort .
The abandonment of reason , of which some religious folk seem so proud .
The deliberate dismissal of individual , independent , autonomous thought , the thing which more than any other gives our species a significance greater than that of coral .
There is absolutely no sufficient justification for the kind of voluntary mindlessness which so many regard as a great and noble virtue .
We humans have amazing abilities .
We can experience the world around us , and put those experiences in context , and construct meaningful ideas about this strange place in which we find ourselves that go beyond what any one person could ever discover on their own .
We can find patterns , work out the rules , explore the causes and reasons underlying what we see .
We can take the time to consider what we know , and we can ask questions .
Never mind finding answers – even having a clear enough knowledge of our situation to know what we do n’t know , and ask meaningful questions about it , is an unprecedented achievement of our innate curiosity .
We can know what we ’re doing as we go about our lives , to an extent that no other race we know of has ever achieved .
That such a phenomenon could arise from the particles of the universe itself is astounding .
But some people do n’t want to do any of that .
To them , our efforts to improve ourselves and our involvement in the world , to aid our understanding by whatever means will allow us to inch slowly toward the truth , should be abandoned .
The curiosity and questioning and unquenchable hunger to probe and discover new things , which has been responsible for basically everything our species has ever achieved , is vilified by some , and blind obedience to authority is held in its place , as some kind of morally superior alternative .
Others are less extreme , but still hold that our powers of human reason , as well as being insufficient to neatly explain every aspect of existence to their satisfaction , can in fact be improved upon and surpassed by a directionless trust in what is basically guesswork .
God , I think I might be starting to talk bollocks too .
Look , I was n’t kidding about how vastly profound and influential this subject ’s been on the history of human thought , and that stuff about dedicated scholars .
You could fill libraries with the serious and soul - searching contemplations engaged in on the matter of faith by people far more learned and clever than me .
If I get too caught up in trying to match them for solemnity and scholarship and scope of rhetoric , then it ’s obvious I ’m going to get way out of my depth very quickly .
Because I ’m just some idiot with a blog , whose position is n’t much more sophisticated than “ I do n’t buy any of this crap ” , and who keeps getting distracted by thinking about bagels whenever I try articulating my thoughts .
See , I just had lunch between that last sentence and this one .
My dedication to my art is pathetic .
Much better then , surely , to sweep aside all the bothersome details and better - informed postulatings of everyone who ’s gone before , on the simple grounds that faith , as a system of belief without rational justification , is just silly .
Because really , should n’t that be obvious on its own ?
Humankind has figured out quite a few excellent tools by which to avoid being wrong , as well as identifying a number of ways in which wrongness can occur in our thinking .
Faith is a matter of deliberately ignoring the very option of wrongness , and refusing to attempt to rule it out .
When the option is there to use these proven methods by which we ’ve discovered so much about the world , and so closely approached truth in so many aspects of the universe , faith demands you put all that aside , not ask questions , and simply hope you guessed right .
Why is this ever something you ’d want to do ?
How can you ever be better off not applying critical thinking to a closely held belief , especially when it dramatically affects your feelings , your behaviours , and the lives of others ?
I ’m honestly rather baffled what people have managed to write thousands of books about on this .
( Some people might suggest I should try reading one .
They may have a point . )
But I ’ve written before about why critical thinking and a skeptical approach should be applied to all knowledge , and I still think that summarises the point quite well enough .
But I suppose I know what some of the common complaints are , so I ’ll briefly go over what some people often say to justify what they call their faith .
( If you have anything better , feel free to comment . )
Belief without proof
A lot of people go this way , as the most innocent - sounding cop - out excuse for being irrational .
All they ’re doing is choosing to believe something without “ absolute scientific proof ” .
They ’re trusting in an idea that simply has n’t been studied and examined by emotionless scientists in white lab coats and described in cold , clinical detail , and this somehow makes them virtuous .
They ’re not being deranged , because there is some evidence for what they believe , it ’s just not been proven beyond all doubt .
Unfortunately , that does n’t really help .
Having bad evidence for something is n’t half - way to having good evidence for it , and is n’t a worthwhile step in the right direction from having no evidence at all .
( Having good evidence for the object of your faith seems to rule out the need to have faith at all .
If you think you can prove the truth of , say , the Bible , then why would you need to “ just believe ” in it when you can be perfectly rational and get there by following the evidence ? )
People cite various experiences of the world as reasons for belief in some divine power , but the way they mix reason and faith always seems haphazard .
If the smile on a baby is to be cited as evidence of a god ’s existence , then you need to leap through all the usual scientific hoops if you want to be taken seriously .
How does a grinning tiny person support your model of reality ?
What would falsify it ?
Can this data not be reconciled with the null hypothesis , namely a universe without a god ?
Yes , these are all sciencey questions , and God is often held to be “ outside ” of science , but what is that supposed to mean ?
If you ’re making a definite claim about reality , then science is the best tool we have to establish whether or not you ’re probably right .
If , when you claim that your deity is evinced by a particular autonomic response in certain carbon - based lifeforms , you ’re not doing science , then what the hell are you doing ?
If you ’re abandoning the due process of logic and reason , you literally might as well be saying “ Penguins are made of cheese , therefore God exists ” .
Hey , if it does n’t have to make sense , why worry ?
To press the point further about proposing evidence , admitting that it does n’t constitute proof , but claiming it as a basis for faith , consider the following two conversations :
“ What evidence do you have that UFOs regularly visit the Earth and abduct people ? ”
“ None at all .
I just have faith . ”
“ You ’re an idiot . ”
“ What evidence do you have that UFOs regularly visit the Earth and abduct people ? ”
“ Well , this one time I saw a thing in the sky , that definitely was n’t a bird because it was massive , it probably weighed about 28 tonnes , and was about 450 feet away and 20 feet across , all of which I precisely estimated in the few seconds I thought I saw it behind some tree branches , and also my sister ’s friend ’s cousin ’s dentist saw some weird green alien - looking creature in his bedroom once , in between a dream about giant dancing corkscrews and waking up in a cold sweat at 4 am .
So , that might not be good enough for a bunch of scientists , with their test tubes and litmus burners and all that fancy science malarkey , but it ’s some evidence , and based on that I choose to have faith . ”
“ Sounds good to me .
You should see what ’s in the book I base my spiritual belief system on . ”
See , just because you ’re capable of saying that this , this , and this are why you have faith , does n’t mean you ’re necessarily making any more sense than if you just picked a random notion out of the air and based a religion around it .
Faith is necessarily arbitrary
Faith , being a belief in spite of an absence of supporting evidence , is by definition arbitrary in its object .
There ’s a limitless supply of things you could believe in , which have no evidence to support them – and yet , without evidence , how can any groundless claim be superior to any other ?
Why is faith in Jesus any more valuable or virtuous than faith in the Flying Spaghetti Monster ?
If you point out that Pastafarianism was created as a deliberate parody just a few years ago , then remember that you ’re using evidence to assert that , and suddenly we ’re having a reasonable discussion and not talking about faith any more .
Explain to me why faith in any other god is “ better ” – in any interpretation of that word that you choose – without using a rational analysis of any evidence to do so .
I do n’t see how you can , but I ’d love to hear it if you ’ve got something .
In fact , if lack of evidence is somehow a bonus and adds value to your level of faith , then surely it would behoove you to deliberately choose the most ridiculous and unsupported set of ideas you can imagine , and latch fervently onto those .
Say you ’re a Christian , and believe every word of the Bible in spite of ( or even because of ) how unlikely it looks based on evidence and reason and every logical way of examining the world .
Would n’t it then show even more faith to believe in Vishnu instead ?
I mean , it ’s even more unlikely that Hinduism ’s going to turn out to be true , right ?
If faith is really a virtue , why not pick something completely outlandish , which there is genuinely no good reason to give even a moment ’s credibility ?
This might work for Alan Moore , but nobody ’s as awesome as Alan Moore , particularly people with “ proper ” religions which they think should command some sort of respect .
Most people ’s religious convictions are deeply ingrained ideas , which they then try to justify and explain at length why it ’s not all illogical nonsense .
And I ’m not sweeping all those efforts aside with this one article .
Whether there ’s a reasonable justification for religious belief , based on observations of the world and hypothetical thought experiments and such , is the basis for a thousand fascinating discussions .
But they ’re totally different from having faith .
If you ’re prepared to be rational about it , then great , let ’s have that discussion instead .
But if there are no sound reasons to believe what you do , then faith is in no way an acceptable fallback position to which to retreat .
It ’s a tacit admission of defeat , but one that ’s seized upon and rallied around , as if it can be made to seem like it does anything more than demonstrate conclusively that you know you ’ve lost and your position makes no sense .
Appealing to any force “ beyond reason ” is like trying to climb through a hole an inch wide by holding onto a mouse ’s tail as it pulls you through ; even if some other power really does have abilities beyond our own ( either to determine truth or fit through tiny holes ) and is willing to show us the way , our own limitations are a part of who we are .
If you ’ve decided what to have faith in by rational means , then obviously you ’re still restrained by the powers of human reason .
If you ’ve made this decision with no such recourse to reason , and you ’ve just plunged in with no rational consideration for what you ’re believing at all , then you ’re on no firmer ground than literally anyone else , believing literally anything else .
How can you be ?
Any claim you make to divine super- rational authority can be repeated by anyone else , with equal credibility .
If you ’re not using logic and reason , you ’re being illogical and unreasonable .
The opposite of skeptical is gullible .
And actually , most people think they can prove what they believe , or at least argue the case for it rationally .
So let ’s do that .
Otherwise : I have faith that God tastes of cinnamon and lives in my stapler .
And my faith ’s just as good as yours .

A group of security researchers has published a fascinating study that demonstrates how to hack a Sequoia AVC Advantage voting machine .
We have already seen several electronic voting machines hacked by experts in controlled environments , but this study goes a step further and shows that it can be done in the wild without privileged access to source code or other specialized materials .
The study was conducted by a group of voting machine security experts led by Ed Felten , the director of Princeton 's Center for Information and Technology Policy .
They used a technique called return - oriented programming to circumvent the built - in security mechanisms in an AVC Advantage voting machine and cause it to divert votes from one candidate to another in a simulated election .
In addition to providing a chilling example of the potential for real - world election hacking , the study also explores some important questions about the longevity of voting machine security .
A well - designed machine that provides highly robust security today might become vulnerable over time as new hacking techniques emerge .
The researchers point out that electronic voting machines will generally have long service cycles due to the lengthy procurement and certification process .
The AVC Advantage has several characteristics that make it more secure than many other voting machines .
It has hardware mechanisms that prevent it from running code from RAM .
This effectively protects against attacks that involve arbitrary code injection .
To circumvent this security measure , the researchers used a technique called return - oriented programming that involves co-opting bits of code that are already in the system .
By chaining together small snippets of regular code from the system ROM , it becomes possible to perform more sophisticated and specialized operations — such as redirecting votes — without having to inject malicious code .
This is a relatively novel technique that emerged in 2007 , and some of the earliest research on return - oriented programming was published by Hovav Shacham of UC San Diego , one of the security experts who contributed to the AVC Advantage study .
" Since the AVC Advantage is a Harvard architecture computer , traditional code injection attacks cannot succeed because any attempt to read an instruction from data memory causes an NMI which will halt the machine , " the paper explains .
" In practice , given a large enough corpus of code , this is not a barrier to executing arbitrary code using return - oriented programming — an extension of return - to - libc attacks where the attacker supplies a malicious stack containing pointers to short instruction sequences ending with a ret . "
The hack
The team wrote a small program that searched the BIOS for groups of instructions ending in " ret . "
They found sequences that could be used together to manipulate the machine 's behavior and control its hardware peripherals , including LCDs and memory cartridges .
They then devised a pseudo - assembly based on these code snippets .
The researchers reverse - engineered an AVC Advantage machine that was purchased through a government surplus auction site .
A researcher was able to buy five units for only $ 82 .
Through their reverse engineering efforts , the team documented the voting machine 's internal operations and made an emulator for developing and testing hacks .
The hack is deployed in a modified results cartridge .
It exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the machine 's cartridge handling code to gain control of the stack and direct the machine to execute the selected code sequences that fulfill the malicious objective .
The exploit , which was developed entirely on the group 's home - rolled emulator , worked with the real hardware on the first try .
The researchers were able to devise and implement this hack in roughly 16 man-months of labor without having any access to the actual source code or non-public documentation .
It worked flawlessly on actual devices during tests and could be used by a sufficiently motivated individual to manipulate the outcome of a real election .
The team estimates that a comparable hack could be funded in the private market for as little as $ 100,000 .
Democracy has never seemed so cheap .

They did everything they could to keep her quiet .
The disgraced NYPD officers charged with raping an intoxicated Manhattan woman in her apartment in December stole her cellphone and contacted her mother and brother in an attempt to frighten her into silence , newly disclosed legal papers allege .
The bombshell details are in a notice of claim filed by the woman against the city and the two cops .
The woman , named as Jane Doe in the filing , is seeking $ 5 million in damages .
The alleged betrayal of the badge occurred in the early hours of Dec. 7 , when Officers Kenneth Moreno and Franklin Mata of the Ninth Precinct responded to a 911 call from a cabby requesting help getting a drunken passenger into her East Village apartment .
The officers escorted the 27 - year - old woman into her home and returned two more times by lying to a resident to gain entry , investigators say .
Moreno then allegedly raped the woman in her bed as she drifted in and out of consciousness while Mata acted as a lookout .
Before leaving the apartment for the last time , the officers began a twisted scheme to silence her , the documents say .
They stole her BlackBerry , and in the days after the crime , the cops contacted the woman ’s mother and brother , the document says .
The notice of claim does n’t say what they told her family , but it does state the officers “ were trying to intimidate ” the woman .
Daniel E. Katz , the woman ’s attorney , declined to elaborate .
“ The notice of claim speaks for itself , ” he said .
“ We are continuing to cooperate with the ongoing criminal investigation . ”
In the claim , the woman asks for $ 3 million for personal injuries and $ 2 million in punitive damages .
The claim also states that “ other specific facts ” about the incident would come to light if the city does not compensate her and she proceeds with a lawsuit .
Moreno , 41 , and Mata , 27 , were charged in April with rape , burglary and official misconduct by the Manhattan District Attorney ’s Office .
They are both free on $ 175,000 bail and have been placed on administrative duty in the NYPD .
Both officers have pleaded not guilty .
Their next court appearance is scheduled for Sept. 16 .
The woman , a high - level executive at a well - known company , had gone out for drinks with friends at a Brooklyn club , Southpaw , between 10 and 10:30 p.m. on Dec. 6 .
When she left the popular Park Slope nightspot at 12:30 a.m. , her blood - alcohol level was twice the legal limit to drive , according to investigators .
Her friends put her in a yellow taxi and instructed the driver , Kofi Owusu , to take her home .
Owusu arrived at her place at 1 a.m. , but the victim was too tipsy to get out of the car , so he called police .
Moreno , a 17 - year NYPD veteran , and Mata , who has two years on the force , responded and helped her into her apartment at 1:10 a.m .
The officers left seven minutes later but returned to the building at 1:56 a.m. and were let in by a resident .
The notice of claim states that the pair told the resident they were investigating a noise disturbance behind the apartment complex .
The men then entered her apartment with a key they had taken from the woman .
They stayed for 17 minutes before receiving a radio call to respond to a traffic accident at 13th Street and First Avenue .
As The Post first reported , the cops then allegedly made a phony 911 call from the accident scene , saying there was a drunken homeless man at an address two buildings away from the woman’s .
The officers were dispatched to that address but instead returned to the woman ’s apartment a second time , at 2:59 a.m .
During that visit , Moreno allegedly raped her while she was lying face down in her bed and after she had vomited several times .
The two officers left the building for the last time at 3:33 a.m.
Later that morning , the woman told her landlady and friends she had been raped by cops .
She saw Moreno again when she set up a meeting with him and secretly recorded his apology to her .
The wiretap was part of a four - month probe that showed the two cops tried to cover up the crime and tampered with a memo book used to record shift details .
Prosecutors also said during the investigation that Moreno admitted having sex with the woman but claimed it was consensual .
Police Commissioner Ray Kelly was so outraged that he issued a rare rebuke of the officers , calling their conduct “ egregious ” and a “ shocking aberration . ”

Update 2/23/10 : For another , all carbon fiber wheel , check out the one we wrote about from Carbon Revolution .
A Japanese company by the name of Weds Sport has come up with the first full carbon fiber wheel .
They unveiled the wheels with what they call their Dry Carbon Wheel Project at the last Tokyo Auto Salon ( 2007 ) show .
One wheel weighs in at just 2.76 kg , which works out to be 6.08475844 pounds .
Interested in getting a set of these for your car ?
Expect to pay around $ 10,000 - $ 12,000 for the set .
While it sounds expensive , you can easily spend $ 8,000 + on custom three - piece forged wheels from a company like HRE .
I tried to get somebody to translate the Japanese from the above display at Tokyo Auto Salon , but this was the best I got from user fithamoto on the Nissan 350Z forums :
Its kinda of complicated , but it basically says its a Dry Carbon Fiber process that can be used on automobile & motorcycle tires .
Something about the weight and color too .
It points out the differences between a wet CF process & Dry CF process .
Sorry , really not much help after all .
I guess your gonna need to get a first gen .
Japanese to translate it correctly .
If anybody else can translate better , we 'd love to know what the rest says ... just post a comment below .
Weds Sport 's display also featured a wheel with a carbon fiber face , but more than likely a forged aluminum wheel surrounding .
This is probably a much cheaper solution , and potentially arguably better looks .
There is some concern about a wheel being 100 % carbon fiber that I 've seen from people online ... especially considering the weight of the wheel .
Is it strong enough to support a car normally driving , let alone at a race track ?
What about the cost of repairing the wheel if something gets damaged ?
Does it need to get fully replaced , or can it be fixed for substantially less cost ?
There is another company by the name of Dymag that makes carbon fiber wheels ( which we 'll cover in a future post ) , but their hub is made out of magnesium .
Apparently , this is for strength reasons , which makes me think these full carbon fiber rims should only be used for show cars .
I 'd like to hear Weds Sport 's thoughts on this .
If you have any insight , feel free to post your comments .
Crossposting something my wife wrote , from here :
I ’ve been in an incredibly foul mood the last couple of days , and until this morning I did not understand why .
We ’re planning on moving to where we actually want to be .
We ’re constantly being asked why we want to move to the middle of nowhere .
I tell everyone , “ because I feel hemmed in and trapped . ”
Almost no one understands what I mean .
Until this morning I could not explain the feeling of being a rat in a cage .
Now I can .
This morning I woke up on my “ do n’t remove the tag ” mattress , walked through my building code compliant house , used the federally compliant toilet , dressed the kids and drove them to their “ state certified ” charter school where they ’ll eat a state approved lunch .
I got back in my state registered , emissions compliant , insured ( by state requirement ) car and drove the legal speed limit back to the house .
I then walked through my Scottsdale code compliant yard ( no weeds in our “ desert ” landscaping ” ) into the house , drank pasteurized ( USDA required ) juice , and ate cereal processed in an inspected facility with milk from an USDA compliant dairy .
I then took my FDA approved prescription pills ( from a licensed pharmacy of course ) and played with the state - licensed dogs .
I took a call on my federally taxed cell phone ( instead of the federally taxed landline ) , stopped by our FDIC insured bank ( which received TARP money that it did n’t want and is not allowed to pay back ) , and drove along city streets ( paid for by sales and property taxes ) to the closest Costco ( which has a business license of course and pays mandated worker ’s comp ) .
I bought beef franks made from inspected beef in an inspected facility , buns made in an OSHA compliant factory , and a gallon of Frank ’s in an approved plastic bottle .
All of this before 10:15 am .
This is not restricted to me of course .
This is a normal daily life for the vast majority of Americans .
Almost everything we do is touched by one agency or another .
In preparation for moving , I ’ve been researching what I want to do with the land .
We want to build our own house and outbuildings and drink our own water and make our own electricity .
This sounds like a daunting task for us to undertake , but do n’t worry , we ’re not doing it alone .
We ’re going to get various contractors to help with the workload that will range from Window Installtors to WDR Metal Roofing Contractors .
All contractors will play an important role in construction .
In order for this to work we have to :
* Buy land with the proper zoning .
* Wait for the required escrow to be completed .
* Apply for building permits and well permits .
* Possibly apply for a zoning variance in order to raise a wind turbine .
* Build code - compliant buildings .
* Wire the electricity according to code .
* Pay sales tax on all materials used .
My biggest dream is to grow an orchard , plant some vegetables and grains , and raise our own milk and meat .
In order for this to happen , we have to
* Buy only trees that can be delivered to the correct state ( as decided by each state ’s government ) .
* Use only approved pesticides ( like we could buy anything else ) .
* Buy a tractor ( with applicable state tax ) .
If we find ourselves with an excess of food and would like to sell it we have to
* Apply for a license .
* Obtain a tax i.d. number .
* Collect sales tax .
* Label the goods according to code .
* Submit to random inspections of the dairy operation .
* Submit to random inspections of the meat process .
* In order to sell prepared foods ( like jams ) submit to inspections of the “ commercial ” kitchen ( which can not be used to prepare the family ’s food ) .

In order to set up the business properly , we have to
* Apply for a business license .
* Obtain a tax i.d. number .

God forbid we deal with the local fauna .
We plan on moving in an area thick with moose and wolves , but in order to hunt we have to obtain
* A hunting license .
* A controlled - hunt tag for the moose ( if we ’re lucky enough to get one ) .
* Forget about the wolves , they ’re “ protected ” .
Should we need to protect our livestock from the moose or wolves we are allowed to dispose of the threat , but we must
* Inform game and fish .
* Turn the carcass over to the state .
If we use firearms to dispose of the threat , we must
* Use a “ legal ” firearm ( as determined by the NFA and ATF ) .
* If we choose to use a suppressor ( because of dogs , horses , and our own hearing ) we must pay the stamp .
This does n’t even account for all of the hoops the realtor and the vendors have to go through .
All of this instead of
* Pay for property .
Make contract with owner .
* Build .
* Dig well .
* Wire .
* Buy tractor .
* Plant .
* Sell food .
* Sell services .
* Protect livestock .
No wonder I feel trapped .
I ca n’t do a single thing with my own property that does n’t involve one government agency or another ( or several ) .
I feel like a rat being funneled through a maze , and I am cognizant of the danger that someone will block off the exit .
It ’s my claustrophobia writ large .
This is just wrong .
I ’m a grown woman .
Why does the government have to meddle in all of my affairs ?
Why do I have to jump through hoops just to accomplish the most simple things in life ?
It ’s all about power and control .
Always has been always will be .
I ’m sure in the beginning the encroachment began with simple things .
After all , is n’t the government supposed to protect our rights ?
Is n’t having a dedicated police force , justice system , military , etc. worth a little in taxes ?
Then a little more encroachment .
Who can disagree with a little tax to pay for state roads ?
That ’s entirely reasonable , right ?
Then enforcement of standards .
Who can disagree with licensing teachers ?
Making sure underage kids ca n’t marry ?
Then the panics set in .
Contaminated meat ?
The government should “ do something ” so it wo n’t happen again !
E coli ?
Pasteurize EVERYTHING !
Of course , the NIMBY ’S added their own input .
Nuclear power plant ?
Not in my backyard !
Enforce zoning so I wo n’t have to worry about it !
Require my neighbor to clean up their yard so my house values do n’t go down !
Then the lobbyists .
Require farm inspections and multiple hoops so small farmers give up and “ our big backers do n’t have competition ” .
Give into the “ green ” lobby so they do n’t pull their campaign contributions .
Of course there ’s always the pure tax whores .
“ It ’s just a little reasonable fee .
On everything .
You want to pay your share , right ? ”
Of course all of this gets codified into law , and the ultimate persuasive tactic is put into play .
“ You do n’t want to be a criminal , do you ?
You do n’t want to go to prison , do you ? ”
This is exactly how we went from a system in which the government ’s job of protecting our rights to a system where government determines WHO is ALLOWED to trample on our rights .
Well I have a message for all you busybodies , bureaucrats , rent - seekers , and whored - out legislators .
LEAVE US THE HELL ALONE .
Get out of my contracts .
Get off of my land .
Leave my property alone .
Stay the hell out of my bedroom .
Most of all , KEEP YOUR NOSES OUT OF MY BUSINESS .
And everyone else ’s for that matter .

IN JABI village , on the Juba River in southern Somalia , the mothers are mostly girls .
They marry as early as 14 and have their first baby soon after .
Their duties barely advance them above a donkey : childbearing and rearing , working in the fields , fetching water from the crocodile - infested river , sweeping faeces from the straw huts .
Most have been raggedly circumcised .
They have no contraception .
There is no school .
How many women in the village have died giving birth ?
“ We cannot count the number , ” blurts out Asha Hussein ; she and the other women weep .
To most people , this is the familiar Africa , a place of large families and high fertility , a continent in which societies are under extreme stress and where the young massively outnumber the old .
Teeming , environmentally degraded , ravaged by poverty , hunger , HIV / AIDS and civil war , Africa appears the most plausible candidate ever to suffer a Malthusian disaster .
Yet there is another Africa , an Africa whose people are charting a course more similar to that of the rest of the world : one where they are living longer , having fewer children , and in which more of their children are surviving infancy .
Cities are restraining population growth , just as they have in Asia and Latin America .
Addis Ababa , Accra , Luanda , may be fetid in parts — shockingly so for those coming from richer countries — but they have low fertility .
An emergent African middle class is taking out mortgages and moving into newly built flats — and two children is what they want .
Africa is still something of a demographic outlier compared with the rest of the developing world .
Long berated ( or loved ) as the sleepiest continent , it has now become the fastest - growing and fastest - urbanising one .
Its population has grown from 110 m in 1850 to 1 billion today .
Its fertility rate is still high : the average woman born today can expect to have five children in her child - bearing years , compared with just 1.7 in East Asia .
Barring catastrophe , Africa 's population will reach 2 billion by 2050 .
To get a sense of this kind of increase , consider that in 1950 there were two Europeans for every African ; by 2050 , on present trends , there will be two Africans for every European ( see chart 1 ) .
Yet Africa is also starting out , a little late , on a demographic transition that others have already traced : as people get richer , they have fewer children .
In 1990 the continent 's total fertility rate was over six , compared with two in East Asia .
By 2030 , according to United Nations projections , the total fertility rate in sub-Saharan Africa could fall to three .
By 2050 it could be below 2.5 .
It is surely no coincidence that the past 15 years have seen Africa 's fastest - ever period of economic growth .
Africa , exceptional in so many ways , does not seem to be an exception to the rule that , as countries get richer , they experience a demographic transition .
That could outweigh all the bad news about civil war , desertification and HIV / AIDS .
As societies grow richer , and start to move from high fertility to low , the size of their working - age population increases .
The effect is a mechanical one : they have fewer children ; the grandparents ' generation has already died off ; so they have disproportionately large numbers of working - age adults .
According to a study by the Harvard Initiative for Global Health* , the share of the working - age population will rise in 27 of 32 African countries between 2005 and 2015 .
The result is a “ demographic dividend ” , which can be cashed in to produce a virtuous cycle of growth .
A fast - growing , economically active population provides the initial impetus to industrial production ; then a supply of new workers coming from villages can , if handled properly , enable a country to become more productive .
China and East Asia are the models .
On some calculations , demography accounted for about a third of East Asia 's phenomenal growth over the past 30 years .
Africa 's people are its biggest asset .
One day , its workforce could be as lusty and vital as Asia 's — especially compared with that of necrotic Europe .
But there is nothing inevitable about the ability to cash in the demographic dividend .
For that to happen , Africa will have to choose the right policies and overcome its many problems .
If a country fails to address those problems , then the demographic dividend could become a burden .
Instead of busy people at work , there will be restless , jobless young thugs ; instead of prosperity , there will be crime or civil unrest .
Africa does not have much time to get things right .
The period of greatest potential , when the working - age population is disproportionately large , is not open - ended .
In demographic terms , it is just a moment or two .
Societies age , and as they do the number of older dependents grows and the moment passes .
Africa has a generation or two to show whether it is , indeed , a demographic outlier as pessimists fear — one in which the dividend turns into a curse — or whether it is able to follow the path blazed by East Asia and reap the benefits of changing population patterns .
Can Africa capitalise on the demographic dividend ?
Malthus 's fears
There are three main reasons for pessimism .
The first is that even today it struggles to provide for its people .
Africa 's population is still growing , remember , even if more slowly because fertility is falling .
And it still faces the classic constraints , identified by Thomas Malthus in the 19th century , of land and water .
Africa today produces less food per head than at any time since independence .
Farms are getting smaller , sometimes farcically so .
Dividing village plots among sons is like cutting up postage stamps .
The average smallholding of just over half an acre ( 0.25 hectares ) is too small to feed a family — hence the continent 's widespread stunting .
Africa 's disease burden extends to its animals and crops .
Bananas , for example , are subject to two diseases — bunchy top disease and bacterial wilt disease — which can ruin 80 % of a harvest .
Scientists reckon 30 m people who depend on the fruit are at risk ; many of them live in conflict zones such as eastern Congo .
If it is to feed its people , Africa badly needs a green revolution .
In those parts with plentiful rainfall and rich soil — wet Africa — the prognosis is reasonably good .
But in bigger dry Africa , such as in Jabi village , efforts to replicate Asia 's green revolution have so far failed .
This is partly because Asia used large cropping systems and irrigation , which are unsuited to dry Africa .
Partly , it is because African leaders and foreign donors have been almost equally indifferent to smallholder farmers and simple improvements to soil and seeds .
Even if policy were right , small farms are slower than large ones to adopt better crops and farming methods .
The task of providing for hungry and thirsty people will be complicated by climate change — a big difference from the demographic transitions in Asia and Latin America .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change thinks Africa will be the continent hardest hit .
Even its best - case scenario ( an increase in global temperatures of 1.1 - 2.9 °C by 2100 ) could be ruinous .
Equatorial glaciers will melt and river - flows fall , even as demand for water rises .
The United Nations Environment Programme says 75 m - 250 m
Africans could go thirsty .
That will mean girls will spend longer walking to fetch water which could encourage them to drop out of school and bear children earlier .
On some estimates , an area of cultivable land the size of France , Germany , Italy and Britain combined will be ruined .
The International Livestock Research Institute says large parts of Africa may soon be too dry for grazing , leading to conflicts between rival cattle herders or , as in Sudan 's Darfur region , between herders and settled farmers .
These are predictions , not certainties .
They do not necessarily mean the land cannot be made to support more people .
Tree cover in southern Niger , for example , has increased tenfold since the devastating droughts of the 1970s .
A government decision to let farmers , rather than the state , own the trees , has made them more valuable by allowing locals to capture the benefits of harvesting bark , branches , seeds and fruits , meaning that locals are less likely to cut them down .
Trees limit soil erosion ; some “ fix ” the soil with nitrogen .
Elsewhere , though , the losses are huge .
Forests in Kenya have shrunk by at least 60 % since 1990 , mainly because more people are cutting down trees for fuel .
It is doubtful whether Kenya 's government is strong enough to save the Mau forest on which Nairobi depends for water and hydroelectric power .
And if Kenya cannot save a forest on which its capital depends , what hope is there for Congo 's rainforest ?
Thanks to its demographic transition .
Africa will suffer less from these afflictions than it otherwise would .
But it cannot remove them altogether , because the continent 's population will continue to grow , albeit more slowly .
The hunger , poverty and strife this causes could gravely limit the demographic dividend .
Which leads to the second reason for pessimism : Africa 's families are under greater strain than Asia 's or Latin America 's were when their demographic transitions first began .
That means , pessimists fear , that African countries may fail to navigate the virtuous cycle of industrialisation , growing employment , increasing productivity and prosperity .
One African in two is a child .
The numbers are such that traditional ways of caring for children in extended families and communities are breaking down .
In southern Africa , as a result of HIV / AIDS , an increasing number of families are headed by children .
A recent report by the African Child Policy Forum , an advocacy group , says there are now 50 m orphaned or abandoned children in Africa .
It thinks the number could rise to 100 m , meaning misery for them and more violent crimes for others .
Millions of children already live rough in towns and cities .
Prostitution and death await the poorest girls .
The boys take to glue and crime .
Africa has the highest rate of child disablement in the world .
Some think 10 - 20 % may be disabled , a staggering number , but since they are rarely seen in clinics and schools that is hard to verify .
Paediatricians suspect some are killed in infancy — not Darwin 's natural selection but the dispensing of an extra mouth to feed .
Physical stunting is probably rising .
Throughout Africa the burden of disease weighs heavily .
Between them , malaria and HIV / AIDS account for about a third of the continent 's 10 m deaths each year .
In the ten years to 1995 , more than 4 m Africans died of AIDS and many countries have ten times as many people living with HIV as have died .
Most are between 20 and 59 .
So HIV / AIDS is damaging that very section of the population — working - age adults — on which the demographic dividend depends .
If young people do not get jobs , or some stake in society , they may turn to violence .
A Norwegian demographer , Henrik Urdal , reckons a country 's risk of conflict rises four percentage points for every one - point increase in the youth population .
So Africa 's pyramids , wide at childhood and adolescence , are more promising than , say , barren Italy 's ( see chart 2 ) , but also more combustible .
In some cities the rate of unemployment is 70 % .
The unemployed are recruited into militias or gangs for the price of a day 's wage .
There was evidence of this after last year 's Kenyan elections , when politicians and businessmen stood accused of paying young men to turn parts of the country into war zones .
Lots of underemployed young people mean too many hotheads and not enough elders .
Paul Collier , an Africa specialist at Oxford University , thinks that in such circumstances young African men are “ very dangerous ” .
The third reason for pessimism is Africa 's political violence , corruption and weak or non-existent governing institutions .
According to the Harvard study , “ institutional quality [ is vital ] for converting growth of the working - age share into a demographic dividend . ”
Here the continent scores much more poorly than Asia or Latin America did in the 1960s or 1980s .
In the worst cases , civil war has meant that the demographic transition has not even begun .
Fertility in Congo , Liberia and Sierra Leone — all torn apart by internecine fighting —has barely fallen .
In Congo the rate is still six , just as it was in 1950 .
In the worst places , fecundity tends to track instability .
Africa 's highest fertility rates are in the refugee and internally displaced camps in Sudan and Somalia , then in those countries recovering from war , then in famine - pocked patches of desert and scrub stretching from Mauritania to Kenya .
Some Africa - watchers fear that parts of the continent may be getting trapped in a downward spiral : more babies mean more competition for resources , more instability — and more babies .
Jared Diamond , a professor at the University of California , Los Angeles , thinks bits of the continent are already suffering a Malthusian collapse of a sort .
The Rwandan genocide , in his view , was a result of too many people pressing on too little land , all overlaid with political tension .
Recent collapses in parts of Mauritania , Chad , Sudan , Somalia and Kenya , to name a few , are taken by neo-Malthusians to have their roots in overpopulating marginal land , compounded by political failure .
Yet such events also serve as reminders of how much can change .
Twenty five years ago , Mozambique and Namibia were also being torn apart by war and Ghana was lurching from coup to coup .
Now , these countries are peaceful , prospering and likely to benefit from the demographic dividend .
Confounding Malthus
Given half a chance , Africa shows what Malthus himself underestimated : innovation .
The leapfrogging of decrepit state telecoms by profitable mobile telephone companies is one example .
A basket of new technologies including wind and solar power stations , biofuel cookers and rainwater tanks could improve prospects for many rural Africans .
Only 4 % of the continent 's farmland is irrigated .
Double that amount , add in fertilisers , seed , credit , information and proper metal warehouses ( in some places a quarter of the harvest may be lost to rot and rats ) , and Africa might not just fill its own 2 billion stomachs , but export farm produce as well .
Emerging Asia and Latin America have been able to absorb much greater numbers of people thanks to urbanisation .
Africa 's rate of urbanisation is the fastest the world has ever seen , says Anna Tibaijuka , the head of Habitat , the UN agency responsible for urban development .
In 1950 only Alexandria and Cairo exceeded 1 m people .
When the city rush is done , Africa may have 80 cities with more than 1 m people , plus a cluster of megacities headed by Kinshasa , Lagos and Cairo — none of which show signs of mass starvation .
Intermediary towns of 50,000 - 100,000 people will soak up most of those coming from the countryside .
Urbanisation is part of the solution to Africa 's demographic problems , not a manifestation of them .

Will the next generation be better off ?
Indeed , it is an open question whether demography should really be considered an African problem — or one of its advantages .
Over the past year , the continent has had the fastest economic growth per person in the world , partly because it has been somewhat less affected by the collapse of world trade , but partly because of the small increases countries are seeing in the number of people of working age .
The UN Population Division points out that Africa 's overall population is 8 % lower today than it would have been if its fertility rate had stayed at its 1970s level .
And the trend towards lower fertility is likely to accelerate .
The use of modern contraceptives in sub-Saharan Africa is only 12 % ( though it has doubled since 1994 ) .
In Somalia it is 1 % .
By comparison , the rate in Asia and Latin America is over 40 % , so contraceptive use is likely to rise sharply .
Demography needs to be put in perspective .
It is not destiny .
Africa needs a green revolution ; more efficient cities ; more female education ; honest governments ; better economic policies .
Without those things , Africa will not reap its demographic dividend .
But without the transition that Africa has started upon , the continent 's chances of achieving those good things would be even lower than they are .
Demography is a start .
* Realizing the Demographic dividend : is Africa any different ?
By David E. Bloom and others .
There ’s a particular breed of lawmaker on Capitol Hill that is pushing hard against a public health care plan , much to the delight of two seriously moneyed special interest groups–insurers and pharmaceuticals .
They ’re the Blue Dogs : moderate , vocal and funded in part by the industries trying to protect their bottom line .
The typical member* of the Blue Dog caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives has received $ 10,300 more from insurers than the typical non-Blue Dog Democrat in the House ( including health and accident insurers , HMOs and other health services ) and only $ 3,625 less than the typical House Republican .
Earlier this month , the Blue Dogs sent a letter to House leadership arguing that a public option should be created “ only if insurance market reforms and increased competition do n’t lower costs on their own , ” according to the Politico .
The support for Blue Dogs from health care professionals is even more evident .
Health pros are among the top 20 industry donors to 38 Blue Dogs since 1989 and are the No. 1 donor for five of them .
Health pros have also given the typical Blue Dog $ 47,550 more than the typical non-Blue Dog Democrat in the House .
This month the American Medical Association , which lobbies on behalf of doctors , also came out against a public health insurance plan .
The AMA is among the top 20 contributors to 10 Blue Dogs since 1989 .
Insurance and pharmaceutical companies fear that a public health option would allow the government to control costs and steal business .
And with the Blue Dogs leading the charge against the government - funded plan , the industries might just get their way .
Without any support from the GOP , two - thirds of the coalition ’s members , who mostly represent Southern and Midwestern states , would have to get behind the House legislation , according to Kaiser Health News .
The health sector overall has given $ 62,650 more to the typical Blue Dog Democrat than to the typical non-Blue Dog Dem since 1989 , while hospitals and nursing homes also favor them , giving $ 5,680 and $ 5,550 more , respectively .
The typical House Republican , however , has collected more than the typical Democrat–Blue Dog or not–from insurers , health professionals and the health sector overall .
When it comes to the pharmaceutical and health products industry , the typical Blue Dog has collected more than the typical non-Blue Dog Dem , but on average , the non-Blue Dog Democrats have brought in more from the companies .
* The term “ typical ” refers to the median , which we are using for comparison in part because of the handful of lawmakers in leadership who have raised large amounts of money , skewing the mean .
Here ’s a list of the members of the Blue Dog Coalition and the total they ’ve received to their leadership PAC and candidate committees from the employees and PACs of various health - related industries and the health sector overall since 1989 :

EFF and Public Knowledge this week urged Congress to give American technology users more input in international trade agreements that have broad ramifications for digital freedom .
In written testimony submitted to the House Ways and Means Committee , the groups told lawmakers that the U.S. Trade Representative 's influential industry trade advisory committee on intellectual property should represent the interests of all stakeholders , and not just IP owners .
PK and EFF also called on Congress to amend the Trade Act to change the default rules that allow the USTR to close ITAC meetings and prevent disclosure of ITAC documents to the public .
The current controversy over the proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) demonstrates why this is necessary .
Representatives of the MPAA , the RIAA , ESA and BSA have called for treaty provisions that would require Internet service providers to engage in filtering of their customers '
Internet communications for potentially copyright - infringing material , force mandatory disclosure of personal information about alleged copyright infringers , and adopt " Three Strikes " policies requiring ISPs to automatically terminate customers '
Internet access upon a repeat allegation of copyright infringement .
Obviously , these provisions raise serious privacy , due process , fairness and free speech questions that demand public interest input .
The USTR has confirmed that members of the industry trade advisory committee on IP have been given access to draft ACTA negotiating texts and provided advice to the USTR .
Meanwhile , citizens , and the public interest groups which represent them , have had to rely on leaked documents to understand ACTA 's likely affect on them .
As Public Knowledge notes , currently the industry trade advisory committee on intellectual property is composed almost exclusively of representatives from large content and pharmaceutical companies .
As international intellectual property norms are increasingly created through closed bilateral and plurilateral trade negotiations , rather than in traditional open multilateral venues like WIPO , it is critical that policymakers obtain balanced input from all affected stakeholders .
It 's time to correct the imbalance and ensure that trade agreements reflect the interests of all Americans .
A generalization of multiple groups of Protestant Christianity .
It 's not actually a denomination , but a category that churches of many denominations fall under , ranging from some baptist churches in the south to non-denominational churches in the north and along the coastline .
Using that criteria , the majority of protestant Christians in the US probably fall under the " Evangelical " category .
Despite popular belief , they are real , tangible people , who are just as capable of being discriminated against as the people who they are frequently ( and usually , falsely ) accused of being discriminated against .
An Evangelical Christian is best characterized as someone who wants to spread the Gospel of Christ by being living examples to the people around them .
Real Evangelicals do not believe in forcing people who are not Christians to act like Christians , because they believe that Christ his followers to only come of their own free will .
Evangelical Christians should NOT be confused with " fundamentalists , " a term that has come to mean someone who is far more mental than fun .
Evangelicals tend to believe in more literal interpretations of the bible , but that does not mean that they are against scientific study or using critical thinking ( after all , how can you understand how the Bible applies to your life without critical thinking ? ) .
Also , they do not want religion to control the government , because as Martin Luther figured out during the dark ages , religion controlling government is actually a cheap disguise for the government controlling religion .
True Evangelicals want freedom of religion , and that includes the freedom to share the gospel with others .
Evangelical Christians are a large , and unfortunately , misunderstood part of the global population .
They are constantly stereotyped as being hateful , bigoted people , even though many of them have done many great works for bringing rights to people and sending help to places .
Evangelicals want to change their communities for the better by changing the people , one person at a time .
Maybe if people came to realize that the large majority of Evangelical Christians are actually legitimately nice people who enjoy life and are happy to share their happiness with others , they 'd realize that the mainstream perception of " evangelical " is merely an aggressively propagated stereotype that aims to strip Christians of their legitimacy as human beings .
Did you hear the one about the Republican senator who thinks health care reform should n't be allowed to pass with less than 80 votes ?
Well , it turns out the senator ( Chuck Grassley ) was n't kidding , but Rachel Maddow mocks him anyway , and she 's joined by the WNBA 's Sue Hicks and Gov. Howard Dean .
How unfair to poor Chuck .
The backdrop for this is a freakout by the GOP on the question of whether or not Democratic senators should sidestep the filibuster , allowing Democrats to pass important pieces of health care reform ( including the public option ) with a simple majority .
Republicans claim they would be disenfranchised if Democrats were allowed to pass laws in the U.S. Senate without a supermajority , but you need only look at the actual votes cast for senators to figure out where the real supermajority is .
Here 's the numbers , including votes cast for appointees ' predecessors in CO , DE , IL , and NY :
Votes cast for the 40 Republican senators : 44.2 million
Votes cast for the 60 Democratic senators : 82.3 million
If you subtract votes cast for the 5 Democratic senators who would consider supporting filibuster , their vote total drops to 79.8 million .
Whether or not you do that , though , the bottom - line is that nearly twice as many people voted for Democratic senators as Republicans .
The next time Republicans want to whine about getting disenfranchised , they oughta ' take it up with the voters who put the Democrats in office .

This mild oil , known as bois de rose , possesses a rich aroma and is used as an ingredient in expensive perfumes .
Rosewood essential oil has a slightly spicy , floral smell , which is captivating and rather special .
The oil is rich in linalool , a chemical used in fragrance industries , which helps give it the distinctive scent .
Since rosewood essential oil is often harvested from the Brazilian rain forest , environmental concerns have lessened the market for it in recent years .
When buying rosewood essential oil , or aromatherapy products which contain rosewood oil , checking the source is important , if possible .
This article is about rosewood - details about the plant , the health benefits associated with rosewood oil , and the aromatherapy products which make use of the oil 's properties and fragrance .
DoJ said to have dropped two - year investigation into corrupt former Florida Rep 's lobbyist - funded trip to Scotland ...
Brad Friedman Byon 8/5/2009 , 9:35 am PT
[ Updated : Former Congressman Bob Ney ( R - OH ) responds to this article .
Ney , convicted for his dealings with Abramoff , including a trip to Scotland , suggests Feeney may have been helped off the hook by friends in high places .
See details and Ney 's comments in UPDATE at bottom of story . ]
Late last week , alleged vote - rigging conspirator and former three - term Congressman Tom Feeney ( R- FL ) was informed that the Department of Justice was dropping their two year probe into his 2003 lobbyist - paid junket with Jack Abramoff to play golf in Scotland , according to his attorney Robert Luskin ( who also happens to be Karl Rove 's criminal attorney ) .
The DoJ 's investigation was stymied earlier this year by an appellate court decision disallowing their subpoena of Feeney 's statements to the U.S. House Ethics Commission on the basis of Constitutional separation of powers .
As we noted last month , the friendly Feeney finding was likely to foul the fed 's felony fact - finding against the failed former Florida Congressman .
The Ethics Commission had , themselves , let Feeney off the hook on the last day in which Republicans controlled the panel before Democrats took over in 2007 .
He would agree to pay just $ 5,643 for the private plane trip and swanky vacation with rightwing lobbyists , despite court papers declaring the trip to have been worth approximately $ 20,000 ...
Prior to Feeney 's 2003 trip , currently indicted former Majority Whip Tom Delay ( R - TX ) enjoyed a similar trip with Abramoff in 2000 , and in 2002 it was Rep. Bob Ney ( R - OH ) 's turn .
Ney pleaded guilty to charges related to his dealings with the convicted lobbyist and served 17 month in federal prison .
[ Update : Ney has replied in comments , in response to this article .
See UPDATE at bottom of story for details . ]
" Life 's too short to be bitter , " Feeney told FLORIDA TODAY earlier this week .
" But I guess most people would be very , very bitter . "
No , Tom .
Most people , having done what you know you did , would be damned relieved to have gotten off the hook as easily as you did .
Just ask Delay or Ney .
But nicely done , playing the victim there .
Feeney reportedly spent some $ 270,000 in campaign funds for " legal services " in fighting the case , according to FEC fiings .
" He also paid more than $ 106,000 to a Baltimore - based consulting firm that specializes in e-mail recovery and computer forensics , " FT reported , and " In the first six months of this year alone , Feeney spent $ 118,000 on fees related to the investigation . "
Money well spent .
Though it 's unclear if those who donated to his campaign would agree .
The former Congressman lost his seat in 2008 to Democrat Suzanne Kosmas , despite his having , literally , carved the once - conservative 24th Congressional district out for himself when he served as Speaker of the Florida House .
The BRAD BLOG has been closely following Feeney --- who named among Congress ' " Most Corrupt " for four years in a row by a non-partisan D.C. ethics watchdog organization --- ever since late 2004 when a then - Republican computer programmer , Clint Curtis , alleged Feeney had asked him to create a vote - rigging software prototype when they both worked at Yang Enterprises Inc. ( YEI ) , an Oviedo , FL software firm .
Feeney was their registered lobbyist and general counsel at the time , even as he was concurrently Speaker of Florida 's House , and even as the company had millions of dollars in state contracts .
Despite Curtis ' sworn affidavit , video - taped Congressional testimony , and successful polygraph test on the matter , Feeney has maintained his innocence in the vote - rigging scheme .
He has , however , long refused to take a polygraph examination as long - challenged by Curtis who would eventually run against Feeney , unsuccessfully , for the Congressional seat in 2006 , in continuing hopes of bringing Feeney 's corruption to light .
An award - winning documentary film , Murder , Spies & Voting Lies : The Clint Curtis Story , detailing the entire sordid affair ( as well as your humble blogger 's effort to investigate and report the story ) was released in 2008 .
UPDATE : In comments left on this item , Ney himself has responded , in an apparent shot at some of his former colleagues , to wryly note :
Alberto Gonzales , wonder if he weighed in on this before exiting his job ? " .
Interesting decision , huh !!!
Maybe I should have been on the ticket with the President 's Brother a few years backAlberto Gonzales , wonder if he weighed in on this before exiting his job ? " .
The BRAD BLOG has confirmed the comments did , in fact , come from the convicted former Congressman who , having served his time , now hosts a daily radio show in Ohio .
Ney 's comment about being " on the ticket with the President 's Brother a few years back " refers to Feeney 's run for Lt. Governor , on Jeb Bush 's ticket in Florida 's 1994 Gubernatorial race .
Bush / Feeney lost that year in a close race , but would go on to win , without Feeney on the ticket , in his second attempt in 1998 .
Nearly 5 million of the nation ’s most polluting vehicles were quietly excluded from the popular “ cash for clunkers ” program after lobbyists for antique auto parts suppliers and car collectors persuaded the government to shut out cars built before 1984 .
The restriction has prevented consumers nationwide who own older cars and trucks from cashing in on the $ 3 - billion federal program even though many do n’t consider their jalopies to be collectors ’ items .
When the federal government announced the rebates of up to $ 4,500 , Chris Hurst said , it looked like the perfect time to unload his gas - guzzling 1981 Ford F - 150 pickup .
Hurst , who lives in the Sierra foothills north of Fresno , was surprised to discover his truck was too old to qualify .
“ If we could have gotten that rebate , it would have worked perfectly for us , ” said Hurst , who is now trying to sell the vehicle , equipped with Ford ’s biggest V - 8 engine , for $ 1,600 .

The restrictions were pushed by lobbyists for the Specialty Equipment Market Assn. , a Diamond Bar group that represents companies that sell parts and services to classic and antique car collectors .
The group , as well as classic car enthusiasts , have opposed cash for clunkers because they do n’t want older vehicles to be destroyed .
When the proposals for a clunker buyback program surfaced early this year , the specialty equipment association opposed the entire concept because such a program could shrink the size of the market for aftermarket parts .
The association eventually got lawmakers to adopt the age limit .
“ We are very pleased that Congress was able to include that in the program , ” said Stuart Gosswein , director of regulatory affairs at the association .
The association represents more than 7,000 companies that make all manner of auto - related products , including reproduction Model T tires and AMC Gremlin upholstery .
The powerful interest group has won legislative battles nationwide to protect owners of classic cars and hot rods from laws covering vehicle noise , emissions tests and much else .
Advertisement
The cash - for - clunkers legislation was sponsored by Rep. Betty Sutton ( D - Ohio ) and Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D - Mich . ) .
Neither returned calls seeking comment .
The final wording of the bill , including the provision requested by the interest group , was ironed out in a legislative conference committee and attached to a military spending bill .
Consumer and environmental groups reluctantly went along with the provision because they were fighting for any rule that would push consumers to buy more fuel - efficient vehicles than the ones they were trading in .
“ I do n’t know that the program makes a whole lot of environmental sense , ” said Lena Pons , a policy analyst for Public Citizen , which pushed for tougher fuel - economy standards .
“ There is not a whole lot of justification for the classic car industry to block older vehicles from being traded in . ”
Other critics fault the age limit on economic grounds , saying it makes little sense even for collectors .
Advertisement
“ If I own a 30 - year - old Mustang , the value of my car goes up if others get destroyed , ” said Chris Edwards , an economist for the libertarian Cato Institute .
“ It is a typical industry loophole that does n’t protect the little guy , but does protect some special interest group . ”
Many Americans do n’t have the money to buy a new car , said Dan Baker , a part - time handyman and gardener in Greenville , S.C. , who said he wished he could have gotten a rebate to upgrade to a better used vehicle .
“ I ’m the kind of person this program could have helped , ” he said .
Baker is trying to sell a brown 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass SS with a broken air conditioner and rusty fenders for $ 1,200 .
Advertisement
“ It ’s just an old car with 101,000 miles on it , ” said Baker , who hopes to join the ministry in the near future .
“ It is not a classic . ”
Groups representing salvage yards and service garages also derailed a provision in the bill that would have required the entire drivetrain of traded - in clunkers to be destroyed .
Junkyards are now permitted to strip and resell all parts of the vehicles except the engines .
Other countries have instituted cash - for - clunkers programs , but they have n’t placed restrictions that block older cars from being traded in .
Germany ’s version , which began in January , offered 2,500 euros ( a little more than $ 3,500 ) for any car older than nine years .
Britain , Spain , France and several other European countries have instituted programs open to cars older than 10 years .
Japan ’s program , instituted this spring , pays 250,000 yen ( about $ 2,600 ) for cars older than 13 years .

Proponents of the age limit argue that older vehicles not only represent a very small portion of the nation ’s overall automotive fleet , but also are n’t driven very much and thus their tailpipe emissions do n’t contribute heavily to global warming .
There are 4.8 million vehicles older than 25 years on the road in the U.S. today , representing about 2 % of all registered vehicles , according to research from Experian Automotive .
The percentage of old vehicles in California is even higher , nearly 3 % , according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles .
Data from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory suggests that vehicles are driven half as many miles annually after 10 years on the road as when new .
“ Most guys I talk to drive their collector car 3,000 miles , tops , ” said Daniel Strohl , associate editor of the blog at Hemmings Motor News , a publication for auto enthusiasts that also called for the age limit .
“ The total amount of pollution from a very small pool of cars is really very minor . ”
State regulators sharply contradict that assertion .
Experts at the California Air Resources Board say cars built before modern engine controls were fully developed in the 1980s are significantly dirtier than new cars .
Advertisement
For example , a 1965 Chevrolet Malibu , when new , produced 400 times the smog - forming pollutants that a new 2010 Malibu produces , said John Swanton , an air pollution specialist with the board .
Thus , an old Malibu driven only 1,000 miles per year produces as much pollution as a new Malibu would in 400,000 miles .
A major reason is that cars made before the mid-1970s lacked catalytic converters .
Yet many states , including California , exempt those very vehicles from smog control laws .
Those loopholes are also the product of lobbying by the classic car industry .
Smog exemptions “ are something we absolutely support , ” said Steve Moskowitz , executive director of the Antique Automobile Club of America .
“ These cars literally ca n’t meet those standards , ” said Moskowitz , a former auto dealer who collects Oldsmobiles dating to 1903 .
Older vehicles also are among the least fuel efficient .
In 1975 , the overall new - car fleet averaged just 13 mpg , according to government data , compared with 22 mpg in 1985 .
Advertisement
And although some old cars are real classics , others are truly just clunkers , said Leslie Kendall , curator of the Petersen Automotive Museum .
“ There are some 50 - year - old cars that are only good for transportation , ” Kendall said .
Los Angeles attorney Chia Evers was excited about using cash for clunkers to buy a new hatchback , such as a Scion xA or a Nissan Cube .
But she was disappointed to discover that her 1973 Volkswagen Beetle was too old to qualify as a trade - in .
Advertisement
“ I feel really guilty about the smog , ” said Evers , who recently started her own practice and does n’t have enough money to buy a new car without an incentive .
“ Driving old cars is fun , but the gas mileage is terrible . ”

For better or worse , Twitter is a full - fledged phenomenon these days .
And why not ?
How else are we supposed to know when Ashton Kutcher is going to the grocery store ?
But as fantastic as it is to finally be able to let people know that you 're in a shoe store without having to tote along a laptop , technology should be used with caution .
There are just some places where you really should n't get your tweet on .
For example ...
6 From a Bar

Unless you 're a sports announcer or you happen to be hosting the last hour of the Today Show , getting hammered while doing anything that involves communicating with people via technology is usually a bad idea .
For most of us , tweeting while drunk is n't a problem , provided you are among the 99.9 percent of users that nobody gives a shit about .
But for celebrities , it 's a whole different story .
For every tweet , there are countless scrutinizing bloggers and journalists praying that you say something stupid .
San Francisco Giants relief pitcher Brian Wilson found this out the hard way .
After blowing his first save of the season during a day game against the Arizona Diamondbacks , a team that could n't hit their way into the second round of a Whack - A - Mole tournament , fans and sportswriters started looking for something to blame his shitty performance on .
In short order , they came up with a plausible theory thanks to this ...
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
As Wilson 's tweets from the night before reveal , not only does he drink pansy ass coffee drinks and aspire to be Don Johnson circa 1985 , but he was hanging out in a bar ( and coming dangerously close to getting into fistfights ) until after 1 am the morning of the game .
Sure , damn near all of us have shown up to work hungover before , but we are n't getting paid millions of dollars to do our shit .
Above : Cracked headquarters , Monday morning .
After word of the ill - timed tweets got out , fans far and wide were questioning Wilson 's dedication to the game .
A few feeble attempts at explaining himself later ( it was all made up ! ) , Wilson did what most of us hope all Twitter users will do eventually .
He deleted his Twitter account entirely .
Oh , the Republicans have been having a field day with this mantra - that employers would shunt their employees into the public plan .
But they 're really upset for the same reason Sebelius mentioned as a positive : Job lock .
Above all else , the Republican party stands for cheap , disposable labor with no rights or protections .
God forbid you should have a public option - you could up and leave your job anytime you wanted !
In the meantime , a White House staffer sent this statement to health care activists late this afternoon :
Nothing has changed .
POTUS has always said that what is essential is that health insurance reform must lower costs , ensure that there are affordable options for all Americans and increase choice and competition .
He believes the public option is the best way to achieve those goals .
From This Week , with Jake Tapper :
TAPPER : OK , I 'll -- I 'll take that as a " yes " and then we 'll move on .
The president often -- and he did last night in Colorado -- says to the American people that , if they like their doctor , they can keep their doctor .
If they like their insurance plan , they can keep their insurance plan .
But according to the Congressional Budget Office , if a public plan , if a public option is introduced , at least 2 million Americans will be switched by their employer from a private plan to the public plan .
Now , that does n't get into the whole issue of employers dropping health care coverage in general and all the people that will be added to the rolls , and I understand that .
But how can the administration make the promise that if you like your insurance plan you can keep it , when CBO and other analysts estimate that some people will be switched from private to public ?
SEBELIUS : Well , I think , Jake , if you -- if you think about a marketplace option and new plans being created in Toledo , Ohio , or in California or in Florida , the network of doctors is likely to be pretty identical .
A lot of plans exist in the same marketplace , and doctors are part of a variety of networks .
So the idea that you would keep your own doctor is highly likely .
The other thing about the -- the new marketplace is , I think , the president is eager to stabilize the employer marketplace .
Small - business owners right now are dropping coverage because they can't any longer afford it .
They can't stay in the market .
With the new tax incentives that are part of health reform , small - business owners would be encouraged to actually stabilize their insurance plans , to offer coverage to their employees .
They 'd have tax credits .
They'd have some help for the low - income employees to be able to afford the coverage .
So I think , if anything , it would n't dismantle the present market .
It would actually help to provide a more stable private marketplace , which right now serves 180 million Americans very well .
People like those plans .
They want to make sure that if they have employer - based coverage that they like , they can keep it .
And this would actually encourage and help employers to stay in the market .
On the other hand , if you lose your job , right now you lose your coverage .
And -- and the new reform plan would make sure that you had an affordable option even if you lost your job , if you wanted to go out on your own and start your new business , which lots of people want to do , you would n't lose your health coverage .
So it would have some choices for consumers to make so they would n't have the kind of job lock that we see now across America .
BELFAST , Me. 
On America ’s highways , wind turbines may be the ultimate oversize load .
Trucks carrying silvery blades nearly half a football field long have been lumbering through this placid coastal town all summer , backing up traffic as they slowly exit the roadway .
Huge , tubular chunks of tower also pass through .
Tall pieces of machinery looking somewhat like jet engines travel at night because they require special routing to avoid overpasses .
As demand for clean energy grows , towns around the country are finding their traffic patterns roiled as convoys carrying disassembled towers that will reach more than 250 feet in height , as well as motors , blades and other parts roll through .
Escorted by patrol cars and gawked at by pedestrians , the equipment must often travel hundreds of miles from ports or factories to the remote , windy destinations where the turbines are erected .
In Belfast , officials have worked hard to keep the nuisance to a minimum , but about 200 trucks are passing through this year on their way to western Maine , carrying parts that have been shipped from Denmark and Vietnam .
Plenty can go wrong despite months of planning .
In Idaho and Texas , trucks laden with tall turbine parts have slammed into interstate overpasses , requiring hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs .
In Minnesota last year , a truck carrying a tubular tower section got stuck at a railroad crossing ; an approaching train stopped just in time .
Also in Minnesota , a woman was killed last September when her car , driven by her husband , collided at an intersection with a truck carrying a wind turbine .
( After a police investigation , local officials found that the truck driver was not at fault . )
Maine had a glitch of its own two years ago , after a truck carrying a big piece of turbine got stuck for hours while trying to round a corner near Searsport , a port near Belfast that receives many turbine parts from overseas .

Peta are known for doing some dumb stunts , but now it 's starting to look like they 've just decided to take on everyone who is n't , like , you know , one of them .
They have just run some ads in Orlando which call larger people " whales " .
The poster features the back of an overweight woman and has the slogan " Save the whales - Lose the blubber - go vegetarian " .
That would seem to be making a pretty strong whale - person link , right ?
" It appears you are implying that overweight people are like whales , " WJXT - TV reporter Scott Johnson said to a PETA representative .
" Not at all , " said Ashley Byrne , of PETA .
" It 's just a way of grabbing people 's attention .
It 's just a provocative way to grab attention . "
feeling a bit ashamed that we ever supported PETA .
They should be ashamed over this .
So putting a photo of a fatter person next to a big slogan saying " save the whales " is n't comparing a person to a big , blubbery whale , it 's just being " provocative " ?
But is n't it being provocativeit 's insensitively hurling abuse at fat people ?
And if it is n't hurling abuse , then how would it be being provocative ?
Oh and ... what is theof being provocative just for the sake of it ?
What is there to respect in an organisation which is happy to run sexy pictures of slim people ( like every fashion product ever ) , and now run photos having a go at the overweight ( like diet product ads ) , and yet thinks its in some way progressive ?
Is it really helpful in the culture we 're stuck in for an animal charity to encourage bullying of fat people ?
And - come to that - if being overweight is such a terrible thing , and animals are so great , what 's with the using " whale " as a term of abuse ?
Or is the poster suggesting that being overweight puts you on a par with one of nature 's majestic giants ?
Or is it not even fully thought through ?
The adverts have provoked some reaction though - and this , by the way , is where we get onto the music connection in this story .
It 's provoked Tegan And Sara to revoke their support for PETA .
They just tweeted
The time to really have felt ashamed about supporting PETA , though , was when it started to emerge that , while they 're very good at getting people to prance about in the nack to promote them , they 're actually shit at caring for animals , and killed 95 % of the animals they were ' caring ' for last year .
While his onetime screenwriting partner Quentin Tarantino was preparing this week for the release of his latest movie , Roger Avary was pleading guilty to charges of vehicular manslaughter and drunken driving , The Ventura County Star reported .
Mr. Avary , who in 1995 won an Academy Award for writing the screenplay for “ Pulp Fiction ” with Mr. Tarantino , entered the plea on Tuesday in Ventura County Superior Court in California .
The charges stem from an accident on Jan. 13 , 2008 , when Mr. Avary ’s car hit a telephone pole in Ojai .
A passenger , Andreas Zini , was killed in the crash and Mr. Avary ’s wife , Gretchen , was injured .
Mr. Avary pleaded not guilty to the charges in December but has apologized for the accident .
He remains free on bail and is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 29 .
As the call for legalization continues to reverberate louder than ever before , the hired soldiers in the war on drugs are seeking to defend their livelihood with arguments of unprecedented desperation and incoherence :
Legalization is not the solution , [ statewide CAMP Commander Michael ]
Johnson said , given that most of the pot is being grown illegally on public parkland by foreign citizens who can not be taxed .
[ San Francisco Chronicle ]
You wo n't have to tax them because they 'll be out of business .
No one 's going to buy some crappy weed that 's grown illegally and destructively in our national forests if there 's an alternative .
The instant you allow California 's legions of skilled and socially conscious marijuana growers to operate in a regulated and legitimate environment , everything ugly and uncontrollable about the state 's marijuana industry will change overnight .
Just watch how he proves my point :
" I 've been doing this for five years , and there just seems to be more and more of it everywhere , " Johnson said .
" We do n't even bother with medicinal grows .
What we 're concerned about is the destruction of the habitat . "
See how he admits that the " medicinal grows " are not what 's causing the problem ?
That 's because they 're legal and regulated .
It really is n’t any more complicated than that .

Sweet !
Now I wish my thesis were longer ! ;-)
You could totally sell a service of this - receive anyone 's thesis and any number of published papers , and swirl them together as if they were in a tornado , and print it at high enough resolution that they can tell that the pages actually contain their stuff and not just random crap .
( It 's THEIR CRAP dammit ! )

Legs under a table ?
By George Shears
The America Clean Energy and Security ( ACES ) bill was recently passed in the U.S. House of Representatives by a very narrow margin and now faces what is likely to be an even more challenging uphill battle for passage in the U.S. Senate .
One major concern voiced by those who are opposed to the passage of this bill is that it will roll back oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear and bio-fuels , resulting in less energy and , therefore , continued dependence on foreign oil .
Two other major objections are that it will markedly increase energy and utility costs and that it will send manufacturing jobs overseas , contributing to even higher unemployment than exists now .
The following video , however , lays out a highly compelling and diametrically opposite interpretation .
It shows , in fact , how this landmark legislation offers an elegant and relatively rapid way to switch to clean energy while simultaneously creating around 2 million new jobs .
As a means of ushering in the new “ Industrial Green Revolution , ” this highly innovative plan has many other important benefits as well .
The main presenter in this video , Van Jones , is the founder of Green for All and is currently the Special Advisor for Green Jobs , Enterprise and Innovation at the White House Council on Environmental Quality .
He is also a TIME Magazine 2008 Environmental Hero , and NY Times Bestselling author of The Green Collar Economy : How One Solution Can Solve Our Two Biggest Problems ( Harper One 2008 ) .
This book has been endorsed by Al Gore , Tom Daschle and Nancy Pelosi .
The simple new paradigm that Van Jones presents in this video is very down to earth and realistic .
At the same time , it is truly transformative in its scope and offers some much needed hope for our collective future .
Hillbilly Horror Rules
Films like Deliverance and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have given us all a healthy fear of hillbillies .
Truthfully though the same principle applies in any country of the world , it does n't have to be the deep south of the US , anywhere remote with inbred locals is liable to be hazardous to your health .
There are loads of horror films that use the same basic format , from Wolf Creek to Eden Lake .
I call them hillbilly movies but you can call them survival flicks if you prefer .
In this article we take a look at some of the classic hillbilly horror rules .
The Rules
Someone always decides to poke fun at the slack jawed locals and sparks off their murderous rage .
Someone will always ask one of the hillbillies for directions so he can guide them to a deserted murder spot .
Usually the person they ask for directions looks evil and often they will actually leer , these are good cues that you do n't want to follow their directions .
The people in the film will always follow their directions .
Someone always goes into a house uninvited and snoops around .
They ignore obvious signs of danger or insanity like animal carcasses and blood encrusted hammers .
Someone always tries to reason with the axe wielding hillbilly when things have already obviously gone beyond the point of no return .
It never works .
Someone always seems to get rescued by running onto a road in front of a pick up truck or van ( it 's rarely a car ) .
The driver is always the vaguely respectable member of the murderous hillbilly clan who takes them straight back to the hillbilly family home .
Someone always tries to appeal to one of the hillbillies to help them , usually a child , woman or extremely retarded hillbilly .
It never works .
Someone always runs to a car and then can't find the keys or can't start the car before being impaled .
If they do start the car a hillbilly will always bang on the side window as they drive past .
They will always crash into a tree within five seconds .
Someone always hides in a stupid hiding place instead of running away .
They always get caught unless they hide under a human corpse or an animal carcass .
Someone always gets caught in a trap of some kind , usually a big rusty man trap .
The others always waste time trying to save them but the person who gets caught in the trap never survives the film .
One of the male victims will always try to fist fight the biggest , most psychotic hillbilly .
This will only earn him a bigger death scene .
One of the female victims always forgets how to run , falls up or down a muddy hill , gets their T - shirt wet or a combination of all three .
There will always be a scene where they fall into a dead body pit or have a body fall on top of them .
When the psychotic killer , who ripped the man apart with his bare hands earlier , catches the woman scrambling back pathetically in the mud to try and escape him he will be sucker punched by a big branch and allow her to get away again .
There will always be a scene where the woman is forced to watch as her husband or boyfriend is tortured , murdered and sometimes skinned alive .
She will always make a whimper sound or scream and give herself away .
There will always be a scene where the hiding victim is about to be discovered when the hillbilly gets called away for dinner .
Even although it would only take them a second to look behind the tree stump , the barrel or in the cupboard the person calling them will be so insistent that they 'll leave immediately .
Police are not capable of saving you in the event of a hillbilly attack .
If you find a policeman he will always either be part of the hillbilly family or be killed because he is pointing the gun at you while the hillbilly sneaks up behind him with a crossbow .
Mobile phones can never get a signal and only appear in hillbilly movies to get people killed .
Either they finally get a signal which means they are due to be stabbed in the back or the phone goes off when they are hiding .
The only way to successfully survive a hillbilly movie is to embrace insanity and embark on a murderous rampage of your own .
If you are n't covered in blood , limping down a highway and muttering to yourself by the end of the film then you 're in a shallow grave or hanging in the hillbilly walk in freezer .

Osorio Out as Red Bulls Coach
No surprise : Juan Carlos Osorio is gone as coach of the Red Bulls , who are on pace for the worst season in MLS history after reaching the league 's championship game last year .
Assistant Richie Williams was named interim coach , the second time he has filled that role .
" I want to apologize to the fans for the results this season , " Osorio said .
Perhaps no one knows Williams better than Galaxy Coach Bruce Arena , who coached the former defensive midfielder at the University of Virginia and D.C. United .
Williams lived at Arena 's house in Virginia after college many years ago and assisted Arena with the Red Bulls .
They talk on the phone every week , Arena said .
" I see a guy who will be demanding of his players , demand quality and demand concentration .
If they inherit half of Richie 's competitiveness , they may win the league this year .
Is that possible ?
I 'd guess they'd have to make the playoffs , which is n't possible , but the guy will get the most out of them . "
When you saw him as a player , could you see the characteristics of a future coach ?
" Actually , no .
He was so competitive back then .
He has matured ; he 's not punching anyone out anymore !
He was a little crazy as a player and you would not have thought of him as a coach , but he has changed and he knows what it takes to lead a team . "

2. THE COURAGE TO FLIP
When I asked my mother recently what exactly endeared Julia Child to her , she explained that “ for so many of us she took the fear out of cooking ” and , to illustrate the point , brought up the famous potato show ( or , as Julia pronounced it , “ the poh - TAY - toh show ! ” ) , one of the episodes that Meryl Streep recreates brilliantly on screen .
Millions of Americans of a certain age claim to remember Julia Child dropping a chicken or a goose on the floor , but the memory is apocryphal : what she dropped was a potato pancake , and it did n’t quite make it to the floor .
Still , this was a classic live - television moment , inconceivable on any modern cooking show : Martha Stewart would sooner commit seppuku than let such an outtake ever see the light of day .
The episode has Julia making a plate - size potato pancake , sautéing a big disc of mashed potato into which she has folded impressive quantities of cream and butter .
Then the fateful moment arrives :
“ When you flip anything , you just have to have the courage of your convictions , ” she declares , clearly a tad nervous at the prospect , and then gives the big pancake a flip .
On the way down , half of it catches the lip of the pan and splats onto the stovetop .
Undaunted , Julia scoops the thing up and roughly patches the pancake back together , explaining : “ When I flipped it , I did n’t have the courage to do it the way I should have .
You can always pick it up . ”
And then , looking right through the camera as if taking us into her confidence , she utters the line that did so much to lift the fear of failure from my mother and her contemporaries : “ If you ’re alone in the kitchen , WHOOOO ” — the pronoun is sung — “ is going to see ? ”
For a generation of women eager to transcend their mothers ’ recipe box ( and perhaps , too , their mothers ’ social standing ) , Julia ’s little kitchen catastrophe was a liberation and a lesson : “ The only way you learn to flip things is just to flip them ! ”

It was a kind of courage — not only to cook but to cook the world ’s most glamorous and intimidating cuisine — that Julia Child gave my mother and so many other women like her , and to watch her empower viewers in episode after episode is to appreciate just how much about cooking on television — not to mention cooking itself — has changed in the years since “ The French Chef ” was on the air .
There are still cooking programs that will teach you how to cook .
Public television offers the eminently useful “ America ’s Test Kitchen . ”
The Food Network carries a whole slate of so - called dump - and - stir shows during the day , and the network ’s research suggests that at least some viewers are following along .
But many of these programs —
I ’m thinking of Rachael Ray , Paula Deen , Sandra Lee — tend to be aimed at stay - at - home moms who are in a hurry and eager to please .
( “ How good are you going to look when you serve this ? ” asks Paula Deen , a Southern gal of the old school . )
These shows stress quick results , shortcuts and superconvenience but never the sort of pleasure — physical and mental — that Julia Child took in the work of cooking : the tomahawking of a fish skeleton or the chopping of an onion , the Rolfing of butter into the breast of a raw chicken or the vigorous whisking of heavy cream .
By the end of the potato show , Julia was out of breath and had broken a sweat , which she mopped from her brow with a paper towel .
( Have you ever seen Martha Stewart break a sweat ?
Pant ?
If so , you know her a lot better than the rest of us . )
Child was less interested in making it fast or easy than making it right , because cooking for her was so much more than a means to a meal .
It was a gratifying , even ennobling sort of work , engaging both the mind and the muscles .
You did n’t do it to please a husband or impress guests ; you did it to please yourself .
No one cooking on television today gives the impression that they enjoy the actual work quite as much as Julia Child did .
In this , she strikes me as a more liberated figure than many of the women who have followed her on television .
Curiously , the year Julia Child went on the air — 1963 — was the same year Betty Friedan published “ The Feminine Mystique , ” the book that taught millions of American women to regard housework , cooking included , as drudgery , indeed as a form of oppression .
You may think of these two figures as antagonists , but that would n’t be quite right .
They actually had a great deal in common , as Child ’s biographer , Laura Shapiro , points out , and addressed the aspirations of many of the same women .
Julia never referred to her viewers as “ housewives ” — a word she detested — and never condescended to them .
She tried to show the sort of women who read “ The Feminine Mystique ” that , far from oppressing them , the work of cooking approached in the proper spirit offered a kind of fulfillment and deserved an intelligent woman ’s attention .
( A man ’s too . )
Second - wave feminists were often ambivalent on the gender politics of cooking .
Simone de Beauvoir wrote in “ The Second Sex ” that though cooking could be oppressive , it could also be a form of “ revelation and creation ; and a woman can find special satisfaction in a successful cake or a flaky pastry , for not everyone can do it : one must have the gift . ”
This can be read either as a special Frenchie exemption for the culinary arts ( féminisme , c’est bon , but we must not jeopardize those flaky pastries ! ) or as a bit of wisdom that some American feminists thoughtlessly trampled in their rush to get women out of the kitchen .
3. TO THE KITCHEN STADIUM
Whichever , kitchen work itself has changed considerably since 1963 , judging from its depiction on today ’s how - to shows .
Take the concept of cooking from scratch .
Many of today ’s cooking programs rely unapologetically on ingredients that themselves contain lots of ingredients : canned soups , jarred mayonnaise , frozen vegetables , powdered sauces , vanilla wafers , limeade concentrate , Marshmallow Fluff .
This probably should n’t surprise us : processed foods have so thoroughly colonized the American kitchen and diet that they have redefined what passes today for cooking , not to mention food .
Many of these convenience foods have been sold to women as tools of liberation ; the rhetoric of kitchen oppression has been cleverly hijacked by food marketers and the cooking shows they sponsor to sell more stuff .
So the shows encourage home cooks to take all manner of shortcuts , each of which involves buying another product , and all of which taken together have succeeded in redefining what is commonly meant by the verb “ to cook . ”
I do n’t know what ’s more disturbing .
The ranting of this bigot or that no one called her out .
She should have been ejected from the train .
Watch :
Stephanie Chu who shot the video said the following on SFIst :
I filmed this on a MUNI T train this morning on my way to work .
I found it appalling that this woman would be so hateful towards a gay / transgender person – so I had no qualms about putting her face on the Internet .
At one point , it got physical .
The train was held up for about 10 minutes until she calmed down , then the cops came to take their statements .
I thought it might be interesting to share how intolerance is still very much alive , even in liberal cities like SF .
Apparently , she works at a hospital ( she wore scrubs ) off of the T line , I am guessing UCSF Mission Bay .
Anyone know who this lovely person is ?
Apparently she was wearing a lanyard that said “ I love Jesus . ”
Boy , what a surprise .

Kyle " Dusty " Foggo , a senior CIA officer who is currently in jail for corruption has told The New York Times how he oversaw the construction of three identical prisons from his base in Frankfurt where he ran the spy agency 's main European supply base .
Some of the world 's most famous people may owe their success to others we rarely hear about .
For example , the songwriter who pens the hits for popular performers .
The BBC World Service spoke to one of the best , Amanda Ghost .

Many little girls dream of being a pop star when they grow up , practising in front of the mirror with a hairbrush , as they dance along to Beyonce or Shakira .
But it is hard to imagine many spending their days dreaming of writing for popstars - unless they are songwriter Amanda Ghost .
I think that 's a common misperception , that everybody wants to be famous
Amanda Ghost
" One of the most enjoyable parts of my job is when I get to hear someone as incredible as Beyonce and Shakira ... sing my words , " she says .
" That 's a much bigger thrill than it gives me to actually sing it myself .
" I think that 's a common misperception , that everybody wants to be famous ... I certainly do n't . "

Ghost is a singer / songwriter in her own right .
She is also the President of Epic Records , and she 's barely 30 .

As much as she respects the talent and commitment of stars like Beyonce , Shakira or Kylie , she says that life is not for her .
" I do n't envy those girls and their incredibly hard working schedules ...
I much prefer to stay at home with my child and enjoy her as opposed to going out on the road . "
Collaboration
She admits has never actually performed some of her most successful songs , such as You 're Beautiful , which she co-wrote with James Blunt .
" I do n't sing it , because I do n't think I can top his vocal performance on it really , " she says .
She first got into professional songwriting when she was pregnant with her first child .
AMANDA GHOST HIT LIST James Blunt 's chart - topping ballad You 're Beautiful The duet for Beyonce and Shakira , Beautiful Liar Beautiful Liar went to No.1 in 32 countries Collaboration with Kylie Minogue , Whitney Houston , and Mariah Carey " I never set out to be a professional songwriter ... but ...
I got pregnant and I stopped pushing myself out as an artist , and as I did that , You 're Beautiful came out and it became this huge hit . "
Since then , she has collaborated with a number of artists , who often give her a brief for the song .
" Beyonce [ and I ] were put together by the people that work around her , she just asked me if I would write something that would be a duet for herself and Shakira that would express female empowerment . "
The result , Beautiful Liar , was written in just a few days , largely in the back of New York cabs , according to Amanda .
But it remains one of her most success collaborations so far , going to number one in 32 countries .
" You know when you 've written a great song , " she says .
" You get that little butterfly feeling in you . "

At the same time , they began calling transplant centers in New York , because it is reachable by nonstop flights from Israel .
The first to respond was NewYork - Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children ’s Hospital .
The two medical teams on opposite sides of the Atlantic began a steady stream of e-mail and phone calls in hopes of stretching the limits of medicine and America ’s transplant system to save the life of a girl with a deadly form of a rare disease .
Kara Ventura , a nurse practitioner and transplant coordinator in New York , answered the call from Dr. Gadi Lalazar , in Hadassah ’s liver unit , about 3 a.m. on Thursday , July 16 .
Her hospital had never received an emergency call for a transplant for someone in another country , but Jessa was a child and an American citizen .
They had to try to help her , Dr. Ventura said .
She alerted the rest of the transplant team , including someone who would contact insurers to make sure the bills would be paid .
Doctors on the team began putting out notices that they would soon need a liver for a desperately ill child .
They also prepared to evaluate family members to see if anyone could be a live donor , giving up part of the liver for a transplant .
The teams agreed on what had most likely shut down Jessa ’s liver : Wilson ’s disease , a genetic disorder that causes the body to accumulate copper , which gradually builds up to toxic levels .
The tipping point often occurs when patients are in their teens or 20s .
In some , like Jessa , the disease gives no warning signs before the liver suddenly stops working .
Jessa ’s blood tests suggested Wilson ’s , and an eye exam found hints of a telltale ring of copper deposits around the iris .
The family was stunned .
Wilson ’s disease is rare , affecting one person in 30,000 .
Jessa ’s parents are healthy and had no idea that they carried the disease .
No one in either family had ever had it , as far as they knew .
The gene is recessive , so people who carry one copy do not develop symptoms .
But Jessa inherited two copies , one from each parent .
The double dose gave her the disease .
Her older sister , tested after Jessa became ill , does not have the disease .
The real challenge would be to stabilize Jessa long enough to survive the trans -Atlantic flight .
Dr. Steven J. Lobritto , NewYork - Presbyterian ’s medical director for pediatric liver transplants , urged Dr. Lalazar and his colleagues to perform plasmapheresis , a procedure that separates blood cells from plasma and lets doctors replace the patient ’s plasma .
In Wilson ’s , removing the plasma can lower the copper level and reverse some of its toxic effects .

I 've been with my boyfriend ( now my fiance ) for almost 7 years now .
We we 're introduced by his sister May 10 years ago .
Since then we started to know each other for over 2 years until I finally said Yes ( as boyfriend ) .
To make the story short he proposed to me .
It happened in May 8 2009 in a Private beach resort in Boracay ( Puka Beach ) .
It was the happiest , the sweetest , the most memorable and the most unexpected thing that happened in my entire life ...
I 'm the kind of person who can smell fishy things easily but unfortunately my fiance won this time .
We have this annual out of town trip every summer with my fiance 's bro's and sisses , so this trip is nothing unusual to me ( as what I thought ) .
It 's just a little different this year because it was kinda far and not to mention a little pricey because it's was in Boracay .
Oh did I mentioned how close my fiance with his brother and 2 sisters ?
Yes , they are really very close , it 's not very common for siblings but these people really enjoy each other company ...
Back to my story , it was a 3 days 2 nights trip , on our first day we celebrated May 's birthday and we really had fun ( as always ) everybody was so makulit ... while we were having dinner I told themand Kuya harvy ( My fiance 's bro - in - law ) said .
What I did n't know is that they 've been planning for my proposal for several days already ...
The next day ... there were a lot of clues ( according to them ) given by Ate Ivy ( my fiance 's eldest sis ) which I did n't notice ( having no idea at all ) .
In the afternoon everybody decided to go to Puka Beach , which is a private beach resort in boracay and our hotel ( Alta Vista de Boracay ) provided a free shuttle ride for us .
When we got there May said " oh kanya kanya muna tayo ... " and everybody went to the right side of the beach while I was being dragged to the left side by my boyfriend / fiance .
We we 're really far from them , from a far , it looks like they are playing some games , and I was likeand he was like " do n't you want to be with me ? " ( in a cheesy voice ) ....
What I did n't know is that , they are writing the proposal question for me using a dried seaweeds in the sand ... so sweet .... everybody was very busy ....
After a few minutes Kuya harvy , Chris ( May 's bf ) and Carlo ( Fiance 's bro ) aprroached us telling us that there was this staff from our hotel who 's going to conduct an activity / game for us , being optimistic as I am , I was like " As we go closer to them I saw a video cam set up and May taking a picture of us in her SLR and there this really big writing on the sand that saysI was really shocked !
( you can see it in the video , I 'm not even wearing a blush on ) and it was like the earth stopped for moment and my hearts starts to beat really fast and I was like shaking and I was likethen he kneeled down on his knees and showed me the ring and ask me to marry him , and I was likeinstead of yes ... hahaha .....
They really pulled it .... Thank's to his ever loyal Bro's and sisses ... it would n't be possible and this big without their help .
Love you guys ...
* 1 billion people live in hazard - prone slums , shantytowns
* Asia most at risk from deadly cyclones , tsunamis , floods
* U.N. says disasters threaten economic stability , security
GENEVA , May 17 ( Reuters ) - Natural disasters threaten to trigger widespread damage and distress in emerging economies , many of which are already on the brink because of the global recession , a United Nations body said on Sunday .
There are 1 billion people living in hazard - prone slums and shantytowns in developing countries , many of which overlooked safety standards in recent years of red - hot growth , according to the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction .
Crammed settlements with poor drainage systems are making floods more frequent and severe in many cities , particularly in Asia , where the ISDR said big swathes of commercial assets and infrastructure are also exposed to storms and earthquakes .
" Disaster risk is rising in an alarming way , threatening development gains , economic stability and global security , " U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said , introducing the 200 - page report launched in Bahrain .
The Geneva - based ISDR estimated that the share of the global economy at direct risk from floods has doubled since 1990 , and that 28 percent more people are now vulnerable to losing their homes , incomes and lives than two decades ago .
" Most flood risk is concentrated in Asian countries , " it said , estimating that three quarters of those at risk of dying in floods around the world are concentrated in Bangladesh , India and China .
Thailand and Indonesia also face substantial threats from floods , the report said .
Bangladesh was listed as facing the highest mortality risk from cyclones , along with China , India , the Philippines , Myanmar and Madagascar , while Ethiopia , Indonesia and India are most vulnerable to deadly landslides .
China and India are most at risk from deaths in earthquakes , followed by Indonesia , El Salvador , Guatemala and the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Sub -Saharan African countries were cited as having the most people and crops exposed to risks from drought .
The poorest communities in developing countries are at highest risk from disasters and are rarely covered by insurance .
The ISDR estimated that 1.7 million people have been killed in 23 " mega disasters " since 1975 , and said that major storms and weather - related emergencies are expected to increase as a result of global warming .
" Many urban areas will also experience stress through water and energy shortages , heat and cold waves and more prevalent disease vectors , " it said , raising particular concern about the impact of rising oceans on Dhaka , Mumbai and Shanghai , large parts of which are only 1 to 5 metres above sea level .
The ISDR stressed it is not just geography that makes impoverished pockets of the world most vulnerable to disasters , saying that weak governance has made both people and economies in poorer countries more exposed to devastation .
For example , the report said while Japan and the Philippines have virtually the same exposure to tropical cyclones , they kill 17 times more people in the Philippines .
Cyclones of the same strength also typically damage 20 times more of Madagascar 's gross domestic product than Japan's .
It accused local officials worldwide of turning a blind eye to poorly built homes , schools and other buildings , and said governments in Africa , Asia and Latin America routinely ignore slums in low - lying and landslide - prone areas .
" Some low and middle - income countries which have experienced recent and rapid economic growth are more at risk from disaster because governance and construction standards have lagged and corruption is still rife , " it said .
" Even in high income countries , problems persist as can be seen from last month 's earthquake in Italy which destroyed a number of buildings constructed in modern times . "

While some states do criminalize HIV exposure , a U.S. District Judge does more than this - he imprisons a woman for the mere possibility that she might transmit HIV in the future .
Editor ’s Note :
At the request of advocates working with the HIV - positive pregnant woman imprisoned in this case , we have removed references to her full name and now refer to her as " Ms. T . "
In May , 2009 , U.S. District Judge John Woodcock sentenced Ms. T ,
who was about five months pregnant , for the crime of having fake
immigration documents .
While both the federal prosecutor and defense
attorney urged the judge to sentence T. to 114 days , which would
allow her to leave prison with time served , Judge Woodcock doubled the
recommended sentence and exceeded federal sentencing guideline
recommendations for the sole purpose of keeping T. in prison until
she gave birth .
Judge Woodcock ’s sole justification for the extended
sentence is that Ms. T. is HIV - positive .
The judge felt that – despite the
fact that T. had arranged for care outside the prison – keeping her in
prison would best ensure that she would take anti-retroviral medication
to reduce the chances of transmitting HIV to her child in utero .
In
issuing this decision , Judge Woodcock has created disturbing precedent
that could allow the state to keep people in jail based solely on the
fact that they have HIV or are pregnant .
To understand how misled Judge Woodcock ’s decision was , it is useful
to understand a little about how HIV can be transmitted from mother to
child , or " vertically . "
HIV can be transmitted during pregnancy ,
childbirth , or breastfeeding .
While all babies born to women living
with HIV will have HIV antibodies when they are born , 75 % of those
babies will " serorevert " and will not develop HIV infection .
Thus ,
without any medical intervention , the rate of transmission is , on
average , 25 % .
Taking antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and birth or
opting to have a cesarean section can reduce the rate of transmission
to less than 2 % .
The best course of treatment to ensure the health of
the mother and her child always depends on the individual woman’s
medical history and circumstances , and should be a decision she makes
after consulting with her physician .
Judge Woodcock ’s decision ignores the complex factors involved in a
pregnant woman ’s medical treatment decisions – as through being HIV
positive makes one incapable of reasonable decision - making – and glibly
equates being HIV - positive and pregnant with committing a crime .
When
reading the sentence , he makes clear that his sole reason for keeping
Ms. T. in prison was that she was HIV - positive and pregnant , and that ,
had she been pregnant and not HIV - positive , he would release her with
time served .
He reasons that he could keep T. in jail " to protect
the public from [ her ] further crimes . "

Judge Woodcock bends himself into bizarre logical contortions to
justify his decision .
He states , " I do n’t think the transfer of HIV to
an unborn child is technically a crime under the law , but it is as
direct and as likely as an ongoing assault . "
Frustrated with what the
law actually forbids , Judge Woodcock invents a new category of actions
that , while not " technically " crimes " under the law , " he still has the
authority to punish with imprisonment .
However , if judges could hold
people in prison for any " direct " and " likely " action they found
morally reprehensible , they would have unlimited discretion .
This is
precisely what the rule of law is intended to prevent .
While some states do , indeed , criminalize HIV exposure , Judge Woodcock does more than this – he imprisons a woman for the mere possibility that she might transmit HIV in the future .
His reasoning essentially criminalizes being HIV - positive and allows
the state to jail anyone with HIV simply because they have HIV and are
capable of transmitting it to another .
It classifies anyone with HIV as
a threat to society who can be incarcerated at the whim of the state to
protect public health .
As Regan Hofmann eloquently explained in her May blog ,
criminalizing HIV transmission contributes to the stigmatization of HIV
and actually harms prevention efforts .
The imprisonment of those with
HIV based on the mere fact that they might transmit it to others is
even more abhorrent as a matter of law and policy .
Some might be tempted to think that the judge in fact is helping
Ms. T. by ensuring she at least has access to medications .
This argument
might have some merit if Ms. T. were asking the judge to keep her in
jail because she was concerned about deportation or her ability to
access care .
But the fact is – and Judge Woodcock recognized – Ms. T. did
not want to remain in prison , much less give birth in prison .
Her
attorney stressed that Ms. T. had arranged for medical treatment outside
of prison at a facility – unlike the prison system – specifically equipped
to meet her medical needs .
Whatever Judge Woodcock ’s protective intentions , using imprisonment
to coerce pregnant women to make the medical care choices we think best
is an outrageous abuse of the system .
By keeping her in prison because
he felt it would be best for the fetus , Judge Woodcock was unable to
see and treat Ms. T. as a competent adult with the ability and the right
to make her own medical decisions .
Instead , he reduced her to a fetal
container – an obstacle to providing the care he wanted for the child she
was carrying .
Not once in the transcript of the sentencing proceeding
does Judge Woodcock consider Ms. T. ’s own medical care or her health
interests .
She is guilty of being HIV positive , while her fetus is , in
his view , " a wholly innocent person . "
Judge Woodcock ’s decision perpetuates the myth that people with HIV
are somehow " other " – more reprehensible , less responsible , and deserving
of whatever state intervention helps protect the " innocent " remainder
of society .
It also furthers the view that pregnant women lose their
autonomy and their rights by virtue of their pregnancy , and that
pregnancy should enable the state to detain a woman if the state
disagrees with the care she is choosing for her own body .
While Ms. T .
may have had counterfeit immigration documents , having HIV and being
pregnant does not make her any less " innocent " or any more deserving of
punishment .
U.C. Berkeley professor Emmanuel Saez has updated his study of U.S. income distribution ( embedded below , via Paul Krugman ) .
The bottom line ?
U.S. income inequality has hit a record high :
Professor Saez 's numbers go through 2007 .
Judging from what happened after the last recession , income disparity will likely ease in 2008 and 2009 as the richest 10 % of Americans get clobbered by stock and house wealth destruction .
Excluding the temporary effect of the recession , however , Professor Saez believes that the trend toward greater inequality is likely to continue unless the government implements radical policy changes -- such as those that developed during the Great Depression .
The Great Depression changes , it should be noted , reduced income disparity for nearly 50 years , until it began climbing again during the Reagan years .
Here are some more exhibits :

Phil Schiller Responds Regarding Ninjawords and the App Store
Tuesday ’s piece on Ninjawords was really about two stories .
The small story is that of a clever $ 2 iPhone dictionary app , the developers of which removed “ objectionable ” words from its dictionary so as to get it published in the App Store .
The big story is about the App Store itself , and whether Apple ’s management is attempting to correct its course .
Yesterday afternoon I received a thoughtful email from Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller regarding Ninjawords and the App Store , and I think it bodes well for both stories .
With Schiller ’s permission , I ’m reprinting the salient portions of it here :
When I read your column last night about the Ninjawords dictionary application I immediately investigated it with our App Store review team to learn the facts of what happened .
Let me start with the most important points - Apple did not censor the content in this developer ’s application and Apple did not reject this developer ’s application for including references to common swear words .
You accused Apple of both in your story and the fact is that we did neither .
Ninjawords is an application which uses content from the Wiktionary.org online wiki - based dictionary to provide a nice fast dictionary application on the web and on the iPhone .
Contrary to what you reported , the Ninjawords application was not rejected in the App Store review process for including common “ swear ” words .
In fact anyone can easily see that Apple has previously approved other dictionary applications in the App Store that include all of the “ swear ” words that you gave as examples in your story .
The issue that the App Store reviewers did find with the Ninjawords application is that it provided access to other more vulgar terms than those found in traditional and common dictionaries , words that many reasonable people might find upsetting or objectionable .
A quick search on Wiktionary.org easily turns up a number of offensive “ urban slang ” terms that you wo n’t find in popular dictionaries such as one that you referenced , the New Oxford American Dictionary included in Mac OS X .
Apple rejected the initial submission of Ninjawords for this reason , provided the Ninjawords developer with information about some of the vulgar terms , and suggested to the developer that they resubmit the application for approval once parental controls were implemented on the iPhone .
The Ninjawords developer then decided to filter some offensive terms in the Ninjawords application and resubmit it for approval for distribution in the App Store before parental controls were implemented .
Apple did not ask the developer to censor any content in Ninjawords , the developer decided to do that themselves in order to get to market faster .
Even though the developer chose to censor some terms , there still remained enough vulgar terms that it required a parental control rating of 17 +.
You are correct that the Ninjawords application should not have needed to be censored while also receiving a 17 + rating , but that was a result of the developers ’ actions , not Apple’s .
I believe that the Apple app review team ’s original recommendation to the developer to submit the Ninjawords application , without censoring it , to the App Store once parental controls was implemented would have been the best course of action for all ; Wiktionary.org is an open , ever - changing resource and filtering the content does not seem reasonable or necessary .
After going back to Ninjawords ’s developers and conferring with some trusted sources within Apple , I believe what Schiller says here is genuinely the case — that what the App Store reviewers wanted for Ninjawords was a 17 + rating , not for Matchstick Software to filter its dictionary listings .
In particular , it seems like it really came down to bad timing around the launch of parental controls .
Matchstick Software initially submitted the app on May 13 .
The response from the App Store was that Apple would n’t publish it with those words without a 17 + parental control rating .
But parental controls — the preferences that specify the age rating limits for apps — debuted in iPhone OS 3.0 , which was not released until June 17 .
And , it ’s worth noting , the June 17 release date was n’t announced until the WWDC keynote address on June 8 .
Back in May , Matchstick Software knew only that OS 3.0 was coming in the near future .
What Matchstick could have done was wait for iPhone OS 3.0 and publish the app with a 17 + rating .
What they wanted to do , though , was ship their app as soon as possible .
Hence Matchstick ’s decision to begin filtering out the words which the App Store reviewers found objectionable .
As Matchstick ’s Phil Crosby told me via email last night , “ 17 + ratings were not available when we launched , which means at that time , it was simply not possible for our dictionary to be on the App Store without being censored .
Given the options of censoring or sitting on the side lines while our competitors ate our lunch , we chose to launch . ”
It is certainly arguable whether Wiktionary ’s English dictionary content should be rated 17 +.
I personally disagree with that .
But what I — and , judging from reaction around the web yesterday , many others — found outrageous was the idea that Apple insisted that Ninjawords both filter its dictionary and still carry the 17 + rating .
That is not the case , and that is good .
Consistency , Fairness , Common Sense
On the one hand , the 17 + rating for Ninjawords may not seem completely out of line , given that Apple is currently requiring the 17 + rating for many apps simply on the grounds that they display “ unfiltered Internet content ” .
But Ninjawords does not display the live contents of Wiktionary — it contains a snapshot of the database .
Unfiltered updates to Wiktionary do not make their way into Ninjawords over the air .
But more importantly , other dictionary apps in the App Store have innocuous age ratings , and yet contain all of the words that App Store reviewers objected to in Ninjawords ( shit , fuck , and cunt , specifically ) .
For example , American Heritage Dictionary ( $ 30 ) is rated 9 + ; “ Dictionary.com ” is available from the App Store for free and is rated 4 +.
( iPhone developers set their own ratings when they submit their applications to the App Store , but , as was the case with Ninjawords , the App Store reviewers will occasionally insist upon a certain minimum rating . )
Regarding this discrepancy between the ratings for dictionaries , Crosby said to me , “ Apple may slap a 17 + rating on our app and wash their hands , saying ‘ you ’re not required to censor your app ’ , but at the same time , they ’re putting a great deal of pressure on us to do so .
Who wants to be the only illicit dictionary on the App Store ?
That may work for Urban Dictionary , but not us .
I think that applying parental ratings inconsistently is tightly related to censorship in our case , and will be true for other apps as well . ”
On the other hand , mDictionary — which , like Ninjawords , uses Wiktionary as its dictionary data source — is rated 17 +.
Nihongo , an English - to - Japanese dictionary app , is also rated 17 +.
Qingwen , a Chinese dictionary , is currently rated 4 + , but its developer wrote a weblog entry about having been flagged by the App Store reviewers because the app contained Chinese translations for the words fuck , cock , and penis :
As is clear from the screenshots , Qingwen does n’t bombard you with words like “ cock ” and “ penis ” the moment you start it up .
No , the Apple employee who took those screenshots specifically searched for those words .
As far as I ’m concerned , it ’s the same thing as opening a website that contains swear words ( like the page you ’re reading , for instance ) on the iPhone .
If they do n’t want Qingwen on the iPhone because it can show you “ objectionable material ” , then why allow Safari , Mail , YouTube and pretty much any other app , which can easily show you all sorts of even more “ objectionable material ” ?
So clearly Ninjawords is not alone in its treatment regarding profanity from App Store reviewers .
I bought a copy of Qingwen to try the current version , and a query for “ fuck ” , the example flagged by the App Store reviewers , no longer generates any results .
“ Shit ” , however , does .
Now , it ’s possible that the Wiktionary database contains certain “ urban slang ” ( to use Schiller ’s term ) that warrants a different rating from other English dictionaries , but the feedback Matchstick software received from the App Store reviewers was very specific .
They were flagged for the words cunt , fuck , and shit .
Those three words are in other dictionaries , rated as low as 4 + .
If there are other terms in the unfiltered Ninjawords dictionary that Apple considers more objectionable , why were n’t those terms pointed out ?
I believe Phil Schiller that Apple ’s policy is not to reject App Store dictionaries for containing swear words .
However , it ’s clear this policy has not been consistently enforced by the App Store review team .
The problem , as I see it , is not that one or more App Store reviewers were unaware that it is acceptable for dictionaries to contain words that are not acceptable in other contexts .
Mistakes are inevitable .
The problem is that there ’s no good recourse for developers to appeal such a mistake .
It should have been enough for Matchstick Software to point out that the words flagged as objectionable in their initial rejection are in fact present in several other dictionaries already in the store .
Here ’s how Schiller closed1 his email to me :
Apple ’s goals remain aligned with customers and developers — to create an innovative applications platform on the iPhone and iPod touch and to assist many developers in making as much great software as possible for the iPhone App Store .
While we may not always be perfect in our execution of that goal , our efforts are always made with the best intentions , and if we err we intend to learn and quickly improve .
This is music to my ears .
That Schiller was willing to respond in such detail and length , on the record , is the first proof I ’ve seen that Apple ’s leadership is trying to make the course correction that many of us see as necessary for the long - term success of the platform .
The improvement I consider most important is a significant focus on fairness , consistency , and common sense in the App Store review process .

Open letter to Congressman Dave Reichert
Are you aware that glaciers are growing in Washington State ?
__________________
3 Jul 09 Dear Congressman Reichert ,
As a resident of Washington State , I feel betrayed by your vote for the Control - and - Tax bill , a bill purportedly designed to fight “ global warming . ”
What global warming ?
Dave , are you aware that glaciers are growing in your own state ?
Yes , glaciers are growing in Washington State .
The Nisqually Glacier on Mt. Rainier is growing .
The Emmons Glacier on Mt. Rainier is growing .
Crater Glacier on Mount St. Helens is growing .
( Crater Glacier is now larger than it was before the 1980 eruption . )
Glaciers on Mt. Shuksan in northern Washington are growing .
Glaciers on Glacier Peak in northern Washington are growing .
Congressman Reichert , I wish you would ask the US Forest Service for a list of glaciers in Washington State , and ask them to tell you – honestly - which ones are growing .
I have a feeling that there are more growing glaciers than any of us have been told .
My fear is that that there is a giant cover up going on , especially given the fact that glaciers are also growing on California ’s Mt. Shasta , and that glaciers are growing in Alaska for the first time in 250 years .
In May , Alaska ’s Hubbard Glacier was advancing at the rate of seven feet per day .
Every time I read about another growing glacier , I ’m told that it 's “ the only glacier in the world that is bucking the global warming trend . ”
But that ’s not true .
Perito Moreno Glacier , the largest glacier in Argentina , is growing .
Pio XI Glacier , the largest glacier in Chile , is growing .
Glaciers are growing on Mt. Logan , the tallest mountain in Canada .
Glaciers are growing on Mt. Blanc , the tallest mountain in France .
Glaciers ( 230 of them ) are growing in the Western Himalayas .
Glaciers are growing in Norway .
Recently , all 50 glaciers in New Zealand were growing .
The Greenland Ice Sheet is growing thicker .
And contrary to what we ’ve being told , the Antarctic Ice Sheet is also growing , not shrinking .
More than 90 percent of the world ’s glaciers are growing , but all that we hear about are the ones that are shrinking .
As author of the book Not by Fire but by Ice , and publisher of www.iceagenow.com, I can verify the facts that I am presenting to you today .
Respectfully ,
Robert W. Felix

Hasspropaganda per 1 - Click - Buy : Soll es eine freiwillige Selbstkontrolle für den Buchhandel geben ?
( Bild : Screenshot )
Der Vorsitzende des Innenausschusses des Bundestags Sebastian Edathy ( SPD ) fordert eine freiwillige Selbstkontrolle im Buchhandel , berichtet der Spiegel in seiner kommenden Ausgabe .
Nach dem Vorbild der Film - und Spieleindustrie solle diese Institution im Vorfeld die Verbreitung von rechtsextremistischem Gedankengut und Verherrlichung des Dritten Reichs in Büchern verhindern .
Anlass für die Forderung ist offenbar eine Studie des deutschen Ablegers des American Jewish Committee , der auf den deutschsprachigen Amazon - Seiten etwa 60 antisemitische oder revisionistische Bücher gefunden habe ( Details dazu hat das AJC offenbar nicht veröffentlicht ) .
Deidre Berger , Leiterin des Berliner Büros des AJC , spricht von einer " immer weiter um sich greifenden Verbreitung von Hass - Literatur " und fordert deren Ächtung durch einen " ethischen Kodex " des Buchhandels .
Amazon wies dieses Anliegen dem Spiegel zufolge zurück : " Wir glauben , dass die richtige Antwort auf diskussionswürdige Literatur nicht deren Entfernung ist , sondern mehr Diskussion . "
Man verlasse sich auf die Kompetenz der Justiz und der Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien und verzichte auf eine eigene Bewertung , auch wenn man nicht mit den Meinungen der fraglichen Bücher sympathisiere .
Das AJC fordert bereits seit Längerem , antisemitische Propaganda aus dem Buchhandel zu entfernen .

Disclaimer : I am an AT&T customer with a data plan .
I 'll do my best not to let this " conflict of interest " interfere with my opinions expressed below .
You have to hand it to AT&T ; they 've got chutzpah !
That , by the way , is not a formal psychiatric term .
I could have said that AT&T is delusional , grandiose , or narcissistic , but everyone understands chutzpah .
In any event , a few days ago , The Boy Genius Report reported an internal email ( later confirmed in an article by Information Week ) indicating that AT&T will require data plans for all smartphone purchases beginning in September .
This new development seems to be just another nail in the coffin of the already - tarnished reputations of mobile - technology carriers in the U.S. Recent stories have highlighted criticism of the industry for high pricing , excessive profits , exclusivity , poor coverage , and reduced capital investment .
The federal government is concerned enough to begin investigations by Congress and the FCC .
My fellow Computerworld writer Mike Elgan went off on the wireless industry a few weeks ago with his well - informed rant on the " 10 things I hate about you . "
But I digress .
This post is about AT&T 's internal email of this change , which is as fine a piece of malarkey as I have seen in a while , filled with illogic , circular reasoning , and just plain dishonesty .
So let 's parse their memo :
•· " We want our customers to have the best possible experience with their Smartphones . "
Should n't it be up to us as to how we want to use and get the best possible experience from our smartphones ?
How do they know what 's best for us ?
•· " A predictable bill is a key factor in customer satisfaction ... "
I 'm thinking that an accurate bill is a key factor in my satisfaction .
Bills would be predictable if customers understand precisely what they are paying for and how much they are paying .
Having contracts written in simple English ( or other language ) wouldbe helpful ( one report indicated that health - insurance contracts are written at a graduate - school level when most Americans read at an eight - grade level .
Similarly , I found AT&T 's contract largely incomprehensible ... and I have a graduate degree ) .
•· " ... Smartphone customers will need to subscribe to a data plan , as the vast majority of customers already do . "
If the vast majority of customers already have data plans , why the need to force the remaining people into something that they obviously do n't want or need ( unless we do n't know what we need , but Big Brother AT&T does ) .
•· " Data plans let customers fully utilize their device ... "
Maybe some people do n't want to fully utilize their devices .
Perhaps they are happy just the way they use their smartphones .
Smartphones are plenty smart without a data plan ; data plans do n't define what makes a smartphone smart .
Instead , it is the plethora of tools ( e.g. , calendar , contacts , music , calculator , the list goes on ) available on these phones that make them smart .
•· " ... without the worry of bill shock . "
It 's been my experience that bill shock only occurs when I 'm charged for services that I did n't ask for or use .
Why would AT&T even allow a data connection to be established if someone has n't paid for its use ?
It seems to me that AT&T must have the technology to just turn data off at their end so unauthorized use can't occur .
Or , for those clueless about data , AT&T sales reps could educate customers about the costs of use without a data plan at the point of purchase and then either shut off the data connection on the individual handsets before customers leave the store or , for mail - order purchases , instruct customers how to do so themselves .
Unless , of course , not doing so allows AT&T to increase their revenues , honesty and respect for customers be damned .
•· " A Sales Coaching Session will be available ... "
Given this plan , those poor sales folks are gonna need a whole lot of coaching to force this medicine down the throats of otherwise willing customers .
I think there should be law that requires companies to be honest about their intentions , in AT&T 's case , they made the change to increase their revenues ( I should acknowledge that AT&T is n't the first to do this .
Verizon started this practice last November ) .
In lieu of that unlikely piece of legislation , I would file this memo under Do They Really Expect Us to Believe This ?
Better yet , crumple it up and throw it out !

Altmann added that fears that Massa had suffered damage to his left eye , which was opened for the first time since the accident yesterday , proved to be unjustified .
" Stimulated by the physiotherapist , he showed he knows left from right and he has full awareness of distance and depth , " said Atlmann .
" And his memory loss regards a short time .
" His eye has been opened , with care because it is still swollen , and he has said he can see .
His vision has not weakened .
" He gave appropriate answers in three languages : Portuguese , Italian , and English .
That means that the brain 's cognitive area is fine . "
Ferrari has confirmed that Massa will be moved out of intensive care later today , and team principal Stefano Domenicali has said that his rate of recovery is impressive .
" It 's a fantastic improvement , " Domenicali told the newspaper .
" Only three days after the crash he 's made encouraging progress .
" He recognised me , I greeted him and I brought him all the team 's and the fans ' warmth and support .
He replied to me in Italian , after he had spoken to his family in Portuguese .
He told me he can't remember anything that had happened : that 's a good thing . "
Domenicali added that Massa 's place at Ferrari will be kept open for him when he is fit enough to return .
" The data is encouraging , but in these situations it 's better to be prudent and take one step at a time , " he said .
" We want him to recover as soon as possible .
" I confirmed to him that we are looking forward to his return soon , that the car is his , and that as soon as he 's ready he 'll be back with us . "
Update 2019 - 11 - 22 : Code for this post has been moved to GitHub with a NuGet Package now available .
I like Mads Kristensen , he 's often coming up with useful code snippets which he shares with the community AND he heads up the BlogEngine .
NET project .
He 's produced the GuidEncoder helper class , which takes a standard guid like this :
c9a646d3-9c61-4cb7-bfcd-ee2522c8f633
And shortens it to a smaller string like this :
00amyWGct0y_ze4lIsj2Mw
Which is a huge help if you happen to be using guids in your URL's .
You can read his article , A shorter and URL friendly GUID , on his website .
I 've gone one step further than Mads , and created a struct which encapsulates the GuidEncoder functionality .
I 've called mine the " ShortGuid " , but you could equally call it a " Sguid " if you like how that sounds ( and if you pronounce GUID like " squid " and not " goo-id " ) .
Mads 's code for en / decoding the guid is still in there as static methods , which you can see further down - I 'm pretty sure it has n't been changed .
I 'll jump right into the usage , if you 're interested in the code , jump to the bottom and download the source visit the repo on GitHub .
Installation
Available on NuGet .
To install , run the following command in the Package Manager Console :
PM > Install - Package CSharpVitamins .
ShortGuid
Using the ShortGuid
The ShortGuid is compatible with normal Guid's and other ShortGuid strings .
Let 's see an example :
Guid guid = Guid .
NewGuid ( ) ; ShortGuid sguid1 = guid ; Console .
WriteLine ( sguid1 ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( sguid1 .
Guid ) ;
This produces a new guid , uses that guid to create a ShortGuid , and displays the two equivalent values in the console .
Results would be something along the lines of :
FEx1sZbSD0ugmgMAF_RGHw b1754c14-d296-4b0f-a09a-030017f4461f
Or you can implicitly cast a string to a ShortGuid as well .
string code = " Xy0MVKupFES9NpmZ9TiHcw " ; ShortGuid sguid2 = code ; Console .
WriteLine ( sguid2 ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( sguid2 .
Guid ) ;
Which produces the following :
Xy0MVKupFES9NpmZ9TiHcw
540c2d5f-a9ab-4414-bd36-9999f5388773
Flexible with your other data types
The ShortGuid is made to be easily used with the different types , so you can simplify your code .
Take note of the following examples :
ShortGuid sguid = ShortGuid .
NewGuid ( ) ; string myString = " Xy0MVKupFES9NpmZ9TiHcw " ; ShortGuid sguid = new ShortGuid ( myString ) ; ShortGuid sguid = ( ShortGuid ) myString ; ShortGuid sguid = myString ; Guid myGuid = new Guid ( " 540c2d5f-a9ab-4414-bd36-9999f5388773 " ) ; ShortGuid sguid = new ShortGuid ( myGuid ) ; ShortGuid sguid = ( ShortGuid ) myGuid ; ShortGuid sguid = myGuid ;
After you 've created your ShortGuid 's the 3 members of most interest are the original Guid value , the new short string ( the short encoded guid string ) , and the ToString ( ) method , which also returns the short encoded guid string .
sguid .
Guid ; sguid .
Value ; sguid .
ToString ( ) ;
Easy comparison with guid 's and strings
You can also do equals comparison against the three types , Guid , string and ShortGuid like in the following example :
Guid myGuid = new Guid ( " 540c2d5f-a9ab-4414-bd36-9999f5388773 " ) ; ShortGuid sguid = ( ShortGuid ) " Xy0MVKupFES9NpmZ9TiHcw " ; if ( sguid == myGuid ) if ( sguid == " Xy0MVKupFES9NpmZ9TiHcw " )
ShortGuid Source Code
[ Update 2019 - 11 - 22 ]
The original 2007 code snippet has been removed from this post in favour of hosting on GitHub with a NuGet Package now also available .
The only notable change has been to make the struct immutable i.e. removing the settings for the public properties ( Thanks Matthew from the comments ) .
As a result of B'Tselem 's ongoing research , there has been a change in the statistics .
The updated statistics are available here .
Today ( Wed. Sept 9th ) Israeli human rights group B'Tselem published its findings on the number of Palestinians and Israelis killed in Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip .
According to B'Tselem 's research , Israeli security forces killed 1,387 *
Palestinians during the course of the three - week operation .
Of these , 773 did not take part in the hostilities , including 320 minors and 109 women over the age of 18 .
Of those killed , 330 took part in the hostilities , and 248 were Palestinian police officers , most of whom were killed in aerial bombings of police stations on the first day of the operation .
For 36 people , B'Tselem could not determine whether they participated in the hostilities or not .
Palestinians killed 9 Israelis during the operation : 3 civilians and one member of the security forces by rockets fired into southern Israel , and 5 soldiers in the Gaza Strip .
Another 4 soldiers were killed by friendly fire .
B'Tselem 's figures , the result of months of meticulous investigation and cross-checks with numerous sources , sharply contradict those published by the Israeli military .
Israel stated that 1,166 Palestinians were killed in the operation and that 60 % of them were members of Hamas and other armed groups .
According to the military , a total of 295 Palestinians who were “ not involved ” in the fighting were killed .
As the military refused to provide B'Tselem its list of fatalities , a comparison of names was not possible .
However , the blatant discrepancy between the numbers is intolerable .
For example , the military claims that altogether 89 minors under the age of 16 died in the operation .
However , B'Tselem visited homes and gathered death certificates , photos , and testimonies relating to all 252 children under 16 , and has the details of 111 women over 16 killed .
Behind the dry statistics lie shocking individual stories .
Whole families were killed ; parents saw their children shot before their very eyes ; relatives watched their loved ones bleed to death ; and entire neighborhoods were obliterated .
The extremely heavy civilian casualties and the massive damage to civilian property require serious introspection on the part of Israeli society .
B'Tselem recognizes the complexity of combat in a densely populated area against armed groups that do not hesitate to use illegal means and find refuge within the civilian population .
However , illegal and immoral actions by these organizations cannot legitimize such extensive harm to civilians by a state committed to the rule of law .
The extent of civilian fatalities does not , in itself , prove that Israeli violated the laws of war .
However , the figures must be considered within the context of the numerous testimonies given by soldiers and Palestinians during and after the operation , which raise grave concerns that Israel breached fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and caused excessive harm to civilians .
The magnitude of this harm requires Israel to conduct an independent and credible investigation , and not make do with military debriefings .
Shortly after the operation , B'Tselem published guidelines for such an investigation and sent the Judge Advocate General 's Office some twenty illustrative cases , in which a total of about 90 Palestinian civilians were killed , demanding that they be investigated .
B'Tselem 's list of fatalities in Operation Cast Lead has been sent to the IDF Spokesperson 's Office for comment .
I know this Nikon S630 is just trying to be helpful , but a little tact would n't hurt .

One platform that consistently seems to get a lot of aftermarket attention is the Mercedes - Benz C- Class Sedan .
In just the last couple of months we have seen the edo competition C63 AMG and the Avus Performance C63 AMG emerge and there are more variations on the horizon .
But sometimes we forget about the company that first saw the potential in the C - Class sedan and set the bar so high that nobody has outdone them yet .
The BRABUS Bullit Black Arrow was first unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in 2008 and is now available as a 2009 model .
Using a run -of - the - mill C - Class , BRABUS employs “ surgical precision ” to install a 6.3 - liter twin - turbo V12 engine capable of 730 horsepower and 974 lb- ft of torque .
All of this power is delivered to the rear wheels using a five - speed auto transmission with a limited - slip differential set at 40 percent .
The Black Arrow can reach 62 mph from a stop in 3.9 seconds and tops out at just over 225 mph .
That ’s pretty amazing for a car that has a curb weight of 4,079 .
In order to keep the BRABUS Bullit Black Arrow from getting airborne due to its Space Shuttle - like thrust capabilities , plenty of aerodynamic mods have been implemented using carbon fiber .
A new front apron with large air ducts helps cool the radiator and front brakes and reduce front axle lift .
A rear spoiler and new apron with integrated diffuser add additional downforce .
The Bullit has a widened track to give it better directional stability and to house the large BRABUS Monoblock S light - alloy wheels in size 19×9.5J in front and 19x10 J in rear .
The car also gets a height - adjustable coil - over suspension with gas - pressure shocks that have selectable settings .
The brakes feature large diameter vented and grooved discs with 12 - piston aluminum calipers up front and 6 - piston calipers in back .
Inside , the BRABUS Bullit Black Arrow gets all of the company ’s usual upgrades including hand - crafted leather interior uphostery and custom seats .
Carbon - fiber components are located on the dashboard , center console and door panels .
Aluminum pedals and shifter round out the look .
MSRP is set as 348,000 Euros , which is $ 494,160 using today ’s exchange rate .
This vehicle will have a very limited production and is available either in a super stealth black matte paint or metallic silver .
It used to be that everyone who was a sports car junkie wanted a high - performance coupe .
And for a long time this was the consistent focus of aftermarket tuning manufacturers and the market segment where the majority of the OEMs offered their most powerful and agile cars .
Do n’t get me wrong , this is still a strong category but the sport sedan market has been heating up over the last few years .
Mercedes , Aston Martin , Porsche , Jaguar , Maserati ( and soon Lamborghini ) are all offering super sedans with tremendous performance and plenty of leg room for four or more passengers .
Even at the next level down , the luxury sport sedan market is booming , with BMW now offering the M3 as a sedan and touring cars like the Cadillac CTS -V juiced to ridiculous proportions .
And , obviously , the tuners have taken notice as well .
I ’m really interested to see what other amazing creations emerge as aftermarket modifcation shops look to outdo one another by using more and more unlikely platforms to peddle their wares .
After all , I never imagined there would be a 730 hp Mercedes C - Class Sedan .
And yet here we have the BRABUS Bullit Black Arrow !

CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
A Hollywood conservative has headed East .
It ’s “ Freedom Concert ” time for Jon Voight .
The Academy Award winner will join Sean Hannity in Cincinnati and Atlanta this weekend to honor fallen soldiers and present college scholarships to surviving children .
Mr. Voight — a warrior himself in many ways — has been cogitating about the state of America , meanwhile .
“ There ’s a real question at stake now .
Is President Obama creating a civil war in our own country ? ” Mr. Voight tells Inside the Beltway .
“ We are witnessing a slow , steady takeover of our true freedoms .
We are becoming a socialist nation , and whoever ca n’t see this is probably hoping it is n’t true .
If we permit Mr. Obama to take over all our industries , if we permit him to raise our taxes to support unconstitutional causes , then we will be in default .
This great America will become a paralyzed nation . ”
RELATED STORIES :
• Remember Iowa , Obama tells supporters
• Dems prepare to push health care without GOP
• ‘ Clunkers ’ program runs out of gas
Be outraged , Mr. Voight advises .
“ Do not let the Obama administration fool you with all their cunning Alinsky methods .
And if you do n’t know what that method is , I implore you to get the book ‘ Rules for Radicals , ’ by Saul Alinsky .
Mr. Obama is very well trained in these methods , ” he continues , citing a television campaign critical of the Republican Party and contentious town - hall meetings about health care reform .
“ The real truth is that the Obama administration is professional at bullying , as we have witnessed with ACORN at work during the presidential campaign .
It seems to me they are sending down their bullies to create fist fights among average American citizens who do n’t want a government - run health care plan forced upon them , ” Mr. Voight says .
“ So I ask again .
Is President Obama creating a civil war in our own country ? ”
MEGALISCIOUS
She ’s blonde .
She ’s the bomb .
And she ’s got important relatives .
Meghan McCain , the woman who brought va-va -voom to the Republican discourse in recent months , will rock ABC ’s “ The View ” Sept. 9 as the first guest co-host for Elisabeth Hasselbeck , now on maternity leave .
Ah , Meghan .
She was the one ( as ABC reminds everybody ) who told Karl Rove , “ You had your eight years .
Now go away . ”
Commentary is running amok online :
You go , girl , they say .
You ’re just a dumb blonde .
Take on Joy Behar .
Oh , and say “ hi ” to your dad .
Which is , of course , Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , onetime presidential hopeful , war hero .
And what does he say ?
“ He ’s very , very proud of his daughter , ” a McCain spokeswoman tells Beltway .
HAIL TO THEE
With cool fanfare , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) announced Thursday that a whopper , 3.3 - inch hailstone fell July 16 in Vermont — deemed an official state record and adding , perhaps , another wrinkle to the global warming argument .
The hailstone conveniently fell in the backyard of one Chuck McGill , a NOAA meteorologist , who whisked it to the office for measurement and photographs .
But now what ?
The hailstone sat for weeks in the NOAA freezer .
Is it a has - been ?
Not to worry .
NOAA ’s got it covered .
“ Chuck ’s taken it home again and put it in his own freezer , ” chief meteorologist Andy Nash tells Beltway .
“ These things can just sublimate to nothing .
You know , evaporate .
Chuck ’s determined to keep that hailstone alive . ”
LOCKED AND LOADED
The Second Amendment Foundation has accused MSNBC of “ demonizing ” gunowners , says Alan Gottlieb , the Bellevue , Wash . - based group ’s founder .
The segment shows a figure toting an AR - 15 rifle outside the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars , where President Obama spoke earlier this week .
“ There are Second Amendment rights , for sure , but also there are questions about whether this has a racial overtone .
I mean , here you have a man of color in the presidency and white people showing up with guns strapped to their waist , ” anchor Contessa Brewer says in the report .
“ What MSNBC purposely did not reveal with the deliberately doctored video is that the man carrying that sport-utility rifle was an African - American , ” says Mr. Gottlieb .
“ Yet all they showed in a brief film clip was a close - up of the rifle against the man ’s neatly - pressed dress shirt .
It was impossible to tell the man ’s race .
This is a detestable attempt to manipulate public sentiment . ”

NOTE : some users have been reporting deciphered signals with non-topical content .
This is the result of past psychotronic signals being bounced back at the Earth from astronomical bodies and paraterrestrial vehicles .
( This phenomenon also results in the cyclical nature of fashion as consumer mind control signals are bounced back to Earth every few decades due to the orbit of Saturn . )

MIND YOUR MIND ™
with MindGuard !
Welcome to the MindGuard website , your source for the award - winning MindGuard family of anti-mind - control software for Amiga and Linux computers .
Developed by Lyle Zapato during the psychotronically turbulent early 1990s , MindGuard offered Amiga - using paranoids the world over a new opportunity to think free of evil influences using advanced Active Anti-Psychotronic ( AAP ) software , theretofore only available to mind - control agents and paranoid millionaires .
At the dawn of the Third Millennium , MindGuard was made available for even the stingiest paranoids with the introduction of MindGuard X for the free Linux OS .
Now no one has an excuse not to be mind - control free !
LAWYERS ATTACK !
Lawyers for Kortech , the makers of the KPsi® psychotronic carrier , have sent me a letter demanding that I stop distributing software that " infringes on [ their ] intellectual property " .
I promise you that I will fight this , but still I urge all freedom - loving people to mirror MindGuard in case they manage to get this site shut down !
What Is MindGuard ?
Positron Emission Tomography images clearly show how MindGuard can block foreign , psychotronic brain influences , returning your mind to a state of restful focus .
MindGuard is a program for Amiga and Linux computers that protects your mind by actively jamming and / or scrambling psychotronic mind - control signals and removing harmful engrammic pollutants from your brain .
It also has the ability to scan for and decipher into English specific signals so you can see exactly Who wants to control you and what They are trying to make you think .
MindGuard works by leveraging your computer 's aluminum - based innards to both detect and emit psychotronic energy using advanced quasi-quantum techniques .
Once a mind - control signal is identified and analyzed , MindGuard can generate a specially tuned anti-signal that will jam the incoming signal .
If MindGuard is unable to properly identify the signal , it will generate psychotronic white noise to ensure the signal 's harmful message is scrambled .
MindGuard is fully configurable and can be customized for the individual user using biorhythmic and eponymologic settings .
MindGuard also includes an advanced DePsych utility , allowing the removal of almost all deep - burned memetic patterns -- including even commercial jingles .
With MindGuard , you can rest assured that your most valuable possession -- your mind -- is safe from the nefarious tinkering of evil - doers .
Why Would I Need MindGuard ?
If you think protecting your hard drive from viruses is important , but give no thought to the safety of your mind , please consider the following :
The technology to implant ideas and images into a person 's mind using electromagnetic and sonic waves was invented more than sixty years ago and has been growing more sophisticated yearly .
Secret agencies are conspiring to control your life and force you to live under a One World Government .
The only thing stopping them are people of differing opinions .
Alien forces are seeking to subjugate humanity to their dominion .
Abductees commonly report having their memories / minds altered .
Governmental regulations of questionable origin are forcing us to rid our world of lead based products and the benefits they hold .
The big buzzword in policing is " Nonlethal Weaponry " , devices that do n't hurt people but make them " surrender " unconditionally and uncontrollably .
The rise in " Entertainment Attractions " in places such as Las Vegas and Florida ( not to mention the continued growth of the granddad of them all : Disneyland ) is creating concentration points where the populations of the world are herded together and subjected to intense psychological programming .
David Hasselhof continues to impress German TV viewers .
The seemingly innocent babble of the Teletubbies is designed to appeal to very young children on an almost biological level inculcating in them the desire to live in a world where faceless voices command obedience under the ever - watchful gaze of Big Baby .
Tinky
Winky may be purple , but Po is most certainly Red .
Sony ( a megamultinational with a special interest in " intellectual property " ) has created a robotic dog -- named Aibo -- that it hopes will become humanity 's new best friend .
The dog communicates with its owners through hypnotic limb gyrations and high - pitched sonic blips that could easily contain subliminal programming .
A Japanese dictionary at hand lists " aiboo " as meaning " accomplice " .
Clearly , people 's minds are in greater danger now than they have ever been in the history of our planet .
That 's why you need MindGuard .

Important Notice About Copper - based Chips
Do n't throw out your old computers !
The computer industry , no doubt at the behest of the forces of mind control , is conspiring to replace all aluminum in computer chips with copper .
IBM has already shipped millions of copper - based PowerPC CPUs and has its sights on all the other chips on your motherboard .
MindGuard uses the unique psychotronic properties of the aluminum found in the chips throughout personal computers to generate its psychotronic anti-signals .
An all - copper computer would not be able to generate proper anti-signals and would be unable to run MindGuard properly ( however it should still be able to pick up and decipher the signals since this is done at the semiconductor level ) .
DO NOT RUN MINDGUARD ON AN ALL COPPER PC !
Computers with just a few copper components , such as the CPU , should still work fine for now .
Make sure to do your research before replacing your mind control protection computer .
Combined with the computer industry 's campaign of continuous obsolescence and the upgrade treadmill , this could render most consumer available personal computers unable to block psychotronics within five years !
Lucky for us paranoids , Linux runs well on all - aluminum 486s , and Amiga computers remain as good as they were in 1990 .
Frequently Asked Questions
Why is n't MindGuard available for my platform ( Windows / Mac / Univac ) ?
Many popular operating system platforms -- most notably Windows and Macintosh -- are in fact created by agents of mind control .
As such , these platforms tend to include subsystems that not only produce mind control , but also defeat anti-psychotronic software such as MindGuard .
In order for MindGuard to run successfully on these platforms , their psychotronic subsystems must be circumvented .
If these subsystems are not completely overcome , the results could be worse than not using MindGuard at all .
This is because psychotronic signals in the wild tend to be generally balanced across contradicting view points , which is the result of competition for mind space .
If Apple increases the strength of their psychotronic signals , Microsoft follows suit .
( While this balance diminishes the relative difference between the contradicting signals , it does not diminish the overall effect of mind control in the environment , which is only getting worse . )
By only partially defeating the psychotronic subsystems in a platform , MindGuard could end up silencing one signal while letting its competing signal ( presumably the one from the platform 's creator ) through loud and clear , which might cause erratic behavior , nerve damage , or an insane zeal to follow the signal 's message beyond what even its creator desired .
Since platforms that engage in the above behavior tend to be closed sourced , it is very difficult to learn how they work in order to circumvent them ( not to mention the fact that doing so is being made illegal under laws such as the DMCA ) .
Because of this difficulty , MindGuard wo n't be available for closed - source , pro-mind - control operating systems any time soon .
What is this " Linux " of which you speak & how do I install it on my Dell ?
Linux is an operating system like Microsoft Windows .
Unlike Windows , Linux does n't contain the hidden mind - control software known as Direct Retro - Memetics ( DRM ) , which are designed to implant engrams into your brain much like how a retrovirus plants its DNA into a cell 's nucleus .
Installing Linux is a topic beyond the scope of this website and unfortunately Lyle Zapato cannot help you with this .
If you would like to get Linux up and running on your computer so you can run MindGuard and protect yourself from the forces of mind control , contact your local Linux Users Group ( LUG ) .
Ask for Tony and make sure you say you want the " MindGuard special " .
What is this " Amiga " of which you speak & how do I install it on my Dell ?
The Amiga was a computer platform originally released in 1985 that was ideal for active anti-psychotronics since it contained unique chipsets not found in other computers -- particularly the " Gary " chip .
In 1992 , the Amiga reached a peak of perfection that , to this day , has not been attained by any other computer platform .
It was decided that no more could be done and so production ceased .
There have been numerous attempts since then to revive Amiga production , but these are Amigas in name only .
The current " Amiga " is an OS that runs on PowerPC architecture without custom chipsets .
FOR THE TIME BEING , ONLY ORIGINAL AMIGAS SHOULD BE USED WITH THE AMIGA VERSION OF MINDGUARD !
While there are reports that MindGuard may work on newer Amigas , this has not been fully tested and may produce dangerous side effects .
Can MindGuard be used to send psychotronic signals ?
Technically , yes .
Since MindGuard needs to generate anti-signals to cancel out the psychotronic signals being sent to you , in its normal operation it is creating psychotronic signals .
However , the range of these signals is limited to the immediate vicinity of your computer so it can't be used to create a mass psychotron .
Also , since MindGuard is Open Source you can be certain that it contains no subversive signals of its own .
Why does MindGuard for Amiga cause Enforcer hits ?
Enforcer hits are MindGuard 's way of letting you know it 's working .
They are unavoidable due to the nonstandard way that MindGuard interacts with your Amiga 's hardware in order to receive and scramble psychotronic signals .
Ignore them .
Why does my MindGuard keep displaying decrypted signals that seem like they came from the late 1990s ?
You may be experiencing psychotronic echoes caused when mind - control signals produce sympathetic vibrations in nearby aluminum ore deposits .
These vibrations can linger in the deposits for years , reemitting the same old signals over and over .
If you have ever visited a town where it seems everyone 's fashion is stuck in some past decade , this is usually the explanation .
Do not be concerned by this .
MindGuard will jam or scramble these old signals as it would fresh ones .
Just count yourself lucky that you missed out on this decade 's insanity .
I have created a small script that proves that MindGuard is a sham !
That 's not a question .
Clearly you are in league with the forces of mind control and are trying to scare people away from a product that can protect them .
You may be doing this of your own free will ( in which case you are evil and are using MindGuard in violation of the MGPL ) but it is more likely that you are yourself a victim of mind control , being instructed from above to conduct a vicious smear campaign against quality anti-psychotronic products .
You should immediately don an AFDB and flush out your brain using MindGuard 's DePsych to remove any of these anti-MindGuard delusions .

July 13 , 2009 --
It has long been a cliche : the woman in childbirth screaming curse words at her husband .
Now , there 's scientific research that may explain why people in pain often use offensive language .
The cursing may actually lessen the perception of pain .
That is the finding of a new study published in NeuroReport .
Researchers at Keele University 's School of Psychology recruited more than 60 undergraduates for the study .
The students were asked to stick their hands in buckets of icy water twice .
The first time , participants repeated a curse word over and over .
The next time , they repeated an everyday , neutral word .
When they repeated the curse word , participants were able to withstand the water longer and reported a lesser pain level than when they repeated the neutral word .
" Swearing has been around for centuries and is an almost universal human linguistic phenomenon , " Richard Stephens , one of the study 's authors , says in a news release .
" It taps into emotional brain centers and appears to arise in the right brain , whereas most language production occurs in the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain .
Our research shows one potential reason why swearing developed and why it persists . "
While the reason for the link between bad words and less pain perception is not known , researchers believe that cursing may fuel a negative emotion such as fear or anger , which prompts a fight or flight response .
One of their findings -- that people 's heart rates were higher when cursing -- supports this theory .
PDF : Gender Gap Results for Press August 3 2009
It 's ladies first in Hamilton County Schools .
Academically , girls are outperforming boys in subjects from kindergarten through high school , a four - year review of test scores shows .
In some subjects , girls have the boys beat by at least 10 percentage points .
" We recognize this is an issue ... but the answers we 're looking for do n't just jump out at us , " said schools Superintendent Jim Scales .
" What we have seen is not disastrous , but it 's enough to be concerned about .
Right now , we do n't have any prescription for trying to overcome it . "
And though the problem starts in elementary school , statistics show that there is a domino effect as fewer young men graduate from high school and college .
" Males become less and less represented the farther up the degree chain you go , " said David L. Wright , chief policy officer for the Tennessee Higher Education Commission .
" And if that 's true , it puts Tennessee in an even tougher spot in competing for those higher knowledge jobs . "
The gender - achievement gap is apparent in Georgia , too , where girls are scoring higher than boys in Dade , Walker , Whitfield and Catoosa counties , in many academic subjects , test data show .
Researchers and policymakers are taking notice , said Alan Richard , spokesman for the Southern Regional Education Board , a nonprofit organization that helps government and education leaders in its 16 member states work together on education .
" Tennessee and Georgia are not alone in this .
This is very much a national phenomenon , " he said .
" It may just now be reaching schools and school boards at the local levels .
Gender should now be a part of local schools ' discussions about improving student achievement . "
Dr. Scales said district officials have " a long list of questions " they must ask themselves about why male achievement is lagging .
" Maybe we 'll find research that shows what we 're doing does n't capture the interest of males .
Maybe the delivery of our instruction is geared more toward females , " he said .
" The classroom materials that we use , do they have more of a feminine slant ? "
One avenue to pursue , he said , is recruiting more male role models into schools .
The vast majority of teachers and administrators , especially in elementary school , are women , he said .
Often the only man in the building is the principal or maybe a gym teacher .
" That 's sometimes referred to as " heartfelt data , " he said .
" In our hearts we think we need ( more male educators ) , but does it really make a difference ?
We do n't have any data that empirically shows that . "
Kirk Kelly , the school system 's director of testing and accountability , said what disturbs him most is the gender achievement gap exists across all socioeconomic levels .
Educators working to close the achievement gap among students of different income levels and races understand poor students may be at a disadvantage in school , Dr. Kelly said .
But in the recent analysis , the only variable is gender .
Hamilton County Schools administrators are experimenting with same - gender classes to see if separating boys and girls in the classroom will improve achievement .
A handful of schools , including East Side , Harrison , Spring Creek , Red Bank and Rivermont elementary schools , plan to offer single - gender classes this year .
Some had to abandon the effort because of an uneven number of boys and girls - for example , most principals can't afford to hire an additional teacher when a grade level has only 10 girls but 40 boys .
EXPOSING GENDER DISPARITIES
By far , the largest achievement gap between boys and girls in Hamilton County Schools is in writing .
Overall , 89.1 percent of girls scored a four or higher ( scores considered proficient or advanced ) on standardized writing assessments , while only 78.7 percent of boys earned a four , according to 2008 test data .
That 11 - point percentage gap is evident from elementary through high school grades , the data show .
Girls also outscored boys by about 5 percentage points in reading - language arts , and almost 4 percentile points in math on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program test for grades three through eight .
In math , girls in grades three through eight did slightly better on tests , with 91.8 percent scoring proficient or advanced , and 88 percent of boys scoring proficient or advanced .
The achievement gap begins to emerge after third grade when about 86 percent of boys and girls score proficient or advanced .
Test results show that in fourth grade , girls begin to outperform boys , and by eighth grade , 91 percent of girls score proficient or advanced compared with 85.5 percent of boys .
The only category in which boys edged out the girls is in ACT scores , where they posted a composite score of 20.2 in 2008 , compared with the girls ' score of 19.3 .
Dr. Kelly attributed the edge to the nearly 200 more girls who took the test than boys .
The achievement gap continues through high school as Hamilton County recorded a 76.9 percent graduation rate for girls , and a 68.4 percent rate for boys in 2008 , the most recent year for which data is available .
Although the test score data for 2009 has not yet been released publicly , Dr. Kelly said male achievement continues to lag .
CLASSROOM EXPERIMENT
In one fifth - grade reading class at Spring Creek Elementary School , the students sit cross -legged on top of their desks .
When the teacher throws them a ball , they are called on to read aloud .
There are no girls in this class .
Spring Creek is in the second year of a single - gender classroom experiment .
" We just had been looking at a lot of research that showed that boys did better academically and behaviorally in classes when there were no girls , " said principal Paula Burgner .
In addition to splitting up the fifth - grade boys and girls , she also has an all - boys third - grade class .
The moves seem to have worked .
The boys in all - boys classes now are scoring higher than the girls , and all of the single - gender classes are reporting about 50 percent fewer discipline referrals , said Ms. Burgner , who also credited teacher training for the improvements .
" When you have predominantly white middle class women teaching low - income boys , some of them do n't know how to relate to those kids , " she said .
" My staff had to be trained to relate to people that are not just like them . "
Hardy Elementary assistant principal Ashley Aldridge also uncovered promising outcomes on single - gender classrooms as part of her doctoral dissertation .
She studied the effects of single - gender fourth - and fifth - grade classrooms in seven high - poverty elementary schools in Hamilton County .
Dr. Aldridge looked at four groups : girls in all - girls classrooms , girls in coed classes , boys in all - boys classrooms and boys in coed classes .
She found that boys who moved to single - gender classes outscored the other three test groups .
" I 'm not making generalizations ... but for me , this was about giving school leaders a snapshot of one way in which they could make improvements in their students ' gains , " Dr. Aldridge said .
Lekesha Swafford 's son , Charles Eaton Jr. , is in an all - boys fifth - grade classroom at Harrison Elementary School .
After the first week of school , Charles seems to be enjoying himself , Ms. Swafford said , but she 's still waiting to pass judgment .
" I 'm willing to see if it works , " she said .
" He deserves a good education . "
Dr. Kelly said the federal No Child Left Behind
Act has forced school systems to scrutinize all data more closely , enabling them to spot achievement gaps , such as the gender gap uncovered by local school leaders .
Although the law requires that states break out test score data on various racial groups and students ' socio- economic status , it does not mandate gender - based analysis .
Tennessee 's state report card does not include test scores by gender , but Georgia 's does .
Rachel Woods , spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Education , said the state report card shows only the requirements of No Child Left Behind .
" At the district level , you could run any kind of report you want , " she said .

Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook Sold Out !
All Preordered Copies Now in Distribution Channel , New Print Run to Arrive in Early November
Ten days before the launch of their much - anticipated Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook , Paizo Publishing today announced that the first print run of the book has sold out , with all preordered copies on their way to stores for an August 13 release .
With preorders more than five times greater than for any previous product in Paizo ’s seven - year history , orders for the Core Rulebook continue to mount even as the company speeds to produce another print run .
Paizo.com has retained enough copies to handle all paizo.com subscriptions and pre-orders .
Customers who have not already placed a pre-order with paizo.com or their game or book retailer are encouraged to seek out a copy immediately following the book ’s retail release , as supplies are expected to run out well before the arrival of a second print run in early November .
“ We thought we had printed enough to last us at least until the end of this year , but skyrocketing demand from our customers and distributors has us reprinting already , ” Lisa Stevens , CEO of Paizo said .
“ We have a healthy amount heading to Gen Con , but we think even those will go fast , so do n’t delay in picking up your copy ! ”

Executive Summary
The book has n’t even been released yet and , aside from extra copies friendly local gaming stores may have ordered to stock their shelves and the copies Paizo plans to take to GenCon this month , they ’re all sold out .
There ’ll be more available in November , apparently , after the second print run — but for now , if you want to get a copy of the book for yourself , you basically need to show up at your FLGS on 13 August and buy any copies they have on the shelves , show up at GenCon and be one of the first people in line at the Paizo booth , or go back in time and order one ( or ask your FLGS to order it for you , as I suggested in Pathfinder RPG Preorder :
It ’s time to reserve a copy . )
This is Good News ( for me )
I hoped it would be popular .
The more popular the game , the more likely it is to have more books available for it in the future — and I definitely want more books for Pathfinder RPG .
Still , this is surprising news .
I did n’t think the first print run would be spoken for before the first book even shipped .
Luckily for me and the SigO , we reserved a copy at our FLGS and signed up for the Pathfinder RPG subscription ( get core game materials as often as they ’re published , cancellable at any time ) in time to get two copies of the game .
We should have both of them on 13 August , the very day the game ’s officially released , including the PDF of the core book we get with the subscription .
If you do n’t get a copy this month , you should probably preörder a copy from the second printing as soon as the option becomes available , if you want one .
Otherwise — maybe that ’ll sell out right away , too , and you ’ll miss it again .
In the meantime , you can at least order a PDF for about $ 10 .
Did you hear the one about bobbing heads on Sunday agreeing that the cause of the Great Depression was the absence of government guidance ?
" The Great Depression would never have happened if there had been any economic regulations , " agreed the policy wonks .
Oh , really ?
So you think a free society generated that monstrosity ?
It is accurate to say that in 1900 a free society did exist .
The government still approximated a minimal state , exerting minimal guidance , and commanding minimal economic regulation .
But , after 1900 , virtually all public policy proposals called for more extensive governmental guidance .
Perhaps the television talksters could benefit from a bit of homeschooling .
An excellent source of data is Crisis and Leviathan : Critical Episode in the Growth of American Government by Robert Higgs ( 1987 ) .
The time frame of the period up to and into the 1920s , in other words those years before the Great Depression , included WWI .
That dramatic episode birthed government expansion and intervention , much of which remained in regulatory force after the generating crisis had past .
Crisis and Leviathan : ... Robert Higgs Best Price : $ 3.99 Buy New $ 24.09 ( as of 09:45 EST - Details )
A partial list of interventions — those government economic regulations — would include :
Bureau of Corporations ( 1903 )
Interstate Commerce
Act major amendments ( 1903 , 1906 , 1910 )
Meat Inspection Act ( 1906 )
Pure Food and Drug Act ( 1906 )
Corporation Tax ( 1911 )
Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution ( 1913 ) ( Income Tax )
Federal Reserve System ( 1913 )
Clayton Antitrust Act ( 1914 )
Federal Trade Commission ( 1914 )
U.S. Immigration ( cut to a trickle during 1915 — 1920 )
Adamson Act ( 1916 ) ( railroad labor wage rates )
Shipping Act ( 1916 )
National Defense Act ( 1916 )
Army Appropriations Act ( 1916 ) ( later took over railroads )
Selective Service Act ( 1917 )
Espionage Act ( 1917 )
Lever Act ( 1917 ) ( food and fuel ) ( prohibited alcohol )
Overman Act ( 1918 ) ( executive powers )
War Finance Corporation Act ( 1918 )
President ’s Mediation Commission ( 1917 ) ( labor relations )
Federal Control Act ( 1918 )
Sedition Act ( 1918 )
Does this look like a laissez - faire list ?
Higgs summarizes just exactly how guided and regulated all economic activities were :
The two years , 1916 — 1918 , witnessed an enormous and wholly unprecedented intervention of the federal government in the nation ’s economic affairs .
By the time of the armistice , the government had taken over the ocean shipping , railroad , telephone , and telegraph industries ; commandeered hundreds of manufacturing plants ; entered into massive economic enterprises on its own account in such varied departments as shipbuilding , wheat trading , and building construction ; undertaken to lend huge sums to businesses directly or indirectly and to regulate the private issuance of securities ; established official priorities for the use of transportation facilities , food , fuel , and many raw materials ; fixed the prices of dozens of important commodities ; intervened in hundreds of labor disputes ; and conscripted millions of men for service in the armed forces .
It had , in short , extensively distorted or wholly displaced markets , creating what some contemporaries called war socialism .
Additionally , Higgs documented that ,
The public debt , which had been slightly more than $ 1 billion before the war , was over $ 25 billion at the end of the war and remained almost $ 17 billion as late as 1929 .
While their heads were bobbing , my head was shaking .
This all had to have been a joke .

RealAudio : " He thought I would wither ... " "
In 1933 , I traveled to Geneva for the fifteenth session of the League of Nations .
There , sitting in the hotel garden , was Dr. Joseph Goebbels , Hitler 's Minister of Propaganda ....
Sunddenly he spotted me and I snapped him .
Here are the eyes of hate .
Was I an enemy ?
Behind him is his private secretary and interpreter .
This picture was published many times throughout the world .
I have been asked how I felt photographing these men .
Naturally , not so good , but when I have a camera in my hand I know no fear . "

MOSCOW 
The Russian government has agreed to let American troops and weapons bound for Afghanistan fly over Russian territory , officials on both sides said Friday .
The arrangement will provide an important new corridor for the United States military as it escalates efforts to win the eight - year war .
The agreement , to be announced when President Obama visits here on Monday and Tuesday , represents one of the most concrete achievements in the administration ’s effort to ease relations with Russia after years of tension .
But the two sides failed to make a trade deal or resolve differences over missile defense , and are struggling to draft a preliminary nuclear arms deal .
The blend of success and stalemate leading to Mr. Obama ’s visit suggests that it is easier to talk about a “ reset ” button than to press it .
The promise of a new era of cooperation was always predicated on the tenuous notion that a change of tone and a shift in emphasis might be enough to bridge deep divisions .
But even with both sides eager for warmer ties , the issues that have torn Washington and Moscow apart did not go away with the transition at the White House .
Mr. Obama is less enthusiastic than President George W. Bush was about an antimissile system in Eastern Europe or NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia , but has not abandoned either goal , to the consternation of the Kremlin .
Despite American pressure , Moscow has not yielded in its confrontation with Georgia a year after their brief war .
Update : Joe Wilson releases new fundraising video .
Yesterday morning , Rob Miller was a relative unknown -- a Democrat lagging far behind Republican Rep. Joe Wilson in the 2010 congressional race .
Now , after Wilson shouted at President Barack Obama during an address on healthcare , Miller is watching his political fortunes soar .
" Rob Miller for Congress " is one of the most searched terms on the Internet .
The national Democratic leadership has singled out Miller for praise .
And Miller , a former Marine and Iraq war veteran , reportedly raised more than $ 200,000 from thousands of donors since Wilson 's outburst .
To recap : Last night , Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of congress .
At one point , he assured lawmakers that illegal immigrants would not be covered by the Democratic healthcare reform proposal .
That provoked Wilson to shout “ You lie ! ” Wilson has since apologized for the incident , and Obama has accepted his apology .
" I'm a big believer that we all make mistakes , " Obama said .
" [ Wilson ] apologized quickly and without equivocation and I 'm appreciative of that .
I do think , as I said last night , that we have to to get to the point where we can have a conversation about big issues that matter to the American people without vitriol , without name calling , with the assumption of the worst of other people 's motives . "
The Monitor 's Peter Grier has broken down the debate over whether or not illegal immigrants would receive coverage under Obama 's proposal .
Bottom line :
The language of all the Democratic reform bills does bar illegal immigrants from receiving subsidized health benefits .
But some Republicans insist that the bills do n't do enough to verify a recipient 's legal status .
It 's a charged issue , to say the least .
And according to The State , Wilson 's outburst has spurred on discussion among South Carolina voters :
Even some of the people who voted for the South Carolina congressman who heckled President Obama say they 're embarrassed by the normally mild - mannered congressman 's outburst .
Still , others in the conservative district that first sent Joe Wilson to Congress in 2001 praised the Republican on Thursday .
For his part , Rob Miller is seeking to to capitalize on his newly - found gains .
" Representative Wilson 's behavior tonight exemplifies everything that is wrong in Washington , " Miller said in a statement to CNN .
" Instead of engaging in childish name - calling and disrespecting our Commander - in - Chief , Joe Wilson should be working towards a bipartisan solution that makes quality , affordable health care available to each and every South Carolinian . "
Update : Joe Wilson releases new fundraising video .

Potomac River exercise sparks fear of DC attack
In the end , it turned out to be nothing more than a Coast Guard training exercise .
But for about an hour this morning , some outlets — including the cable news networks CNN and Fox News — aired reports of a possible unauthorized incursion into a prohibited zone on the Potomac River .
